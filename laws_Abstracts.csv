0,"This article explores how the economic impacts of violence can continue long after a relationship has ended and how the family law system is a generally unhelpful tool for financial recovery from abuse. Hurdles in the legal system such as the unavailability of legal aid and the absence of affordable legal representation, lack of legislative reforms in relation to property division in cases of violence, and difficulties in enforcing orders, compound experiences of violence and entrench poverty. Reforms to improve the family law property system for victims of violence are suggested.

1,"This article discusses the recent repeal of the death penalty in Papua New Guinea and examines some potential implications for considerations to decriminalise same-sex sexual activity and sex work in the country. It considers that, while the repeal of the death penalty was a significant milestone for human rights domestically and internationally, the dominance of Christian morals evident in propelling the repeal deepens the challenge for law reform on issues of moral bearing, most notably the decriminalisation of same-sex sexual activity and sex work. The article further analyses the political conditions to conclude that for those considering law reform, there may be better prospects through the Supreme Court by way of a constitutional validity challenge than through the Parliament.

2,"For more than half a century, Australian states and territories have criminalised the distinct offence of inciting another person to commit suicide. The maximum penalties for these offences vary and require the accused to have intended that the victim would commit suicide. In contrast, the offence of involuntary manslaughter does not require such an intention. Instead, a charge of manslaughter requires that the accused acted in a conscious and voluntary way that caused the victims death, and that their conduct was either criminally negligent or unlawful and dangerous. Drawing on cases from the United States and United Kingdom, this article suggests that in appropriate circumstances in Australia, especially in the context of family violence, offenders should be held criminally liable for manslaughter if they cause another person to commit suicide.

4,"The presumption of doli incapax is a legal safeguard for children who contravene the criminal law. Four distinct thresholds emerge from the application of doli incapax across the Australian jurisdictions: actual knowledge that the offending conduct was seriously wrong; actual knowledge that the offending conduct was wrong; capacity to know that the offending conduct should not occur; and capacity to know that the offending conduct was seriously wrong. This article explores differences in the four doli incapax thresholds and suggests a uniform approach to the presumption is required to correct the jurisdictional inconsistency.

5,"The decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in Benjamin v Kalio has been praised. However, the route taken by the Court to do justice and its implication have never been considered. This article examines the route through which the Supreme Court of Nigeria arrived at justice in this case. The article finds that the Supreme Court of Nigeria overruled its previous judgments by holding that unregistered land instruments could be tendered in evidence because section 20 of the Land Instruments (Preparation and Registration) Law of Rivers State is unconstitutional for not being within the legislative competence of States. The article argues that this is a simplistic route to justice having not taken cognisance of the Nigerian federalism and the concepts of existing and deemed laws with the probable consequence of rendering such laws on presumptions as section 30 of the Criminal Code and section 50 of the Penal Code null and void. The article concludes that this tends to constitute a pitfall.

6,"In considering the protection of fundamental rights in Hong Kong, the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap 383) (BORO) tend to be the dual focus. However, common law principles protective of fundamental rights continue to apply. These include principles of statutory interpretation such as the principle of legality (the presumption that general or ambiguous words in legislation are insufficient to interfere with certain common law rights) and the presumption that legislation is to be interpreted consistently with international treaties. This article considers the role of these common law interpretive principles in Hong Kong, and, in particular, the scope for their application in light of the Basic Law and the BORO. It concludes that the protection of fundamental rights in Hong Kong will continue to focus on the Basic Law and the BORO for so long as the current constitutional arrangements persist. However, the courts ought to take care to pay due regard to the relevant common law interpretive principles, including the stringency of the test of necessary implication where a statutory interference with rights is not express, and the potential for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to be relevant to statutory interpretation.

7,"The common law on vicarious liability is unsatisfactory because the doctrine is couched at such a high level of generality that it cannot yield predictable results when applied to a given fact situation. This paper is an attempt to inject some precision into the doctrine. It examines and rejects three justifications for the doctrine: effective compensation/risk spreading, deterrence and certain theories related to quid pro quo. It then proposes the most suitable justification for the doctrine: vicarious liability is imposed because and when the defendant, by placing the tortfeasor in the position in its organisation that it did with that position's accompanying privileges and demands, had created or significantly enhanced the risk of the claimants injury. Three implications follow from this justification: (1) there is no vicarious liability for the wrongful acts of independent contractors; (2) agency reasoning should be rejected; and (3) we should stop using the phrase enterprise-risk approach.
"
8,"This paper considers how three jurisdictions, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, have sought to reconcile freedom of religion with equality rights, particularly in the commercial context, and particularly in relation to sexual orientation. The recent decisions of the United Kingdom Supreme Court and United States Supreme Court form the backdrop for that discussion. It is argued that the former made piecemeal, and misleading, use of American case law, and a fuller consideration of that jurisdictions position was warranted, and would have led to a different view of the recent American decision. It argues that the United Kingdom Supreme Court was in error in viewing a message on a cake ordered from a baker as an example of the baker's expression, leading it to an incorrect conclusion at odds with statutory mandates in the commercial sphere around refusals of service. Both high court decisions risk undermining progress on the equality front.
"
9,"It is commonly understood that contract law and property law are different areas of law which address different issues. This article departs from this conventional position in a rather radical way by arguing that the conclusion, amendment, and termination of contracts are in fact property law transactions and that the strict divide between contract law and property law is therefore not justifiable. It demonstrates theoretical and practical implications as contract law must be redefined and aligned with the general property law framework to avoid inconsistencies and thus the violation of the notion of formal rationality.

10,"The difficulties in balancing judicial independence and accountability, the importance of formal processes around the investigation of judicial conduct, and the need for clarity on the respective roles of the branches of government under the separation of powers were all issues that were highlighted by the recent controversy surrounding the conduct of a Supreme Court Judge in Ireland. This article considers the detail of the controversy, in the context of the Irish system governing judicial discipline and removal, analyses certain problems underlined by the episode, and finally reflects on lessons that may be helpful for any jurisdiction grappling with the complex issues involving judicial discipline and removal.

11,"While it is true that the expanded use of health information and electronic health records (eHRs) can help deliver better healthcare, there remains the need to reconcile citizens legitimate concerns for privacy protection and confidentiality in the use of their personal health data, and the potential for violation of their privacy. Under the Hong Kongs Electronic Health Record Sharing System (eHRSS), the eHR of the individual patient can be accessed and shared between healthcare providers for healthcare-related purposes. Although the Electronic Health Record Sharing System Ordinance (Cap 625) (the eHRSSO) and the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap 486) (the PD(P)O) provide protection for personal data and patients privacy, the eHRSS has come under greater scrutiny given the rise in data breaches experienced globally and in Hong Kong. The articles objective is twofold. It first examines the eHRSS specifically with regard to some of the more pertinent provisions of the eHRSSO and the PD(P)O, to critically evaluate the extent to which these provisions ensure and protect patient privacy. Thence it offers suggestions and recommendations as to how protection for patient privacy can be enhanced and, indeed, altogether better ensured.

12,"Media is often termed as the fourth pillar of India; it is an indispensable part in keeping democracy alive and reaching out to the masses. The media plays an instrumental role in educating and delivering the truth to people. However, in recent times, the media has exceeded its role by bringing its lens into the courtrooms and setting up its own trials, parallelly. The transition from responsible reporting to investigating various high-profile cases or cases of infamous crimes has made the media trial a common practice. From aiming to grab the highest television rating points to trying to stay relevant in the changing times, the media has overstepped its own boundary. The unconscious transition in its role has not only interfered with the fair administration of justice but also pressurised the judiciary to act in a certain way. It has, also, hampered the fundamental and constitutional rights of both the accused and the victim of a crime. The courts have always, unfailingly, guarded the freedom of press, and they continue to do so. However, the judiciary sensed trouble in certain cases when the media began to deliver its own verdict before the evidence was verified or the guilt proved. It is here that the need to demarcate a line arose in order to ensure the media remains well within its job of fair reporting. In an attempt to contain this adverse effect of the media, the legislature and the judiciary have attempted to frame rules and guidelines to that effect. This article attempts to discuss the various facets of media trials and the laws pertaining to them.

13,"The meteoric rise of the digital platforms and their increasing dominance can be easily considered the highlight of the latter half of the previous decade. Even though antitrust laws do apply to such online markets, the determination of the competitive strength of in these digital markets was often determined by the quantum of data accumulated by the entities. The article is an attempt by the authors to evaluate the feasibility of applicability of the existing competition law framework to the growing platform economies and the resultant implications of personal data being collected by such entities. For this research, the authors have outlined three specific questions. First, what is the inter-relation between the growing platform economy and merger control regime of a country? Second, what are the possible avenues of concerns that may arise due to collection of personal data? Finally, what are the possible enforcement challenges that would hamper the applicability of existing competition regimes to the digital platforms? The research is doctrinal research, and the authors have adopted a comparative-analytical research methodology for evaluating the above-mentioned research questions. The authors have considered the jurisdictions of the EU and India as the geographical scope for the research. The authors consider the following upon the conclusion of the study. First, the use and access of this data after the merger with companies with low turnover confer the acquiring enterprise a market power by which it can have an edge over its competitors in the market which will ultimately harm the competition in the market. Second, the digital market is data-driven; hence, collection of copious amounts of data places the big-tech players in a position of control, allowing them to indulge in exclusionary and exploitative conduct. Third, the assessment basis of combinations, more specifically in cases of data-based entities within the competition law, needs a serious re-assessment to include data within the scope of assessment as it is the primary asset in such cases.

14,"This case note reports on the judgment of the Court of Justice in case C-673/20 EP. The decision clarified that British nationals lost their EU citizenship status following the UK's withdrawal from the Union. After giving an overview of the facts of the case and summarizing the opinion of AG Collins and the Court's reasoning, this contribution critically engages with the judgment and reflects on its place in the Court's jurisprudence on Union citizenship.

15,"The principle that in all actions relating to children () the child's best interests must be a primary consideration (Article 24(2) EU Charter of Fundamental Rights) is widely applied by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). This article considers preliminary rulings in which the CJEU had recourse to the best interests of the child as the criterion for settling the dispute in the main proceeding. For analytical purposes, these cases may be grouped in two clusters: cases resembling child custody disputes, and other cases. It is argued that, in the light of the varied factual circumstances of the judicial disputes, the application of the criterion of best interests of the child as primary consideration warrants further scrutiny. To this end, this article identifies and assesses a practical and a conceptual challenge to the widespread application of the criterion. The former posits that the criterion is indeterminate, and this article considers whether drawing from Article 3 of the Convention on the Right of the Child may help in solving the uncertainty; the latter maintains that the test is unjust and self-defying, a critique that this article finds only partially founded, for cases resembling child custody disputes.
"
16,"Temporariness of refugee protection has started to emerge as a new standard in the policies of European countries. Given this development, the article focuses on one specific issue related to this temporariness: how refugee status intertwines with the conditions for the granting, revocation and prolongation of national residence permits. What are the interconnections between refugee status, including its cessation and revocation, on the one hand, and national residence permits and their revocation and prolongation, on the other? How are these interconnections regulated by international law, EU law and national law (with Sweden as an example)? Inaddition to the detailed analysis of the relevant legal norms, the article situates the questions within a more general discussion about residence in the national community. In this way, it is shown how temporariness creates tensions at national level where the refugee qua resident in the national community, benefits from safeguards in favour of individual certainty. This explains why residence permits, as opposed to refugee status, have central organizing role at national level.

17,"Based on the guidelines issued by the European Securities and Market Authority and by the European Banking Authority, the article deals with the legal qualification of blockchain-based crypto-assets under EU law. Focusing on crypto-assets that function as a) investment instruments (that is, investment tokens) and as b) electronic money (that is, payment tokens), the work outlines shortages and drawbacks in the applicability and enforcement of existing EU legal frameworks regulating investment activities and payment services. With such analysis, the article seeks to inform the ongoing debate within European institutions on the need of regulatory intervention in this area, and it points out pressing questions to be tackled by further research.

18,"This article examines, within Chinas complex healthcare sector, the extent to which Chinas legal frameworks can adapt to a data-driven context that requires the reconciliation of public and private interests for the use of health data. Current data-processing mechanisms operate through individual consent, and administrative authorisation in mobile health settings are insufficient and ineffective to meet societal needs while simultaneously protecting individuals interests. In light of this shift of regulation from individual control to collective governance, this article argues that the principle of the right to health may complement this collective governance model. The right to health principle emphasises solidarity, justice, confidentiality, and collective responsibility, which may balance power asymmetries in the use of health data among different stakeholders. The article proposes a solution that incorporates the states obligation with private actors responsibilities, while stressing the importance of data sharing and the fair use of health data.

19,"In 2018, Australian paramedics entered the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for Health Practitioners. The scheme represented a significant change in the way paramedics were regulated and able to self-identify. Equally, it brought substantial changes to the individual accountability and responsibilities of practitioners. Response to these reforms was largely positive; however, diverse views existed on the intent and impacts of the scheme. Paramedics were surveyed immediately before registration commencement to examine their views concerning the new regulatory framework. Supportive views included acknowledgement of regulations public safety function and potential advancement of the profession. Dissenting views predicted increased practitioner risk and degradation of working conditions. Importantly, this study explores how members of the same profession can have diverse views of the same regulatory scheme. This study supports the notion that paramedicine consists of diverse subcultures with differing worldviews. This presents challenges in ensuring cohesive professional engagement with regulation and the evolution of the profession.

20,"This article assesses the regulatory framework relating to over-the-counter (OTC) sales of antibiotics for human use in India. The OTC sale of antibiotics is recognised as a pathway for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR); a serious public health challenge in need of urgent regulatory responses. Analytically, this article identifies opportunities within existing laws in India and highlights gaps that need to be filled by modifying existing laws or developing new ones. Conceptually, it suggests a need to reflect on the limits of traditional, top-down, command-and control regulation and to think about alternative approaches. The article therefore advocates for an approach to regulation that incorporates two elements. First, it argues for a broader concept of regulation that encompasses binding as well as non-binding regulatory instruments and initiatives aimed at influencing stakeholder behaviour (including soft regulation, economic incentives, information campaigns and uses of technology). Second, it makes the case for enhanced stakeholder participation in regulatory design. The article will be relevant for health policy and drug regulators in India and other low- and middle-income countries, as well as legal scholars, social scientists and others interested in the regulation of OTC sales of antibiotics for AMR containment.

21,"COVID-19 has significantly impacted all aspects of maternity services in the United Kingdom, exacerbating the fact that choice is insufficiently centred within the maternity regime. In this article, we focus on the restrictions placed on homebirthing services by some National Health Service Trusts in response to the virus. In March 2020, around a third of Trusts implemented blanket policies suspending their entire homebirth service. We argue that the failure to protect choice about place of birth during the pandemic may not only be harmful to birthing peoples physical and mental health, but also that it is legally problematic as it may, in some instances, breach human rights obligations. We also voice concerns about the possibility that in the absence of available homebirthing services people might choose to freebirth. While freebirthing (birthing absent any medical or midwifery support) is not innately problematic, it is concerning that people may feel forced to opt for this.

22,"The modern, global food system is unsustainable for both human and planetary health. The widespread consumption of highly processed foods and use of production systems that negatively affect the environment have led to a rise in nutrition-related diseases and exacerbated the effects of climate change. A comprehensive reform of global food systems and diets is needed to effectively respond to this problem, but the interference of food industry actors in health negotiations is diluting health policies at both domestic and international levels. This article establishes the concrete value of international legal responses grounded in human rights for tackling the global syndemic of climate change and malnutrition. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) exemplifies how normative conflicts between the trade and health regimes can be overcome. Forming an effective and egalitarian response to malnutrition and climate change will require a rights-based, regime interaction approach that prioritizes human and planetary health over private interests.
"
23,"Noting that 2022 marked the 45th anniversary of the Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions  the first treaties that explicitly noted the relationship between international human rights law and international humanitarian law - this column reflects on how the relationship between these two bodies of law has developed since 1977. It demonstrates that while much progress has been made internationally towards understanding the relationship between two bodies of law, there are still obstacles to be overcome if the goal is to apply the two bodies of law in a complementary fashion and achieve the maximum protection of the human person.

24,"Black Lives Matter is having a profound impact on how individuals and communities view their repressive histories and their present environments. The movement has greatly influenced the questioning of everyday landscapes and the role of official memory in the erection, maintenance, or removal of monuments and memorials. In this column, I shed light on these phenomena, and highlight the tensions that exist between the acknowledgement and removal of racist or problematic memorials and statues and the protection of historical monuments and cultural heritage more generally. A human rights approach to memorialization would be a step in the right direction, while recognizing that the imperatives of the present shape memorialization efforts. It calls on those in the human rights field to continue pressing for critical reflection and debate around racism and memory landscapes, and to call out and expose racism in all of its forms in order to bring about social change.

25,"On 14 June 2018, Russias national football team will play against Saudi Arabia for the opening match of this years football World Cup held in Russia. In the subsequent month, more than 3 billion people are expected to follow this mega-sporting event (MSE) on television.1 What the people behind their screens will see are state-of-the-art stadiums with the newest technology, each costing hundreds of millions of dollars.2 What most of the viewers are not aware of, however, is that during the building of these stadiums tens of thousands of workers were exposed to severe human rights violations.3 Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other human rights groups documented the structural exploitation of workers, including non-payment or severe delays in payment of wages, working in unsafe conditions leading to injuries, and the death of 17 workers, as well as forced illegal work due to lack of employment contracts and other documentation.4 Lack of proof of any employment relation made it extremely difficult for workers to complain about these exploitative practices. If workers managed to file a complaint, they were threatened by their employers with retaliation and non-payment of wages.5 Journalists and human rights advocates who tried to investigate and report on these conditions have been working under constant suspicion and intimidation. Journalists have been arrested during their investigations, held in detention and faced with criminal charges.6
