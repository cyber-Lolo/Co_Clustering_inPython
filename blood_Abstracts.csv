0,"IMPORTANCE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood 
cancer. Hepatotoxic effects, including hyperbilirubinemia and elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, are common 
during all phases of therapy and are linked to several chemotherapeutic agents, 
including asparaginase, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate.
OBJECTIVE: To determine which genetic variants were associated with 
hyperbilirubinemia and elevated ALT and AST levels in children, adolescents, and 
young adults treated for ALL.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective analysis of a multiethnic 
genome-wide association study was conducted between January 1, 2019, and April 
15, 2022, including patients treated as part of Children's Oncology Group (COG) 
trials with centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia, which accrued 
data from December 29, 2003, to January 21, 2011 (AALL0232), and from January 
22, 2007, to July 24, 2014 (AALL0434). Germline genotypes were interrogated 
using genome-wide arrays and imputed using a National Institutes of Health 
TOPMed Imputation server. Mixed-effects logistic regressions were used to 
account for multiple episodes for an individual patient. Genotype × treatment 
phase interaction was tested to uncover phase-specific genetic risk factors.
EXPOSURES: Total duration of multiagent protocol chemotherapy ranging from 2.5 
to 3.5 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4) hyperbilirubinemia of 
grade 3 or higher and elevated liver ALT and AST levels.
RESULTS: A total of 3557 participants were included in the analysis (2179 
[61.3%] male; median age, 11.1 [range, 1-30] years). Among 576 known variants 
associated with these liver function test results in the general population, 
UGT1A1 variant rs887829 and PNPLA3 variant rs738409 were associated with 
increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia (odds ratio [OR], 2.18 [95% CI, 1.89-2.53]; 
P = 6.7 × 10-27) and ALT and AST levels (OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.15-1.40]; P = 3.7 × 
10-7), respectively, during treatment for ALL. Corresponding polygenic risk 
scores were associated with hepatotoxic effects across all therapy phases and 
were largely driven by UGT1A1 and PNPLA3 variants. Genome-wide association 
analysis revealed an age-specific variant near the CPT1A gene that was only 
associated with elevated ALT and AST levels among patients younger than 10 years 
(OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.18-1.39]; P = 8.7 × 10-10).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest a strong genetic basis for 
interpatient variability in hyperbilirubinemia and aminotransferase level 
elevations during leukemia chemotherapy."
1,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of vitamin D (Vit D) supplementation on systemic 
biomarkers of collagen degradation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and copper 
metabolism in adolescent patients with keratoconus (KC).
METHODS: This was a prospective observational pilot study. Twenty patients (age 
range, 16-19 years) presenting KC and Vit D insufficiency (<30 ng/mL) were 
included. Vit D supplementation was prescribed by their general practitioner as 
per the standard of care. Patients were followed up for 12 months. At each 
visit, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), maximal keratometry 
(Kmax), and thinnest corneal thickness (TCT) were evaluated. The primary outcome 
of the study was the proportion of patients with Kmax progression of less than 1 
D throughout the 12-month follow-up time. Blood samples were collected at 
different time points to evaluate Vit D levels and systemic markers of collagen 
degradation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and copper metabolism by ELISA or 
RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Lower Vit D levels in the plasma were correlated with higher levels of 
systemic biomarkers of collagen degradation. Vit D supplementation increased the 
cell availability of copper. Moreover, stabilization of KC progression was found 
in 60% of patients (72% of eyes) after 12 months with Vit D supplementation. 
BSCVA, Kmax, and TCT rates remained stable during the observation period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that Vit D administration could affect ocular 
and systemic biomarkers in KC and illuminate a possible mechanism that can be 
used to develop new treatment alternatives.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Although KC therapy currently relies exclusively on 
surgical procedures, Vit D supplementation may offer a non-invasive and 
inexpensive alternative with minimal associated side effects."
2,"IMPORTANCE: Patients with cancer are known to have increased risk of COVID-19 
complications, including death.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of COVID-19 vaccination with 
breakthrough infections and complications in patients with cancer compared to 
noncancer controls.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective population-based cohort study 
using linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, in residents 18 years 
and older who received COVID-19 vaccination. Three matched groups were 
identified (based on age, sex, type of vaccine, date of vaccine): 1:4 match for 
patients with hematologic and solid cancer to noncancer controls (hematologic 
and solid cancers separately analyzed), 1:1 match between patients with 
hematologic and patients with solid cancer.
EXPOSURES: Cancer diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes occurring 14 days after receipt of second 
COVID-19 vaccination dose: primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough 
infection; secondary outcomes were emergency department visit, hospitalization, 
and death within 4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection (end of follow-up March 31, 
2022). Multivariable cumulative incidence function models were used to obtain 
adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% CIs.
RESULTS: A total of 289 400 vaccinated patients with cancer (39 880 hematologic; 
249 520 solid) with 1 157 600 matched noncancer controls were identified; the 
cohort was 65.4% female, and mean (SD) age was 66 (14.0) years. SARS-CoV-2 
breakthrough infection was higher in patients with hematologic cancer (aHR, 
1.33; 95% CI, 1.20-1.46; P < .001) but not in patients with solid cancer (aHR, 
1.00; 95% CI, 0.96-1.05; P = .87). COVID-19 severe outcomes (composite of 
hospitalization and death) were significantly higher in patients with cancer 
compared to patients without cancer (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.42-1.63; P < .001). 
Risk of severe outcomes was higher among patients with hematologic cancer (aHR, 
2.51; 95% CI, 2.21-2.85; P < .001) than patients with solid cancer (aHR, 1.43; 
95% CI, 1.24-1.64; P < .001). Patients receiving active treatment had a further 
heightened risk for COVID-19 severe outcomes, particularly those who received 
anti-CD20 therapy. Third vaccination dose was associated with lower infection 
and COVID-19 complications, except for patients receiving anti-CD20 therapy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large population-based cohort study, patients 
with cancer had greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse outcomes than 
patients without cancer, and the risk was highest for patients with hematologic 
cancer and any patients with cancer receiving active treatment. Triple 
vaccination was associated with lower risk of poor outcomes."
3,"IMPORTANCE: Single-arm trials have allowed for transformative therapies to be 
made available to patients expeditiously. However, using single-arm trials to 
support drug approval presents several challenges that must be carefully 
considered.
OBSERVATIONS: Between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2021, the US Food and 
Drug Administration granted 176 new malignant hematology and oncology 
indications based on single-arm trials, including 116 accelerated approvals 
(AAs) and 60 traditional approvals. Overall, 87 approvals (49%) were for new 
molecular entities or original biologics and 89 (51%) were supplemental 
indications. Response rate (RR) was the most common end point used to support 
approval in these single-arm trials (173 of 176 [98%]). Of the 116 AAs based on 
single-arm trials, 45 (38%) fulfilled their postmarketing requirement to verify 
clinical benefit, 61 (52%) are pending verification of benefit, and 10 (9%) were 
withdrawn from the market as of December 31, 2021. Most (56 of 61 [92%]) AAs 
based on single-arm trials pending verification of benefit occurred during the 
previous 5 years and have ongoing confirmatory trials as of December 2021.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Single-arm trials have been a common development 
strategy to support regulatory approval as early-stage expansion cohorts with 
promising durable RRs have become more prevalent. In the appropriate context, 
single-arm trials using durable RRs can allow patients expedited access to novel 
therapies and will continue to serve a role in advancing drug development in 
oncology. However, single-arm trials have a smaller noncomparative safety data 
set, inability to use time-to-event end points, and other limitations that 
require careful consideration within the context of the disease and available 
therapies. The randomized clinical trial remains the preferred approach in 
clinical investigation."
4,"IMPORTANCE: With a prevalence between 0.2% and 6.1% of all live births, 
congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is a major cause of congenital 
nonhereditary sensorineural hearing loss. Despite the large amount of research 
on cCMV-related hearing loss, it is still unclear which newborns are at risk of 
hearing loss.
OBJECTIVE: To identify independent risk factors for cCMV-related congenital 
hearing loss and predictors of hearing loss severity at birth.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study of newborns with 
cCMV infection used data included in the Flemish CMV registry that was collected 
from 6 secondary and tertiary hospitals in Flanders, Belgium, over 15 years 
(January 1, 2007, to February 7, 2022). Data were analyzed March 3 to October 
19, 2022. Patients were included in the study after confirmed diagnosis of cCMV 
infection and known hearing status at birth. Patients who presented with other 
possible causes of sensorineural hearing loss were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was hearing status at birth. 
Clinical, neurological, and laboratory findings along with the timing of 
seroconversion and blood viral load were separately considered as risk factors. 
Binary logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors 
for congenital hearing loss in newborns with cCMV. Effect sizes were measured 
using Hedges g, odds ratio, or Cramer V.
RESULTS: Of the 1033 newborns included in the study (553 of 1024 [54.0%] boys), 
416 (40.3%) were diagnosed with symptomatic cCMV infection and 617 (59.7%) with 
asymptomatic cCMV infection. A total of 15.4% of the patients (n = 159) 
presented with congenital hearing loss; half of them (n = 80 [50.3%]) had 
isolated hearing loss. The regression model revealed 3 independent risk factors 
for congenital hearing loss: petechiae at birth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.7; 
95% CI, 1.9-23.9), periventricular cysts on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 
aOR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-14.1), and seroconversion in the first trimester (aOR, 
3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-9.3). Lower viral loads were seen in patients with normal 
hearing compared with those with congenital hearing loss (median [IQR] viral 
load, 447.0 [39.3-2345.8] copies per milliliter of sample [copies/mL] vs 1349.5 
[234.3-14 393.0] copies/mL; median difference, -397.0 [95% CI, -5058.0 to 174.0] 
copies/mL).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that 
newborns with cCMV infection and petechiae at birth, periventricular cysts on 
MRI, or a seroconversion in the first trimester had a higher risk of congenital 
hearing loss. Clinicians may use these risk factors to counsel parents in the 
prenatal and postnatal periods about the risk of congenital hearing loss. 
Moreover, linking clinical features to hearing loss may provide new insights 
into the pathogenesis of cCMV-related hearing loss. The importance of viral load 
as a risk factor for congenital hearing loss remains unclear."

rash and swelling of the left side of the chest wall. What is your diagnosis?"
6,"IMPORTANCE: Molecular testing in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is commonly 
limited by inadequate tumor sample. Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) genotyping as a 
complementary test is specific but only moderately sensitive. Genotyping of 
cfDNA in pleural and pericardial effusion (PE-cfDNA) can further optimize 
molecular diagnostic yield and reduce the need for repeated biopsies.
OBJECTIVE: To prospectively validate droplet digital polymerase chain reaction 
(ddPCR) for detection of sensitizing EGFR variants and acquired Thr790Met 
variant (T790M) from PE-cfDNA in patients with NSCLC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective diagnostic validation study 
was conducted between September 6, 2016, and January 21, 2021 at 2 major Hong 
Kong cancer centers. Patients with advanced NSCLC with both wild-type and 
variant EGFR status and exudative PE who underwent thoracocentesis or 
pericardiocentesis were randomly enrolled. Patients were either EGFR-tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive (cohort 1) or EGFR-TKI treated but osimertinib 
naive (cohort 2). Enrolled patients underwent pleural- or pericardial-fluid and 
blood sampling for ddPCR EGFR testing. EGFR status results with ddPCR testing of 
PE-cfDNA and blood were compared with EGFR status in matched tumor biopsy or PE 
cell block samples.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Specificity, sensitivity, and concordance of 
PE-cfDNA for detection of sensitizing EGFR variants and acquired T790M 
variation.
RESULTS: Among 171 patients (54% female) enrolled, there were 104 in cohort 1 
and 67 in cohort 2. In cohort 1, 37% (38/102) were EGFR-variant positive; 
PE-cfDNA showed 97% sensitivity (95% CI, 92%-100%), 97% specificity (95% CI, 
93%-100%), and 97% concordance (ĸ = 0.94, P < .001) for the detection of 
sensitizing EGFR variants. It was more sensitive than plasma in detecting 
sensitizing EGFR variants (97% vs 74%, P < .001). In cohort 2, 38% (15 of 40) 
were positive for the EGFR T790M variant; PE-cfDNA showed 87% sensitivity (95% 
CI, 69%-100%), 60% specificity (95% CI, 41%-79%), and 70% concordance (ĸ = 0.42, 
P = .004) for acquired T790M. The EGFR T790M variant was detected in 51% of 
PE-cfDNA vs 25% of PE cell block samples.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this diagnostic study, EGFR variants could be 
accurately detected from PE-cfDNA in patients with NSCLC. More EGFR T790M was 
detected in PE-cfDNA than in guideline-recommended PE cell block preparations. 
These results suggest that PE-cfDNA can complement plasma and tumor genotyping 
for detecting EGFR variants in patients with advanced NSCLC."
7,"Early-life arsenic (As) exposure is a particular health concern. However, it is 
unknown if As ingested early in life is more readily absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, i.e., higher in oral bioavailability. Here, 
weanling (3-week) and adult (6-week-old) female mice were exposed to arsenate in 
the diet (10 μg g-1) over a 3-week period with As oral bioavailability estimated 
using As urinary excretion as the bioavailability endpoint. The As urinary 
excretion factor was 1.54-fold higher in weanling mice compared to adult mice 
(82.2 ± 7.29 versus 53.1 ± 3.73%), while weanling mice also showed 2.28-, 1.50-, 
1.48-, and 1.89-fold higher As concentration in small intestine tissue, blood, 
liver, and kidneys, demonstrating significantly higher As oral bioavailability 
of early-life exposure. Compared to adult mice, weanling mice significantly 
differed in gut microbiota, but the difference did not lead to remarkable 
differences in As biotransformation in the GI tract or tissue and in overall gut 
metabolite composition. Although the expression of several metabolites (e.g., 
atrolactic acid, hydroxyphenyllactic acid, and xanthine) was up-regulated in 
weanling mice, they had limited ability to elevate As solubility in the 
intestinal tract. Compared to adult mice, the intestinal barrier function and 
intestinal expression of phosphate transporters responsible for arsenate 
absorption were similar in weanling mice. However, the small intestine of 
weanling mice was characterized by more defined intestinal villi with greater 
length and smaller width, providing a greater surface area for As to be absorbed 
across the GI barrier. The results highlight that early-life As exposure can be 
more readily absorbed, advancing the understanding of its health risk."
8,"Piezo ion channel is a mechanosensitive protein on the cell membrane, which 
contains Piezo1 and Piezo2. Piezo channels are activated by mechanical forces, 
including stretch, matrix stiffness, static pressure, and shear stress. Piezo 
channels transmit mechanical signals that cause different downstream responses 
in the differentiation process, including integrin signaling pathway, ERK1/2 
MAPK signaling pathway, Notch signaling, and WNT signaling pathway. In the fate 
of stem cell differentiation, scientists found differences in Piezo channel 
expression and found that Piezo channel expression is related to developmental 
diseases. Here, we briefly review the structure and function of Piezo channels 
and the relationship between Piezo and mechanical signals, discussing the 
current understanding of the role of Piezo channels in stem cell fate and 
associated molecules and developmental diseases. Ultimately, we believe this 
review will help identify the association between Piezo channels and stem cell 
fate."
9,"As alternative blood supply routes, collateral blood vessels can play a crucial 
role in determining patient outcomes in acute and chronic intracranial occlusive 
diseases. Studies have shown that increased collateral circulation can improve 
functional outcomes and reduce mortality, particularly in those who are not 
eligible for reperfusion therapy. This article aims to discuss the anatomy and 
physiology of collateral circulation, describe current imaging tools used to 
measure collateral circulation, and identify the factors that influence 
collateral status."
10,"Environmental pollution and changing climatic conditions are likely to damage 
biodiversity not only on organismal level but on molecular level as well. The 
aim of the present study was to find the concentration of heavy metals in soil, 
water, feed, feathers, and blood and association of heavy metals with DNA damage 
of P. cristatus. The results showed that lead (Pb) was significantly (P < 0.01) 
higher in soil and cadmium (Cd) was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in soil and 
water. Chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co) were significant 
(P < 0.01) in feed. Manganese (Mn) was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in feed 
and soil (surface). In addition, Pb and Cd concentrations were significant 
(P < 0.01) in feathers while Cr and Zn concentrations were significantly 
(P < 0.01) higher in feces. Nickel was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in 
feathers and eggshell while Mn and Co concentrations were significantly 
(P < 0.01) higher in blood and feces, respectively. Furthermore, significant 
positive correlation between Pb (rs = 0.75; P < 0.05) and Cd (rs = 0.67; 
P < 0.05) concentrations in blood with tail DNA was found. It was concluded that 
heavy metals exist in the soil, water, feathers, and blood and have association 
with DNA damage of P. cristatus."
11,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of cancer with limited 
treatment options and terrible long-term survival, and it is expected to become 
the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. One reason why this 
cancer is so aggressive and resistant is the formation of dense stroma that 
surrounds the neoplastic epithelium, which promotes tumor progression, invasion, 
metastasis, and resistance. The three major components of PDAC stroma are 
extracellular matrix (ECM), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and 
vasculature. The dense ECM acts as a natural physical barrier, impeding drug 
penetration to PDAC tumor cells. Consequently, the method that combines 
stroma-targeting with anticancer therapy may be a viable alternative for 
increasing drug penetration. Additionally, blood vessels are key entities of the 
tumor stroma, serving as a pathway for nutrition as well as the only way for 
chemical medicines and immune cells to act. Finally, PDAC CAFs and tumor cells 
have crosstalk effects in the tumor microenvironment, where they are responsible 
for enhanced matrix deposition. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of 
our current comprehension of the three key components of PDAC stroma and the new 
promising therapeutic targets for PDAC."
12,"PURPOSE: Ureaplasma species are associated with urogenital infections, 
infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as neonatal infections. 
Involvement of the central nervous system in adults is extremely rare. We report 
an unusual case of a brain abscess secondary to otitis media with Ureaplasma 
parvum in a patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA).
METHODS: Imaging and laboratory findings, treatment decisions, and outcome of 
this case are explicated.
RESULTS: A young adult with GPA presented with progredient earache after 
ambulant diagnosis of otitis media. Despite different courses of broad-spectrum 
antibiotic therapy, she developed meningoencephalitis due to mastoiditis 
following temporal abscess formation. Mastoidectomy and neurosurgical abscess 
removal were performed. Standard cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood and 
intracranial abscess material, as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 
common bacterial and viral meningitis pathogens remained negative. Only 
eubacterial PCR of intracranial abscess material returned positive for 
Ureaplasma parvum. The patient finally improved under antibiotic therapy with 
moxifloxacin and doxycycline.
CONCLUSION: Ureaplasma species are rare causative pathogens in immunocompromised 
patients. They should be considered in patients with humoral immunodeficiencies 
with culture-negative infections failing standard therapy. Eubacterial PCR 
should be performed in early states of infection in these patients for immediate 
diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment to prevent adverse outcomes."
13,"Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the most dangerous complications of pregnancy, 
characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and symptoms of multiple organ 
failure, which are detected de novo after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is one of the first to recognize 
pregnancy and is an important regulator of blood pressure. The placenta has its 
own RAAS, the role of which in the development of PE is not fully understood. In 
this work, for the first time, we characterized the expression of RAAS 
components and miRNAs controlling it in the placenta at various times of PE 
manifestation. The data obtained will allow the development of a new strategy in 
the future for the search for therapeutic agents for patients suffering from PE 
and cardiovascular diseases."
14,"To investigate the relationship between the correlation ratios of selenium (Se) 
and other elements and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among older adults. A 
total of 1000 individuals participated in our research analysis. The 
concentrations of elements in whole blood were determined using inductively 
coupled plasma mass spectrometry to reflect their exposure levels. Participants' 
cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. 
Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between 
elemental ratios and MCI. Se concentration was positively correlated with red 
blood cell count (r = 0.219, p < 0.001), haemoglobin level (r = 0.355, 
p < 0.001), haematocrit (r = 0.215, p < 0.001), mean corpuscular haemoglobin 
(r = 0.294, p < 0.001) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration 
(r = 0.428, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with red cell volume 
distribution width-standard deviation (r = -0.232, p < 0.001) and platelet 
distribution width (r = -0.382, p < 0.001). Compared with the normal group, the 
ratios of Se/vanadium (V), Se/lead (Pb) and Se/cadmium (Cd) in the whole blood 
of the MCI group were significantly lower (all p < 0.001), while the ratios of 
manganese (Mn)/Se and iron (Fe)/Se were higher (all p < 0.001). The increase in 
the ratios of Se/V, Se/Pb and Se/Cd is related to a decreased risk of MCI among 
older adults; contrarily, an increase in the ratios of Mn/Se and Fe/Se may be a 
risk factor for MCI."
15,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) has been used to detect rare causative variants in 
neurological diseases. However, the efficacy of WES in genetic diagnosis of 
clinically heterogeneous familial stroke remains inconclusive. We prospectively 
searched for disease-causing variants in unrelated probands with defined 
familial stroke by candidate gene/hotspot screening and/or WES, depending on 
stroke subtypes and neuroimaging features at a referral center. The clinical 
significance of each variant was determined according to the American College of 
Medical Genetics guidelines. Among 161 probands (mean age at onset 53.2 ± 13.7 
years; male 63.4%), 33 participants (20.5%) had been identified with 19 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (PVs; WES applied 152/161 = 94.4%). Across 
subtypes, the highest hit rate (HR) was intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH, 
7/18 = 38.9%), particularly with the etiological subtype of structural 
vasculopathy (4/4 = 100%, PVs in ENG, KRIT1, PKD1, RNF213); followed by ischemic 
small vessel disease (SVD, 15/48 = 31.3%; PVs in NOTCH3, HTRA1, HBB). In 
contrast, large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 4/44 = 9.1%) and cardioembolism 
(0/11 = 0%) had the lowest HR. NOTCH3 was the most common causative gene 
(16/161 = 9.9%), presenting with multiple subtypes of SVD (n = 13), ICH (n = 2), 
or LAA (n = 1). Importantly, we disclosed two previously unreported PVs, KRIT1 
p.E379* in a familial cerebral cavernous malformation, and F2 p.F382L in a 
familial cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The contribution of monogenic 
etiologies was particularly high in familial ICH and SVD subtypes in our 
Taiwanese cohort. Utilizing subtype-guided hotspot screening and/or subsequent 
WES, we unraveled monogenic causes in 20.5% familial stroke probands, including 
1.2% novel PVs. Genetic diagnosis may enable early diagnosis, management and 
lifestyle modification. Among 161 familial stroke probands, 33 (20.5%) had been 
identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic monogenic variants related to stroke. 
The positive hit rate among all subtypes was high in intracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH) and ischemic small vessel disease (SVD). Notably, two previously 
unreported variants, KRIT1 p.E379* in a familial cerebral cavernous malformation 
and F2 p.F382L in familial cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, were disclosed. CVT

16,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The omega-3 fatty acids (n3-FAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have recently undergone testing for their 
ability to reduce residual cardiovascular (CV) risk among statin-treated 
subjects. The outcome trials have yielded highly inconsistent results, perhaps 
attributable to variations in dosage, formulation, and composition. In 
particular, CV trials using icosapent ethyl (IPE), a highly purified ethyl ester 
of EPA, reproducibly reduced CV events and progression of atherosclerosis 
compared with mixed EPA/DHA treatments. This review summarizes the mechanistic 
evidence for differences among n3-FAs on the development and manifestations of 
atherothrombotic disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Large randomized clinical trials with n3-FAs have produced 
discordant outcomes despite similar patient profiles, doses, and triglyceride 
(TG)-lowering effects. A large, randomized trial with IPE, a prescription EPA 
only formulation, showed robust reduction in CV events in statin treated 
patients in a manner proportional to achieved blood EPA concentrations. Multiple 
trials using mixed EPA/DHA formulations have not shown such benefits, despite 
similar TG lowering. These inconsistencies have inspired investigations into 
mechanistic differences among n3-FAs, as EPA and DHA have distinct membrane 
interactions, metabolic products, effects on cholesterol efflux, antioxidant 
properties, and tissue distribution. EPA maintains normal membrane cholesterol 
distribution, enhances endothelial function, and in combination with statins 
improves features implicated in plaque stability and reduces lipid content of 
plaques. Insights into reductions in residual CV risk have emerged from clinical 
trials using different formulations of n3-FAs. Among high-risk patients on 
contemporary care, mixed n3-FA formulations showed no reduction in CV events. 
The distinct benefits of IPE in multiple trials may arise from pleiotropic 
actions that correlate with on-treatment EPA levels beyond TG-lowering. These 
effects include altered platelet function, inflammation, cholesterol 
distribution, and endothelial dysfunction. Elucidating such mechanisms of 
vascular protection for EPA may lead to new interventions for atherosclerosis, a 
disease that continues to expand worldwide."
17,"BACKGROUND: Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) is a rare locally aggressive 
vascular neoplasm that occurs mainly in the pediatric population. KHE usually 
originates just underneath the skin and affects deeper tissues through 
infiltrative growth; however, visceral tissue involvement is quite rare.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-month-old girl with jaundice and acholic stool was 
referred to our hospital for further evaluation of a hepatoduodenal ligament 
tumor. A blood examination revealed high bilirubin and liver enzyme levels, but 
no signs of coagulopathy. The first attempt at a diagnostic surgical procedure 
did not provide sufficient diagnostic information. However, the 
histopathological diagnosis of the cystic duct excised in the second surgery 
indicated KHE. Therefore, in our case, KHE was considered a cause of obstructive 
jaundice. Sirolimus (rapamycin) was initiated, and the patient was discharged 
7 months after admission.
CONCLUSIONS: In cases of atypical hypervascular lesions in the abdominal cavity, 
especially in the pediatric population, it is important to consider the 
possibility of KHE, and surgical intervention with proper strategies is required 
for diagnosis, followed sequentially by promising treatments."
18,"Many modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors have been associated with 
hypertension. However, current screening programs are still failing in 
identifying individuals at higher risk of hypertension. Given the major impact 
of high blood pressure on cardiovascular events and mortality, there is an 
urgent need to find new strategies to improve hypertension detection. We aimed 
to explore whether a machine learning (ML) algorithm can help identifying 
individuals predictors of hypertension. We analysed the data set generated by 
the questionnaires administered during the World Hypertension Day from 2015 to 
2019. A total of 20206 individuals have been included for analysis. We tested 
five ML algorithms, exploiting different balancing techniques. Moreover, we 
computed the performance of the medical protocol currently adopted in the 
screening programs. Results show that a gain of sensitivity reflects in a loss 
of specificity, bringing to a scenario where there is not an algorithm and a 
configuration which properly outperforms against the others. However, Random 
Forest provides interesting performances (0.818 sensitivity - 0.629 specificity) 
compared with medical protocols (0.906 sensitivity - 0.230 specificity). 
Detection of hypertension at a population level still remains challenging and a 
machine learning approach could help in making screening programs more precise 
and cost effective, when based on accurate data collection. More studies are 
needed to identify new features to be acquired and to further improve the 
performances of ML models."
19,"PURPOSE: Intracranial arteriovenous-malformation (AVM) is a relatively rare 
condition in pediatrics, yet is a major cause of spontaneous intracranial 
hemorrhage with a risk of fatal hemorrhage reported to be between 4 and 29%. 
Little is known about vessel morphology and optimum treatment modalities 
including multimodality combination therapy and prognosis in children.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all children presenting to our institution 
from 2006 to 2020 that had an AVM was undertaken.
RESULTS: A total of 50 children were identified with median age of 11 (range 
1-16) years. The mean follow-up was 7.6 years. Forty-one children presented as 
an emergency and of those, 40 had hemorrhage identified on initial brain 
imaging. The average nidus size was 25 mm, drainage was superficial in 51% of 
cases, and located in eloquent cortex in 56%. The supplemental Spetzler-Martin 
grading indicated 78% (39/50) were grade 4 and above (moderate to high risk). 
Primary treatment modalities included embolization in 50% (25) or SRS in 30% 
(15) and surgery in 20% (10).The AVM was obliterated on follow-up DSA in 66% 
children. Three children had post-treatment hemorrhage, two related to 
embolization and one the day following SRS, giving a re-bleed rate of 6%. The 
GOSE was available for 32 children at long term follow and 94% had a good 
outcome (GOSE 5-8). Two children died due to acute hemorrhage (4%).
CONCLUSION: The majority of children with AVM present with hemorrhage. The 
rebleed rate during definitive treatment is low at 6% over the study period. The 
selective use of the 3 modalities of treatment has significantly reduced 
mortality and severe disability."
20,"Blood flow restriction pressures are typically set as a percentage of the 
arterial occlusion pressure. For those who do not have the ability to measure 
the arterial occlusion pressure, estimation equations are available. However, 
notable considerations are needed when estimating pressure with a narrow cuff 
(5 cm) in the lower body. A previously published equation in this journal was 
developed but was created only using 55% of the sample because the arterial 
occlusion of the others could not be obtained within the manufacturer's pressure 
limit. The purpose of this article was twofold: (1) to investigate how previous 
studies have implemented the equation and (2) to highlight potential concerns of 
using this equation. Two databases were used to locate articles that used the 
equation from Loenneke et al. (2015). We found that this equation had been cited 
10 times to estimate arterial occlusion pressure with some notable concerns. 
Some did not use a 5 cm wide cuff, while others used it for participants who had 
arterial occlusion pressures exceeding 300 mmHg. To highlight the latter, we 
also applied the Loenneke et al. (2015) lower body equation to participants with 
arterial occlusion pressures known to exceed 300 mmHg to demonstrate potential 
concerns. This retrospective analysis found that 52% of the sample with known 
pressures over 300 mmHg (40 out of 77) would be estimated below 300 mmHg. This 
paper highlighted important considerations for those trying to estimate arterial 
occlusion pressure in the lower body with a narrow cuff (5 cm)."
21,"PURPOSE: To compare heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), blood lactate 
(BL), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during arm cycling with and 
without a blood flow restriction (BFR).
METHODS: Twelve healthy males (age: 23.9 ± 3.75 years) completed four, 
randomized, 15-min arm cycling conditions: high-workload (HW: 60% maximal power 
output), low-workload (LW: 30% maximal power output), low-workload with BFR 
(LW-BFR), and BFR with no exercise (BFR-only). In the BFR conditions, cuff 
pressure to the proximal biceps brachii was set to 70% of occlusion pressure. 
HR, VO2, and RPE were recorded throughout the exercise, and BL was measured 
before, immediately after, and five minutes post-exercise. Within-subject 
repeated-measures ANOVA was used to evaluate condition-by-time interactions.
RESULTS: HW elicited the greatest responses in HR (91% of peak; 
163.3 ± 15.8 bpm), VO2 (71% of peak; 24.0 ± 3.7 ml kg-1 min-1), BL 
(7.7 ± 2.5 mmol L-1), and RPE (14 ± 1.7) and was significantly different from 
the other conditions (p < 0.01). The LW and LW-BFR conditions did not differ 
from each other in HR, VO2, BL, and RPE mean of conditions: ~ 68%, 41%, 
3.5 ± 1.6 mmol L-1, 10.4 ± 1.6, respectively; p > 0.05). During the BFR-only 
condition, HR increased from baseline by ~ 15% (on average) (p < 0.01) without 
any changes in VO2, BL, and RPE (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: HW arm cycling elicited the largest and most persistent 
physiological responses compared to LW arm cycling with and without a BFR. As 
such, practitioners who prescribe arm cycling for their clients should be 
advised to augment the demands of exercise via increases in exercise intensity 
(i.e., power output), rather than by adding BFR."
22,"Background: We reviewed the literature comparing the pathological 
characteristics of singleton births conceived after assisted reproductive 
technology (ART) with those after spontaneous conception. Methods: We reviewed 
PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Google Scopus, Scholar, Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science for the previous 10 years, up to 
November 2022. Results: Four eligible studies included 3445 placentas, 806 after 
ART (IVF/ICSI). Placentas after ART differed in frequency of retroplacental and 
marginal hematomas (p = 0.04), increased thickness (p = 0.02), higher overall 
occurrences of vascular and anatomical pathology (p < 0.001) and more frequent 
marginal (p = 0.001) and membranous (p = 0.02) umbilical cord insertion than 
placentas from non-ART pregnancies. Conclusion: Further research is needed to 
determine the extent to which these placental changes in ART pregnancies alter 
its function and pregnancy outcome."
23,"BACKGROUND: The high safety of homologous blood components, together with the 
introduction of the Patient Blood Management strategy, has led to the 
progressive abandonment of preoperative autologous blood donation (PAD) in 
surgery. Furthermore, recent scientific publications provide evidence about the 
non-usefulness of PAD in the collection of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from 
bone marrow (BM), also in consideration of harvest procedure safety. 
Nevertheless, no conclusive studies have been published yet.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood Establishments (BE) and Bone Marrow Collection 
Centers (BMCC) participated in a specific qualitative survey proposed by Italian 
National Blood and Transplant centers with the support of the relevant Italian 
Scientific Societies. The survey aimed at evaluating the policy adopted for PAD 
in related and unrelated adult HSC donors in Italy during the period 2018-2020.
RESULTS: Forty-one BE corresponding to 37 BMCC filled in the questionnaire. Of 
830 BM donors, 661 (80%) underwent 1063 PAD (mean 1.6 PAD/donor). The remaining 
169 donors (20%) underwent BM harvest without PAD. No serious adverse events 
were reported for either donor group. In the case of ineligibility of donors for 
the PAD program, due to low hemoglobin values, 7/10 centers shifted donors to 
peripheral blood stem cell collection and three centers chose a different donor. 
Remarkably, only 51% of the PAD units requested were eventually transfused 
during the BM harvest process. Finally, the iron support policy among centers 
was heterogeneous.
DISCUSSION: The results of this survey show that PAD is heterogeneously applied 
in Italian BMCC, as in other countries. However, all BMCC except two are willing 
to adopt a Patient Blood Management strategy as an alternative approach to adult 
related and unrelated BM donor harvests."
24,"BACKGROUND: Children have different clinical and physiological drivers for 
transfusion from adult recipients. However, adverse transfusion reactions (ATRs) 
in pediatric patients are usually reported using the same criteria as for 
adults. Broad assessments of pediatric ATRs neglect substantial variation in 
different developmental stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 342,950 patients, ~2.43 
million transfusions, and 5,540 ATR reports collated from New Zealand hospitals 
between 2005 and 2021. Using 16 years as the upper age limit, 138,856 pediatric 
transfusions and 402 pediatric ATR reports were identified and dissected at 
three levels: pediatric as a whole, pediatric developmental stage (i.e., 
neonate, infant, preschool, and school), and chronological age to identify 
patients at high risk of ATRs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
followed to quantify risk factors.
RESULTS: Pediatric recipients had a higher ATR risk than adults (p=6.9e-07) but 
the high risk was associated mainly with children older than 2 years. Neonates 
and infants accounted for 75.0% of pediatric recipients but had much lower ATR 
rates than adults. Pediatric transfusion recipients showed a clear male bias 
prior to age 11 years and then a female bias. However, gender difference in 
experiencing ATRs was significant only after age 13 years (p=2.3e-04). Analyses 
focusing on the high-risk group revealed allergic reactions being the cause of 
the elevated risk and identified the main risk factors of number of transfusions 
(p=4.5e-10) and multiple types of components transfused (p=2.0e-13).
DISCUSSION: The identified ATR risk factors signal linkage with the biological 
drivers for transfusion. Low ATR rates in infancy could also be attributed to 
use of neonatal components, low transfusions per patient, and less developed 
immunity. The relative increase in female recipients from age 11 may be 
associated with increased red blood cell demand following puberty."
25,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of low pre-operative hemoglobin (Hb) among cardiac 
surgery patients is high. As iron homeostasis is often impaired in these 
patients, restoration of iron availability might over-ride iron-restricted 
erythropoiesis. This post-hoc analysis of a previously published, large, 
randomized clinical trial (ClincalTrials.gov NCT03560687; n=1,000) assesses 
which sub-cohort of patients benefits the most from pre-operative Hb 
optimization with oral Sucrosomial® iron.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients without baseline Hb (n=349) or receiving >5 red 
blood cell units (n=57) were excluded from the study. Data from the remaining 
594 were reanalyzed according to treatment, baseline anemia (Hb <13 g/dL) or 
gender. Patients (pt) received a one-month course of 60 mg/day Sucrosomial® iron 
(Iron group, n=309) or routine care (Control group, n=285) prior to elective 
cardiac surgery. Main end-point variables were increase in Hb from randomization 
to hospital admission, transfusion requirements, and cost-effectiveness of 
Sucrosomial® iron administration.
RESULTS: At hospital admission, Hb had increased 0.7 g/dL and 0.1 g/dL, for Iron 
and Control groups, respectively (p<0.001), with no gender-related differences, 
leading to a decrease in transfusion rate (30 vs 59%, respectively; p<0.001) and 
transfusion index (0.5 units/patient vs 1.2 units/pt, respectively; p<0.001). 
Sucrosomial® iron administration was well-tolerated, and yielded cost-savings of 
€92/pt (p<0.001), particularly in those presenting with baseline Hb <13 g/dL.
CONCLUSIONS: This post-hoc analysis confirms pre-operative Sucrosomial® iron 
administration is a safe and cost-effective strategy to increase preoperative Hb 
and decrease transfusion requirements in elective cardiac surgery, especially in 
those anemic at baseline."
26,"BACKGROUND: The boundaries between myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 
immune-mediated cytopenias are often difficult to establish and both conditions 
may benefit from immunosuppressive therapy. The optimal timing and doses of 
immunosuppressants are largely unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically evaluated a retrospective cohort of 79 
patients with low-risk MDS tested for anti-erythrocyte or anti-platelet 
autoantibodies to assess their frequency and the efficacy of immunosuppression, 
particularly with steroids.
RESULTS: We found autoantibody positivity in 43% of cases and overt autoimmune 
diseases in 18%, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thromboctyopenia, 
and Evans syndrome. Steroid treatment improved cytopenia in about half of 
patients, with 26% achieving a complete recovery lasting for a median of 12 
months. Better responses were observed in anemic patients with anti-erythrocyte 
autoantibodies than in those with anti-platelet autoantibodies, and the 
combination with recombinant erythropoietin (7/10) had a possible synergistic 
effect. Steroid doses were heterogeneous depending on the clinical intent (i.e., 
anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anabolizing). Patients treated with a dose 
of 1 mg/kg day of prednisone for overt autoimmune cytopenia showed high rates of 
complete responses (60%).
DISCUSSION: This observation suggests a trial with a short course (2-3 weeks) of 
standard steroid doses to ascertain efficacy and properly silence the autoimmune 
pathogenic mechanism. Steroid-related adverse events (16% of cases) should be 
monitored carefully in this elderly, frail population. In conclusion, features 
of autoimmunity are present in more than two-thirds of low-risk MDS patients and 
a trial with prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg day for 2-3 weeks, with proper monitoring of 
adverse events, may be useful to improve cytopenias in selected cases."
27,"BACKGROUND: Congenital factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency is a rare coagulation 
disorder characterized by muscular or mucocutaneous bleeding with 
life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs), especially in cases with 
severe disease. The best treatment is the use of prophylactic plasma-derived or 
recombinant FXIII (rFXIII). Few data on the use of rFXIII in the real-world 
scenario are available. The main goal of this study was to assess the efficacy 
and safety of catridecacog (NovoThirteen®) in a population of patients with 
FXIII deficiency. Other objectives were to compare the different pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profiles of each patient and to use them to create a tailored prophylaxis 
regimen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected and analyzed all pharmacokinetic and 
clinical data in our registry of the patients with congenital FXIII deficiency 
treated with rFXIII at eleven Italian hemophilia centers. Data were collected 
from January 2019 to December 2020.
RESULTS: Overall, data on 20 patients with FXIII deficiency were collected, 16 
of whom presented with severe disease. Pharmacokinetics was assessed in 18 cases 
before starting prophylaxis. Prophylaxis was subsequently started in these 
patients using a wide range of dosages (25.0-80.0 IU/kg; mean 33.8 IU/kg) and 
infusion intervals (3.0-8.0 weeks). During a mean follow up of 47 months, two 
minor bleeds and one ICH in a severe patient who had remained under on-demand 
treatment were reported.
DISCUSSION: Efficacy and safety of rFXIII were proven in all patients. The 
dosage and infusion timing for the treated patients sometimes differed to those 
reported in the MENTOR pivotal studies, thus underlying the importance of 
tailored management in a real-world scenario."
28,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the readability of consent forms for 
blood transfusion in public hospitals in Spain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, national study conducted 
within the Spanish healthcare system. Data were collected through the online 
retrieval of consent documents and direct consultation with 223 public 
hospitals. Consent forms were subjected to readability assessment including 
typographical, grammatical and lexical dimensions. The INFLESZ scale, a 
well-validated instrument adapted to the reading habits of Spaniards, was 
applied to determine the grammatical readability of the documents. The Spanish 
Mosby's Dictionary and the Dictionary of Spanish were used together to 
systematically identify the number of medical terms contained in the text. Data 
were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
RESULTS: Forty-five written consent forms for blood transfusion, in use in 126 
general public hospitals were evaluated for various parameters, including font 
size (=10.41), abbreviations (=10.58), word count (=595, 209 min-1,499 max) and 
length (1 to 7 pages). The overall readability score (=50.66) was indicative 
that consent forms are somewhat difficult to read. A heterogeneity of 116 
different healthcare terminology words was identified. Word count was 
statistically and moderately positively related to the number of medical terms 
identified in the text (rho=0.496, p=0.001) and the INFLESZ score (rho=0.34, 
p=0.023).
DISCUSSION: In this first national study to assess the ease of reading written 
information on blood transfusion given to patients, deficiencies were found in 
the three dimensions of readability (typographical, grammatical and lexical) and 
a lack of uniformity among the written consent forms is pronounced. Further 
research is needed to develop more person-centered tools to support patients in 
the process of consenting for blood transfusion."
29,"BACKGROUND: Refining risk stratification of cytogenetically  normal AML (CN-AML) 
cases is important for decision making and tailoring of therapy. In this context 
genetic and epigenetic mutations was considered. Among these epigenetic 
regulators are DNMT3A & TET2 genes. Therefore, the aim of  this study was to 
determine the prevalence of DNMT3A and TET2 genes mutations and their impact on 
the outcome of  adult AML patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The present study is cross sectional study which was 
conducted on 39 adult CN-AML patients at diagnosis. For all included patients 
sanger sequencing was done for DNMT3A exon 23 and TET2 exon 3 genes.
RESULTS: DNMT3A mutations were detected in 8 of 39 patients (20.5%), and in 5 of 
39 patients(12.8%) in TET gene. Two CN-AML  patients had combined mutations in 
both genes. All of the mutations detected were missense and only one was frame 
shift. Mutated TET2 or DNMT3A genes were significantly associated with failure 
of complete remission (CR) (p <0.001), higher mortality rate, shorter OS 
(mean=16 versus 22.7 months) and shorter DFS (mean= 9.5 versus 21.4 months) when 
compared to non-mutated ones.
CONCLUSION: Mutated TET2 and DNMT3A detection define a subgroup of CN-AML 
patients with poor outcome."
30,"BACKGROUND: The burden of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is increasing due to 
longer patient survival, better life expectancy of the general population, and 
increasing drug prices. Funding is one of the main concerns in the choice of CML 
medication used worldwide; thus, patient assistance programmes were introduced 
to ensure accessibility to affordable treatment. In this study, we evaluated CML 
drug distribution inequality in Malaysia through patient assistance programmes, 
using pharmaco-economics methods to evaluate CML treatment from the care 
provider's perspective.
METHODS: Patients with CML were recruited from outpatient haematological clinics 
at the national centre of intervention and referral for haematological 
conditions and a public teaching hospital. The health-related quality of life or 
utility scores were derived using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Costing 
data were obtained from the Ministry of Health Malaysia Casemix MalaysianDRG. 
Imatinib and nilotinib drug costs were obtained from the administration of the 
participating hospitals and pharmaceutical company.
RESULTS: Of the 221 respondents in this study, 68.8% were imatinib users. The 
total care provider cost for CML treatment was USD23,014.40 for imatinib and 
USD43,442.69 for nilotinib. The governmental financial assistance programme 
reduced the total care provider cost to USD13,693.51 for imatinib and 
USD19,193.45 for nilotinib. The quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 17.87 
and 20.91 per imatinib and nilotinib user, respectively. Nilotinib had a higher 
drug cost than imatinib, yet its users had better life expectancy, utility 
score, and QALYs. Imatinib yielded the lowest cost per QALYs at USD766.29.
CONCLUSION: Overall, imatinib is more cost-effective than nilotinib for treating 
CML in Malaysia from the care provider's perspective. The findings demonstrate 
the importance of cancer drug funding assistance for ensuring that the 
appropriate treatments are accessible and affordable and that patients with 
cancer use and benefit from such patient assistance programmes. To establish 
effective health expenditure, drug distribution inequality should be addressed."
31,"BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is a complex biological process wherein novel capillary 
blood vessels mature from pre-existing vasculature for delivering tissues with 
oxygen and nutrients. Natural molecules that have anti-angiogenic activity and 
toxicity can raise the focus on using plant sources as essential therapeutic 
agent.
OBJECTIVE: The current research was intended to estimate the probable 
anti-angiogenic activity of abscisic acid alone and in combination with 
prednisolone, a well-known angiostatic glucocorticoid.
METHODS: two months old albino rats were used in this study. ABA and 
prednisolone stock solutions were prepared and added after embedding aortic 
rings in growth media. The ex vivo rat aorta ring assay (RAR) was applied to 
explore the anti-angiogenic effect of ABA. The in vivo chorioallantoic membrane 
assay (CAM) was applied to quantify the blood vessels inhibition zone by ABA 
effect. That zone was calculated as the mean inhibition region on eggs in mm ± 
SD.
RESULTS: Abscisic acid screened byex vivo and in vivo assays, revealed a 
significant dose-dependent blood vessels inhibition in comparison to the 
negative control with IC50= 7.5µg/ml and a synergism effect when combined with 
prednisolone.
CONCLUSION: The synergism activity of ABA with prednisolone can significantly 
inhibit blood vessels growth in RAR and CAM assays. These results shed the light 
on the potential clinic values of ABA, and prednisolone combination in 
angiogenesis-dependent tumors."
32,"BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is the process of vascularization from preexisting 
blood vessels. It is essential for many physiological and pathological 
processes. Quinine is an anti-malarial agent belongs to the quinoline alkaloid 
that can inhibit angiogenesis. Vitamin C is also an important antioxidant and 
has been shown to reduce angiogenesis in tumor.
OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at investigating the effect of quinine alone and 
in combination with vitamin C on angiogenesis process.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 12 to 14 weeks old male albino rats were used for the 
study. Quinine was prepared by dissolving in DMSO and was serially diluted. The 
rat aorta ring assay was employed to investigate the antiangiogenic effect of 
quinine ex vivo. An in vivo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was used to 
measure the blood vessels inhibition zone by quinine. The zone of inhibition was 
calculated as the mean inhibition area of a blood vessel in mm±SD.The obtained 
data were statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: The results revealed that quinine has a significant dose-dependent 
inhibition effect on the growth of blood vessels by 98% ± 0.07 in concentration 
100µg/ml when compared to the negative control. moreover, the inhibition of 
blood vessels growth as a measure of the antiangiogenic activity of quinine in 
combination with vitamin C shows a synergistic effect when the concentration 
that inhibit 50% of blood vessels growth (IC50) which equals to 5.05 µg/ml 
resulted in 85% of growth inhibition when combined with IC50 of vitamin C which 
equals to 22..87µg/ml.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the activity of quinine with vitamin C 
synergism can greatly lower blood vessels growth in rat aorta rings and CAM 
assays. Quininehas an inhibitory effect on tumor and can be utilized as an 
antiangiogenic agent alone or in combination with vitamin C."
33,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the main epidemiological 
characteristics of AML (morbidity, survival, distribution by AML variants and 
age groups) in 5 regions participating in the study.
METHODS: This stat study was conducted on patients diagnosed with acute myeloid 
leukemia in 5 regions of Kazakhstan, from January 2017 to December 2020. 
Compared with self-assessment of acute myeloid leukemia using a questionnaire, 
postoperative histopathology in patients with suspected acute myeloid leukemia. 
The questionnaire, compiled by artificial intelligence, is grouped into 
categories ""risk"" and ""no risk"". Statistical processing and analysis of data was 
carried out using the analytical package SAS 9.4. Methods of reporting 
statistics, standardization of morbidity were used.
RESULT: According to the standardized morbidity indicators obtained (from 1.39 
to 2.43 per 100 thousand population), we can say that the registered incidence 
of AML remains low. This value practically does not differ from the incidence of 
AML (2.71) according to the Kazakhstan Cancer Registry for 2016 and is 
significantly lower than the data of European and American registries (4-5 cases 
per 100 thousand inhabitants per year).
CONCLUSION: This study identified specific areas with a high risk of acute 
myeloid leukemia in Eastern Kazakhstan, as well as spatial inequality in their 
distribution with the formation of this disease. These results can be useful in 
developing any strategy for responding to a high risk of cancer in specific 
areas."
34,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined survival outcomes in relapsed childhood 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in resource-limited countries. This study aimed to 
evaluate the prognostic factors and survival outcomes of relapsed childhood AML 
in Thailand.
METHODS: The medical records of AML patients aged 0-15 years treated in a major 
tertiary center in Southern Thailand between December 1979 and December 2019 
were reviewed retrospectively. The overall survival (OS) was calculated using 
the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 316 AML patients were included and relapse occurred in 98 
(31%) patients. Of these, 57 (58.2%) and 41 (41.8%) patients had early [≤1 year 
from first complete remission (CR1)] and late (>1 year from CR1) relapses, 
respectively. Only 54 (55.1%) patients received chemotherapy after relapse. The 
3-year OS of all relapsed patients was 3.5%. The 3-year OS of patients with 
early and late relapse were 0% and 8.5%, respectively (p=0.002). The 3-year OS 
of patients who received chemotherapy and those who did not were 6.5% and 0%, 
respectively (p <0.0001). The median survival time of patients who did not 
receive chemotherapy was 1.7 months. The 3-year OS of patients who achieved 
second complete remission (CR2) and those who did not were 12.6% and 0%, 
respectively (p <0.001).
CONCLUSION: The relapsed AML rate was 31% and the survival outcome was poor with 
a 3-year OS of 3.5%. The adverse prognostic factors were early relapse, failure 
to achieve CR2 and those who did not receive chemotherapy after relapse."
35,"BACKGROUND: Chromium (Cr) is a transition metal, natural element. Chromium is 
the 21st most abundant element in Earth's crust. Cr is found in soil, rocks and 
living organisms. It may have various oxidation states, from -2 to +6, but most 
of these states are too unstable to exist in any significant quantities. The 
purpose of this review and meta-analysis is to critically assess the scientific 
evidence on the carcinogenic effects of chromium (Cr) and to determine whether 
there is currently sufficient evidence to suggest that that there is a link 
between chromium levels in hair and blood serum and breast cancer in women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Research on the relationship between heavy metal chromium 
and the risk of developing breast cancer has been searched in PubMed, EMBASE, 
Web of Science, Scopus among papers published between January 2000 and September 
2020. The search used the following terms (MeSH): breast cancer, women, trace 
elements, metals, chromium, chemically-induced, hair, serum using additional 
terms.
RESULTS: In the second group of comparisons of women from ""ecologically clean"" 
districts of Aktobe Region, there were significantly lower indicators of the 
microelements in tumor tissue. The amount of Fe ranges from 38.46 to 65.39 ug/g 
(average 49.56±5.81 ug/g), Cu from 2.8 to 6.69 ug/g (average 5.06±1.01 ug/g), Zn 
from 1.89 to 5.38 ug/g (average 3.88±0.89 ug/g), Cr from zero to 6,1 ug/g 
(average 2.13±1.29 ug/g), Ni from 0.11 to 0.42 ug/g (average 0.28±0.067 ug/g) и 
Pb from zero to 0.19 ug/g (average 0.098±0.06 ug/g).
CONCLUSION: The article established that women who live or work in ecologically 
polluted areas or have problems with micronutrient exchange need in-depth 
screening and more frequent screening for early detection of pre- and breast 
cancer."
36,"Anti-diabetic therapies possess many side effects; thus, searching for 
alternative strategies with low cost, minimal side effects, and high therapeutic 
value is very important. The present study aimed to explore the combined use of 
selenium yeast (SY) and standard anti-diabetic drug pioglitazone (PGZ) for 
diabetes mellitus (DM) treatment in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DM. STZ was 
injected daily intraperitoneally with a low dose (40 mg/kg) into Sprague-Dawley 
rats to induce DM. The synergistic effect of the SY (0.2 mg/kg) and PGZ (0.65 
mg/kg) on DM complications was evaluated after 88 weeks of treatment. The impact 
of our medication on glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, lipid abnormalities, 
oxidative mediators, and inflammatory markers was assessed by biochemical 
techniques. STZ-induced diabetes has toxic effects, including toxic hepatic 
tissues, lipid disturbances, massive oxidative damage, and hyperinflammation. 
Experimental rats either treated with monotherapy alone or combined therapy 
resulted in a significant anti-diabetic effect. The PGZ+ SY combination has the 
best effect, as illustrated by significant (P < 0.05) decreases in fasting blood 
glucose, (FBG) insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR levels. This combination attenuated 
(P < 0.05) lipid disturbances and their associated elevated atherogenicity 
biomarkers. At the same time, treatments with PGZ+ SY exhibited an 
anti-inflammatory effect as they ameliorated the increase in inflammatory 
parameters (CRP, TNF-α, IL-6). Also, it restored the total antioxidant capacity 
and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARƔ) levels that were 
decreased by STZ-DM induction. In conclusion, this study finds PGZ+ SY as a 
promising DM therapeutic alternative. This synergistic combination alleviates 
most DM-related complications and insulin resistance."
37,"Purpose: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) who undergo cancer treatment 
sometimes report posttraumatic growth (PTG). Although the importance of peer 
support has been suggested, its association with PTG, especially its five 
distinct domains, needs to be investigated further in AYA cancer survivors. The 
present study examined the role of demographics and peer support in PTG among 
AYA cancer patients and survivors. Methods: The present, multicenter, 
cross-sectional, web-based study enrolled AYA cancer patients and survivors 
(median age: 28 years). Of 549 AYA patients recruited, 212 from 11 cancer 
centers and 12 cancer patient communities agreed to participate by completing a 
self-reported measure of PTG (Extended Version of the Posttraumatic Growth 
Inventory-Japanese) and providing information about their diagnosis, treatment, 
peer support (affiliation with an AYA patient community or friendship with other 
AYA patients), and social status. Multiple regression analysis was used to 
identify significant correlations overall and in the five PTG domains. Results: 
PTG was positively associated with male sex, having a confidant, and friendship 
with other AYA patients, and negatively associated with cranial radiation. 
Friendship with other AYA patients was positively associated with four of the 
five PTG subscales. For the five subscale scores, ""cranial radiation"" was 
negatively associated with ""relating to others""; ""belonging to a religion"" was 
positively associated with ""spiritual change""; and ""having a confidant"" was 
positively associated with ""relating to others"" and ""new possibility."" 
Conclusion: ""Having a confidant"" and ""friendship with other AYA patients"" were 
positively associated with PTG. Psychosocial interventions mobilizing peer 
support may contribute to promoting PTG in AYA patients. UMIN000035439."
38,"Abstract Background: To investigate retrospectively whether changes in serum 
albumin levels within one hour of flexible ureteroscopy (fURS) lithotripsy can 
be used as a predictor of post-operative urosepsis. Patients and Methods: 
Eligible patients with unilateral upper urinary calculi who underwent fRUS 
lithotripsy performed by a single surgeon at our center were included in the 
analysis. The patients were divided into sepsis and non-sepsis groups. The 
change ratio of albumin and white blood cell (WBC) count was calculated by 
post-operative/pre-operative index*100%. Univariable and multivariable logistic 
regression analyses were used to assess whether there was a correlation between 
risk factors and post-operative urosepsis. The receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve was used to analyze factors that showed significant differences in 
multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 314 patients 
were included in the analysis, 20 of whom had post-operative urosepsis and five 
developed septic shock; no deaths occurred. Multivariable logistic regression 
analysis showed that urine culture results, WBC counts within one hour after 
surgery, post-operative albumin levels, and the degree of albumin changes after 
surgery were independent predictors of post-operative urosepsis. Receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis showed that noteworthy hypoalbuminemia 
after surgery and positive pre-operative urine culture could help screen 
high-risk patients for post-operative urosepsis effectively. Conclusions: 
Hypoalbuminemia shortly after operation can be utilized as a predictor for early 
diagnosis of post-operative urosepsis in patients undergoing fURS lithotripsy."
39,"Background: Post-injury inflammation and its correlation with anemia recovery 
after severe trauma is poorly described. Severe injury induces a systemic 
inflammatory response associated with critical illness and organ dysfunction, 
including disordered hematopoiesis, and anemia. This study sought to 
characterize the resolution of post-injury inflammation and anemia to identify 
risk factors associated with persistence of anemia. Patients and Methods: This 
single-institution study prospectively enrolled 73 trauma patients with an 
injury severity score >15, hemorrhagic shock, and a lower extremity long bone 
orthopedic injury. Blood was obtained at enrollment and after 14 days, one, 
three, and six months. Analytes were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests with 
correction for multiple comparisons. Results: Median age was 45 years and Injury 
Severity Score (ISS) was 27, with anemia rates of 97% at two weeks, 80% at one 
month, 52% at three months, and 30% at six months. Post-injury elevations in 
erythropoietin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein resolved by one month, 
three months, and six months, respectively. Median granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
concentrations remained elevated throughout the six-month follow-up period. 
Patients with persistent anemia had longer intensive care unit and hospital 
lengths of stay, more infectious complications, and received more packed red 
blood cell transfusions compared to those with early anemia recovery. 
Conclusions: Severe trauma is associated with a prolonged inflammatory response, 
which is associated with increased transfusion requirements, lengths of stay, 
and persistent anemia. Further analysis is needed to identify correlations 
between prolonged inflammation and clinical outcomes after discharge."
40,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the vital sign stability and cost of two commonly used 
sedatives, midazolam (MDZ) and dexmedetomidine (DEX). Patients and.
METHODS: This retrospective study targeted patients who underwent mandibular 
third molar extractions under intravenous sedation using MDZ or DEX. The 
predictor variable was the type of sedative used. The primary outcome variables 
were vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure), vital sign outliers, and cost 
of the sedatives. A vital sign outlier was defined as a 30% or more change in 
vital signs during sedation; the fewer changes, the higher the vital sign 
stability. The secondary outcome variables included the observer's assessment of 
alertness/sedation scale, level of amnesia, patient satisfaction, and bispectral 
index score. Covariates were sex, age, body mass index, sleeping time, dental 
anxiety score, and Pederson scale. Descriptive statistics were computed 
including propensity score matching (PSM). The P-value was set at 0.05.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 185 patients, 103 in the MDZ group and 82 in the DEX 
group. Based on the data after PSM, the two samples had similar baseline 
covariates. The sedative effect of both agents was satisfactory. Heart rate 
outliers were more common with MDZ than with DEX (49.3% vs 22.7%, P=0.001). 
Heart rate was higher with MDZ (P=0.000). The cost was higher for DEX than for 
MDZ (29.27±0.00 USD vs 0.37±0.04 USD, P=0.000).
CONCLUSION: DEX showed more vital sign stability, while MDZ was more economical. 
These results could be used as a reference to guide clinicians during sedative 
selection."
41,"OBJECTIVE: Over the past 20 years valve-sparing aortic root replacement has 
aroused increasing interest because of a progressive attitude towards the 
preservation of natural tissue. Aortic reimplantation is the most used technique 
to spare the valve, allowing simultaneously aortic root replacement and aortic 
annular stabilization. The reimplantation into a graft with sinuses guarantees 
an optimal anatomic and functional reconstruction with established good results 
at 15 years. The aim of this study is to report the world longest follow-up (up 
to 20-years) of aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft.
METHODS: From February 2000 to December 2021, 265 consecutive patients with 
aortic root aneurysm received aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva 
graft. From 2018 leaflet plication with the routine use of caliper was 
performed. For each patient we performed both intraoperative and post-procedural 
transoesophageal echocardiography. All patients were followed with clinical 
assessment and echocardiography. The mean duration of follow-up was 
85 ± 63 months.
RESULTS: The study cohort had a median age of 55 ± 18 and 87.2% were male. The 
aortic root aneurysm was associated to bicuspid aortic valve in 18.9% of 
patients and to Marfan syndrome in 10.6% of cases. 55.9% had an aortic 
regurgitation ≥ 2+. Overall survival at 15 was 87.6 ± 3.4. Freedom from cardiac 
death was stable at 99.6 ± 0.4 at 5, 10 and 15 years. Freedom from recurrent 
AR ≥ 3+ and freedom from reoperation remained stable at 10 and 15 years at 
92.2 ± 2.1 and 95.9 ± 1.6, respectively. There was a minimal incidence of 
infective endocarditis (0.8%), thromboembolism (2.2%) and haemorrhage (2.0%). 
Six out of seven patients requiring reoperation had surgery in the first period 
of our experience (last in 2004). Early sub-optimal results had a negative 
effect on residual aortic regurgitation. Moreover, we hypothesized that the 
routine use of caliper may have contributed to a further improvement of the 
outcome, even if these data need to be confirmed by a longer follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The first long term follow-up after aortic valve reimplantation 
using the Valsalva graft demonstrated excellent results. These long-term results 
gradually improved with learning curve, remaining stable during the second 
decade of observation. The systematic use of caliper may have contributed to a 
further improvement of the outcome."
42,"Objective: Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes 
(POEMS) syndrome is a rare monoclonal plasma cell proliferation disorder. At 
present, there is no unified treatment for POEMS syndrome. Here, we describe one 
case with POEMS syndrome with obvious neurological symptoms diagnosed in 
September 2020. We made a meta--analysis to assess the efficacy of treatment 
strategies in recent years. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the diagnosis 
and treatment of this patient, and searched relevant articles in PubMed, Embase, 
and MEDLINE databases using MedicalSubject Headings (MeSH) (eg, POEMS, Therapy, 
Drug Therapy, Biological Therapy, Combined Modality Therapy, Hematopoietic Stem 
Cell Transplantation, Immunotherapy, Molecular Targeted Therapy, 
Chemoradiotherapy, and Salvage Therapy) and free words, and performed the 
statistical analysis. Results: The patient's efficacy evaluation was complete 
response (CR) after treatment with ixazomib combined with autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT). Overall, 20 articles consist of 6 clinical trials, 14 
retrospective studies, and 936 patients were included in this meta-analysis. 
There was no significant difference in complete hematologic response (CRH) rate 
between people who underwent ASCT and those who did not. However, ASCT might 
have a better survival rate. Conclusions: Ixazomib combined with ASCT therapy 
may be a safe and effective method for patients with POEMS syndrome."
43,"Dengue viral illness is endemic in many tropical countries with temperate 
climates. The haematological and cardiovascular sequelae of dengue are well 
known; however, respiratory manifestations are still an area of active medical 
research. We conducted a literature search on PubMed, Medline CINAHIL, EMBASE 
and found 64 articles on respiratory sequelae of dengue. All relevant original 
articles and case reports were included and the relevant information regarding 
the respiratory manifestations of dengue was retrieved from the relevant 
eligible articles. Respiratory manifestations of dengue range from mild pleural 
effusion to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The former was the most common 
complication, seen in 5.1% of patients, followed by acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) in 1.7%, pneumonia in 0.5%, respiratory distress in 0.3%, 
pulmonary hemorrhage in 0.1%, and haemothorax in 0.01%. Involvement of the 
respiratory system indicates severe disease and is difficult to manage. 
Therefore its early detection is important."
44,"PURPOSE: To compare Mydrane®, mydriatic eye drops, and Mydriasert® in terms of 
pupil site stability, surgical time, visual field, and anterior chamber 
configuration modifications among patients with primary open-angle glaucoma 
(POAG) during cataract extraction surgery.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of sixty patients with POAG and cataract who 
underwent elective cataract extraction. All patients underwent routine 
ophthalmic examinations, including automatic visual field examination, anterior 
chamber configuration, specular microscopy, and arterial blood pressure 
measurement prior to surgery, and 24 h and 30 days postoperatively. All cataract 
surgeries were video-recorded and all measurements were performed using a media 
player. Patients divided into groups 1, 2, and 3 (n = 20 in each group) received 
topical mydriatic eye drops, Mydriasert®, and an intracameral injection of 
Mydrane®, respectively, immediately after the first incision.
RESULTS: The mean change in pupil size from just before capsulorhexis to the end 
of surgery was 0.43 ± 0.09, 0.42 ± 0.08, and 0.36 ± 0.02 mm in groups 1, 2, and 
3, respectively. The mean surgery duration was similar among all the groups. The 
baseline main cell density slightly decreased at 24 h and remained stable for 30 
days postoperatively. The mean deviation and pattern standard deviation remained 
stable at 1 month after surgery. At 24 h after surgery, the nasal irido-corneal 
angle, temporal-iridocorneal angle, and anterior chamber depth increased 
compared with the baseline, remaining stable for 30 days after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Mydrane® produced adequate and stable mydriasis as effectively as 
produced by Mydriasert® and topical eye drops."
45,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines for young children with nutritional iron deficiency 
anemia (IDA) presenting to the emergency department (ED) are lacking, leading to 
variability in care. We aimed to standardize management of these patients 
through the development and implementation of an evidence-based algorithm using 
quality improvement methodology.
PROCEDURE: Baseline data of the target population (n = 42; 60% male; median age 
22.5 months, median hemoglobin 5.3 g/dl) identified variability across four key 
measures of clinical management: laboratory evaluation, therapy choice, therapy 
administration, and patient disposition. Literature review and consensus from 
pediatric hematology providers informed a draft algorithm that was refined in an 
iterative multidisciplinary process. From September 2020 to June 2021, we aimed 
to increase IDA management per the algorithm by ≥20% relative to baseline for 
the four key outcome measures using sequential Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. 
Process measures focusing on provider communication/documentation and balancing 
measures involving efficiency and therapy-related adverse events were assessed 
concurrently.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were evaluated among four PDSA cycles and shared 
similar characteristics as the baseline population. Improvements of ≥20% above 
baseline adherence levels or 100% adherence were achieved for all outcome 
measure across four PDSA cycles. Adherence to recommended laboratory evaluation 
improved from 43 (baseline) to 71%, therapy choice from 78 to 100%, therapy 
administration from 50 to 83%, and disposition from 85 to 100%. ED length of 
stay remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a standardized algorithm for young children with 
nutritional IDA in the ED increased adherence to evidence-based patient care."
46,"Background: First-pass efficacy (FPE) has been established as an important 
predictor of favorable functional outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy (ET) 
in anterior circulation strokes. In this retrospective cohort study, we 
investigate predictors and clinical outcomes of FPE in posterior circulation 
strokes (pcAIS). Methods: The Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry database 
was used to identify pcAIS patients who achieved FPE. Their baseline 
characteristics and outcomes were compared with the non-FPE group. The primary 
outcome was a 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-3. Univariate (UVA) and 
multivariate (MVA) analyses were done to evaluate predictors of FPE. Safety 
outcomes included distal emboli, vessel rupture, symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage, and mortality. Results: Of 359 patients, 179 (50%) achieved FPE. 
Clot burden, occlusion site, and ET technique-related variables were similar 
between the two groups except for shorter procedure time with FPE. The primary 
outcome was significantly better with FPE (56.4% vs. 32.8%, p < 0.001). 
Complications were similar except for a higher rate of distal emboli in non-FPE 
group (11.1% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.032). Atrial fibrillation (Afib) had increased odds 
(aOR: 2.06, 95% CI; 1.24, 3.4, p = 0.005) and prior ischemic stroke had 
decreased odds (aOR: 0.524, 95% CI; 0.28, 0.97, p = 0.04) of FPE. Afib was the 
only independent predictor of FPE on MVA (1.94, 95% CI; 1.1, 3.43, p = 0.022). 
Conclusions: Higher rate of FPE in Afib-related pcAIS could possibly be 
explained by the differences in clot composition and degree of in-situ 
atherosclerotic disease burden. Future studies are warranted to explore the 
relationship of clot composition with ET outcomes."
47,"We propose a mathematical and numerical model for the simulation of the heart 
function that couples cardiac electrophysiology, active and passive mechanics 
and hemodynamics, and includes reduced models for cardiac valves and the 
circulatory system. Our model accounts for the major feedback effects among the 
different processes that characterize the heart function, including 
electro-mechanical and mechano-electrical feedback as well as force-strain and 
force-velocity relationships. Moreover, it provides a three-dimensional 
representation of both the cardiac muscle and the hemodynamics, coupled in a 
fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model. By leveraging the multiphysics nature 
of the problem, we discretize it in time with a segregated 
electrophysiology-force generation-FSI approach, allowing for efficiency and 
flexibility in the numerical solution. We employ a monolithic approach for the 
numerical discretization of the FSI problem. We use finite elements for the 
spatial discretization of partial differential equations. We carry out a 
numerical simulation on a realistic human left heart model, obtaining results 
that are qualitatively and quantitatively in agreement with physiological ranges 
and medical images. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
48,"Pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired disorder associated with 
autoimmune destruction and impairment of platelet production in children. Some 
children exhibit poor or transient response to ITP-directed treatments and are 
referred to as having refractory ITP (rITP). There is currently no consensus on 
the definition of rITP, nor evidence-based treatment guidelines for patients 
with rITP. After a survey of pediatric ITP experts demonstrated lack of 
consensus on pediatric rITP, we pursued a systematic review to examine the 
reported clinical phenotypes and treatment outcomes in pediatric rITP. The 
search identified 253 relevant manuscripts; following review, 11 studies 
proposed a definition for pediatric rITP with no consensus amongst them. Most 
definitions included suboptimal response to medical management, while some 
outlined specific platelet thresholds to define this suboptimal response. Common 
attributes identified in this study should be used to propose a comprehensive 
definition, which will facilitate outcome comparisons of future rITP studies."
49,"Early access to care is essential to improve survival rates for childhood 
cancer. This study evaluates the determinants of delays in childhood cancer care 
in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) through a systematic review of the 
literature. We proposed a novel Three-Delay framework specific to childhood 
cancer in LMICs by summarizing 43 determinants and 24 risk factors of delayed 
cancer care from 95 studies. Traditional medicine, household income, lack of 
transportation, rural population, parental education, and travel distance 
influenced most domains of our framework. Our novel framework can be used as a 
policy tool toward improving cancer care and outcomes for children in LMICs."
50,"BACKGROUND: Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) and clinical 
splenomegaly by 6 months of age appeared at greater risk of invasive infections 
after 5 years of the Jamaican Cohort Study. We determined whether this risk 
remained significant over a longer study period, using a more rigorous 
definition of infection and examining the contribution of potential confounders.
METHODS: Newborn screening of 100,000 consecutive deliveries during 1973-1981 
detected 311 births with HbSS. Age at first clinical splenomegaly was used to 
categorize 285 of these patients in whom this could be determined: at or before 
7 months (early), after 7 months (later), or 'never' palpated despite repeated 
examinations. Infective episodes were confined to 'first infections confirmed by 
positive culture'. Using a generalized linear model, the risk of septicaemia was 
assessed in each group, after adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Of 93 'first infections', 42 occurred in 105 subjects in the 'early' 
group, 49 in 157 subjects in the 'later' group, and two in 23 subjects in the 
'never' group; the observed to expected ratio of 1.42, 0.90 and 0.22 was highly 
significant (p = .003). Assessed as risk ratios, 'early' splenomegaly had a 
significantly higher risk ratio (RR) for septicaemia (RR = 7.4, confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.1-50.7, p < .05) when compared to the 'never' group adjusting 
for vaccine exposure and foetal haemoglobin concentration. The most common 
organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella species, Haemophilus 
influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus.
CONCLUSION: Early clinical splenomegaly in HbSS remains a predictor of 
septicaemia, defining a group that may require closer monitoring."
51,"BACKGROUND: There have been significant changes in clinical guidelines for 
sickle cell disease (SCD) over the past two decades, including updated 
indications for hydroxyurea, transfusions, and iron overload management. In 
practice however, there are few studies that examine SCD care utilization over 
time.
METHODS: We conducted a serial cross-sectional cohort study of pediatric SCD 
patients from 2004 to 2019 using Georgia Medicaid claims data. For each year, we 
reported receipt of any transfusion, chronic transfusion, or three or more 
filled hydroxyurea prescriptions. For children receiving chronic transfusion 
(six or more annual transfusions), we evaluated iron overload diagnosis, 
monitoring, and chelation use. Among children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), we 
examined rates of transfusions and hydroxyurea use. The Cochran-Armitage test 
was used to assess trend.
RESULTS: There were 5316 unique children 2-18 years old with SCD enrolled in 
Georgia Medicaid from 2004 to 2019. Children receiving any transfusion increased 
from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized. In SCA patients, chronic transfusions 
initially increased from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized from 2010 to 2019. For 
chronically transfused children, monitoring of iron burden and filled chelator 
prescriptions both increased significantly. Hydroxyurea use in SCA patients 
increased from 12% to 37%, with increases noted within each age group, most 
notably from 21% to 60% in the 13-18-year-old cohort.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated changes in SCD care utilization over time, including 
increased hydroxyurea use, changes in transfusion rates, and increased attention 
to iron overload management. While trends in clinical management do follow 
updates in treatment guidelines, there is still delayed and suboptimal uptake of 
guideline recommendations in pediatric SCD patients."
52,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of intermittent high-intensity exercise 
training ([IHIE], including high-intensity interval training [HIIT] and 
recreational team sports [RTS]) on systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP) in adults with pre- to established arterial hypertension.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase and SPORTDiscus.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the impact 
of IHIE on BP versus a non-exercise control.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently conducted all 
procedures. Mean differences were calculated using random-effects model. The 
certainty of the evidence was assessed with GRADE.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven RCTs (18 HIIT and 9 RTS) were analyzed, with median 
duration of 12 weeks. Participants' (n=946) median age was 46 years. Overall, 
IHIE decreased SBP (-3.29 mmHg; 95%CI: -5.19, -1.39) and DBP (-2.62 mmHg; 95%CI: 
-3.79, -1.44) compared to the control group. IHIE elicited higher decreases in 
office SBP and DBP of hypertensive subjects (SBP: -7.13 mmHg; [95%CI: -10.12, 
-4.15]; DBP: -5.81 mmHg, [95%CI: -7.94, -3.69]) than pre-hypertensive (SBP: 
-2.14 mmHg, [95%CI: -4.36, -0.08]; DBP: -1.83 mmHg, [95%CI: -2.99, -0.67]). No 
significant differences were found between HIIT (SBP: -2.12 mmHg, [95%CI: -4.78, 
-0.54]; DBP: -1.89 mmHg, [95%CI: -3.32, -0.48]) and RTS (SBP: -4.18 mmHg, 
[95%CI: -7.19, -2.43]; DBP: -4.04 mmHg, [95%CI: -6.00, -2.09]). These findings 
are low/very low certainty of evidence. No adverse cardiovascular events were 
reported.
CONCLUSIONS: IHIE appears to be safe and to promote substantial decreases in BP, 
particularly in patients with hypertension. However, the certainty of evidence 
was low/very low."
53,"Death happening in massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, 
traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving 
rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive 
bleeding situations. Herein, we develop a covalent crosslinked AG-PEG glue based 
on extracellular matrix-like amino-gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives. The AG-PEG 
glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with 
various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive 
and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, 
enabling it to withstand up to 380 mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal 
systolic blood pressure of 60-180 mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig 
cardiac penetrating hole with 6 mm diameter is effectively stopped using the 
glue within 60 seconds. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually 
recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14 days. Possessing 
on-demand solubility, self-gelling and rapid degradability, the AG-PEG glue may 
provide a fascinating stop bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and 
emergency rescue. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
54,"OBJECTIVE: Risk factors of mortality in critically ill children with 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are not well described. This systematic 
review aims to determine overall mortality of critically ill children with HLH, 
and describes etiologies, treatment, and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) 
support employed.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from 
inception until February 28, 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and randomized controlled trials 
reporting children aged 18 years or below, diagnosed with HLH and admitted to 
the PICU.
DATA EXTRACTION: Etiologies, treatment modalities, PICU therapies, and mortality 
outcomes were summarized. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Total 36 studies (total patients = 493, mean age: 49.5 months 
[95% confidence interval (CI): 30.9-79.5]) were included. Pooled mortality rate 
was 32.6% (95% CI: 23.4-42.4). The most frequent etiologies for HLH were 
infections (53.3%) and primary HLH (12.8%), while the remaining cases were due 
to other causes of secondary HLH, including autoimmune diseases, malignancy, and 
drug-induced and idiopathic HLH. Pooled mortality rate was higher in primary 
than secondary HLH (72.2%, 95% CI: 57.8-84.5 vs. 23.9%, 95% CI: 14.4-35.02; p < 
.01). Univariate analysis found that treatment with etoposide was associated 
with higher mortality, while intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) were associated 
with lower mortality. Conversely, multivariable analysis adjusted for etiology 
demonstrated no association between etoposide and IVIG use, and mortality. 
Twenty-one studies (total patients = 278) had detailed information on PICU 
therapies. Mechanical ventilation (MV), continuous renal replacement therapy, 
and inotropes were used in 107 (38.5%), 66 (23.7%), and 51 patients (18.3%), 
respectively. Need for MV was associated with increased risk of mortality (mean 
difference = 28%, 95% CI: 9-47).
CONCLUSION: Critically ill children with HLH have high mortality rates and 
require substantial PICU support. Collaborative work between multiple centers 
with standardized data collection can potentially provide more robust data."
55,"The literature on the blood cells of Zovawk pigs is scanty; thus, this study was 
designed to elaborate the light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy

with various stains. The blood samples were treated with various substrates for 
cytoenzymatic research, and the alterations were noted. A 1000× magnification 
Olympus Trinocular Research microscope was used to examine the smears. The blood 
samples were prepared for electron microscopy according to the standard 
procedure. The prepared samples were delivered to the Sophisticated Analytical 
Instrumentation Facility (SAIF), All India Institute of Medical Sciences 
(AIIMS), New Delhi, for SEM imaging. On LM, pig erythrocytes were spherical and 
nonnucleated. The cytoplasm of the neutrophils was spherical and included 
cytoplasmic granules. The eosinophils had prominent cytoplasmic granules and 
were round. Basophils were infrequently present and had cytoplasmic granules 
that were clear blue. The sizes of small, medium and large lymphocytes were 
noted. The monocytes were oval or circular. The platelets ranged in form from 
asymmetric to round. The blood samples were stained for cytochemical analyses 
using acid ferrocyanide stain for iron, Sudan black blue stain for lipids, 
toluidine blue stain for mucopolysaccharides, and periodic acid Schiff's stain 
for glycogen. The cytoenzymatic characteristics were evaluated and compared with 
substrates treated with acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, 
arylsulfatase, cytochrome oxidase, beta-glucuronidase, and succinate 
dehydrogenase. Erythrocytes appeared as biconcave disks under SEM. Two forms of 
leukocytes were observed, having a rough and pointed cell surface like a flower. 
It can be concluded that the LM and SEM morphology of blood cells of Zovawk pigs 
resembled other domestic animals, however, few differences were observed among 
the discussed animals."
56,"BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness (AS) was associated with heart failure (HF) in 
previous studies based on specific populations with small samples and the 
effects of age and blood pressure on AS were not taken into account. Whether AS 
was independently associated with new-onset HF in community dwellers has not 
been fully investigated to date.
METHODS: Individuals who participated in health evaluations and underwent 
synchronized brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) screening in 2010 to 
2019 were included. They were free of HF and atrial fibrillation at baseline. 
The participants were allocated to 3 groups according to their baPWV values. 
Normal AS was defined as baPWV <1400 cm/s, borderline AS was defined as 
1400≤baPWV<1800 cm/s, and elevated AS was defined as baPWV ≥1800 cm/s. Cox 
proportional hazard regression was used to calculate hazard ratios with 95% CIs 
of new-onset HF across different AS groups.
RESULTS: A total of 40 064 participants were enrolled with a mean age of 
48.81±12.67 years. During a mean 5.53 years of follow-up, 411 participants 
developed HF. Compared with the normal AS group, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for 
incident HF was 1.97 (1.36-2.86) for the borderline AS group and 2.24 
(1.49-3.38) for the elevated AS group in the multivariable-adjusted model. For 
each 1 SD (359 cm/s) increase in baPWV, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for new-onset 
HF was 1.10 (1.02-1.20).
CONCLUSIONS: AS was positively associated with a higher risk of new-onset HF 
independently of traditional risk factors, with a dose-responsive effect."
57,"PROBLEM: Interleukin 35 (IL-35) is involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis 
by suppressing immunoreaction and promoting endometrial cell proliferation. It 
may also be an essential cytokine in forming the immunosuppressive functions of 
regulatory B lymphocytes (Bregs). The involvement of Bregs in the pathogenesis 
of endometriosis has not been previously investigated. In this study, we 
determined the frequencies of different Breg subpopulations, namely, B10, 
immature B-cells, and plasmablasts, and their abilities to produce IL-35 in 
women with endometriosis compared to healthy women.
METHODS: The frequencies of different subpopulations of Bregs producing IL-35 
were measured in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis (total pool), 
women with deep infiltration endometriosis (DIE), women with ovarian 
endometriosis, and healthy women as a control by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We observed a decrease in the percentage of B10 cells and plasmablasts 
in women with endometriosis and an increase in the percentage of these Breg 
populations producing IL-35 in the same experimental group. Interestingly, we 
also revealed that women with DIE had increased percentages of B10 cells and 
plasmablasts producing IL-35.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings are the first to reveal the frequencies 
of different subpopulations of Bregs producing IL-35 in women with 
endometriosis. The results suggest that IL-35 expression in B lymphocytes could 
be used as a peripheral marker of endometriosis; however, further studies are 
needed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
58,"Hydrazine and its derivatives are well-known environmental hazards and 
biological carcinogens; therefore, there is a great need for a powerful workflow 
solution for protecting the public from unexpected exposure to toxic 
contaminants. Recently, functional surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 
exhibits enormous benefits in sensing trace biochemical substances due to its 
fingerprint-like identification of individual molecules, making it an ideal 
method for detecting and quantifying hydrazine. Herein, for the first time, we 
integrated the orthogonal chemical reporter strategy with SERS to build an 
intelligent hydrazine detection platform (orthogonal chemical SERS, ocSERS), in 
which 4-mercaptobenzaldehyde was incorporated on a nanoimprinted gold nanopillar 
array, which acted as an orthogonal coupling partner of hydrazine to form Raman 
active benzaldehyde hydrazone, allowing for sensitively detecting hydrazine with 
a detection limit of 10-13 M in complex circumstances. Particularly, ocSERS 
could effectively identify the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) after 
its reduction to dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), enabling ultrasensitive detection of 
UDMH (10-13 M). Importantly, ocSERS could not only monitor elevated levels of 
NDMA in ranitidine due to improper storage but also quantify NDMA in urine and 
blood after oral administration of NDMA-containing drugs, thereby preventing 
NDMA overexposure. Therefore, ocSERS represents the first click SERS sensor and 
may open up a new analytical field."
59,"The aim of this study was to optimize a coculture in vitro model established 
between the human Müller glial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, 
mimicking the inner blood-retinal barrier, and to explore its resistance to 
damage induced by oxidative stress. A spontaneously immortalized human Müller 
cell line MIO-M1 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were plated 
together at a density ratio 1:1 and maintained up to the 8th passage (p8). The 
MIO-M1/HUVECs p1 through p8 were treated with increasing concentrations (range 
200-800 μM) of H2 O2 to evaluate oxidative stress induced damage and comparing 
data with single cell cultures. The following features were assayed p1 through 
p8: doubling time maintenance, cell viability using MTS assay, ultrastructure of 
cell-cell contacts, immunofluorescence for Vimentin and GFAP, molecular biology 
(q-PCR) for GFAP and CD31 mRNA. MIO-M1/HUVECs cocultures maintained distinct 
cell cytotype up to p8 as shown by flow cytometry analysis, without evidence of 
cross activation, displaying cell-cell tight junctions mimicking those found in 
human retina, only acquiring a slight resistance to oxidative stress induction 
over the passages. This MIO-M1/HUVECs coculture represents a simple, 
reproducible and affordable model for in vitro studies on oxidative 
stress-induced retinal damages."
60,"Psoriasis is a predominantly Th17 cell-driven chronic autoinflammatory skin 
disorder. Brevilin A, a natural sesquiterpene lactone extracted from Centipeda 
minima, has been used as a traditional oriental medicine for allergic diseases 
for centuries. However, the effects of brevilin A on psoriasis have yet to be 
established. In this study, we investigated brevilin A to elucidate its 
potential effects on T cell activities in psoriasis, in animal models and 
patients. An imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis murine model was 
utilized. Experimental mice were administered different doses of brevilin A (5, 
10, 20 mg/kg respectively) for a duration of 5 days. Cutaneous manifestations 
were measured daily. Under hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC), acanthosis and proinflammatory cytokine expression 
in the dorsal skin of mice were detected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) was used for the measurement of IL-17A levels in serum samples. Naïve 
CD4+ T cells, isolated from mice spleen and lymph nodes and from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of psoriatic patients, were used to evaluate the 
effects of brevilin A on Th17 differentiation. In brevilin A-treated mice, 
brevilin A significantly reduced skin redness and scaling; acanthosis as well as 
IL-6, IL-17A, and ki-67 expressions were downregulated in the dorsal skin, and 
serum levels of IL-17A were lowered. Brevilin A also inhibited Th17 
differentiation. In conclusion, brevilin A demonstrated significant capability 
in ameliorating skin inflammation in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis and 
could modulate Th17 differentiation. Therefore, brevilin A is potentially 
pharmacologically effective in the treatment of psoriasis."
61,"Bone disease is among the defining characteristics of symptomatic Multiple 
Myeloma (MM). Imaging techniques such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
can identify plasma cell proliferation and quantify disease activity. This 
function renders these imaging tools as suitable not only for diagnosis, but 
also for the assessment of bone disease after treatment of MM patients. The aim 
of this article is to review FDG PET/CT and MRI and their applications, with a 
focus on their role in treatment response evaluation. MRI emerges as the 
technique with the highest sensitivity in lesions' detection and PET/CT as the 
technique with a major impact on prognosis. Their comparison yields different 
results concerning the best tool to evaluate treatment response. The 
inhomogeneity of the data suggests the need to address limitations related to 
these tools with the employment of new techniques and the potential for a 
complementary use of both PET/CT and MRI to refine the sensitivity and achieve 
the standards for minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation."
62,"Disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is influenced by activation of 
circulating and synovial immune cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and monocytes 
are key cells that drive inflammation in RA. This study investigated if a 
relationship exists between disease activity in RA and circulating Treg and 
monocyte numbers and phenotypes. A potential sialic acid (Sia) mediated link 
between Tregs and monocytes was also probed in vitro. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from RA patient (n = 62) and healthy 
control (n = 21) blood using density gradient separation. Flow cytometry was 
used to count and phenotype Treg and monocyte subsets, and to sort healthy 
control Tregs for Sia cell culture experiments. The effects of Sia on activated 
Treg FoxP3 and NFκB expression was assessed by flow cytometry and concentrations 
of secreted TNFα, IL-10 and IFNγ determined by ELISA. High disease activity RA 
patients who were unresponsive to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (n = 
31), have significantly lower relative numbers (percentages) of CD4+CD25+CD127- 
Tregs (p &lt; 0.01) and memory CD45RA-FoxP3+ Tregs (p &lt; 0.01), compared to 
low disease activity responders (n = 24). Relative numbers of non-classical 
CD169+ monocytes are associated with disease activity in RA (p = 0.012). Sia 
reduced Treg expression of FoxP3, NFκB and cytokines in vitro. A strong 
association has been identified between non-classical CD169+ monocytes and 
post-treatment disease activity in RA. This study also indicates that Sia can 
reduce Treg activation and cytokine release. We postulate that such a reduction 
could be mediated by interaction with sialyted proteins captured by CD169+ 
monocytes."
63,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine predictive factors of early 
mortality and early rebleeding (≤30 days) following transarterial embolization 
(TAE) for treatment of acute gastrointestinal bleeding.
METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted for acute gastrointestinal bleeding 
to the interventional radiology department in a tertiary center between January 
2012 and January 2022 were included. Exclusion criteria were patients: (1) aged 
&lt; 18-year-old, (2) referred to the operation room without TAE, (3) treated 
for hemobilia, (4) with mesenteric hematoma, (5) lost to follow-up within 30 
days after the procedure. We evaluated pre and per-procedure clinical data, 
biological data, outcomes, and complications.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included: 55 (80.9%) experienced upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding and 13 (19.1%) lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Median 
age was 69 (61-74) years. There were 49 (72%) males. Median hemoglobin was 7.25 
(6.1-8.3) g/dL. There were 30 (50%) ulcers. Coils were used in 46 (67.6%) 
procedures. Early mortality was 15 (22.1%) and early rebleeding was 17 (25%). In 
multivariate analysis, hyperlactatemia (≥2 mmol/L) were predictive of early 
mortality (≤30 days). A high number of red blood cells units was associated with 
early rebleeding.
CONCLUSION: This study identified some predictive factors of 30-day mortality 
and early rebleeding following TAE. This will assist in patient selection and 
may help improve the management of gastrointestinal bleeding."
64,"BACKGROUND: Lipodystrophy is one of the most frequent complications in people 
with diabetes following subcutaneous insulin therapy, and poor management can 
lead to several problems, such as impaired glycemic control and adherence to 
therapy, anxiety, and depression. Poor injection technique represents the main 
risk factor for lipodystrophies. In order to enhance the patient's insulin 
injection technique to heal lipodystrophy, improve psychological indices, and 
promote involvement in their health and care, the efficacy of emerging 
person-centered care called the IARA model was tested.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients were randomly allocated to the IARA group 
(Experimental; n = 25) or standard education (Control; n = 24). The following 
questionnaires were used in a mixed-method design: (i) State Anxiety Scale; (ii) 
Beck Depression Inventory; (iii) Italian Summary of Diabetes Self-Care 
Activities. An ad hoc open-ended questionnaire was structured for the 
qualitative analysis. Finally, photos were taken in order to verify if injection 
sites were changed until the follow-up at 12 months. The number of patients who 
participated until the completion of the study was 17 in the IARA and 11 in the 
Control group.
RESULTS: State anxiety was significantly reduced in people who followed IARA to 
follow-up at 3 and 6 months (p &lt; 0.05). The IARA group also demonstrated 
better compliance in blood glucose monitoring and foot-care compared to Control 
at follow-up at 12 months. The management of insulin injections dramatically 
improved in participants who received IARA intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: IARA could be considered an effective strategy to improve 
well-being and compliance in people affected with diabetes mellitus and 
lipodystrophy complications."
65,"Altered cytochromes P450 enzymes (CYP) and P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp) 
activity may explain variabilities in drug response. In this study, we analyzed 
four years of phenotypic assessments of CYP/P-gp activities to optimize 
pharmacotherapy in psychiatry. A low-dose probe cocktail was administered to 
evaluate CYP1A2, 2B6, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, and P-gp activities using the 
probe/metabolite concentration ratio in blood or the AUC. A therapeutic 
adjustment was suggested depending on the phenotyping results. From January 2017 
to June 2021, we performed 32 phenotypings, 10 for adverse drug reaction, 6 for 
non-response, and 16 for both reasons. Depending on the CYP/P-gp evaluated, only 
23% to 56% of patients had normal activity. Activity was decreased in up to 57% 
and increased in up to 60% of cases, depending on the CYP/P-gp evaluated. In 
11/32 cases (34%), the therapeutic problem was attributable to the patient's 
metabolic profile. In 10/32 cases (31%), phenotyping excluded the metabolic 
profile as the cause of the therapeutic problem. For all ten individuals for 
which we had follow-up information, phenotyping allowed us to clearly state or 
clearly exclude the metabolic profile as a possible cause of therapeutic 
failure. Among them, seven showed a clinical improvement after dosage 
adaptation, or drug or pharmacological class switching. Our study confirmed the 
interest of CYP and P-gp phenotyping for therapeutic optimization in psychiatry."
66,"COVID-19 continues to afflict the global population, causing several 
pathological diseases and exacerbating co-morbidities due to SARS-CoV-2's high 
mutation. Recent interest has been devoted to some neuronal manifestations and 
to increased levels of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain-derived Neurotrophic 
Factor (BDNF) in the bloodstream during SARS-CoV-2 infection, neurotrophins that 
are well-known for their multifactorial actions on neuro-immune-endocrine and 
visual functions. Nineteen (19) patients were enrolled in this monocentric 
prospective study and subjected to anamnesis and biosamples collection (saliva 
and blood) at hospitalization (acute phase) and 6 months later (remission 
phase). NGF and BDNF were quantified by ELISA, and biochemical data were related 
to biostrumental measurements. Increased NGF and BDNF levels were quantified in 
saliva and serum during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (hospitalized 
patients), and reduced levels were observed in the next 6 months (remission 
phase), never matching the baseline values. Salivary and circulating data would 
suggest the possibility of considering sera and saliva as useful matrices for 
quickly screening neurotrophins, in addition to SARS-CoV2 antigens and RNA. 
Overall, the findings described herein highlight the importance of NGF and BDNF 
as dynamic biomarkers for monitoring disease and reinforces the possibility of 
using saliva and sera for quick, non-invasive COVID-19 screening."
67,"Lung cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide. Numerous 
medications targeting specific molecular alterations in non-small cell lung 
cancer have been introduced in the last decade and have revolutionized the 
clinical management of the disease. Their use has brought to a parallel 
evolution of molecular testing techniques to identify alterations in druggable 
molecular targets within the genetic material of the tumors. To perform 
molecular testing, biopsy or surgery tissue specimens are needed, which in 
addition allow the histological characterization of the tumors. Unfortunately, 
in real-life practice not all the patients are suitable for biopsy or surgery 
procedures. The use of liquid biopsy for blood extracted tumoral DNA analysis is 
a promising approach in unbiopsied cases, but it is also weighted by several 
methodological and technical limitations. We report here a case of 
histologically undiagnosed lung cancer managed with a liquid biopsy and 
subsequently with anti-EGFR treatment. Our report highlights that the use of 
liquid biopsy molecular testing in specific clinical situations can offer 
treatment opportunities for fragile patients affected by lung cancer."
68,"It is known that pneumothorax (PX) and pneumomediastinum (PM) develop due to 
COVID-19 disease. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of 
PX/PM due to COVID-19 in the intermediate intensive care unit (IMCU) and to 
evaluate the factors causing barotrauma and also the clinical outcomes of these 
patients. A total of 283 non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia followed 
up in the IMCU in a 1-year period were included in the study. The patients were 
classified as group 1 (having barotrauma) and group 2 (without barotrauma). The 
rate of barotrauma was 8.1% (n = 23, group 1). PX developed on the right 
hemithorax in 12 (70.6%) patients. Group 1 had statistically significantly 
higher 28-day mortality rates compared with group 2 (p = 0.014). The eosinophil 
and d-dimer levels of the patients in group 1 were higher, while C-reactive 
protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and albumin levels were lower than Group 2 (p &lt; 
0.001, p = 0.017, p = 0.001, p &lt; 0.001), and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The 
similar rates of NIMV administration in our study groups support that barotrauma 
is not the only mechanism in the development of PX/PM. The findings of high 
blood eosinophil count and low blood levels of CRP, albumin, and fibrinogen in 
the barotrauma group of our study might be a pathfinder for future studies."
69,"We describe our institutional experience of developing a liquid biopsy approach 
using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis for personalized medicine in cancer 
patients, focusing on the hurdles encountered during the multistep process in 
order to benefit other investigators wishing to set up this type of study in 
their institution. Blood samples were collected at the time of cancer surgery 
from 209 patients with one of nine different cancer types. Extracted tumor DNA 
and circulating cell-free DNA were sequenced using cancer-specific panels and 
the Illumina MiSeq machine. Almost half of the pairs investigated were 
uninformative, mostly because there was no trackable pathogenic mutation 
detected in the original tumor. The pairs with interpretable data corresponded 
to 107 patients. Analysis of 48 gene sequences common to both panels was 
performed and revealed that about 40% of these pairs contained at least one 
driver mutation detected in the DNA extracted from plasma. Here, we describe the 
choice of our overall approach, the selection of the cancer panels, and the 
difficulties encountered during the multistep process, including the use of 
several tumor types and in the data analysis. We also describe some case reports 
using longitudinal samples, illustrating the potential advantages and rewards in 
performing ctDNA sequencing to monitor tumor burden or guide treatment for 
cancer patients."
70,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis in patients after cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary 
bypass (CPB) has a high rate of mortality. We sought to determine whether 
changes in lipidomics can predict sepsis after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: We used high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass 
spectrometry to explore global lipidome changes in samples from a prospective 
case-control cohort (30 sepsis vs. 30 nonsepsis) hospitalized with 
cardiovascular surgery. All patients were sampled before and within 48-72 h 
after surgery. A bioinformatic pipeline was applied to acquire reliable features 
and MS/MS-driven identifications. Furthermore, a multiple-step machine learning 
framework was performed for signature discovery and performance evaluation.
RESULTS: Compared with preoperative samples, 94 features were upregulated and 
282 features were downregulated in the postoperative samples of the sepsis 
group, and 73 features were upregulated and 265 features were downregulated in 
the postoperative samples of the nonsepsis group. ""Autophagy"", ""pathogenic 
Escherichia coli infection"" and ""glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor 
biosynthesis"" pathways were significantly enriched in the pathway enrichment 
analysis. A multistep machine learning framework further confirmed that two 
cholesterol esters, CE (18:0) and CE (16:0), were significantly decreased in the 
sepsis group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, oleamide and stearamide were increased 
significantly in the postoperative sepsis group (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed characteristic lipidomic changes in the plasma 
of septic patients before and after cardiac surgery with CPB. We discovered two 
cholesterol esters and two amides from peripheral blood that could be promising 
signatures for sepsis within a dynamic detection between the preoperative and 
postoperative groups."
71,"BACKGROUND: The present study was devoted to the search for possible 
associations between various adipokines/cytokines associated with the secretory 
activity of visceral adipocytes, elevated blood levels of LDL-C and abdominal 
obesity in people under 45 years.
METHODS: A population sample of Novosibirsk residents (n = 1415) was divided 
into deciles based on the levels of LDL-C. The study included 158 people, 87 men 
and 71 women, who had serum LDL-C levels of ≥4.2 mmol/L. Abdominal obesity was 
found in 50% of people (54% men, 45% women). By multiplex analysis using the 
human metabolic hormone V3 panel and the human adipokine magnetic bead panel, 
levels of adipokines and inflammatory markers were determined on a Luminex 
MAGPIX flow fluorimeter.
RESULTS: According to multivariate regression analysis (binary logistic 
regression), the most significant biomolecules, regardless of other factors, 
associated with the presence of AO against the background of hyper-LDL-C in 
young people were leptin (direct association) and lipocalin-2 (reverse 
association), leptin in young men (direct association), and leptin and TNF-alpha 
in women (direct association).
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in young people under 45 years with the presence of two 
important, potentially atherogenic risk factors-hyper-LDL-C and abdominal 
obesity-a complex of adipokines and metabolic hormones were associated with the 
presence of these diseases."
72,"Distal femur reaming-free total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was reported to possess 
lower risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
than conventional TKA in a retrospective population-based study. We tried to 
offer prospective biological evidence by comparing the levels of AMI and VTE 
serum surrogate markers among the patients undertaking navigation and 
conventional TKAs to support these observations. Thirty-four participants 
undertaking navigation TKA and 34 patients receiving conventional TKA were 
recruited between February 2013 and December 2015. Blood samples were drawn from 
all participants before TKA, and 24 and 72 h after TKA, to assess the 
concentration of soluble P-selectin, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), 
C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) between the participants 
undergoing navigation and conventional TKAs. We showed that significantly lower 
serum levels of soluble P-selectin 24 h after, as well as CRP 24 and 72 h after 
TKA could be observed in the navigation cohort. The more prominent surge of 
serum soluble P-selectin and CRP were perceived 24 and 72 h after TKA among the 
participants undergoing conventional TKA. Based upon our prospective biological 
evidence, the merits of navigation TKA are strengthened by lower levels of AMI 
and VTE serum surrogate markers."
73,"INTRODUCTION: Few of us are skilled lipreaders while most struggle with the 
task. Neural substrates that enable comprehension of connected natural speech 
via lipreading are not yet well understood.
METHODS: We used a data-driven approach to identify brain areas underlying the 
lipreading of an 8-min narrative with participants whose lipreading skills 
varied extensively (range 6-100%, mean = 50.7%). The participants also listened 
to and read the same narrative. The similarity between individual participants' 
brain activity during the whole narrative, within and between conditions, was 
estimated by a voxel-wise comparison of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent 
(BOLD) signal time courses.
RESULTS: Inter-subject correlation (ISC) of the time courses revealed that 
lipreading, listening to, and reading the narrative were largely supported by 
the same brain areas in the temporal, parietal and frontal cortices, precuneus, 
and cerebellum. Additionally, listening to and reading connected naturalistic 
speech particularly activated higher-level linguistic processing in the parietal 
and frontal cortices more consistently than lipreading, probably paralleling the 
limited understanding obtained via lip-reading. Importantly, higher lipreading 
test score and subjective estimate of comprehension of the lipread narrative was 
associated with activity in the superior and middle temporal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Our new data illustrates that findings from prior studies using 
well-controlled repetitive speech stimuli and stimulus-driven data analyses are 
also valid for naturalistic connected speech. Our results might suggest an 
efficient use of brain areas dealing with phonological processing in skilled 
lipreaders."
74,"Patients with neurological comorbidities are more likely to develop severe 
COVID-19. We aimed to detect the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with spontaneous 
intracerebral hemorrhage comorbidity and the role of enoxaparin in decreasing 
the mortality rate in these cases, even though enoxaparin is a potential cause 
of intracerebral hemorrhage. The patients were checked on to detect surveillance 
outcomes, the relationship between mortality and patient characteristics, and 
the relationship between enoxaparin and study outcomes. Chest condition and GCS 
improved in 67.9% of participants. Hematoma course increased in 49.1%. 
Midline-shift, brain-edema, and COVID symptoms improved in 67.9%. There was a 
non-significant difference in mortality regarding age and gender. There was a 
significant difference in mortality regarding treatment with enoxaparin; 75% of 
the patients who did not receive enoxaparin died. 92.6% of the patients who 
showed decreases in hematoma course were administered enoxaparin. 76.9% of the 
patients who showed increases in hematoma-course were administered enoxaparin. 
Most of the patients who were admitted to the neurosurgical unit with 
spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage acquired the COVID-19 infection. Most of 
the cases included in this study did not progress to severe cases. The dying 
patients showed deterioration in both neurological and COVID-19 symptoms. The 
anticoagulant properties of enoxaparin given earlier before and throughout the 
infection can considerably reduce mortality in COVID-19 individuals with 
spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. It is recommended to use enoxaparin for 
cases with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 regardless of 
hematoma size because the rate of improvement was greater than the mortality 
rate after using enoxaparin in this study."
75,"The ""Blood pressure levels, clinical features and markers of subclinical 
cardiovascular Damage of Asthma patients"" (BADA) study is aimed at defining the 
cardiovascular risk profile and the markers of subclinical and clinical vascular 
and cardiac damage in asthmatic patients. Very few studies have assessed 
asthmatic patients without concomitant heart disease through a transthoracic 
echocardiogram. The goal of the present study is to investigate the prevalence 
of morphology and/or function changes in the cardiac chambers of a sample of 86 
patients with chronic asthma, referred to the dedicated outpatient unit of the 
Division of Respiratory Diseases of the AOUP ""P. Giaccone"" of the University of 
Palermo, and the results obtained were compared with those of a control group 
without respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. Patients with asthma showed a 
marked and widespread involvement of the four cardiac chambers compared with the 
controls: enlargement of the two atria, greater left ventricular remodeling with 
interventricular septal thickening, increased indexed left ventricular mass with 
a significantly greater percentage of patients with overt left ventricular 
hypertrophy, worse left ventricular diastolic function proven by the significant 
difference in the E/A ratio, and worse right ventricular systolic function with 
global right ventricular dysfunction estimated by the Myocardial Performance 
Index (Tei Index). Multivariate regression analysis, after adjustment for 
essential hypertension, hypertension severity, diabetes, Body Mass Index, and 
creatinine clearance, seems to indicate that the indexed left ventricular mass, 
right atrial volume, and right ventricular Tei index (but not left ventricular 
hypertrophy) correlate significantly with asthma, severe asthma, and FEV1 (and 
to a lesser extent with asthma duration). No correlation is apparent between 
inhaled therapy (ICS, SABA) and myocardial involvement. These results seem to 
confirm that a more in-depth cardiovascular evaluation in patients with chronic 
respiratory disease allows the identification of unrecognized cardiovascular 
involvement. A transthoracic echocardiogram performed in asthmatic patients 
without clinically overt signs or symptoms of cardiovascular impairment has 
identified some features indicative of an early subclinical cardiac impairment 
not found in the control group. These findings, considering also the higher 
frequency of hypertension in the asthma group, deserve further validation in the 
future."
76,"OBJECTIVES: Interstitial pneumonia is a severe complication induced by the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Several 
treatments have been proposed alone or, more often, in combination, depending, 
also, on the presence of other organ disfunction. The most frequently related, 
well-described, and associated phenomenon is pan-lymphopenia with circulating, 
high levels of cytokines. We report, here, on two patients with COVID-19 and 
lymphoproliferative disorders treated with Tocilizumab (a humanized monoclonal 
antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor) and followed by an [18F]FDG PET/CT 
to early evaluate the therapy's efficacy.
METHODS: One patient with angioimmunoblastic T-lymphoma (A), one with Hodgkin 
lymphoma (A), and both with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and with similar 
clinical findings of interstitial pneumonia at the CT scan, were imaged by 
[18F]FDG PET/CT before and 14 days after a single dose of Tocilizumab.
RESULTS: In both patients, the basal [18F]FDG PET/CT showed a diffused lung 
parenchyma uptake, corresponding to the hyperdense areas at the CT scan. After 2 
weeks of a Tocilizumab infusion, patient B had an improvement of symptoms, with 
normalization of the [18F]FDG uptake. By contrast, patient A, who was still 
symptomatic, showed a persisting and abnormal distribution of [18F]FDG. 
Interestingly, both patients showed a low bone marrow uptake of [18F]FDG at the 
diagnosis and after 15 days, while the spleen uptake was low only in lymphopenic 
patient A; both are indirect signs of an immune deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in these two patients, interstitial pneumonia was 
efficiently treated with Tocilizumab, as demonstrated by the [18F]FDG PET/CT. 
Our results confirm that interleukin-6 (IL6) has a role in the COVID-19 disease 
and that anti-cytokine treatment can also be performed in patients with 
lymphoproliferative disorders."
77,"COVID-19 causes not only severe respiratory symptoms, but also long-term 
sequelae, even if the acute-phase symptoms are minor. Neurological and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms are emerging as major long-term sequalae. In patients 
with pre-existing behavioral symptoms, such as individuals with autism spectrum 
disorders (ASD), the emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms due to long COVID 
can be difficult to diagnose and manage. Herein, we present three ASD cases who 
presented with markedly worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 
exposure and subsequent difficulty in managing the post-COVID neuropsychiatric 
symptoms. Case 1 contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic 
and treatment targeting COVID-19-induced immune activation was delayed. Case 2 
was asymptomatic in the acute stage of a confirmed COVID-19 exposure, but still 
developed significant neuropsychiatric symptoms. Case 3 demonstrated a difficult 
course, partly due to pre-existing immune dysregulation and prior use of 
multiple immunomodulating agents. In cases 1 and 3 for whom serial blood samples 
were obtained, notable changes in the production of inflammatory and 
counter-regulatory cytokines by peripheral blood monocytes were observed. The 
presented cases illustrate the profound effects of COVID-19 on neuropsychiatric 
symptoms in ASD subjects and the difficulty of managing long-COVID symptoms."
78,"The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) is a crucial 
phenomenon for understanding the pathophysiological characteristics of blood 
vasculature and microenvironments in solid tumors. It is also an essential 
concept for designing anticancer drugs that can be selectively delivered into 
tumor tissue via the unique extravasation and retention mechanism for 
macromolecular drugs. As tumor vasculature is highly heterogeneous, the 
intensities of the EPR effect vary according to the types and locations of solid 
tumors in different species. However, the EPR effect is universally observed in 
a broad spectrum of solid tumors in human cancer as well as experimental animal 
tumor models. The matter is how to utilize the EPR effect for drug design and 
clinical application. Many hypotheses were proposed and tested to enhance the 
EPR effect in solid tumors in order to increase the efficacy of drug delivery. 
However, we should focus on increasing the blood flow in tumors so that more 
drugs can be perfused and accumulated inside tumor tissue and execute anticancer 
activities. Angiotensin II co-administration and the approach of intratumor 
arterial infusion should be considered to achieve selective tumor tissue 
perfusion for nanodrugs."
79,"BACKGROUND: Mental and physical health are both important for overall health. 
Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being; however, 
it is often difficult to monitor remotely. The objective of this scoping review 
is to investigate studies that focus on mental health and stress detection and 
monitoring using PPG-based wearable sensors.
METHODS: A literature review for this scoping review was conducted using the 
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) 
framework. A total of 290 studies were found in five medical databases (PubMed, 
Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science). Studies were deemed eligible if 
non-invasive PPG-based wearables were worn on the wrist or ear to measure vital 
signs of the heart (heart rate, pulse transit time, pulse waves, blood pressure, 
and blood volume pressure) and analyzed the data qualitatively.
RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria, with four real-life 
studies, eighteen clinical studies, and one joint clinical and real-life study. 
Out of the twenty-three studies, seventeen were published as journal-based 
articles, and six were conference papers with full texts. Because most of the 
articles were concerned with physiological and psychological stress, we decided 
to only include those that focused on stress. In twelve of the twenty articles, 
a PPG-based sensor alone was used to monitor stress, while in the remaining 
eight papers, a PPG sensor was used in combination with other sensors.
CONCLUSION: The growing demand for wearable devices for mental health monitoring 
is evident. However, there is still a significant amount of research required 
before wearable devices can be used easily and effectively for such monitoring. 
Although the results of this review indicate that mental health monitoring and 
stress detection using PPG is possible, there are still many limitations within 
the current literature, such as a lack of large and diverse studies and 
ground-truth methods, that need to be addressed before wearable devices can be 
globally useful to patients."
80,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a key role in cancer, 
influencing growth, proliferation, and survival of tumor cells. PIK3CA mutations 
are generally oncogenic and responsible for uncontrolled cellular growth. PI3K 
inhibitors (PI3Ki) can inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, although burdened by 
not easily manageable toxicity. Among PI3Ki, alpelisib, a selective p110α 
inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- PIK3CA 
mutant metastatic breast cancer (BC) that has progressed to a first line 
endocrine therapy. PIK3CA mutations are also present in triple negative BC 
(TNBC) and HER2+ BC, although the role of PI3K inhibition is not well 
established in these subtypes. In this review, we go through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway, describing most common mutations found in PI3K genes and how they can 
be detected. We describe the available biological and clinical evidence of 
PIK3CA mutations in breast cancers other than HR+/HER2-, summarizing clinical 
trials investigating PI3Ki in these subtypes."
81,"This study aimed to determine the impact of modifications in emergency 
department (ED) practices caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic on the clinical outcomes and management of patients with septic shock. 
We performed a retrospective study. Patients with septic shock who presented to 
the ED between 1 January 2018 and 19 January 2020 were allocated to the 
pre-COVID-19 group, whereas those who presented between 20 January 2020 and 31 
December 2020 were assigned to the post-COVID-19 group. We used propensity score 
matching to compare the sepsis-related interventions and clinical outcomes. The 
primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Of the 3697 patients 
included, 2254 were classified as pre-COVID-19 and 1143 as post-COVID-19. A 
total of 1140 propensity score-matched pairings were created. Overall, the 
in-hospital mortality rate was 25.5%, with no statistical difference between the 
pre- and post-COVID-19 groups (p = 0.92). In a matched cohort, the post-COVID-19 
group had delayed lactate measurement, blood culture test, and infection source 
control (all p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in time to 
antibiotics (p = 0.19) or vasopressor administration (p = 0.09) between the 
groups. Although sepsis-related interventions were delayed during the COVID-19 
pandemic, there was no significant difference in the in-hospital mortality 
between the pre- and post-COVID-19 groups."
82,"INTRODUCTION: Differential diagnostics of early-onset schizophrenia and autism 
spectrum disorders (ASD) are a problem of child psychiatry. The prognosis and 
relevant treatment are to a large degree determined by the correctness of 
diagnosis. We found earlier that leucocyte DNA of adult schizophrenia patients 
contained significantly larger copy numbers of ribosomal repeats (rDNA) coding 
for rRNA, than DNA of mentally healthy controls.
AIM: To compare the contents of ribosomal repeats in the leucocyte DNA of 
children with schizophrenia, children with ASD, and healthy age-matched controls 
to estimate the possibility of using this genetic trait in the differential 
diagnostics of the two types of disorders.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples of patients with infantile autism (A-F84.0 
according to ICD-10, N = 75) and with childhood-onset schizophrenia (SZ-F20.8 
according to ICD-10, N = 43) were obtained from the Child Psychiatry Department 
of the Mental Health Research Center. The healthy control blood samples (HC, N = 
86) were taken from the Research Centre for Medical Genetics collection. The 
recruitment of cases was based on the clinical psychopathologic approach. DNA 
was extracted from blood leukocytes with organic solvents. Nonradioactive 
quantitative hybridization technique was applied for determining the abundance 
of ribosomal repeats in the genomes. Statistical processing was performed using 
StatPlus, Statgraphics and MedCalc.
FINDINGS: DNA derived from SZ cases contained 565 ± 163 rDNA copies, which is 
significantly (p &lt; 10-6) higher than the rDNA content in ASD cases (405 ± 109 
copies) and controls (403 ± 86 copies). The HC and A groups did not differ by 
rDNA copy number (p &gt; 0.4). The genetic trait ""rDNA copy number in patient's 
genome"" can potentially be applied as an additional marker in differential 
diagnostics of childhood-onset schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders."
83,"PURPOSE: This study examined the association of microalbuminuria (MAU), as 
determined by albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), with hypertension (HTN) among 
Turkish immigrants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) living in deprived neighborhoods 
of The Hague, Netherlands.
METHODS: A total of 110 participants, physician-diagnosed with T2D, aged ≥ 30 
years were recruited from multiple sources from The Hague, Netherlands in a 
cross-sectional design. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) were measured using automated office blood pressure equipment. 
Urine albumin was measured by immunoturbidimetric assay. Urine creatinine was 
determined using the Jaffe method. MAU was defined as ACR ≥ 3.5 mg/mmol for 
females and/or ACR ≥ 2.5 mg/mmol for males.
RESULTS: MAU was present in 21% of Turkish immigrants with T2D. Adjusted 
logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of having MAU were 6.6 
times higher in hypertensive than those that were normotensive (p = 0.007; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.19, 36.4).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HTN and MAU may be assessed as a 
standard of care for T2D management for this population. Prospective studies of 
diabetes outcomes are recommended to further verify these findings."
84,"BACKGROUNDS: The purpose of this study is to present our clinical experience 
using the Ilizarov bone transfer technique and free-flap technique in the 
reconstruction of large tibial bone and soft tissue defects, including an 
evaluation of both the management of postoperative complications and long-term 
outcomes.
METHODS: From January 2010 to May 2020, 72 patients with tibia bone and soft 
tissue defects were retrospectively evaluated. Either an anterolateral thigh 
perforator flaps (ALTP) or latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flaps (LD), solely 
or in combination, were used to cover soft tissue defects. Once the flap was 
stabilized, an Ilizarov external fixator was applied to the limb. Follow-up was 
postoperatively performed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
RESULTS: Postoperatively, there were two cases of total and five of partial flap 
necrosis, and two cases of subcutaneous ulcers, which were caused by vascular 
crisis, infection, and hematoma, respectively. All the patients underwent 
Ilizarov external fixator surgery after flap recovery. A total of 16 
complications occurred, including 3 cases of simple needle tract infection 
(antibiotic treatment) and 13 cases of complications requiring reoperation. A 
correlation factor analysis revealed that the main factors affecting the healing 
time were the defect length and operative complications. All patients with 
complications treated with the vascularized iliac flap eventually healed 
completely.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ilizarov method used together with an ALTP, LD, or a 
combination thereof yields good clinical results for repairing large bone and 
soft tissue defects of the tibia, thus reducing the incidence of amputations. 
However, longer treatment times may be involved, and postoperative complications 
can occur. The vascularized iliac flap may be a suitable choice for the 
treatment of postoperative complications of this type of Ilizarov bone 
transport."
85,"INTRODUCTION: The most clinically useful concept in asthma is based on the 
intensity of treatment required to achieve good asthma control. Biomarkers to 
guide therapy are needed.
AIMS: To investigate the role of circulating levels of soluble urokinase 
plasminogen activator receptor suPAR as a marker for asthma severity.
METHODS: We recruited patients evaluated at the Asthma Clinic, University of 
Thessaly, Greece. Asthma severity and control were defined according to the GINA 
strategy and Asthma Contro Test (ACT). Anthropometrics, spirometry, fractional 
exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), suPAR, blood cell count, c-reactive protein (CRP), 
and analyses of kidney and liver function were obtained. Patients with a history 
of inflammatory, infectious, or malignant disease or other lung disease, more 
than 5 pack years of smoking history, or corticosteroid therapy were excluded.
RESULTS: We evaluated 74 asthma patients (69% female, mean age 57 ± 17 years, 
mean body mass index (BMI) 29 ± 6 kg/m2). In total, 24%, 13%, 6%, 5%, 29% and 
23% of the participants had mild well-controlled, mild uncontrolled, moderate 
well-controlled, moderate uncontrolled, severe well-controlled, and severe 
uncontrolled asthma, respectively. Overall, 67% had T2-high asthma, 26% received 
biologics (15% and 85% received omalizumab and mepolizumab, respectively), and 
34% had persistent airway obstruction. suPAR levels were significantly lower in 
asthmatics with moderate uncontrolled asthma than in patients with severe 
uncontrolled asthma without (2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 3.3 ± 0.7 ng/mL, p = 0.023) or with 
biologics (2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 3.6 ± 0.8 ng/mL, p = 0.029). No correlations were found 
between suPAR levels and age, BMI, T2 biomarkers, CRP, or spirometric 
parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: suPAR levels were higher in asthmatics with severe disease than in 
those with moderate uncontrolled asthma."
86,"Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction has become an important strategy for tumor 
therapy, which has shown outstanding therapeutic effects in clinical settings. 
However, unsatisfactory response rates and immune-related adverse effects limit 
the use of anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies. Here, we report the discovery and 
identification of S4-1, an innovative small-molecule inhibitor of PD-L1. In 
vitro, S4-1 effectively altered the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction, induced PD-L1 
dimerization and internalization, improved its localization to endoplasmic 
reticulum, and thus enhanced the cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells toward tumor cells. In vivo, S4-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth in 
both lung and colorectal cancer models, particularly in colorectal cancer, where 
it led to complete clearance of a portion of the tumor cells. Furthermore, S4-1 
induced T-cell activation and inversed the inhibitory tumor microenvironment, 
consistent with the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway blockade. These data support the 
continued evaluation of S4-1 as an alternative ICB therapeutic strategy."
87,"OBJECTIVES: Inotodiol has been proven to have antitumor, antiviral, 
anti-inflammatory, and antiallergic properties. This study investigated the 
immunomodulatory capability of inotodiol in allergic rhinitis mice.
METHODS: Forty BALB/c mice were divided into four groups, 10 mice each: control 
(CON), allergic rhinitis with PBS treatment (AR), inotodiol treatment (AR+Ino), 
and dexamethasone treatment (AR+Dex). Episodes of sneezing and nose rubbing were 
counted. Cytokines in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) and immunoglobulin in blood serum 
were measured. Nasal mucosae from each group were used for protein, RT-PCR, and 
histological analyses. Splenocytes were cultured for evaluation of cytokine 
production in each group.
RESULTS: Symptoms of rubbing and sneezing improved in the group of AR+Ino and 
AR+Dex than in the AR. NLF in the AR+Ino and AR+Dex also showed a significant 
decrease in interleukin (IL)-5, IL-10, and IL-13 compared to the AR. In 
addition, the number of eosinophils, goblet cells, and mast cells were notably 
lower in the nasal mucosae of the AR+Ino and AR+Dex. IL-4 and IL-17A in the 
AR+Ino and AR+Dex groups were decreased compared to the AR. Chemokines related 
to mast cell degradation were also decreased in the AR+Ino and AR+Dex groups. 
Total immunoglobulin (Ig)E, specific IgE and OVA-specific IgG1, and histamine 
levels were also significantly lower in the AR+Ino and AR+Dex groups. IL-10 and 
IL-13 were notably increased in the splenocytes of the AR after OVA stimulation, 
while the other groups showed no change.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate inotodiol can help suppress allergic 
responses by immunomodulation activities. This article is protected by

88,"Macrophages, critical components of bone marrow microenvironment, are reported 
to be remodeled into leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs) in leukemic 
microenvironment where they contribute to leukemia development, characterized as 
M2 macrophages with pro-tumor effects. However, how leukemic microenvironment 
transforms macrophages into LAMs remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the clinical 
relevance of LAMs and profiled their RNA-Seq from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
patients with complete remission (CR) after induction treatment and refractory 
AML patients. Our results showed that the proportion and number of LAMs in 
refractory AML patients was higher than that in CR patients and LAM was a poor 
prognostic factor of AML patients. Furthermore, let-7b was a potentially 
aberrant gene in LAMs contributed to M2-subtype characteristics. Knockdown of 
let-7b in LAMs could inhibit the development of AML by repolarizing LAMs towards 
M1-subtype characteristics through the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 
and NF-κB pathway. Our study provides insight for future LAM-based immunotherapy 
strategies for AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
89,"BACKGROUND: There remain few efficacious treatments for bipolar depression, 
which dominates the course of bipolar disorder (BD). Despite multiple studies 
reporting associations between depression and cerebral blood flow (CBF), little 
is known regarding CBF as a treatment target, or predictor and/or indicator of 
treatment response, in BD. Nitrous oxide, an anesthetic gas with vasoactive and 
putative antidepressant properties, has a long history as a neuroimaging probe. 
We undertook an experimental medicine paradigm, coupling in-scanner 
single-session nitrous oxide treatment of bipolar depression with repeated 
measures of CBF.
METHODS: In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 25 adults with BD 
I/II and current treatment-refractory depression received either: 1) nitrous 
oxide (20 minutes at 25% concentration) plus intravenous saline (n=12), or 2) 
medical air plus intravenous midazolam (2mg total; n=13). Study outcomes 
included changes in depression severity (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating 
Scale scores, primary) and changes in CBF (via arterial spin labeling magnetic 
resonance imaging).
RESULTS: There were no significant between-group differences in 24-hour 
post-treatment MADRS change or treatment response. However, the nitrous oxide 
group had significantly greater same-day reductions in depression severity. 
Lower baseline regional CBF predicted greater 24-hour post-treatment MADRS 
reductions with nitrous oxide but not midazolam. In region-of-interest and 
voxel-wise analyses, there was a pattern of regional CBF reductions following 
treatment with midazolam vs. nitrous oxide.
CONCLUSIONS: Present findings, while tentative and based on secondary endpoints, 
suggest differential associations of nitrous oxide vs. midazolam with bipolar 
depression severity and cerebral hemodynamics. Larger studies integrating 
neuroimaging targets and repeated nitrous oxide treatment sessions are 
warranted."
90,"The somatic hypermutation (SHM) status of the clonotypic, rearranged 
immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene is an established prognostic and 
predictive marker in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Analysis of SHM is 
generally performed by PCR-amplification of clonal IGHV-IGHDIGHJ gene 
rearrangements followed by sequencing to identify IGHV gene sequences and 
germline identity. Targeted-hybridisation next-generation sequencing (NGS) can 
simultaneously assess clonality and other genetic aberrations, however it has 
limitations for SHM analysis due to sequence similarity between different IGHV 
genes and mutations introduced by SHM, which can affect alignment efficiency and 
accuracy. We have developed a novel SHM assessment strategy using a 
targeted-hybridisation NGS approach (EuroClonality-NDC assay) and applied it to 
331 samples of lymphoproliferative disorder (LPDs). Our strategy focuses on 
analysing the sequence downstream to the clonotypic, rearranged IGHJ gene up to 
the IGHM enhancer (IGHJ-E) which provides more accurate alignment. Overall, 
84/95 (88.4%) CLL cases with conventional SHM data showed concordant SHM status, 
increasing to 91.6% when excluding borderline cases. Additionally, IGHJ-E 
mutation analysis in a wide range of pre- and post-germinal centre LPD showed 
significant correlation with differentiation and lineage status, suggesting that 
IGHJ-E analysis is a promising surrogate marker enabling SHM to be reported 
using NGS-capture strategies and whole genome sequencing."
91,"Androgens have been reported to elongate telomeres in retrospective and 
prospective trials with patients with telomeropathies, mainly with bone marrow 
failure. In our single-arm prospective clinical trial, 17 patients with short 
telomeres and/or germline pathogenic variants in telomere-biology genes 
associated with at least one cytopenia and/or radiologic diagnosis of ILD were 
treated with 5 mg/kg of intramuscular nandrolone decanoate every 15 days for 2 
years. Ten of 13 evaluable patients (77%) showed telomere elongation at 12 
months by flow-FISH (average increase, 0.87 kb; 95% CI, 0.20-1.55 kb; p=0.01). 
At 24 months, all 10 evaluable patients showed telomere elongation (average 
increase, 0.49 kb; 95% CI, 0.24-1.23 kb; p=0.18). Hematologic response was 
achieved in 8/16 patients (50%) with marrow failure at 12 months, and in 10/16 
patients (63%) at 24 months. Seven patients had ILD at baseline, and two and 
three had pulmonary response at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Two patients 
died due to pulmonary failure during treatment. In the remaining evaluable 
patients, the pulmonary function remained stable or improved, but showed 
consistent decline after cessation of treatment. Somatic mutations in myeloid 
neoplasm-related genes were present in a minority of patients and were mostly 
stable during drug treatment. The most common adverse events (AE) were 
elevations in liver function test levels in 88%, acne in 59%, and virilization 
in 59%. No AE grade ≥ 4 was observed. Our findings indicate that nandrolone 
decanoate elongates telomeres in patients with telomeropathies, which correlated 
with clinical improvement in some cases and tolerable adverse events.

92,"OBJECTIVES: In open structure MPI systems, the nonlinear variation of the field 
free lines in the large region of interest scanning process distorts the x-space 
image reconstruction. In this study, we propose a nonlinear field free line 
projection reconstruction algorithm to solve the edge distortion problem of open 
structure MPI imaging.
METHODS: First, we calculate the curvature change law of the field free line in 
the scanning process. Then, we design a nonlinear back projection reconstruction 
algorithm according to the nonlinear characteristics of the field free line in 
the scanning process. Finally, the nonlinear back projection reconstruction 
algorithm is used to complete the tomography of blood vessels.
RESULTS: The numerical calculation and simulation results show that the open 
structure MPI combined with a nonlinear back projection reconstruction algorithm 
can accomplish vascular fault reconstruction. The reconstruction algorithm 
proposed in this paper suppresses the edge distortion of the image and improves 
the positioning accuracy of the image. The size of the region of interest where 
distortions are low is increased 16 times by allowing 10.9% degradation in the 
gradient.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a non-linear inverse projection reconstruction algorithm 
to reduce the structural artefacts caused by FFL distortion. It provides a 
reconstruction scheme for a large region of interest fine imaging of open 
structure FFL-MPI."
93,"OBJECTIVE: Despite successful endovascular therapy, a proportion of stroke 
patients exhibit long-term functional decline, regardless of the cortical 
reperfusion. Our objective was to evaluate the early activation of the adaptive 
immune response and its impact on neurological recovery in patients with large 
vessel occlusion (LVO).
METHODS: Nineteen (13 females, 6 males) patients with acute LVO were enrolled in 
a single-arm prospective cohort study. During endovascular therapy (EVT), blood 
samples were collected from pre and post-occlusion, distal femoral artery, and 
median cubital vein (controls). Cytokines, chemokines, cellular and functional 
profiles were evaluated with immediate and follow-up clinical and radiographic 
parameters, including cognitive performance and functional recovery.
RESULTS: In the hyperacute phase (within hours), adaptive immune activation was 
observed in the post-occlusion intra-arterial environment (post). Ischemic 
vascular tissue had a significant increase in T-cell-related cytokines, 
including IFN-γ and MMP-9, while GM-CSF, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-1a, and MIP-1b 
were decreased. Cellularity analysis revealed an increase in inflammatory IL-17+ 
and GM-CSF+ helper T-cells, while natural killer (NK), monocytes and B-cells 
were decreased. A correlation was observed between hypoperfused tissue, infarct 
volume, inflammatory helper, and cytotoxic T-cells. Moreover, helper and 
cytotoxic T-cells were also significantly increased in patients with improved 
motor function at 3 months.
INTERPRETATION: We provide evidence of the activation of the inflammatory 
adaptive immune response during the hyperacute phase and the association of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines with greater ischemic tissue and worsening recovery 
after successful reperfusion. Further characterization of these immune pathways 
is warranted to test selective immunomodulators during the early stages of 
stroke rehabilitation."
94,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of computed 
tomography-guided localization needle (LN) and methylene blue (MB) for pulmonary 
nodule localization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2019 and January 2022, 547 patients 
underwent computed tomography-guided LN (n=171) or MB (n=376) localization and 
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) resection.
RESULTS: In total, 171 and 376 nodules were localized via LN and MB, 
respectively, with respective technical localization success rates of 92.98 % 
and 88.56 % (p = 0.111). The pulmonary nodule localization time was 
significantly shorter for the MB group than for the LN group (p < 0.05). 
However, the rates of total complication, chest pain, and cough were 
significantly lower in the LN group (c2 = 8.251/25.092/5.127, all p < 0.05). 
Furthermore, the LN group had a shorter VATS time than the MB group (p < 0.05). 
The VATS achieved a 100% operation success rate in both groups, and there was no 
significance between groups with respect to the types of surgery (p ＞ 0.05) or 
the blood loss (p ＞ 0.05). Moreover, logistic regression analysis showed that 
the localization technique was an independent risk factor for total 
complications and chest pain.
CONCLUSION: Both techniques can effectively localize pulmonary nodules before 
VATS. MB had a shorter localization time, but the LN had a shorter VATS time and 
a lower incidence of complications, especially chest pain."
95,"The human lifespan is increasing, and mankind is aging. It is estimated that, 
until the year 2050, this population worldwide will reach 22% of the total world 
population. Along with aging, the human immunologic system changes, a process 
called immunosenescence or even inflammaging. The aging immune system increases 
mortality and morbidity in the elderly mainly because it loses its capacity to 
react against internal and external aggressions. There is a decrease in B and T 
lymphocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes lose the CD28 protein expression that is needed 
for co-stimulation, leading to reduced response to viral infections. This could 
be responsible for more deleterious consequences of coronavirus disease 
infection in the elderly. Besides that, the human brain ages, being more 
susceptible to damage and viral infections, such as COVID-19 infection. There 
are several pathways that could explain the susceptibility to the COVID-19 
infection in the elderly brain, one of them is binding to ACE 2 receptors in 
cerebral cells through the spike protein. It has been reported that glial cells 
and neurons, in addition to endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells in the 
brain, express the ACE 2 receptor, which would justify the neurological symptoms 
and consequences of the disease. This infection can have several clinical 
manifestations such as hemorrhagic stroke, delirium and long-term cognitive 
complaints, such as brain fog, polyneuropathies, short time memory complaints 
and insomnia. Although none of the studies could prove that there is a long-term 
neuronal damage, there are clinical sequelae that should be taken into account 
and more studies are necessary to know the consequences of the infection in the 
elderly brain."
96,"AIM: The primary aim of the study is to describe the variation in the operative 
and non-operative management of emergency presentations of colon and rectal 
cancer in an international cohort. Secondary aims will be to develop a risk 
prediction model for mortality and primary anastomosis and validate risk 
criteria of large bowel obstruction in patients with previously known colorectal 
cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy or awaiting elective surgery.
METHOD: This prospective, multicentre audit will be conducted via the student- 
and trainee-led EuroSurg Collaborative network internationally over 2023 with 
90-day follow-up. Data will be collected on consecutive adult patients 
presenting to the hospital in an unplanned and urgent manner with colorectal 
cancer (CRC) due to malignant large bowel obstruction (LBO), perforation, 
CRC-related haemorrhage, or other related reasons. Primary outcome is 90-day 
mortality. Secondary outcomes include rates of stomas, primary anastomosis, 
stenting, preoperative imaging, and complications or readmissions.
CONCLUSION: This protocol describes the methodology for the first international 
audit on the management of acutely presenting CRC. This study will utilise a 
large collaborative network with robust data validation and assurance 
strategies. APOLLO will provide a comprehensive understanding of current 
practice, develop risk prediction tools in this setting, and validate existing 
trial results."
97,"AIM: To conduct a metabolic and nutritional assessment of children with 
neuromuscular disorders, including investigation of the liver and bone mineral 
density.
METHODS: In this observational study, we included 44 children with neuromuscular 
disorders. The nutritional status, bone health, and liver were assessed by 
ultrasound, transient elastography, dual X-ray absorptiometry scan, blood 
samples, anthropometric measurements, and three-day diet registration.
RESULTS: Liver involvement was found in 31.0%: liver enlargement in 7.1%, 
steatosis in 4.8%, fibrosis in 14.3%, and liver enlargement together with 
steatosis or fibrosis was found in 4.8%. These changes were found in 9/23 
patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 4/9 patients with spinal muscular 
atrophy type II, and 0/12 patients with other neuromuscular diagnoses. Low bone 
mineral density was found in 44.0% of the patients, though the majority used 
daily vitamin D and calcium supplements. Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency 
was found in 22.6%.
CONCLUSION: The metabolic assessment in children with neuromuscular disorders 
shows an increased risk of liver enlargement, steatosis, and fibrosis. Possible 
causes are obesity, decreased mobility, low skeletal muscle mass, and for a 
subgroup the use of glucocorticoids. The findings suggest that monitoring liver 
function should be part of the nutritional assessment in patients with 
neuromuscular disorders."
98,"α-gal syndrome (AGS) is caused by the intake of products containing α-gal 
(galactose-α-1,3-galactose) like mammalian meat. Over the last decade, 
scientific literature about AGS has been increasing, but the true burden of 
cases is still unknown [1, 2]. In the USA (University of Virginia Allergy 
Clinic), the number of confirmed cases of AGS was 24 in 2009 [3] and increased 
to 34,000 in the entire USA by 2019 [4]. As shown in surveys, in Italy AGS is 
present throughout the country [5]. The literature suggests that a previous tick 
bite can cause AGS, but in our case it was not possible to demonstrate this 
association as the patient did not recall any tick bite, even in childhood. 
After eating red meat, a 56-year-old male patient had developed symptoms such as 
a generalized urticaria, diarrhea, and faintness, requiring admission to the 
Emergency Department. The diagnosis was verified using blood CAP-FEIA test and 
prick-to-prick test. After completing the diagnostic process, we provided the 
patient with emergency therapy, and auto-injectable adrenaline was prescribed. 
Despite the diagnosis, the patient ate red meat once again which resulted in 
severe urticaria 2 hours after the meal, requiring a second visit to the 
Emergency Room. Now the patient is under follow-up at our Department of Allergy 
and Clinical Immunology."
99,"OBJECTIVE: to describe a case of severe sepsis and complicated bacteremia caused 
by Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and review similar cases in the literature.
CASE SUMMARY: A 26-year-old gentleman with a history of epilepsy presented with 
symptoms of sore throat, productive cough, periumbilical abdominal pain, watery 
diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, subjective fevers along with progressive jaundice 
for seven days. The patient had acute fulminant liver failure, septic shock, and 
Multi-organ failure. He required vasopressors, underwent intubation, and had 
grown Arcanobacterium haemolyticum in the blood and Bronchoalveolar lavage 
samples. He developed a peritonsillar abscess and cavitary pneumonia and 
required chest tube drainage followed by thoracotomy for hemothorax. The patient 
improved on Ampicillin-Sulbactam treatment and was treated with a total 
antibiotic duration of 6 weeks. He fully improved on post-discharge follow-up.
DISCUSSION: Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a Gram-positive (sometimes Gram 
variable), catalase-negative facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, 
non-spore-forming, and variably β-hemolytic and is known to be a cause of 
pharyngitis and skin and soft tissue infections. Rarely A. Haemolyticum can be 
associated with severe systemic infections such as infective endocarditis, 
systemic abscesses, osteomyelitis, and septicemia. In previous literature 
reviews, the source of A. haemolyticum depended on the host, and pharyngeal and 
upper respiratory sources were likely to be associated with immunocompetent 
hosts.
CONCLUSION: A. haemolyticum should be included in the differential diagnosis of 
bacterial pharyngitis complicated by severe systemic illness. Penicillins are 
the most commonly used antibiotics for treating A. haemolyticum bacteremia, and 
macrolides can be used for Penicillin's treatment failure."
100,"Due to low incidence, there are no large prospective studies or clinical trials 
for small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the genitourinary system (GU), and most data 
are extrapolated from SCC of the lung. Using the SEER database, we analyzed 
incidence trends, overall survival, and cancer-specific survival using the 
log-rank test. Analysis of variables was performed using the Cox proportional 
hazards regression model. The analysis showed that SCC of the bladder and 
prostate were the most common types of GU SCC, with 1836 and 606 cases, 
respectively. In 2018, the incidence of SCC of the bladder and prostate was 
twice that of 2010 (P < 0.001). The overall survival and cancer-specific 
survival of patients with SCC of the bladder were significantly longer than 
those of patients with SCC of the prostate (P < 0.0001). SCC bladder patients 
with advanced age, more extensive growth, lymph node involvement, no surgical 
intervention, and the presence of the metastasis had worse survival outcomes 
(P < 0.05). The Asian/Pacific Islander race provided some survival benefits for 
patients with SCC of the bladder (P < 0.05). For patients with SCC of the 
prostate, only advanced age was a risk factor for poor outcomes (P < 0.05)."
101,"Current literature does not support routine testing for hereditary and acquired 
thrombophilia disorders in the inpatient setting. Testing in the acute setting 
rarely changes patient management or could lead to patient mismanagement. 
Despite prior educational interventions, continued overuse of inpatient testing 
warrants further quality improvement measures. A hard-stop best practice 
advisory pop-up was implemented in the electronic medical record in a 
multicenter academic hospital system to provide clinicians guidance on the 
appropriate use of thrombophilia testing at the point of care. Pre- and 
postintervention retrospective data were collected to assess clinical features 
before and after implementation. Before the intervention, 271 patients underwent 
inpatient hypercoagulability testing; after the intervention, 238 patients 
underwent inpatient hypercoagulability testing. The total number of labs ordered 
per patient decreased from 1185 to 910, a 13% reduction (P = 0.003). Overall, 
there was a savings of $23,597 in total direct cost and $123,153 in total 
charges when comparing the 6-month timeframes before and after the intervention 
(P < 0.01). Although this study found only mild reductions in thrombophilia 
testing, it presents a new means of providing point-of-care intervention and 
education for hypercoagulability testing in the inpatient setting."
102,"Inherited thrombocytopenia (IT) is a heterogeneous group of diseases with a 
genetic origin. The primary symptom presented by patients is a reduced platelet 
count in the peripheral blood. Nevertheless, certain forms of IT are 
characterized by the occurrence of other congenital malformations or 
predisposition to acquire additional diseases. Five related subjects with 
lifelong thrombocytopenia were admitted to our clinic. A total of 16 cases of 
persistent thrombocytopenia were investigated in the family history. Molecular 
and cytogenetic analysis covered MECOM, MPL, RUNX1, ETV6, and GATA1 genes, whose 
mutations are known to cause predisposing forms of IT. The laboratory testing 
revealed thrombocytopenia ranging from 19 to 65 × 109/L in the subjects. Mild 
bleeding symptoms were present in each of the subjects, while two of five had a 
history of severe hemorrhage requiring transfusion of blood products. 
Establishing a diagnosis of IT protects the patient from unnecessary treatment 
and enables the appropriate surveillance."
103,"We describe a rare case of injury to a branch of the brachial artery in a 
48-year-old man with a bicep musculotendinous injury. His presenting symptoms 
included severe pain, swelling, and paresthesias in the right upper extremity. 
Examination revealed significant soft tissue swelling with ecchymoses in the 
right upper arm with diminished palpable pulses. Imaging revealed a biceps 
muscle injury along with active arterial extravasation of a branch of the deep 
brachial artery. Interventional radiology successfully performed coil 
embolization. Bicep musculotendinous injury is typically characterized by pain, 
swelling, and decreased strength. Rarely, complications such as compartment 
syndrome have been reported. Brachial arterial injury has not been implicated in 
the setting of this entity, especially in the absence of blunt or penetrating 
trauma, until our current patient's presentation."
104,"Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm that accounts for 10% of all 
hematologic malignancies, characterized by malignant proliferation of monoclonal 
plasma cells in the bone marrow. It predominantly affects men 60 to 70 years of 
age. Plasmacytoma is a discrete mass of neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells that 
may be osseous or extramedullary. Though extramedullary plasmacytomas are 
uncommon, they can involve any tissue or organ. Only a few cases of pancreatic 
involvement have been reported. We report a case of a 78-year-old woman with a 
long-standing history of multiple myeloma noted to have pancreatic tail 
involvement with plasmacytoma with plasmablastic features. Multiple myeloma with 
plasmablastic transformation has a poor prognosis; hence, a multidisciplinary 
team approach is crucial to identify and initiate appropriate management in 
these cases."
105,"BACKGROUND: There is debate on whether uterine gauze packing or intrauterine 
balloon tamponade is safer and more effective as a surgical management option 
for treating postpartum hemorrhage.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare intra- and postoperative outcomes of 
intrauterine balloon tamponade and uterine gauze packing in patients with 
postpartum hemorrhage.
STUDY DESIGN: A range of databases such as Cochrane and PubMed were searched 
using terms including ""post-partum haemorrhage,"" ""uterine balloon tamponade,"" 
and ""uterine gauze packing."" All observational studies comparing intrauterine 
balloon tamponade with uterine gauze packing were included. Five studies were 
identified enrolling 821 adult patients diagnosed with postpartum hemorrhage. 
Primary outcomes included blood loss volume, success rates, and maternal 
mortality. Secondary outcomes comprised requiring additional interventions, 
postoperative hemoglobin levels, and requiring blood transfusions. Fixed and 
random models were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Intrauterine balloon tamponade seemed to be a superior option to 
uterine gauze packing. Intrauterine balloon tamponade was better in reducing 
intraoperative blood loss, with a statistically significant improvement 
(P<.0001). Cases managed with intrauterine balloon tamponade seemed to have 
statistically significant shorter operative time (P=.023) and hospital length of 
stay (P=.020) in one study.
CONCLUSION: Intrauterine balloon tamponade remains more effective and safer as a 
first-line surgical management option for postpartum hemorrhage compared with 
uterine gauze packing."
106,"PURPOSE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a deadly malignancy that is 
frequently diagnosed in patients with significant medical comorbidities. When 
delivering local and regional therapy, an exceedingly narrow therapeutic window 
is encountered, which often precludes patients from receiving aggressive 
curative therapy. Radiation therapy advances including particle therapy have 
been employed in an effort to expand this therapeutic window. Here we report 
outcomes with the use of proton therapy with curative intent and immunotherapy 
to treat patients diagnosed with high-risk NSCLC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were determined to be high risk if they had 
severe underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction, history of prior thoracic 
radiation therapy, and/or large volume or unfavorable location of disease (eg, 
bilateral hilar involvement, supraclavicular involvement). As such, patients 
were determined to be ineligible for conventional x-ray-based radiation therapy 
and were treated with pencil beam scanning proton beam therapy (PBS-PBT). 
Patients who demonstrated excess respiratory motion (ie, greater than 1 cm in 
any dimension noted on the 4-dimensional computed tomography simulation scan) 
were deemed to be ineligible for PBT. Toxicity was reported using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Overall survival 
and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 29 patients with high-risk NSCLC diagnoses were treated with 
PBS-PBT. The majority (55%) of patients were defined as high risk due to severe 
cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Most commonly, patients were treated definitively 
to a total dose of 6000 cGy (relative biological effectiveness) in 30 fractions 
with concurrent chemotherapy. Overall, there were a total of 6 acute grade 3 
toxicities observed in our cohort. Acute high-grade toxicities included 
esophagitis (n = 4, 14%), dyspnea (n = 1, 3.5%), and cough (n = 1, 3.5%). No 
patients developed grade 4 or higher toxicity. The majority of patients went on 
to receive immunotherapy, and high-grade pneumonitis was rare. Two-year 
progression-free and overall survival was estimated to be 51% and 67%, 
respectively. COVID-19 was confirmed or suspected to be responsible for 2 
patient deaths during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Radical PBS-PBT treatment delivered in a cohort of patients with 
high-risk lung cancer with immunotherapy is feasible with careful 
multidisciplinary evaluation and rigorous follow-up."
107,"Evidence that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease is already un-ravelling. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a 
bidirectional communication system that is not fully understood but includes 
neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. The progression of 
Alzheimer's disease is supported by mechanisms related to the imbalance in the 
gut microbiota and the development of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are at 
the origin of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in the composition of the gut 
microbiome led to dysregulation in the pathways governing this system. This 
leads to neurodegeneration through neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter 
dysregulation. Neurodegeneration and disruption of the blood-brain barrier are 
frontiers at the origin of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, bacteria populating 
the gut microbiota can secrete large amounts of amyloid proteins and 
lipopolysaccharides, which modulate signaling pathways and alter the production 
of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the pathogenesis of Alz-heimer's 
disease. Importantly, through molecular mimicry, bacterial amyloids may elicit 
cross-seeding of misfolding and induce microglial priming at different levels of 
the brain-gut-microbiota axis. The potential mechanisms of amyloid spreading 
include neuron-to-neuron or distal neuron spreading, direct blood-brain barrier 
crossing, or via other cells such as astrocytes, fibroblasts, microglia, and 
immune system cells. Gut microbiota metabolites, including short-chain fatty 
acids, pro-inflammatory factors, and neurotransmitters may also affect AD 
pathogenesis and associated cognitive decline. The purpose of this review is to 
summarize and discuss the current findings that may elucidate the role of gut 
microbiota in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the 
underlying mechanisms may provide new insights into novel therapeutic strategies 
for Alzheimer's disease, such as probiotics and targeted oligosaccharides."
108,"BACKGROUND: Despite the implementation of various cancer therapies, adequate 
therapeutic efficacy has not been achieved. A growing number of studies have 
been dedicated to the discovery of new molecules to combat refractory cancer 
cells efficiently. Recently, the use of a rare type of sugar, D-allose, has 
attracted the attention of research communities. In combination with the 
first-line treatment of cancers, including different types of radiotherapies and 
chemotherapies, D-allose has been detected with favorable complementary effects. 
Understanding the mechanism of therapeutic target molecules will enable us to 
develop new strategies for cancer patients that do not currently respond to the 
present therapies.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide a review of the effects of D-allose in cancer 
treatment, its mechanisms of action, and gaps in this field that require more 
investigations.
DISCUSSION: With rare exceptions, in many cancer types, including head and neck, 
lung, liver, bladder, blood, and breast, D-allose consistently has exhibited 
anticancer activity in vitro and/or in vivo. Most of the D-allose functions are 
mediated through thioredoxin-interacting protein molecules. D-allose exerts its 
effects via reactive oxygen species regulation, cell cycle arrest, metabolic 
reprogramming, autophagy, apoptosis induction, and sensitizing tumors to 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: D-allose has shown great promise for combating tumor cells with no 
side effects, especially in combination with first-line drugs; however, its 
potential for cancer therapy has not been comprehensively investigated in vitro 
or in vivo."
109,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can be accompanied by structural damage to 
the brain. Here, we investigated how the presence of intracranial traumatic 
computed tomography (CT) pathologies relates to the global functional outcome in 
young patients one year after mTBI. All patients with mTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale: 
13-15) ≤24 years in the multi-center, prospective, observational Collaborative 
European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) study were 
included. Patient demographics and CT findings were assessed at admission, and 
the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) was evaluated at 12 months follow-up. 
The association between a ""positive CT"" (at least one of the following: epidural 
hematoma, subdural hematoma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH), 
intraventricular hemorrhage, subdural collection mixed density, contusion, 
traumatic axonal injury) and functional outcome (GOSE) was assessed using 
multivariable mixed ordinal and logistic regression models. A total of 462 
patients with mTBI and initial brain CT from 46 study centers were included. The 
median age was 19 (17-22) years, and 322 (70%) were males. CT imaging showed a 
traumatic intracranial pathology in 171 patients (37%), most commonly tSAH 
(48h), contusions (40%), and epidural hematomas (37%). Patients with a positive 
CT scan were less likely to achieve a complete recovery 12 months post-injury. 
The presence of any CT abnormality was associated with both lower GOSE scores 
(Odds ratio (OR): 0.39 [0.24-0.63]) and incomplete recovery (GOSE <8; OR: 0.41 
[0.25-0.68]), also when adjusted for demographical and clinical baseline 
factors. The presence of intracranial traumatic CT pathologies was predictive of 
outcome 12 months after mTBI in young patients, which might help to identify 
candidates for early follow-up and additional care."
110,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of a supervised concurrent exercise-training 
program during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal birth-related outcomes and 
type of birth.
METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine Caucasian pregnant women from the GESTAFIT 
project participated in this quasi-experimental study and were allocated into 
control [(n=86), (age 33.1±4.8 years old, BMI 24.8±4.1 kg/m2)] or exercise group 
[(n=50) (age 33.1±4.1 years old, BMI: 24.7±4.1 kg/m2)]. The exercise group 
followed a 60-min 3 days/week concurrent (aerobic and strength) training program 
from the 17th gestational week until birth. Maternal and neonatal birth-related 
outcomes (i.e. gestational age at birth, duration of labour, placental and 
neonatal weight and type of birth) were collected from obstetric medical 
records. Umbilical arterial and venous blood gas analysis were assessed after 
birth.
RESULTS: The exercise group increased average duration of the first stage of 
labour [between-group differences (B): 80.8 minutes, 95% confidence interval 
(CI), 4.18, 157.31, p=0.03] and decreased duration of the second stage of labour 
[between-group differences (B): 29.8 minutes, 95% CI: -55.5, -4.17, p=0.02)] 
compared to the control group. The exercise group showed greater placental 
[between-group differences (B): 53.3 grams (95% CI: 9.99, 96.7, p=0.01)] and 
neonatal [between-group differences (B): 161.8 grams (95% CI: 9.81, 313.8, 
p=0.033)] weight compared to the control group. No differences between groups 
were found regarding type of birth (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: A concurrent and supervised physical exercise program during 
pregnancy is safe and could promote better maternal and neonatal birth-related 
outcomes. More studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which physical 
exercise increases neonatal and placenta weight."
111,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: In patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding (ANVUGIB), the optimal timing of endoscopy is still a matter of 
dispute. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the 
clinical benefit of early endoscopy.
METHODS: A literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases was 
conducted to identify publications from inception to March 1, 2022. Eligible 
studies included observational cohort studies and randomized controlled trials 
that reported clinical outcomes of endoscopy in patients with ANVUGIB. ANVUGIB 
patients who underwent endoscopy within 24 hours of admission were considered to 
have had an early endoscopy. The primary outcome was the mortality rate in 
ANVUGIB patients who had early or nonearly endoscopy.
RESULTS: The final analysis included five randomized controlled studies (RCTs) 
and 20 observational studies from the 1,206 identified articles. The mortality 
rate was not significantly reduced among patients who received endoscopy 
performed within 24 hours, whether in cohort studies nor in RCTs. For subgroup 
analysis, a higher mortality rate was found only among patients who received 
very early endoscopy within 12 hours (odds ratio, 1.66; p<0.001, I2=0) in cohort 
studies. No significant difference in mortality rates was found among patients 
at high risk of bleeding who received early versus nonearly endoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: Early endoscopy within 24 hours does not appear to significantly 
reduce the mortality rates of patients with ANVUGIB. Further well-designed 
studies are warranted to address if very early endoscopy within 12 hours can 
provide a clinical benefit for patients at high risk of bleeding."
112,"AIM: To investigate the pattern of left ventricular (LV) function and myocardial 
perfusion and their relationship in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients using 
layer-specific speckle tracking imaging (STI) and layer-specific myocardial 
contrast echocardiography (MCE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty DCM patients and 30 controls were recruited and 
underwent STI and MCE examination. The peak values of longitudinal strain (LS), 
circumferential strain (CS) of each layer of LV were recorded and compared 
between groups. Additionally, cross-sectional area of a microvessel (A) and 
average myocardial microvascular lesion (β) of each layer were measured, 
myocardial blood flow (MBF) was estimated using A × β, above parameters were 
compared between two groups.
RESULTS: The LS of endo- (LSendo ), mid- (LSmid ) and epicardium (LSepi ), as 
well as CS of endo- (RSendo ), mid- (RSmid ), (LSepi ) epicardium and LS 
endo/epi, CS endo/epi were significantly decreased in DCM patients. More 
importantly, DCM patients demonstrated decreased A, β and A × β in all three 
myocardium layers and A endo/epi, β endo/epi, A × β endo/epi compared to the 
controls. The time to peak and the cardiac cycle required to reach the peak were 
prolonged in DCM patients (p < 0.05). Longitudinal strain parameters of each 
layer had a negative relationship with perfusion parameter A and this 
relationship was strongest between LSendo and Aendo (r = 0.690, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The cardiac strain and, more importantly, coronary microcirculation 
perfusion was impaired in each layer in DCM patients. The longitudinal function 
of the LV myocardium was closely related to changes in myocardial 
microcirculation perfusion."
113,"BACKGROUND: Circumferential liposuction may cause a dilution anemia due to a 
high volume of infiltrated tumescent. Studies analyzing the percentage of 
absorbed tumescent as well as the safe limit of tumescent infiltration are 
currently lacking.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to calculate the average volume uptake of 
administered fluids in power-assisted liposuction. Furthermore, we sought to 
calculate a practical formula to determine the amount of fluid that can safely 
be administered without inducing symptomatic dilution anemia or hypervolemia.
METHODS: Patients undergoing circumferential liposuction with power-assisted 
tumescent infiltration were included in a prospective clinical study. All 
relevant administered and excreted volumes during and after the operation were 
collected. Preoperative versus postoperative hemogram results were compared and 
the hemodynamic parameters were followed for 24 hours. The average volume uptake 
was calculated based on the measured volumes, as well as the ratio between 
administered volumes and the patient's blood volume.
RESULTS: 30 patients were included during September 2021. The average volume 
uptake was 58% for a calculated 1.11 to 1 infiltration to aspiration ratio. 
There was a mean drop of 1.9 g/dl and 4.6% for the postoperative Hb and Hct, 
respectively, with a stable Red Blood Cell level. All patients remained 
hemodynamically stable without the need for blood transfusion or prolonged 
oxygen need. The average tumescent versus blood volume ratio was 85.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: In circumferential liposuction with power-assisted infiltration, 
the infiltrated tumescent volume should remain below 85% of the patient's blood 
volume to minimize the risk of a symptomatic dilution anemia or hypervolemia."
114,"In humans, exposure to electromagnetic millimeter waves (MMW) has a hypoalgesic 
effect. In animals, this effect has been shown to depend on innervation density 
of the area exposed. This study aims to assess hypoalgesic and parasympathetic 
effects of MMW applied on the palmar side of the wrist in healthy participants. 
In a within-subject design, 10 healthy participants had the palmar side of their 
wrist exposed to MMW (61.25 GHz, 17 mW/cm2) for 30 minutes, 1 h, & 1 h30, and 
30 minutes of sham exposure. Experimental pain was induced after the exposure 
sessions with the Cold Pressor Test, and pain threshold and pain tolerance 
values were compared to that of the sham condition. Participants' heart rate and 
blood pressure were measured before and after exposures. Finally, innocuity of 
the exposure system was controlled with a pre-post exposure visual examination 
scale and skin temperature measured by a thermal camera. Exposure to 30 minutes, 
but not 1 h or 1 h30, of MMW led to significant increases in pain thresholds 
compared to the sham condition, but no increase of pain tolerance. All 
conditions led to decreased heart rate, while no change in blood pressure was 
observed. No change in skin state or temperature was observed for any of the 
conditions. MMW applied on the inner part of the wrist diminish pain sensations 
more effectively than placebo, and seem to increase parasympathetic activities, 
while remaining innocuous. Building a miniaturized MMW emission system to be 
worn on the wrist would provide access to ambulatory MMW therapy for pain 
management."
115,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dual blockade of BRAF and MEK kinases is a standard of care 
for metastatic V600E/K BRAF mutant melanoma. This study reports the first 
systematic description of colitis due to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.
METHODS: We studied consecutive patients with melanoma, treated with BRAF and 
MEK inhibitors, who had colitis requiring hospitalisation. Electronic files were 
studied; endoscopic biopsies and colectomy specimens were read centrally.
RESULTS: Between January 2021 and March 2022, nine women and one man, aged 
50-90 years, were studied. Nine patients received encorafenib and binimetinib; 
one patient received dabrafenib and trametinib. The main symptoms were 
diarrhoea, haematochezia, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction. Blood tests 
showed anaemia, increased CRP and low serum albumin levels in most patients. All 
patients had ulcerations of the right colon with (2/10) or without (8/10) 
stenosis of the ileocecal valve, and 4/10 patients also had ulcerations distal 
to the right colon. Histopathological findings were suggestive of ischaemia and 
mild inflammation. Nine of the 10 patients discontinued BRAF/MEK inhibitors. 
Drugs were reintroduced in four patients, three of whom had a severe relapse of 
diarrhoea. Two patients required surgery and underwent intestinal resection. One 
patient died of enterocolitis.
CONCLUSION: BRAF/MEK inhibitors can induce severe colitis characterised by 
ulcerations of the right colon."
116,"BACKGROUND: The Harambee study is a cluster randomized trial in Western Kenya 
that tests the effect, mechanisms, and cost-effectiveness of integrating 
community-based HIV and non-communicable disease care within microfinance groups 
on chronic disease treatment outcomes. This paper documents the stages of our 
feasibility study conducted in preparation for the Harambee trial, which include 
(1) characterizing the target population and gauging recruitment capacity, (2) 
determining community acceptability of the integrated intervention and study 
procedures, and (3) identifying key implementation considerations prior to study 
start.
METHODS: Feasibility research took place between November 2019 and February 2020 
in Western Kenya. Mixed methods data collection included surveys administered to 
115 leaders of 105 community-based microfinance groups, 7 in-person meetings and 
two workshops with stakeholders from multiple sectors of the health system, and 
ascertainment of field notes and geographic coordinates for group meeting 
locations and HIV healthcare facilities. Quantitative survey data were analyzed 
using STATA IC/13. Longitude and latitude coordinates were mapped to county 
boundaries using Esri ArcMap. Qualitative data obtained from stakeholder 
meetings and field notes were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Of the 105 surveyed microfinance groups, 77 met eligibility criteria. 
Eligible groups had been in existence from 6 months to 18 years and had an 
average of 22 members. The majority (64%) of groups had at least one member who 
owned a smartphone. The definition of ""active"" membership and model of saving 
and lending differed across groups. Stakeholders perceived the community-based 
intervention and trial procedures to be acceptable given the minimal risks to 
participants and the potential to improve HIV treatment outcomes while 
facilitating care integration. Potential challenges identified by stakeholders 
included possible conflicts between the trial and existing community-based 
interventions, fear of group disintegration prior to trial end, clinicians' 
inability to draw blood for viral load testing in the community, and deviations 
from standard care protocols.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that it was feasible to recruit the number of 
microfinance groups necessary to ensure that our clinical trial was sufficient 
powered. Elicitation of stakeholder feedback confirmed that the planned 
intervention was largely acceptable and was critical to identifying challenges 
prior to implementation.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The original trial was prospectively registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04417127) on 4 June 2020."
117,"PURPOSE: Angiogenesis is involved in many pathological and physiological 
processes and is mainly driven by hypoxia. Karyopherin subunit alpha 2 (KPNA2), 
a member of the nuclear transport protein family, was recently shown to be 
induced by hypoxia in various types of tumours, so we aimed to investigate the 
role and mechanism of KPNA2 in angiogenesis under hypoxia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After overexpression or knockdown of KPNA2 in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by adenovirus vector infection, the 
tube formation, proliferation and migration of HUVEC under hypoxia were detected 
by tubule formation assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining and 
Transwell assay, respectively. After overexpression or knockdown of KPNA2 in a 
murine hindlimb ischemia model by local injection of purified adenovirus vector 
into the gastrocnemius muscle, blood flow changes were examined with a laser 
Doppler system. Changes in KPNA2-binding proteins under hypoxia were detected by 
immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and co-immunoprecipitation 
(Co-IP). The effect of KPNA2 on signal transducer and activator of transcription 
3 (STAT3) was detected by Western blotting and quantitative RT‒PCR.
RESULTS: KPNA2 was upregulated in the HUVEC hypoxia model and murine hindlimb 
ischemia model. Overexpression of KPNA2 increased the proliferation, migration 
and tube formation of HUVEC under hypoxia, while knockdown of KPNA2 reduced the 
proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVEC. Overexpression of KPNA2 
promoted the restoration of blood flow in the murine hindlimb ischemia model, 
while knockout of KPNA2 inhibited the restoration of blood flow in the murine 
hindlimb ischemia model. Mechanistically, hypoxia promoted the binding of STAT3 
to KPNA2. Overexpression of KPNA2 promoted STAT3 phosphorylation and then 
upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 
2(ANGPT2), whereas knockdown of KPNA2 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and then 
downregulated VEGF and ANGPT2.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that hypoxia promotes the binding of STAT3 to 
KPNA2 and KPNA2 promotes angiogenesis under hypoxia by promoting the binding of 
STAT3 and JAK1 and regulating STAT3 phosphorylation."
118,"The standard therapies in lymphoma have predominantly focused on targeting tumor 
cells with less of a focus on the tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a 
critical role in favoring tumor growth and survival. Such an approach may result 
in increasingly refractory disease with progressively reduced responses to 
subsequent treatments. To overcome this hurdle, targeting the TME has emerged as 
a new therapeutic strategy. The TME consists of T and B lymphocytes, 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and other components. Understanding the 
TME can lead to a comprehensive approach to managing lymphoma, resulting in 
therapeutic strategies that target not only cancer cells, but also the 
supportive environment and thereby ultimately improve survival of lymphoma 
patients. Here, we review the normal function of different components of the 
TME, the impact of their aberrant behavior in B cell lymphoma and the current 
TME-direct therapeutic avenues."
119,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in SERPINC1 lead to deficiency in antithrombin (AT) which 
is an endogenous anticoagulant of normal hemostasis and could result in venous 
thromboembolism (VTE).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old male patient with recurrent thrombosis returned 
to the hospital with multiple cerebral thrombosis after voluntary cessation of 
dabigatran therapy. Laboratory tests revealed a type I AT deficiency in this 
patient and further whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel heterozygous 
frameshift duplication (c.233_236dup, p.Val80Alafs*26) in SERPINC1 gene. 
Long-term dabigatran treatment was given and no recurrence or side effects were 
found within the followed 5 years.
CONCLUSION: A multisystem VTE patient with a novel SERPINC1 mutation 
(c.233_236dup, p.Val80Alafs*26) reached a favourable outcome after dabigatran 
treatment."
120,"BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common and serious complication of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). LN pathogenesis is not fully understood. Axl 
receptor tyrosine kinase is upregulated and contributes to the pathogenic 
progress in LN. We have reported that Axl disruption attenuates nephritis 
development in mice.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles with RNA-seq 
using renal cortical samples from nephritic mice. Axl-KO mice were bred onto a 
B6.lpr spontaneous lupus background, and renal disease development was followed 
and compared to the Axl-sufficient B6.lpr mice. Finally, anti-glomerular 
basement membrane (anti-GBM) Ab-induced nephritic mice were treated with Axl 
small molecule inhibitor, R428, at different stages of nephritis development. 
Blood urine nitrogen levels and renal pathologies were evaluated.
RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis revealed that renal Axl activation contributed 
to cell proliferation, survival, and motility through regulation of the Akt, 
c-Jun, and actin pathways. Spontaneous lupus-prone B6.lpr mice with Axl 
deficiency showed significantly reduced kidney damages and decreased T cell 
infiltration compared to the renal damage and T cell infiltration in 
Axl-sufficient B6.lpr mice. The improved kidney function was independent of 
autoAb production. Moreover, R428 significantly reduced anti-GBM 
glomerulonephritis at different stages of GN development compared to the 
untreated nephritic control mice. R428 administration reduced inflammatory 
cytokine (IL-6) production, T cell infiltration, and nephritis disease activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study emphasize the important role of Axl 
signaling in LN and highlight Axl as an attractive target in LN."
121,"PURPOSE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), a secreted 
protein associated with inflammation, is believed to possess momentous and 
multiple anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective properties. However, the role 
and potential mechanism of TSG-6 in cervical disk degeneration (CDD) are still 
not clear. Hence, we aimed to explore the effect of TSG-6 on CDD.
METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was applied to detect the expression level 
of TSG-6 and IL-1β in normal and degenerated nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues. 
Then, qRT-PCR and western blot were adopted to test the TSG-6 protein expression 
after IL-1β treatment (10 ng/mL) in human NP cells (HNPCs). After 
over-expressing TSG-6, qRT-PCR was also utilized to evaluate the expression of 
TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6 and the synthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs), 
western blot to check the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins 
[collagen II, aggrecan, and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3)], pain-related 
molecules (CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; NGF, nerve growth factor; SP, 
substance P), and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related proteins.
RESULTS: Briefly speaking, TSG-6 and IL-1β expression levels were significantly 
increased in CDD patient tissues; and IL-1β treatment could significantly 
increase TSG-6 expression in HNPCs. Further research revealed that, in addition 
to greatly promoting sGAGs synthesis, TSG-6 over-expression also inhibited 
TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6 expression and ECM degradation in IL-1β-induced HNPCs. 
(The collagen II and aggrecan expression was up-regulated and MMP-3 expression 
was down-regulated.) Furthermore, over-expression of TSG-6 could decrease the 
levels of CGRP, NGF, and SP protein expression and activate the PI3K/Akt 
signaling pathway in IL-1β-treated HNPCs.
CONCLUSION: TSG-6 inhibits inflammatory responses, ECM degradation, and 
expression of pain-related molecules in IL-1β-induced HNPCs by activating the 
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."
122,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus treatment as a chronic disease 
requires adequate adherence to treatment including controlling blood glucose 
levels and lifestyle management. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
factors affecting of adherence to T2D treatment from the perspective of patients 
and design an intervention program based on Pender's health promotion model 
(HPM) to increase T2D treatment adherence in Bandar Abbas, a city located in the 
south of Iran.
METHODS: This mixed method study will consist of qualitative stage, 
questionnaire design and a randomized, open-label, parallel-group interventional 
study based on HPM in southern Iran. Sampling for qualitative stage will 
continue until reaching the saturation. In the intervention stage, participants 
will be 166 T2D patients referring to the Bandar Abbas Diabetes Clinic will be 
randomized into intervention and control groups (allocation 1:1). After 
identifying the factors affecting adherence to treatment in T2D patients by 
qualitative study and literature review, a questionnaire based on HPM will be 
designed. In the next stage, 10 sessions of intervention for the intervention 
group will be designed. To evaluate the effect of the intervention, intervention 
and control groups will be tested for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) before and 3 months 
after the intervention.
DISCUSSION: This designed study is a program for improving treatment adherence 
in T2D based on the HPM model and contributes to a better understanding of 
effective factors in adherence to treatment in T2D patients. The results of this 
project can be used for macro-diabetic planning.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered on the Iranian Registry of Clinical 
Trials (IRCT20211228053558N1: https://www.irct.ir/trial/61741 ) and first 
release date of 17th March 2022."
123,"BACKGROUND: To support the primary care sector in delivering high-quality type 2 
diabetes (T2D), literature reviews emphasize the need for implementing models of 
collaboration that in a simple and effective way facilitate clinical dialogue 
between general practitioners (GPs) and endocrinologists. The overall aim of the 
project is to evaluate if virtual specialist conferences between GPs and 
endocrinologists about patients living with T2D is clinically effective and 
improves diabetes competences and organization in general practice in comparison 
to usual practice.
METHODS: A prospective, pragmatic, and superiority RCT with two parallel arms of 
general practices in the Municipality of Aarhus, Denmark. All general practices 
are invited (n = 100). The intervention runs for 12 months and consists of four 
virtual conferences between endocrinologists and an individual general practice. 
Before the first conference, an introductory webinar teaches GPs about how to 
use an IT-platform to identify and manage T2D patients. The main analysis (month 
12) concerns the difference between the intervention and control arm. It is 
expected that the virtual conferences at the patient level will improve 
adherence to international recommendations on diabetes medication for T2D 
patients and improve the risk profile with a reduction in glycated haemoglobin, 
blood pressure, and cholesterol. The study design allows for identifying a 
significant difference between the intervention (n = 15) and control group 
(n = 15) regarding the three primary clinical outcomes with a power of 
0.8870-0.9941. At the general practice level, it is expected that general 
practitioners and practice staff in the intervention group will improve 
self-reported diabetes competence and organization. The control arm will get the 
intervention when the primary intervention ends (months 12-24), and the 
intervention arm transitions to a maintenance phase.
DISCUSSION: The potential of virtual conferences is yet to be fully tapped 
because of methodological limitations. Studies have also not yet systematically 
evaluated virtual conferences in the context of chronic care using a 
high-quality research design. Given the nature of this real-life intervention, 
general practitioners and endocrinologists cannot be blinded to their allocation 
to either the intervention or comparison arm.

124,"BACKGROUND: Ginsenoside compound K (GC-K) potentially alleviates ulcerative 
colitis involved in gut microbiota, which is significantly associated with the 
occurrence and development of colitis. However, the effect and mechanism of GC-K 
on anti-colitis in relation to gut microbiota are not clear. This study focused 
on the prevention and mechanism of GC-K on Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced 
colitis of mice pertinent to gut microbiota.
METHODS: DSS was used to establish a chronic colitis mouse model. Body weight 
analysis, colon length measurement, HE staining, and inflammatory factors levels 
were processed in animal experiments. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze 
Th17/Treg cells in the mouse spleen and blood. 16S rRNA sequencing was utilized 
to analyze gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was 
employed to verify the anti-colitis efficacy of GC-K by reshaping gut 
microbiota.
RESULTS: GC-K significantly relieved colitis-related symptoms due to decreased 
disease activity index (DAI) scores, spleen weight, and increased colon length. 
Additionally, the tight junction proteins were increased, and the 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-17, were decreased 
after GC-K treatment. Furthermore, Bacteroides spp. significantly increased 
after modeling. Moreover, FMT experiments confirmed that GC-K-driven gut 
microbiota greatly relieved DSS-induced colitis.
CONCLUSION: GC-K alleviated colitis via the modulation of gut microbiota."
125,"BACKGROUND: As one of the major diagnostic criteria in Musculoskeletal Infection 
Society, the microbiological diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) 
performed by analyzing periprosthetic tissue culture is recommended. The goal of 
this study was to determine if methylene blue (MB) has antibacterial effects 
that might interfere with microbial culture in vitro.
METHODS: Eight isolates of reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Candida 
albicans were incubated appropriately on blood agar, China blue agar, or 
Sabouraud's agar plates at 35 ℃. (Streptococci were cultured in a CO2-rich 
atmosphere.) Each bacterial suspension was formed by 50-fold dilution before the 
test MB was added. For each strain, bacterial suspension was divided into 3 
groups (5 samples each) exposed either MB 0.1%, MB 0.05% or sterile 
non-bacteriostatic 0.45% saline. The antimicrobial property of MB was determined 
by measuring the bacterial density on agar plates incubated for 24 h and 
comparing it with controls unexposed to MB.
RESULTS: Exposure to MB 0.1% or MB 0.05% negatively affected microbial viability 
in vitro. Of the diluted form of MB exposure, reference strains of S. hominis 
and A. baumannii resulted in fewer colony-forming units compared with the 
sterile saline control. MB concentration was significantly negatively correlated 
with CFU counts of S. hominis and A. baumannii strains. The antibacterial 
property of MB 0.1% or MB 0.05% appears to affect the ability to culture the 
organism in in vitro assays.
CONCLUSION: MB 0.1% or MB 0.05% has strong antimicrobial activities against some 
commonly encountered bacterial strains in PJI in vitro. To further evaluate its 
potential antibacterial usefulness in clinical applications, the next studies 
are needed to assess the ability of MB to affect the ability to culture the 
pathogens in vivo, especially in periprosthetic tissue."
126,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation between N-terminal probrain 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH) D), high-mobility 
group box 1(HMGB1), endogenous activin A (ACTA), blood glucose 
level, electrolyte levels and developmental quotient (DQ) scores of 
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).
METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 90 neonates diagnosed with HIE 
who were admitted to our hospital from January 2018 to June 2021 were 
retrospectively enrolled, and 40 healthy full-term neonates born in our hospital 
during the same period were randomly selected. Neonates with HIE and healthy 
conditions were set as the study group and control group, respectively. Neonates 
with HIE are divided into three subgroups, mild, moderate, and severe, based on 
the severity of HIE. The Gesell Developmental Scale (GDS) was used to assess 
neural development of neonates at 9 to 12 months postnatal. Biomarkers of 
peripheral venous blood were measured and collected in all neonates, including 
NT-proBNP, (25-(OH) D), HMGB1, ACTA, electrolyte levels and blood glucose 
levels. General demographic information and Apgar score were compared between 
the two groups. The differences between the two groups of biomarkers were 
compared and the correlation between these biomarkers and DQ scores was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in gestational age, maternal age, 
gender, way of birth, birth weight, gestational age and whether the mother was a 
primipara between the two groups (P>0.05). The 10 min Apgar score of the study 
group (5.87±0.36) was lower than that of the control group (9.37±0.32) with 
significant difference (P<0.05). The levels of NT-proBNP, HMGB1, and ACTA in the 
study group were higher than that in the control group (243.87±21.29 pmol/L vs. 
116.98±22.19 pmol/L; 8.92±1.87 μg/L vs. 3.28±1.08 μg/L; 23.78±0.89 ng/ml vs. 
2.98±0.38 ng/ml), while the levels of 25-(OH) D and electrolyte levels 
were lower than that in the control group (24.28±1.87 vs. 31.29±1.93; K+: 
4.49±0.23 mmol/L vs. 4.73±0.21 mmol/L; Na+: 118.76±13.02 mmol/L vs. 134.28±12.29 
mmol/L; Ca2+: 1.77±0.23 mmol/L vs. 2.35±0.26 mmol/L; Mg2+: 0.61±0.17 mmol/L vs. 
0.91±0.17 mmol/L), with statistically significant differences (P<0.001). The 
levels of NT-probNP, HMGB1, ACTA and the incidence of hypoglycemia were the 
highest in the severe group, which were significantly higher than those in the 
moderate group and mild group (P<0.05). The levels of NT-probNP, HMGB1, ACTA and 
the incidence of hypoglycemia were the lowest in the mild group. The 25-(OH) D 
level, the incidence of hyperglycemia and electrolyte levels were the lowest in 
the severe group, which were significantly lower than those in the moderate and 
mild groups (all P<0.05). Meanwhile, the 25-(OH) D level, the incidence of 
hyperglycemia and electrolyte levels in the moderate group were lower than those 
in the mild group, and the differences were statistically significant (all 
P<0.05). The incidence of hyperglycemia in severe group (16 cases) was the 
lowest, significantly lower than that in moderate group (17 cases) and mild 
group (22 cases), and the difference was statistically significant (all P<0.05). 
The DQ scores of HIE neonates were negatively correlated with NT-proBNP, HMGB1, 
and ACTA (r=-0.671, -0.421, -0.518, all P< 0.001). The DQ scores was positively 
correlated with levels of 25-(OH) D and blood glucose level (r =0.621, 0.802, 
all P< 0.001). The DQ scores was also positively correlated with levels of 
potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium (0.367, 0.782, 0.218, 0.678, all 
P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The NT-proBNP, HMGB1, ACTA, 25-(OH) D, blood glucose levels and 
electrolyte levels are correlated with the severity of HIE, and developmental 
quotient scores in neonates with HIE. These biomarkers are suggestive for 
assessing the prognosis of neonate with HIE."
127,"BACKGROUND: It has been known that ABO blood groups are linked to the phenotypes 
of certain diseases; however, and the relationship between ABO blood groups and 
postoperative pain have not been extensively studied, especially in children. 
This study was to investigate whether there would be an association between the 
four major ABO blood groups and postoperative pain, as indicated by the 
differences in pain scores and rescue fentanyl requirements among blood groups 
in children after adenotonsillectomy.
METHODS: A total of 124 children, aged 3-7 years, ASA I or II, and undergoing 
elective adenotonsillectomy were enrolled in the study. Postoperative pain was 
evaluated using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) 
and the rescue fentanyl requirement in post anesthesia care unit (PACU) was 
analyzed. Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score and the duration 
of PACU were recorded. The postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) within 24 h 
were documented.
RESULTS: Among four blood type groups, no significant differences were observed 
regarding surgery time, and the gaps of fentanyl given at the anesthesia 
induction and the first rescue fentanyl injection in PACU. However, patients 
from AB and B blood groups had significantly higher pain score at initial CHEOPS 
assessment and consequently, higher consumption of rescue fentanyl during PACU 
stay. A significantly higher percentage of patients had received > 1 μg/kg 
rescue fentanyl. Higher PAED scores were also observed in AB and B blood groups.
CONCLUSION: Paediatric patients with AB and B blood type had higher 
postoperative CHEOPS pain score and required significantly more fentanyl for 
pain control than those with A and O blood type after T&A. The initial scores of 
PAED in patients with AB and B blood type were also higher than that in patients 
with A and O blood type."
128,"BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization, road traffic injuries 
lead to 1.3 million deaths each year and represent the leading cause of death 
for young adults under 30 years old. The use of psychoactive substances, 
including alcohol, drugs and pharmaceuticals, is a well-known risk factor for 
road traffic injuries. Our study aims to assess the prevalence of substances 
consumed by drivers in western Switzerland. Such studies are pivotal to 
improving prevention and developing public awareness campaigns.
METHODS: To assess the prevalence of psychoactive substances among drivers, 
roadside controls were performed in collaboration with local police, using their 
classical sampling procedures to detect drivers under the influence of drugs or 
alcohol over two time periods (P1: 2006-2008, P2: 2017-2020). When impaired 
driving was not suspected by the police, minimally invasive sampling strategies 
(i.e., oral fluids during P1 and dried blood spots during P2) were performed on 
volunteer drivers after a road safety survey. A posteriori analyses and 
statistical interpretation were then performed.
RESULTS: Among the 1605 drivers included in the study, 1048 volunteers provided 
an oral fluid sample, while 299 provided a dried blood spot sample. The 
percentage of drivers testing positive for at least one substance that can 
impact driving abilities was stable over time, with a rate of 10.5% positivity 
measured over both periods. Considering the different categories of substances, 
a slight variation was observed between both periods, with 7.6 and 6.3% of 
pharmaceuticals and 3.6 and 4.9% of illicit drugs for P1 and P2, respectively. 
Regarding the consumption of illicit drugs, the highest percentage of positivity 
was measured in biological fluids of drivers under the age of 35, during nights 
and week-ends, periods which are considered particularly prone to fatal 
accidents for this age group. Disturbingly, the road safety survey highlighted 
that drivers' perception of the risk of getting positively controlled while 
driving after drug consumption is low (3.3 on a 1-to-10 scale, N = 299).
CONCLUSION: The number of positive cases measured in voluntary drivers who 
passed the preliminary police check demonstrates the importance of systematic 
biofluid sampling strategies regarding driving under the influence of 
psychoactive substances. Although the number of fatal road accidents globally 
has decreased over time, the results of this study reveal the need for both 
better prevention and deterrent processes that could potentially reduce the risk 
of fatal road accidents associated with drug consumption."
129,"BACKGROUND: During surgery, any mismatch between oxygen delivery (DO2) and 
consumption (VO2) can promote the development of postoperative complications. 
The respiratory exchange ratio (RER), defined as the ratio of carbon dioxide 
(CO2) production (VCO2) to VO2, may be a useful noninvasive tool for detecting 
inadequate DO2. The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis 
that RER measured during liver transplantation may predict postoperative 
morbidity. Secondary objectives were to assess the ability of other variables 
used to assess the DO2/VO2 relationship, including arterial lactate, mixed 
venous oxygen saturation, and veno-arterial difference in the partial pressure 
of carbon dioxide (VAPCO2gap), to predict postoperative complications.
METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive adult patients who 
underwent liver transplantation for end stage liver disease from June 27th, 
2020, to September 5th, 2021. Patients with acute liver failure were excluded. 
All patients were routinely equipped with a pulmonary artery catheter. The 
primary analysis was a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve constructed 
to investigate the discriminative ability of the mean RER measured during 
surgery to predict postoperative complications. RER was calculated at five 
standardized time points during the surgery, at the same time as measurement of 
blood lactate levels and arterial and mixed venous blood gases, which were 
compared as a secondary analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 115 patients included, 57 developed at least one postoperative 
complication. The mean RER (median [25-75] percentiles) during surgery was 
significantly higher in patients with complications than in those without 
(1.04[0.96-1.12] vs 0.88[0.84-0.94]; p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve 
was 0.87 (95%CI: 0.80-0.93; p < 0.001) with a RER value (Youden index) of 0.92 
giving a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 74% for predicting the 
occurrence of postoperative complications. The RER outperformed all other 
measured variables assessing the DO2/VO2 relationship (arterial lactate, SvO2, 
and VAPCO2gap) in predicting postoperative complications.
CONCLUSION: During liver transplantation, the RER can reliably predict 
postoperative complications. Implementing this measure intraoperatively may 
provide a warning for physicians of impending complications and justify more 
aggressive optimization of oxygen delivery. Further studies are required to 
determine whether correcting the RER is feasible and could reduce the incidence 
of complications."
130,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common critical illness in intensive care unit (ICU) and 
seriously threatens the life of patients. Therefore, to identify a simple and 
effective clinical indicator to determine prognosis is essential for the 
management of sepsis patients. This study was mainly based on blood urea 
nitrogen to albumin ratio (B/A), a comprehensive index, to explore its 
correlation with the prognosis of sepsis patients during hospitalization.
METHODS: Totally, adult patients in ICU who were diagnosed with sepsis in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database from 2008 to 
2019 were involved in this study. The study population were divided into 
survivors group and non-survivors group based on the prognosis during 
hospitalization. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was utilized to analyze the 
association between B/A level and the risk of ICU all-cause mortality in 
patients with sepsis and determine the optimal cut-off value of B/A. The study 
population was divided into low B/A group and high B/A group based on the 
optimal cut-off value. The survival curve of ICU cumulative survival rate was 
draw through Kaplan-Meier method. The correlation between B/A and the prognosis 
of patients was conducted by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Furthermore, 
we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: A total of 10,578 patients with sepsis were enrolled, and the ICU 
all-cause mortality was 15.89%. The patients in the non-survivors group had 
higher B/A values and more comorbidities than those in the survivors group. RCS 
showed that the risk of ICU all-cause mortality increased with the B/A level, 
showing a non-linear trend (χ2 = 66.82, p < 0.001). The mortality rate in the 
high B/A group was significantly higher than that in the low B/A group 
(p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that compared with the low B/A group, 
the ICU cumulative survival rate of patients with sepsis was significantly lower 
in the high B/A group (log-rank test, χ2 = 148.620, p < 0.001). Further analysis 
of multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that an elevated B/A 
(≥ 7.93) was an independent factor associated with ICU mortality among patients 
with sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated B/A might be a useful prognostic indicator in patients 
with sepsis. This study could offer a deeper insight into treating sepsis."
131,"PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of the avatera system for performing 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) followed by intracorporeal 
reconstruction of ileal neobladder.
METHODS: Six anesthetized female pigs were used to perform RARC and formation of 
the intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder. Three surgeons with different 
level of expertise in the use of robotic systems performed RARC after a short 
instructional lecture and a 2-h hands-on training. The urinary diversion phase 
was performed only by the experienced surgeon. The successful completion of the 
procedure, operative time for demolitive and reconstructive phases, 
intraoperative blood loss and malfunction of the robotic system were evaluated.
RESULTS: An improvement of the operative time was observed for each surgeon. The 
experienced surgeon, the fellow and the resident improved their time by 11, 15, 
and 22 min, respectively, between the first and the second RARC performed. The 
most significant time difference was demonstrated by the resident, who had no 
previous experience in using robotic systems. The time difference between the 
first and the last orthotopic ileal neobladder creation for the experienced 
surgeon was 51 min.
CONCLUSION: The feasibility of avatera system for performing complex surgical 
procedure such as RARC with intracorporeal neobladder formation was demonstrated 
by this experimental study. No major bleeding or severe malfunctions were 
observed during the procedures. Significant improvement in operative time was 
demonstrated with the increasing experience from 1st to 6th case."
132,"The recovery of independent gait represents one of the main functional goals of 
the rehabilitative interventions after stroke but it can be hindered by the 
presence of unilateral spatial neglect (USN). The aim of the paper is to study 
if the presence of USN in stroke patients affects lower limb gait parameters 
between the two body sides, differently from what could be expected by the motor 
impairment alone, and to explore whether USN is associated to specific gait 
asymmetry. Thirty-five stroke patients (right or left lesion and ischemic or 
hemorrhagic etiology) who regained independent gait were assessed for global 
cognitive functioning and USN. All patients underwent a gait analysis session by 
using a wearable inertial system, kinematic parameters were computed. Enrolled 
patients presented altered motion parameters. Stroke patients with USN showed 
specific asymmetries in the following parameters: stance phase, swing phase, and 
knee range of motion. No differences in the clinical scores were found as the 
presence of USN. The presence of USN was associated with a specific form of 
altered gait symmetry. These findings may help clinicians to develop more 
tailored rehabilitative training to enhance gait efficacy of patients with motor 
defects complicated by the presence of selected cognitive impairments. Overview 
of the experiment setup. The workflow shows: diagnosis of unilateral spatial 
neglect by the neuropsychologist, sensors placement, gait analysis protocol and 
evaluation of the gait asymmetry together with the statistically significant 
features."
133,"Bone marrow studies currently provide a lot of valuable information in the 
diagnostics of hematological diseases including hematopoietic stem cells 
disorders. Our studies on low-molecular weight organic compounds in bone marrow 
stem cell niche in various pathogenic conditions, revealed relatively high 
variability of histamine levels in different groups of hematological diseases. 
It was also found that serotonin levels were significantly lower than those 
typically measured in peripheral blood as well as many have the influence on 
stem cells proliferative potential. This paper presents findings from 
quantitative and statistical analyses of histamine and serotonin levels. Bone 
marrow collected from patients undergoing routine diagnostic procedures for 
hematological diseases and receiving inpatient treatment were analyzed. 
Histamine and serotonin levels were measured using hydrophilic interaction 
liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Obtained 
data were analyzed statistically and correlated with the diagnosed groups of 
hematological diseases and the parameters of complete blood counts. Histamine 
was found in all tested samples, including those from patients without 
malignancy, and the reported levels were comparable to the reference values in 
blood. This observation allows us to assume that bone marrow cells can produce 
and accumulate histamine. Moreover, the statistical analysis revealed a 
significant relationship between histamine levels and diagnosed mastocytosis, 
and between histamine levels and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Different results 
were obtained for serotonin, and its concentrations in most cases were below the 
limit of quantification of the method used (< 0.2 ng/mL), which can only be 
compared to peripheral blood plasma. In a few cases, significantly higher 
serotonin levels were observed and it concerned diseases associated with an 
increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow."
134,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common but fatal complication after cardiac 
surgery. In the absence of effective treatments, the identification and 
modification of risk factors has been a major component of disease management. 
However, the optimal blood pressure target for preventing cardiac 
surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) remains unclear. We sought to 
determine the effect of postoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) in CSA-AKI. 
It is hypothesized that longer periods of hypotension after cardiac surgery are 
associated with an increased risk of AKI. This prospective cohort study was 
conducted on adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery requiring 
cardiopulmonary bypass at a tertiary center between October 2018 and May 2020. 
The primary outcome is the occurrence of CSA-AKI. MAP and its duration in the 
ranges of less than 65, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 mmHg within 24 h after surgery 
were recorded. The association between postoperative MAP and CSA-AKI was 
examined by using logistic regression. Among the 353 patients enrolled, 217 
(61.5%) had a confirmed diagnosis of CSA-AKI. Each 1 h epoch of postoperative 
MAP less than 65 mmHg was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.208 (95% 
CI, 1.007 to 1.449; P = 0.042), and each 1 h epoch of postoperative MAP between 
65 and 74 mmHg was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.144 (95% CI, 
1.026 to 1.275; P = 0.016) for CSA-AKI. A potentially modifiable risk factor, 
postoperative MAP less than 75 mmHg for 1 h or more is associated with an 
increased risk of CSA-AKI."
135,"BACKGROUND: After subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), early brain injury (EBI) and 
delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) lead to poor outcomes. Discovery of biomarkers 
indicative of disease severity and predictive of DCI is important. We tested 
whether leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a marker of severity, DCI, 
and functional outcomes after SAH.
METHODS: We performed untargeted proteomics using mass spectrometry in plasma 
samples collected at < 48 h of SAH in two independent discovery cohorts (n = 27 
and n = 45) and identified LRG1 as a biomarker for DCI. To validate our 
findings, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed this finding 
in an internal validation cohort of plasma from 72 study participants with SAH 
(22 DCI and 50 non-DCI). Further, we investigated the relationship between LRG1 
and markers of EBI, DCI, and poor functional outcomes (quantified by the 
modified Rankin Scale). We also measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 
LRG1 and investigated its relationship to EBI, DCI, and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Untargeted proteomics revealed higher plasma LRG1 levels across EBI 
severity and DCI in both discovery cohorts. In the validation cohort, the levels 
of LRG1 were higher in the DCI group compared with the non-DCI group (mean 
(SD): 95 [44] vs. 72 [38] pg/ml, p < 0.05, Student's t-test) and in study 
participants who proceeded to have poor functional outcomes (84 [39.3] vs. 72 
[43.2] pg/ml, p < 0.05). Elevated plasma LRG1 levels were also associated with 
markers of EBI. However, CSF levels of LRG1 were not associated with EBI 
severity or the occurrence of DCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma LRG1 is a biomarker for EBI, DCI, and functional outcomes 
after SAH. Further studies to elucidate the role of LRG1 in the pathophysiology 
of SAH are needed."
136,"BACKGROUND: The utility of head computed tomography (CT) in predicting elevated 
intracranial pressure (ICP) is known to be limited in traumatic brain injury; 
however, few data exist in patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of prospectively collected data in 
patients with nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid hemorrhage 
[SAH] or intraparenchymal hemorrhage [IPH]) who underwent external ventricular 
drain (EVD) placement. Head CT scans performed immediately prior to EVD 
placement were quantitatively reviewed for features suggestive of elevated ICP, 
including temporal horn diameter, bicaudate index, basal cistern effacement, 
midline shift, and global cerebral edema. The modified Fisher score (mFS), 
intraventricular hemorrhage score, and IPH volume were also measured, as 
applicable. We calculated the accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and 
negative predictive value (NPV) of these radiographic features for the coprimary 
outcomes of elevated ICP (> 20 mm Hg) at the time of EVD placement and at any 
time during the hospital stay. Multivariable backward stepwise logistic 
regression analysis was performed to identify significant radiographic factors 
associated with elevated ICP.
RESULTS: Of 608 patients with intracranial hemorrhages enrolled during the study 
time frame, 243 (40%) received an EVD and 165 (n = 107 SAH, n = 58 IPH) had a 
preplacement head CT scan available for rating. Elevated opening pressure and 
elevated ICP during hospitalization were recorded in 48 of 152 (29%) and 103 of 
165 (62%), respectively. The presence of ≥ 1 radiographic feature had only 32% 
accuracy for identifying elevated opening pressure (PPV 30%, NPV 58%, area under 
the curve [AUC] 0.537, 95% asymptotic confidence interval [CI] 0.436-0.637, 
P = 0.466) and 59% accuracy for predicting elevated ICP during hospitalization 
(PPV 63%, NPV 40%, AUC 0.514, 95% asymptotic CI 0.391-0.638, P = 0.820). There 
was no significant association between the number of radiographic features and 
ICP elevation. Head CT scans without any features suggestive of elevated ICP 
occurred in 25 of 165 (15%) patients. However, 10 of 25 (40%) of these patients 
had elevated opening pressure, and 15 of 25 (60%) had elevated ICP during their 
hospital stay. In multivariable models, mFS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.36, 95% 
CI 1.10-1.68) and global cerebral edema (aOR 2.93, 95% CI 1.27-6.75) were 
significantly associated with elevated ICP; however, their accuracies were only 
69% and 60%, respectively. All other individual radiographic features had 
accuracies between 38 and 58% for identifying intracranial hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: More than 50% of patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage 
without radiographic features suggestive of elevated ICP actually had 
ICP > 20 mm Hg during EVD placement or their hospital stay. Morphological head 
CT findings were only 32% and 59% accurate in identifying elevated opening 
pressure and ICP elevation during hospitalization, respectively."
137,"Over the last decade, the use of targeted therapies and immune therapies led to 
drastic changes in the management lung cancer and translated to improved 
survival outcomes. This growing arsenal of therapies available for the 
management of non-small cell lung cancer added more complexity to treatment 
decisions. The genomic profiling of tumors and the molecular characterization of 
the tumor microenvironment gradually became essential steps in exploring and 
identifying markers that can enhance patient selection to facilitate treatment 
personalization and narrow down therapy options. The advent of innovative 
diagnostic platforms, such as next-generation sequencing and plasma genotyping 
(also known as liquid biopsies), has aided in this quest. Currently, programmed 
cell death ligand 1 expression remains the most recognized and fully validated 
predictive biomarker of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Other markers 
such as tumor mutational burden, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, driver 
mutations, and other molecular elements of the tumor microenvironment bear the 
potential to be predictive tools; however, the majority are still 
investigational. In this review, we describe the advances noted thus far on 
currently validated as well as novel emerging biomarkers that have the potential 
to guide the use of immunotherapy agents in the management of non-small cell 
lung cancer."
138,"Metformin hydrochloride enteric-coated capsule (MH-EC) is a commonly used 
clinical drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we described 
a metformin hydrochloride mucosal nanoparticles enteric-coated capsule 
(MH-MNPs-EC) based on metformin hydrochloride chitosan mucosal nanoparticles 
(MH-CS MNPs) and its preparation method to improve the bioavailability and 
hypoglycemic effect duration of MH-EC. In intestinal adhesion study, the residue 
rates of free drugs and mucosal nanoparticles were 10.52% and 67.27%, 
respectively after cleaned with PBS buffer. MH-CS MNPs could significantly 
improve the efficacy of MH and promote the rehabilitation of diabetes rats. In 
vitro release test of MH-MNPs-EC showed continuous release over 12 h, while 
commercial MH-EC released completely within about 1 h in intestinal environment 
(pH 6.8). Pharmacokinetic study was performed in beagle dogs compared to the 
commercial MH-EC. The durations of blood MH concentration above 2 μg/mL were 9 h 
for MH-MNPs-EC versus 2 h for commercial MH-EC. The relative bioavailability of 
MH-MNPs-EC was determined as 185.28%, compared with commercial MH-EC. In 
conclusion, MH-CS MNPs have good intestinal adhesion and can significantly 
prolong the residence time of MH in the intestine. MH-MNPs-EC has better 
treatment effect compared with MH-EC, and it is expected to be a potential drug 
product for the treatment of diabetes because of its desired characteristics."
139,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molecular imaging of the dopamine transporters (DAT) 
provides valuable information about neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
Parkinson's. This study assessed the accuracy and precision of DAT-SPECT 
quantification methods.
METHODS: Twenty-three DAT-SPECT images of a striatal phantom were acquired. The 
specific (caudate and putamen) and the non-specific (background activity) 
chambers were filled with [99mTc]Tc. Different specific-to-non-specific activity 
ratios (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2 to 1) and the specific binding ratio (SBR) 
were calculated. Five methods using ROIs were assessed: (a) Manual ROIs on SPECT 
images; (b) TwoBox and (c) ThreeBox methods and Volume of Interest (VOI) using 
structural images; (d) MRI and (e) CT. Accuracy was evaluated by the concordance 
correlation coefficient (CCC) and precision by Pearson's coefficient and linear 
regression.
RESULTS: The SBR quantified in the specific and striatal chambers resulted in a 
CCC increase with a decrease in the nominal values. For lower SBR, MRI and CT 
showed higher CCCs when caudate ([Formula: see text] = 0.89 e [Formula: see 
text] = 0.84) and putamen ([Formula: see text] = 0.86 e [Formula: see text] = 
0.82) were evaluated. For striatal assessments, the TwoBox method was the most 
accurate ([Formula: see text] = 0.95). High Pearson's coefficients were found in 
the correlations between all methods.
CONCLUSIONS: All five methods showed high precision even when applied to images 
with different activities. MRI and CT were the most accurate for assessing the 
caudate or putamen. To assess the striatal chamber and in the absence of 
structural information, the TwoBox method is advisable."
140,"Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning 
regimens have expanded use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(HCT) in AML to include older and medically less-fit patients, but relative 
efficacies and toxicities remain poorly defined. Here, we analyzed outcomes from 
343 adults transplanted in remission after RIC (n = 137) or NMA (n = 206) 
conditioning between 2006 and 2021. The characteristics of RIC and NMA HCT 
patients were similar except that RIC patients were younger and their time 
between most recent remission achievement and allografting was shorter. There 
were no significant differences in relapse risk, relapse-free survival (RFS), 
overall survival (OS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) between RIC and NMA HCT 
patients, both overall (relapse: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80, P = 0.27; RFS: 
HR = 0.93, P = 0.61; OS: HR = 0.93, P = 0.66; NRM: HR = 1.13, P = 0.59) and when 
patients were stratified by pre-HCT measurable residual disease (MRD) status. 
After multivariable adjustment, there was no statistically significant 
association between conditioning intensity and relapse (HR = 0.69, P = 0.088), 
RFS (HR = 0.86, P = 0.37), OS (HR = 0.89, P = 0.49), or NRM (HR = 1.37, 
P = 0.19). In this non-randomized cohort of adults undergoing allografting for 
AML in first or second remission at our center, we could not detect 
statistically significant differences in outcomes between those assigned to RIC 
and those assigned to NMA conditioning."
141,"Cerebral ischemic stroke causes substantial white matter injury, which is 
further aggravated by neuroinflammation mediated by microglia/astrocytes. Given 
the anti-neuroinflammatory action of telmisartan and the enhancing blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) permeability potential of resuscitation-inducing aromatic herbs, 
13 hybrids (3a-m) of telmisartan (or its simplified analogues) with 
resuscitation-inducing aromatic agents were designed, synthesized, and 
biologically evaluated. Among them, the optimal compound 3a (the ester hybrid of 
telmisartan and (+)-borneol) potently inhibited neuroinflammation mediated by 
microglia/astrocytes and ameliorated ischemic stroke. Particularly, 3a 
significantly conferred protection for white matter integrity after cerebral 
ischemic stroke via decreasing abnormally dephosphorylated neurofilament 
protein, upregulating myelin basic protein, and attenuating oligodendrocyte 
damage. Further RNA-sequencing data revealed that 3a upregulated expression of 
transcriptional regulator ATF3 to reduce the expression of CH25H, prevented 
proinflammatory state of lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia/astrocytes to 
limit excessive inflammation, and eventually protected neighboring 
oligodendrocytes to prevent white matter injury. Taken with the desirable 
pharmacokinetics behavior and improved brain distribution, 3a may be a feasible 
therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke and other neurological disorders with 
white matter injury."
142,"Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous 
micro-deletion in the WS critical region (WSCR) and is characterized by 
hyper-sociability and neurocognitive abnormalities. Nonetheless, whether and to 
what extent WSCR deletion leads to epigenetic modifications in the brain and 
induces pathological outcomes remains largely unknown. By examining DNA 
methylation in frontal cortex, we revealed genome-wide disruption in the 
methylome of individuals with WS, as compared to typically developed (TD) 
controls. Surprisingly, differentially methylated sites were predominantly 
annotated as introns and intergenic loci and were found to be highly enriched 
around binding sites for transcription factors that regulate neuronal 
development, plasticity and cognition. Moreover, by utilizing enhancer-promoter 
interactome data, we confirmed that most of these loci function as active 
enhancers in the human brain or as target genes of transcriptional networks 
associated with myelination, oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation, cognition and 
social behavior. Cell type-specific methylation analysis revealed aberrant 
patterns in the methylation of active enhancers in neurons and OLs, and 
important neuron-glia interactions that might be impaired in individuals with 
WS. Finally, comparison of methylation profiles from blood samples of 
individuals with WS and healthy controls, along with other data collected in 
this study, identified putative targets of endophenotypes associated with WS, 
which can be used to define brain-risk loci for WS outside the WSCR locus, as 
well as for other associated pathologies. In conclusion, our study illuminates 
the brain methylome landscape of individuals with WS and sheds light on how 
these aberrations might be involved in social behavior and physiological 
abnormalities. By extension, these results may lead to better diagnostics and 
more refined therapeutic targets for WS."
143,"INTRODUCTION: Meta-analyses implicate immune dysfunction in depression 
confirming increased levels of circulating immune proteins (e.g., cytokines) in 
depression cases compared to controls. White blood cells (WBC) both produce and 
are influenced by cytokines, and play key roles in orchestrating innate and 
adaptive immune responses, but their role in depression remains unclear. 
Therefore, a systematic review of studies of various WBC subsets in depression 
is required for a greater understanding of the nature of immune dysfunction in 
this illness.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and PsycINFO databases (inception to 5th April 2022) 
and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of identified studies 
comparing absolute count and/or relative percentage of flow cytometry-derived 
WBC subsets between depression cases and controls. Selected studies were quality 
assessed. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included and 27 studies (n = 2277) were 
meta-analysed. We report an increase in mean absolute counts of WBC (seven 
studies; standardised mean difference [SMD] = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.61-1.53; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 64%), granulocytes (two studies; SMD = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.45-2.68; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 0%), neutrophils (four studies; SMD = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.23-1.58; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 82%), monocytes (seven studies; SMD = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.19-1.01; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 66%), CD4+ helper T cells (11 studies; SMD = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.15-0.45; 
P < 0.01; I2 = 0%), natural killer cells (11 studies; SMD = 1.23; 95% CI, 
0.38-2.08; P < 0.01; I2 = 95%), B cells (10 studies; SMD = 0.30; 95% CI, 
0.03-0.57; P = 0.03; I2 = 56%), and activated T cells (eight studies; 
SMD = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24-0.66; P < 0.01; I2 = 0%) in depression, compared to 
controls. Fewer studies reported relative percentage, indicating increased 
neutrophils and decreased total lymphocytes, Th1, and Th2 cells in depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression is characterised by widespread alterations in 
circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells, consistent with dysfunction in both 
innate and adaptive immunity. Immune cells could be useful biomarkers for 
illness subtyping and patient stratification in future immunotherapy trials of 
depression, along with cytokines, other biomarkers, and clinical measures."
144,"INTRODUCTION: Variants in the BRCA1/2 genes are responsible for familial breast 
cancer. Numerous studies showed a different spectrum of BRCA variants among 
breast cancer patients of different Ethnicity origin. In the available 
literature, no previous research has focused on breast cancer-associated 
variants among the Khakass people (the indigenous people of the Russian 
Federation).
METHODS: Twenty-six Khakass breast cancer patients were enrolled in the study. 
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and used to prepare libraries using 
a Hereditary Cancer Solution kit. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed 
using the MiSeq System (Illumina, USA).
RESULTS: In our study, 12% of patients (3/26) carried a single pathogenic 
variant; 54% of patients (14/26) carried variants of uncertain significance 
(VUS) or conflicting variants; and 35% of patients (9/26) did not carry any 
clinically significant variants. Germline pathogenic variant in the ATM gene 
(rs780619951, NC_000011.10:g.108259022C > T) was identified in two unrelated 
patients with a family history of cancer (7.6%, 2/26). The pathogenic truncating 
variant in the ATM gene (p. R805* or c.2413C > T) leads to the nonfunctional 
version of the protein. This variant has been earlier reported in individuals 
with a family history of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study describes the germline variant in the ATM gene 
associated with breast cancer in Khakass women of North Asia."
145,"To explore the fitting effect of the ARIMA, GM(1,1), and RANSAC model in the 
changes of white blood cells (WBC) in benzene-exposed workers, and select the 
optimal model to predict the WBC count of workers. Among 350 employees in an 
aerospace process manufacturing enterprise in Nanjing, workers with 10 years of 
benzene exposure were selected, and used Excel software to organize the WBC 
data, and the ARIMA model and RANSAC model were established by R software, and 
the GM(1, 1) model was established by DPS software, and the magnitude of the 
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of fitting three models to WBC counts was 
compared. The MAPE based on the ARIMA(2,1,2) model is 6.78%, the MAPE based on 
the GM(1,1) model is 5.19%, and the MAPE based on the RANSAC model is 6.37%, so 
the GM( 1,1) model was more suitable for fitting the trend of WBC counts in 
benzene exposed workers in this study. The GM(1,1) model is suitable for fitting 
WBC counts in a small sample size and can provide a short-term prediction of WBC 
counts in benzene-exposed workers and provide basic information for occupational 
health risk assessment of workers."
146,"Natural sources and anthropogenic activities are responsible for the widespread 
presence of heavy metals in the environment in the volcanic and geothermal area 
of Mt. Amiata (Tuscany, Italy). This study evaluates the extent of the 
population exposure to metals and describes the major individual and 
environmental determinants. A human biomonitoring survey was carried out to 
determine the concentrations of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), thallium (Tl), 
antimony (Sb), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), vanadium 
(V), and manganese (Mn). The associations between socio-demographics, lifestyle, 
diet, environmental exposure, and metal concentrations were evaluated using 
multiple log-linear regression models, adjusted for urinary creatinine. A total 
of 2034 urine and blood samples were collected. Adjusted geometric averages were 
higher in women (except for blood Hg) and younger subjects (except for Tl and 
Cd). Smoking was associated with Cd, As, and V. Some dietary habits (rice, fish, 
and wine consumption) were associated with As, Hg, Co, and Ni. Amalgam dental 
fillings and contact lenses were associated with Hg levels, piercing with As, 
Co, and Ni. Among environmental determinants, urinary As levels were higher in 
subjects using the aqueduct water for drinking/cooking. The consumption of 
locally grown fruits and vegetables was associated with Hg, Tl, and Co. Exposure 
to geothermal plant emissions was associated only with Tl."
147,"Cellular senescence caused by oncogenic stimuli is associated with the 
development of various age-related pathologies through the senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP is mediated by the activation of cytoplasmic 
nucleic acid sensors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the 
accumulation of nucleotide ligands in senescent cells is unclear. In this study, 
we revealed that the expression of RNaseH2A, which removes ribonucleoside 
monophosphates (rNMPs) from the genome, is regulated by E2F transcription 
factors, and it decreases during cellular senescence. Residual rNMPs cause 
genomic DNA fragmentation and aberrant activation of cytoplasmic nucleic acid 
sensors, thereby provoking subsequent SASP factor gene expression in senescent 
cells. In addition, RNaseH2A expression was significantly decreased in aged 
mouse tissues and cells from individuals with Werner syndrome. Furthermore, 
RNaseH2A degradation using the auxin-inducible degron system induced the 
accumulation of nucleotide ligands and induction of certain tumourigenic 
SASP-like factors, promoting the metastatic properties of colorectal cancer 
cells. Our results indicate that RNaseH2A downregulation provokes SASP through 
nucleotide ligand accumulation, which likely contributes to the pathological 
features of senescent, progeroid, and cancer cells."
148,"Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) develop thoracic aortic aneurysms as the 
aorta presents excessive elastin breaks, fibrosis, and vascular smooth muscle 
cell (vSMC) death due to mutations in the FBN1 gene. Despite elaborate vSMC to 
aortic endothelial cell (EC) signaling, the contribution of ECs to the 
development of aortic pathology remains largely unresolved. The aim of this 
study is to investigate the EC properties in Fbn1C1041G/+ MFS mice. Using en 
face immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we showed that EC alignment with 
blood flow was reduced, EC roundness was increased, individual EC surface area 
was larger, and EC junctional linearity was decreased in aortae of Fbn1C1041G/+ 
MFS mice. This modified EC phenotype was most prominent in the ascending aorta 
and occurred before aortic dilatation. To reverse EC morphology, we performed 
treatment with resveratrol. This restored EC blood flow alignment, junctional 
linearity, phospho-eNOS expression, and improved the structural integrity of the 
internal elastic lamina of Fbn1C1041G/+ mice. In conclusion, these experiments 
identify the involvement of ECs and underlying internal elastic lamina in MFS 
aortic pathology, which could act as potential target for future MFS 
pharmacotherapies."
149,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is emerging in genetic diagnoses as it provides 
functional support for the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance. 
However, the use of amniotic fluid (AF) cells for RNA-seq has not yet been 
explored. Here, we examined the expression of clinically relevant genes in AF 
cells (n = 48) compared with whole blood and fibroblasts. The number of 
well-expressed genes in AF cells was comparable to that in fibroblasts and much 
higher than that in blood across different disease categories. We found AF cells 
RNA-seq feasible and beneficial in prenatal diagnosis (n = 4) as transcriptomic 
data elucidated the molecular consequence leading to the pathogenicity upgrade 
of variants in CHD7 and COL1A2 and revising the in silico prediction of a 
variant in MYRF. AF cells RNA-seq could become a reasonable choice for postnatal 
patients with advantages over fibroblasts and blood as it prevents invasive 
procedures."
150,"OBJECTIVE: A shared care model was implemented in 2006 in Queensland to 
facilitate paediatric oncology, haematology and palliative care patients 
receiving care as close to home as possible. Following initial diagnosis, care 
planning and treatment at the tertiary children's hospital, appropriate local 
care was coordinated by Regional Case Managers (RCMs) established at each of 10 
Shared Care Units (SCUs). This enabled safe and quality regional care supported 
by a statewide network providing clinical governance and education. This paper 
examines learnings from 15 years of this shared care.
SETTING: Ten hospitals throughout Queensland facilitated a statewide model of 
shared care for paediatric oncology, haematology and palliative care patients, 
supported by a tertiary hub in Brisbane.
PARTICIPANTS: Regional Case Managers in Shared Care Units and their supporting 
staff.
DESIGN: Staff from SCUs were surveyed and focus group interviews conducted.
RESULTS: The paper reviews the attributes, knowledge and experience required for 
RCMs. Standards of care were supported through education workshops, clinical 
placements, chemotherapy credentialing, guidelines and standards. RCMs 
facilitated communication and information sharing with the tertiary centre, 
advocated for their cohort of patients locally and streamlined and supported the 
family's experience of care.
CONCLUSION: The RCM role provided invaluable clinical leadership for the care of 
paediatric oncology, haematology and palliative patients across Queensland. As 
new treatments evolve, the expertise and coordination provided by the RCMs will 
be even more critical. Achieving high-quality shared care outcomes is 
underpinned by the RCMs drive to achieve statewide safety and support for this 
cohort of children."
151,"OBJECTIVE: Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is the main limitation of 
extended liver resection. The molecular mechanism and the role of leukocytes in 
the development of PHLF remain to be unveiled. We aimed to address the impact of 
serine proteases (SPs) on the acute phase after liver resection by intravitally 
analyzing leukocyte recruitment and changes in hemodynamics and microcirculation 
of the liver.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice undergoing 60% partial hepatectomy were treated with 
aprotinin (broad-spectrum SP inhibitor), tranexamic acid (plasmin inhibitor), or 
vehicle. Sham-operated animals served as controls. In-vivo fluorescence 
microscopy was used to quantify leukocyte-endothelial interactions immediately 
after, as well as 120 min after partial hepatectomy in post-sinusoidal venules, 
along with measurement of sinusoidal perfusion rate and post-sinusoidal shear 
rate. Recruitment of leukocytes, neutrophils, T-cells, and parameters of liver 
injury were assessed in tissue/blood samples.
RESULTS: Leukocyte recruitment, sinusoidal perfusion failure rate, and shear 
rate were significantly increased in mice after 60% partial hepatectomy compared 
to sham-operated animals. The inhibition of SPs or plasmin significantly 
attenuated leukocyte recruitment and improved the perfusion rate in the remnant 
liver. ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil recruitment significantly increased 
after 60% partial hepatectomy and were strongly reduced by plasmin inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment in the liver in 
response to the increment of sinusoidal shear rate were hallmarks in the acute 
phase after liver resection. SPs mediated leukocyte recruitment and contributed 
to the impairment of sinusoidal perfusion in an ICAM-1-dependent manner in the 
acute phase after liver resection."
152,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Different approaches are available after progression of 
disease (PD) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), including continuation of ICI, treatment switching to tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) and cessation of anticancer therapy. We sought to characterise 
the relationship between radiologic patterns of progression and survival 
post-ICI, also appraising treatment strategies.
METHODS: We screened 604 HCC patients treated with ICIs, including only those 
who experienced PD by data cut-off. We evaluated post-progression survival (PPS) 
according to treatment strategy at PD and verified its relationship with 
radiologic patterns of progression: intrahepatic growth (IHG), new intrahepatic 
lesion (NIH), extrahepatic growth (EHG), new extrahepatic lesion (NEH) and new 
vascular invasion (nVI).
RESULTS: Of 604 patients, 364 (60.3%) experienced PD during observation. Median 
PPS was 5.3 months (95%CI: 4.4-6.9; 271 events). At data cut-off, 165 patients 
(45%) received no post-progression anticancer therapy; 64 patients (17.6%) 
continued ICI beyond PD. IHG (HR 1.64 [95%CI:1.21-2.22]; p=0.0013) and nVI (HR 
2.15 [95%CI:1.38-3.35]; p=0.0007) were associated with shorter PPS. Multivariate 
models adjusted for progression patterns, treatment line, and ALBI grade and 
ECOG-PS at PD confirmed receipt of ICI beyond PD with (HR 0.17, 95%CI 0.09-0.32; 
p<0.0001), or without subsequent TKI (HR 0.39, 95%CI 0.26-0.58; p<0.0001) as 
predictors of prolonged PPS versus no anticancer therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: ICI-TKI sequencing is a consolidated option in advanced HCC. nVI 
and IHG predict poorer prognosis. Despite lack of recommendation, continuation 
of ICI beyond progression in HCC is adopted clinically: future efforts should 
appraise which patients benefit from this approach."
153,"BACKGROUND: Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is characterized by persisting burning 
pain of the oral mucosa, and its etiopathogenesis remains poorly understood. Our 
study aimed to detect the expression of miRNA-206 in the blood and clarify the 
relationship among miRNA-206, pain, anxiety and depression of BMS patients.
METHODS: Thirty patients with BMS and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in 
the experimental and control groups, respectively. Data on medical history and 
clinical oral examination for all participants were collected. Simultaneously, 
scores of Visual Analogous Scale (VAS), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and 
Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were administered. The expression level of 
miRNA-206 in plasma were determined by RT-(q)PCR. Finally, and the relationship 
of miRNA-206 expression with the VAS score, SAS score, and SDS score was 
analyzed. χ2 test, t-test were used for statistical analysis of the data, and P 
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The majority of the patients with BMS identified the tongue as the main 
pain area, and showed dry mouth and poor sleep quality. The SAS and SDS scores 
of patients with BMS were higher than those of healthy controls (P <0.05) and 
were positively correlated with VAS pain score. In addition, miRNA-206 
expression was higher in patients with BMS than in healthy individuals (P 
<0.05), and was positively correlated with the VAS and SDS scores (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BMS suffer from pain and tend to be more anxious and 
depressed than healthy controls. miRNA-206 expression in the peripheral blood of 
patients with BMS is positively correlated with pain and depression, which may 
be involved in the pathogenesis of BMS."
154,"OBJECTIVE: Endothelial cell (EC) coupling occurs through gap junctions and 
underlies cerebral blood flow regulation governed by inward-rectifying (KIR ) 
channels. This study addressed effects of KIR channel activity on EC coupling 
before and during Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Intact EC tubes (width: ~90-100 μm; length: ~0.5 mm) were freshly 
isolated from posterior cerebral arteries of young Pre-AD (1-3 months) and aged 
AD (13-18 months) male and female 3xTg-AD mice. Dual intracellular 
microelectrodes applied simultaneous current injections (±0.5-3 nA) and membrane 
potential (Vm ) recordings in ECs at distance ~400 μm. Elevated extracellular 
potassium ([K+ ]E ; 8-15 mmol L-1 ; reference, 5 mmol L-1 ) activated KIR 
channels.
RESULTS: Conducted Vm (∆Vm ) responses ranged from ~-30 to 30 mV in response to 
-3 to +3 nA (linear regression, R2 ≥0.99) while lacking rectification for charge 
polarity or axial direction of spread. Conduction slope decreased ~10-20% during 
15 mmol L-1 [K+ ]E in Pre-AD males and AD females. 15 mmol L-1 [K+ ]E decreased 
conduction at lower thresholds in AD animals (~±20 mV) versus Pre-AD (~±25 mV). 
AD increased (~10-15%) conducted hyperpolarization during 8-12 mmol L-1 [K+ ]E .
CONCLUSIONS: Brain endothelial KIR channel activity modulates bidirectional 
spread of vasoreactive signals with enhanced regulation of EC coupling during AD 
pathology."
155,"AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the incidence and degree of 
postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions(POAs) in secondary laparoscopic 
procedures and assess the power of the preoperative levels of tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha(TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta(IL-1β) and selected peripheral 
inflammatory biomarkers(PIBs) in the prediction of the development and extent of 
POA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 103 patients who had 
previously undergone at least one or more laparoscopic abdominal or 
gynecological operations. We examined TNF-α, IL-1β, and PIBs, namely C-reactive 
protein, white blood cell count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and systemic immune-inflammation index(SII) 
according to the presence, location, and score of adhesions determined during 
secondary laparoscopic procedures.
RESULTS: Only age, postoperative adhesion index(PAI) score, NLR, SII, TNF-α, and 
IL-1β resulted in a significant difference in the existence of adhesion(P<0.05). 
The correlation analysis of TNF-α with variables showed that the PAI score and 
IL 1β levels had a significantly positive correlation.
CONCLUSION: The presence and extent of POA could be predicted by examining the 
preoperative TNF-α level in patients who had laparoscopic abdominal surgery 
previously. We could overcome adverse events during secondary laparoscopic 
procedures by assessing high-risk patients and integrating a personalized 
surgical approach to managing selected patients."
156,"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a complex treatment used in 
malignancies and some non-malignant diseases. The informed consent process for 
HCT can also be complex due to patient- and process-related barriers. The 
informed consent process needs to be a dynamic and ongoing process, not simply a 
checklist. As a result of the realities of HCT, we highlight some potential 
pitfalls to the informed consent process including uncertainty, sociocultural 
and communication barriers, and decisional regret. The purpose of this 
comprehensive review is to highlight unique situations which can result in 
failure of the informed consent process. We also offer potential solutions to 
these pitfalls, primarily making the informed consent more patient focused 
through dynamic and continuous processes to mitigate decisional regret."
157,"PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the preoperative systemic 
inflammation response index (SIRI) to predict the outcomes after open radical 
cystectomy (RC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the 
institutional cystectomy database and identified 241 consecutive RC patients. 
Patient demographics and oncologic outcomes were noted. We calculated the SIRI 
as previously described (NeutrophilxMonocytes/Lymphocytes), based on the 
blood-tests at the day before surgery and a minimum >30-day later.
RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 20 months (interquartile range 9-52). Two, 3 
and 5 years recurrence free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 60.6%, 
57.1%, 48.9%, and 54.7%, 47.0%, 37.2%, respectively. Patients with preoperative 
SIRI >1.91 had significantly higher recurrence rates (P < 0.001) and lower OS (P 
< 0.001). For internal validation, we evaluated postoperative SIRI >1.91 
(repeatability testing), and again found significantly higher recurrence rates 
(P < 0.001) and lower OS (P = 0.004). Persistently high SIRI increased the 
recurrence and death risk 5.79 and 2.87 fold, respectively. SIRI was also a 
significant independent predictive factor for RFS and OS in the multivariable 
cox regression analyses (P < 0.05). SIRI improved the discriminative ability of 
the models 1.5% to 4.2% and this was quite higher than other inflammatory 
markers (NLR, MLR, PLR, SII) in all models.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SIRI >1.91 had significantly higher recurrence and 
lower OS rates. The cut-off value is validated internally. SIRI is an 
independent predictive factor for RFS and OS. The contribution of SIRI in the 
cox models is higher than other inflammatory markers."
158,"AIM: This paper analyzes the adaptive changes that take place in mature and 
elderly women with different track records in social sports in order to develop 
health and rehabilitation techniques based on personalized and groupwise 
approaches.
METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted between 2009 and 2019 in 
Zhengzhou, China. The sample consisted of 24 mature and elderly women 
(45-65 years old) in the experimental group (regular social sports) and 40 women 
of the same age who did not exercise (control group). The experimental group 
received physiotherapy twice a week. The sessions were scheduled for 10 a.m. and 
lasted for 3 h. The functional status of cardiovascular system parameters (blood 
pressure, heart rate) was measured. In addition, the physical working capacity 
(PWC 150), as well as the coefficient of body adaptation to stress and the 
Robinson index (the amount of oxygen required by the human body to function) 
were estimated.
RESULTS: Women from the experimental group maintained stable coefficients of 
adaptation during all 10 years over which the study was conducted. Women with a 
long track record (up to 10 years) revealed a slight increase in the body's 
functional capacity (P ≤ 0.05 with control). More than 50% of the women in the 
experimental group had cardiovascular measurements within or above the normal 
range, whereas the opposite was true in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The longitudinal study revealed upward trends of physical working 
capacity indicators, which can slow down involutional changes in the body. In 
some cases, the body's functional capacity may be improved. Geriatr Gerontol Int

159,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) contribute significantly to genetic diversity in 
humans, including disease-causing variation. While the effect of STR variation 
on gene expression has been extensively assessed, their impact on epigenetics 
has been poorly studied and limited to specific genomic regions. Here, we 
investigated the hypothesis that some STRs act as independent regulators of 
local DNA methylation in the human genome, and modify risk of common human 
traits. To address these questions, we first analyzed two independent datasets 
comprising PCR-free whole genome sequencing (WGS) and genome-wide DNA 
methylation levels derived from whole blood samples in 245 (discovery cohort) 
and 484 individuals (replication cohort). Utilizing genotypes for 131,635 
polymorphic STRs derived from WGS using HipSTR, we identified 11,870 STRs that 
associated with DNA methylation levels (mSTRs) of 11,774 CpGs (Bonferroni 
p<0.001) in our discovery cohort, with 90% successfully replicating in our 
second cohort. Subsequently, through fine-mapping using CAVIAR we defined 585 of 
these mSTRs as the likely causal variants underlying the observed associations 
(fm-mSTRs), and linked a fraction of these to previously reported genome-wide 
association study signals, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying 
complex human traits. Furthermore, by integrating gene expression data, we 
observed that 12.5% of the tested fm-mSTRs also modulate expression levels of 
nearby genes, reinforcing their regulatory potential. Overall, our findings 
expand the catalog of functional sequence variants that affect genome 
regulation, highlighting the importance of incorporating STRs in future genetic 
association analysis and epigenetics data for the interpretation of 
trait-associated variants."
160,"Surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization (SALDI) acts as a soft 
desorption/ionization technique, which has been widely recognized in 
small-molecule analysis owing to eliminating the requirement of the organic 
matrix. Herein, titania nanosheets (TiO2 NSs) were applied as novel substrates 
for simultaneous analysis and imaging of low-mass molecules and lipid species. A 
wide variety of representative analytes containing amino acids, bases, drugs, 
peptides, endogenous small molecules, and saccharide-spiked urine were examined 
by the TiO2 NS-assisted LDI mass spectrometry (MS). Compared with conventional 
organic matrices and substrates [Ag nanoparticles (NPs), Au NPs, carbon 
nanotubes, carbon NPs, CeO2 microparticles, and P25 TiO2], the TiO2 NS-assisted 
LDI MS method shows higher sensitivity and less spectral interference. 
Repeatability was evaluated with batch-to-batch relative standard deviations for 
5-hydroxytryptophan, glucose-spiked urine, and glucose with addition of internal 
standard, which were 17.4, 14.9, and 2.8%, respectively. The TiO2 NS-assisted 
LDI MS method also allows the determination of blood glucose levels in mouse 
serum with a linear range of 0.5-10 mM. Owing to the nanoscale size and uniform 
deposition of the TiO2 NS matrix, spatial distributions of 16 endogenous small 
molecules and 16 lipid species from the horizontal section of the mouse brain 
tissue can be visualized at a 50 μm spatial resolution. These successful 
applications confirm that the TiO2-assisted LDI MS method has promising 
prospects in the field of life science."
161,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the uterine artery blood flow parameters of patients with 
recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) at different gestational ages and to 
investigate the effects of aspirin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on 
uterine artery blood flow parameters and pregnancy outcomes.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study involving analysis of clinical 
data for 140 patients: 47 in an aspirin group, 49 in a combination group, and 44 
in a control group. The uterine artery blood flow parameters of the three groups 
in the middle luteal period and 10th, 12th, 16th, and 20th gestational weeks 
were compared. Trends in uterine artery flow parameters were predicted by 
function fitting, and the uterine artery flow parameters and pregnancy outcomes 
between different drug administration regimens were compared.
RESULTS: With increasing gestational age, the uterine artery blood flow 
parameters of the three groups gradually decreased. In the middle luteal phase, 
the uterine artery blood flow parameters (mRI, mPI, mS/D) of the recurrent 
spontaneous abortion group, that is, the aspirin and combination groups, were 
significantly higher than those of the control group. Uterine artery blood flow 
parameters from 10 to 20 weeks of gestation were as follows: combined group < 
aspirin group < normal pregnancy group. The mean resistance index (mRI) in the 
combination group decreased most rapidly compared with the aspirin group between 
10 and 20 weeks of gestation. The live birth rate was higher in the combination 
group than in the aspirin group.
CONCLUSIONS: Both aspirin and aspirin combined with LMWH can reduce uterine 
artery blood flow parameters, and combination therapy is superior to aspirin 
alone. In the RSA group, the rate of mRI decline may predict pregnancy outcome 
to some extent. Combination therapy can improve the live birth rate and reduce 
the miscarriage rate."
162,"Red algal polysaccharide is a good potential medical resource. Different red 
algal polysaccharides have different structural characteristics and rich 
biological activities. Previous studies have identified some structural 
information of sulfated polysaccharide (GNP, 25.8 kDa) from red algae, Gelidium 
crinale and found that GNP has excellent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and 
anti-tumor activities. On this basis, this study investigated the effect of GNP 
on atherosclerosis, which is closely related to antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory mechanisms and usually coexists and interacts with 
hypertension. This study investigated the inhibitory activity of GNP on 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its mechanism on oxidized low-density 
lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced HUVEC atherosclerosis. The results showed that GNP 
inhibits the up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules and oxidized low-density 
lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1). GNP can regulate mitogen-activated protein 
kinases (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and PI3K/AKT signal pathways, 
inhibit apoptosis, invasion and migration. Meanwhile, GNP (IC50 = 269.2 μg/mL) 
antagonizes ACE by competitive binding mode, and it can reduce systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). It provides a 
theoretical basis for GNP as a potential substance for the prevention and 
treatment of atherosclerosis."
163,"Spontaneous acute intracerebral hemorrhage (SAIH) is a common and 
life-threatening condition that affects more than three million patients each

neurological impairment. The role of radiology is paramount in optimizing 
patient outcomes by diagnosing SAIH, its potential complications, and the most 
likely etiology. While the positive diagnosis of SAIH is straightforward, the 
etiologic diagnosis is broad, covering primary SAIH (hypertension, cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy) and secondary SAIH (vascular malformations, nonatheromatous

164,"PURPOSE: To explore the effects of combined fenestration of lamina terminalis 
and Liliequist membrane during surgical clipping on the occurrence of chronic 
hydrocephalus in patients with ruptured anterior circulation aneurysm.
METHODS: Clinical data of 78 patients with anterior circulation ruptured 
aneurysms who were treated between June 2018 and January 2021 were 
retrospectively analyzed. Based on the surgical treatment, patients were divided 
into 3 groups: clipping group (26 cases); fenestration group (lamina terminalis 
fenestration combined with clipping, 28 cases); and combination group (lamina 
terminalis fenestration and Liliequist membrane opening combined with clipping, 
24 cases). The incidence of postoperative chronic hydrocephalus, the 
postoperative hydrocephalus shunt rate, and the Glasgow prognostic score (GOS) 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative chronic hydrocephalus in the combined 
group (16.6 %, 4/24) was significantly lower than that in the clipping group 
(46.1 %, 12/26) and the fenestration group (35.7 %, 10/28; P < 0.05). The shunt 
rate of chronic hydrocephalus in the combined group (4.1 %, 1/24) was 
significantly lower than that in the clipping group (30.7 %, 8/26) and the 
fenestration group (17.8 %, 5/28; P < 0.05). The rate of postoperative GOS score 
of 5 in the combined group (75.0 %, 18/24) was significantly higher than that in 
the clipping group (23.0 %, 6/26) and the fenestration group (57.1 %, 16/28; 
P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Aneurysm clipping combined with lamina terminalis fenestration and 
Liliequist membrane opening can reduce the occurrence of chronic hydrocephalus 
and the rate of chronic hydrocephalus shunt surgery, thereby improving the 
prognosis of patients."

166,"INTRODUCTION: Marine casualties are increasing, and mortality from trauma 
associated with immersion in seawater is high. However, the associated 
pathophysiological characteristics remain unclear, limiting research into the 
early emergency treatment strategy.
METHODS: Healthy and 50% hemorrhagic shock rats were soaked in 15°C and 21°C 
seawater for 2 h, 4 h and 6 h, respectively, and the effects on vital signs, 
internal environment, tissue metabolism, lethal triad, vital organ functions and 
survival were observed.
RESULTS: Immersion in seawater can cause death in healthy rats. Rats with 
hemorrhagic shock in 15°C seawater showed a lower survival rate than the 
corresponding groups in 21°C seawater. Moreover, compared with 21°C seawater, 
15°C seawater played a more remarkable role in decreasing mean arterial 
pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate, increasing water content and 
decreasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the brain and lung; increase in plasma 
osmolality, Na+, K+, Cl-, and the occurrence of the lethal triad manifested by a 
decrease in core body temperature, pH, lactate, and an increase in coagulation 
parameters, as well as damage to cardiac, intestinal, hepatic, and renal 
functions in rats with hemorrhagic shock.
CONCLUSIONS: Immersion in seawater at low temperatures could be lethal to 
healthy rats, causing the occurrence of a lethal triad and damage to vital 
organs. Furthermore, 15°C-seawater had a more significant effect than 
21°C-seawater on aggravating the imbalance of internal environment and tissue 
metabolism, resulting in a higher incidence of the lethal triad and thus 
aggravating the dysfunctions of vital organs, which eventually resulted in 
higher mortality in rats with hemorrhagic shock."
167,"BACKGROUND: Tourniquets have been modified and used for centuries to occlude 
blood flow to control hemorrhage. More recently, the occlusion of peripheral 
vessels has been linked to resultant increases in blood pressure, which may 
provide additional therapeutic potential, particularly during states of low 
cardiac output.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate a causal relationship 
between tourniquet application and blood pressure in healthy adults.
METHODS: Healthy adult volunteers were recruited to participate in this 
IRB-approved study. Each participant met inclusion criteria and demonstrated 
baseline normotension. Brachial cuff blood pressure and heart rate were recorded 
pre- and post-tourniquet application to the bilateral legs.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven adults aged 22 to 35 years participated and were included 
in analysis. The average systolic blood pressure was 122 ± 7 mmHg, diastolic 
blood pressure was 72 ± 9 mmHg, and heart rate was 70 ± 13 bpm. Following 
bilateral tourniquet application over the femoral vasculature, we observed a 
statistically significant increase in systolic (7 mmHg, p < 0.001) and diastolic 
(4 mmHg, p = 0.05) blood pressures with no significant change in heart rate (2 
bpm, p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The elevations in systolic and diastolic blood pressures establish 
a dependent relationship between tourniquet application to the lower extremities 
and blood pressure elevation. These results may support new indications for 
tourniquet-use or extremity vessel occlusion in settings of hemodynamic 
instability."
168,"Cryopreservation of red blood cells (RBCs) is imperative for transfusion 
therapy, while cryoprotectants are essential to protect RBCs from cryoinjury 
under freezing temperatures. Trehalose has been considered as a biocompatible 
cryoprotectant that naturally accumulates in organisms to tolerate anhydrobiosis 
and cryobiosis. Herein, we report a feasible protocol that enables glycerol-free 
cryopreservation of human RBCs by integration of the synthesized trehalose 
lipids and dissociative trehalose through ice tuning and membrane stabilization. 
Typically, in comparison with sucrose monolaurate or trehalose only, trehalose 
monolaurate was able to protect cell membranes against freeze stress, achieving 
96.9 ± 2.0% cryosurvival after incubation and cryopreservation of human RBCs 
with 0.8 M trehalose. Moreover, there were slight changes in cell morphology and 
cell functions. It was further confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry and 
osmotic fragility tests that the moderate membrane-binding activity of trehalose 
lipids exerted cell stabilization for high cryosurvival. The aforementioned 
study is likely to provide an alternative way for glycerol-free cryopreservation 
of human RBCs and other types of cells."
169,"HOXA9 is commonly upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it confers 
poor prognosis. Characterising the protein interactome of endogenous HOXA9 in 
human AML, we identified a chromatin complex of HOXA9 with the nuclear matrix 
attachment protein-SAFB. SAFB perturbation phenocopied HOXA9 knockout to 
decrease AML proliferation, increase differentiation and apoptosis in vitro and 
prolonged survival in vivo. Integrated genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic 
analyses further demonstrated that the HOXA9-SAFB-chromatin complex associates 
with NuRD and HP1g to repress the expression of factors associated with 
differentiation and apoptosis, including NOTCH1, CEBPd, S100A8, and CDKN1A. 
Chemical or genetic perturbation of NuRD and HP1g -associated catalytic activity 
also triggered differentiation, apoptosis and the induction of these 
tumor-suppressive genes. Importantly, this mechanism is operative in other 
HOXA9-dependent AML genotypes. This mechanistic insight demonstrates active 
HOXA9-dependent differentiation block as a potent mechanism of disease 
maintenance in AML, that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention via 
therapies targeting the HOXA9/SAFB interface and/or NuRD and HP1g activity."
170,"Aim: To identify genes associated with the prognosis of head and neck squamous

Methods: Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Human Protein Atlas, 
University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer, LinkedOmics, cBioPortal, Cell 
Counting Kit 8, and polymerase chain reaction were used in this study. Results: 
The expression level of nuclear transport factor 2 (NUTF2) was elevated in HNSC 
tissues and was associated with poor prognosis in HNSC patients. NUTF2-targeted 
intervention inhibited the proliferation of HNSC cells. SEC61G, which was 
positively correlated with NUTF2, was decreased in HNSC cells with NUTF2 
suppression. Conclusions: NUTF2 may be correlated with the prognosis and 
development of HNSC, laying the foundation for future studies on the potential 
role of NUTF2 in HNSC."
171,"The DNA-origami technique has enabled the engineering of transmembrane nanopores 
with programmable size and functionality, showing promise in building biosensors 
and synthetic cells. However, it remains challenging to build large (>10 nm), 
functionalizable nanopores that spontaneously perforate lipid membranes. Here, 
we take advantage of pneumolysin (PLY), a bacterial toxin that potently forms 
wide ring-like channels on cell membranes, to construct hybrid DNA-protein 
nanopores. This PLY-DNA-origami complex, in which a DNA-origami ring corrals up 
to 48 copies of PLY, targets the cholesterol-rich membranes of liposomes and red 
blood cells, readily forming uniformly sized pores with an average inner 
diameter of ∼22 nm. Such hybrid nanopores facilitate the exchange of 
macromolecules between perforated liposomes and their environment, with the 
exchange rate negatively correlating with the macromolecule size (diameters of 
gyration: 8-22 nm). Additionally, the DNA ring can be decorated with 
intrinsically disordered nucleoporins to further restrict the diffusion of 
traversing molecules, highlighting the programmability of the hybrid nanopores. 
PLY-DNA pores provide an enabling biophysical tool for studying the 
cross-membrane translocation of ultralarge molecules and open new opportunities 
for analytical chemistry, synthetic biology, and nanomedicine."
172,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are a heterogeneous group of 
cells with expansion, differentiation, and repopulation capacities. How HSPCs 
orchestrate the stemness state with diverse lineage differentiation at steady 
condition or acute stress remains largely unknown. Here, we show that zebrafish 
mutants that are deficient in an epigenetic regulator Atf7ip or Setdb1 
methyltransferase undergo excessive myeloid differentiation with impaired HSPC 
expansion, manifesting a decline in T cells and erythroid lineage. We find that 
Atf7ip regulates hematopoiesis through Setdb1-mediated H3K9me3 modification and 
chromatin remodeling. During hematopoiesis, the interaction of Atf7ip and Setdb1 
triggers H3K9me3 depositions in hematopoietic regulatory genes including cebpβ 
and cdkn1a, preventing HSPCs from loss of expansion and premature 
differentiation into myeloid lineage. Concomitantly, loss of Atf7ip or Setdb1 
derepresses retrotransposons that instigate the viral sensor Mda5/Rig-I like 
receptor (RLR) signaling, leading to stress-driven myelopoiesis and 
inflammation. We find that ATF7IP or SETDB1 depletion represses human leukemic 
cell growth and induces myeloid differentiation with retrotransposon-triggered 
inflammation. These findings establish that Atf7ip/Setdb1-mediated H3K9me3 
deposition constitutes a genome-wide checkpoint that impedes the myeloid 
potential and maintains HSPC stemness for diverse blood cell production, 
providing unique insights into potential intervention in hematological 
malignancy."
173,"Adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) therapies suffer from a number of limitations 
(e.g., poor control of solid tumors), and while combining ACT with cytokine 
therapy can enhance effectiveness, this also results in significant side 
effects. Here, we describe a nanotechnology approach to improve the efficacy of 
ACT therapies by metabolically labeling T cells with unnatural sugar 
nanoparticles, allowing direct conjugation of antitumor cytokines onto the T 
cell surface during the manufacturing process. This allows local, concentrated 
activity of otherwise toxic cytokines. This approach increases T cell 
infiltration into solid tumors, activates the host immune system toward a Type 1 
response, encourages antigen spreading, and improves control of aggressive solid 
tumors and achieves complete blood cancer regression with otherwise noncurative 
doses of CAR-T cells. Overall, this method provides an effective and easily 
integrated approach to the current ACT manufacturing process to increase 
efficacy in various settings."
174,"OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic strip craniectomy for metopic craniosynostosis relies on 
rapid growth and postoperative helmeting for correction. Endoscopic repair is 
generally performed before patients reach 4 months of age, and outcomes in older 
patients have yet to be quantified. Here, the authors examined a cohort of 
patients treated with endoscopic repair before or after 4 months of age to 
determine aesthetic outcomes of delayed repairs.
METHODS: Data from eligible patients were retrospectively assessed and 
aggregated in a dedicated metopic synostosis database. Inclusion criteria were 
radiographically confirmed metopic synostosis and endoscopic treatment. Patients 
were dichotomized into two groups: those younger than 4 months and those 4 
months or older at the time of repair. The frontal width and interfrontal 
divergence angle (IFDA) were measured on reconstructed CT images. These 
measurements, alongside operative time, estimated blood loss, and transfusion 
rates, were compared between groups using the Student t-test or chi-square test.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 28 patients treated before 4 months of 
age and 8 patients treated at 4-6 months of age. Patient sex and perioperative 
complications did not differ by age group. Older age at repair was not 
significantly associated with 1-year postoperative IFDA (140° ± 4.2° vs 142° ± 
5.0°, p = 0.28) or frontal width (84 ± 5.2 vs 83 ± 4.4 mm, p = 0.47).
CONCLUSIONS: One-year postoperative IFDA and frontal width do not differ 
significantly between patients treated before and after 4 months of age. Further 
study with longer follow-up is necessary to confirm the longevity of these 
results at skeletal maturity."
175,"OBJECTIVES: Regarding neurocognitive and immunomodulatory properties of cinnamon 
(Cinn) we aimed to investigate whether cinnamon regulates acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) activity, and oxidative abnormalities with concomitant memory dysfunction 
in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes.
METHODS: 47 male adult rats were divided into seven groups (n=8 animals): 
Control group: in these non-diabetic rats only saline 0.9% NaCl was gavaged, 
Diabetic (Dia) group: diabetic rats in them saline 0.9% NaCl was gavaged for six 
weeks. Dia-Cinn 100, Dia-Cinn 200, and Dia-Cinn 400, Dia-Met groups: in these 
diabetic rats the extract (100, 200, 400 mg/kg respectively) or metformin 
(300 mg/kg) was gavaged for six weeks. Passive avoidance performance, AChE 
enzyme activity, and oxidative indicators were examined among the groups.
RESULTS: vs. the Control group, blood glucose level and stay time in the dark 
were remarkably increased in Dia group whereas the latency time was decreased. 
Meanwhile, antioxidant levels (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and thiols) 
noticeably decreased in the Dia group compared to the Control group. On the 
other hand, Cinn extract espicailly at the highest dose recovered the changes 
similar to those found in the metformin-treated group.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings proposed that the cinnamon hydro-ethanolic extract 
promotes memory recovery in diabetic conditions through the atteuation of the 
AChE activity and oxidative injury."
176,"Purpose: To explore the surgical techniques and clinical value of pure 
transperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy (LNU) plus bladder cuff excision 
(BCE) conducted without changing the patient's position in the treatment of 
upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Methods: From August 2018 to July 2021, 
we retrospectively reviewed 66 patients who underwent LNU + BCE in a single 
position. Then, their demographic characteristics, perioperative and 
pathological outcomes, and postoperative follow-up data were evaluated. Results: 
All 66 operations in this group were successfully completed without conversion 
to open surgery. The mean operative time was 125 ± 47 minutes, whereas the 
estimated blood loss was 10 (10, 15) mL. The median postoperative drainage time 
was 4 (3.8, 6.0) days, the time to catheter extraction after the operation was 
4.5 (3.0, 6.0) days, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 6 (5, 7) 
days. Pathological results showed urothelial carcinoma in 65 cases, including 56 
high-grade and 9 low-grade cases. Lymph node metastasis was found in 8 cases of 
high-grade urothelial carcinoma. All the surgical margins were negative. The 
median follow-up was 16.5 (11.0-25.6) months, and there was neither tumor 
recurrence nor distant metastasis. Conclusions: Pure transperitoneal LNU + BCE 
in a single position is a safe and effective minimally invasive technique for 
UTUC and is worthy of clinical application and promotion. It takes advantage of 
a programmed procedure, short operation time, less blood loss, less trauma, and 
quick recovery after the operation. However, multicenter randomized controlled 
studies with large samples are needed to further confirm these findings. Trial 
Registration: The study was registered at Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of 
Medical Sciences (No. 22/054-3255) and the registration date is August 2018."
177,"Background: In the difficult gallbladder, the rate of bile duct injury (BDI) 
remains high. To lessen iatrogenic biliary injury, we attempted to utilize 
indocyanine green (ICG)-guided fluorescence cholangiography during surgery to 
illuminate the extrahepatic biliary tract. Materials and Methods: According to 
admission criteria, 38 patients were diagnosed with difficult gallbladder and 
underwent percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD). Consecutive 
patients who underwent ICG-assisted laparoscopic biliary surgery (n = 18, ICG 
group) or conventional laparoscopic biliary surgery (n = 20, white light [WL 
group) were enrolled in this study. ICG group received ICG fluorescent 
cholangiography via PTGBD tube during operation; 16 cases of laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy (LC) and 2 cases of LC plus laparoscopic common bile duct 
exploration (LC+LCBDE) were performed by fluorescent laparoscopy. In the WL 
group, 16 cases of LC, 1 case of laparoscopic subtotal cholecystectomy (LSC), 
and 3 cases of LC+LCBDE were performed under white light without ICG. Result: 
The biliary system was successfully established in the ICG group. Compared with 
the WL group, the anatomy of the Calot's triangle with severe abdominal adhesion 
or local inflammatory edema was more clearly displayed by fluorescence. 
Laparoscopic surgery was completed in both groups without conversion to 
laparotomy. There were no significant differences in surgery-related 
complications (P = .232) and postoperative hospital stay (P = .074) between the 
two groups. However, compared with the WL group, the ICG group had less 
intraoperative blood loss (P = .002) and shorter operation duration (P = .006). 
Conclusion: ICG fluorescence cholangiography has good clinical application value 
in the difficult gallbladder, which can avoid iatrogenic BDI, reduce 
surgery-related complications and intraoperative blood loss, and shorten the 
duration of surgery."
178,"Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) represents a rare distinct lymphoma entity with 
plasmablastic morphology and plasmacytic immunophenotype that is characterized 
by an aggressive clinical course. Standard chemotherapeutic regimens often 
remain insufficient to cure affected patients. Recently, comprehensive molecular 
analyses of large cohorts of primary PBL samples have revealed the mutational 
landscape as well as the pattern of copy number alterations of this rare 
lymphoma subtype. Identification of recurrent aberrations affecting the 
JAK-STAT, RAS-RAF, NOTCH, IRF4, and MYC signaling pathways drive the molecular 
pathogenesis of PBL and hold great potential for novel targeted therapeutic

179,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases without a 
care standard and show variability in treatment outcomes. This Spanish, 
observational, prospective study ERASME (CEL-SMD-2012-01) assessed the evolution 
of newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve high-risk MDS patients (according to 
IPPS-R). 204 patients were included: median age 73.0 years, 54.4% males, 69.6% 
0-1 ECOG, and 94.6% with comorbidities. Active treatment was the most common 
strategy (52.0%) vs. stem cell transplantation (25.5%) and supportive 
care/watchful-waiting (22.5%). Overall (median) event-free survival was 
7.9 months (9.1, 8.3, and 5.3); progression-free survival: 10.1 months (12.9, 
12.8, and 4.3); and overall survival: 13.8 months (15.4, 14.9; 8.4), 
respectively, with significant differences among groups. Adverse events (AEs) of 
≥3 grade were reported in 72.6% of patients; serious AEs reported in 60.6%. 
33.1% of patients died due to AEs. Three patients developed second primary 
malignant neoplasms (median: 8.2 months). Our study showed better outcomes in 
patients receiving active therapy early after diagnosis."
180,"Background: Remote physiological monitoring (RPM) is a form of telehealth that 
measures vital signs at home and automatically reports the results to providers, 
thereby possibly improving chronic disease management. Medicare payment for RPM 
began in 2019. Two potential obstacles to RPM growth are the paucity of 
published clinical outcomes data and the Medicare requirement that monitoring be 
done at least 16 days per month to bill for the service. To help address these 
issues, we report the following uncontrolled observational study. Methods: A 
total of 1,102 consecutive patients enrolled in RPM were divided into four 
groups based on initial average mean arterial pressure (MAP) and into six groups 
based on the number of days per month MAP was measured. We report changes in MAP 
after 6 months of RPM as a function of initial MAP, and number of days per month 
MAP was monitored. Results: After 6 months of RPM, average MAP dropped from 97 
to 93 (p < 0.01). This drop was greatest in the 50% of patients initially 
hypertensive. These patients saw average MAP reductions from 106 to 97 (p < 
0.001) and became normotensive. Although MAP reduction was greatest the more 
frequently patients measured, significant reduction occurred in the hypertensive 
patients whether they measured more or less than 16 days per month (p < 0.001). 
No minimum threshold of measurements was found that predicted failure of RPM to 
lower MAP. Conclusions: RPM is associated with clinically and statistically 
significant reductions in average MAP in patients who were initially 
hypertensive. This benefit occurred irrespective of the number of days per month 
patients measured MAP."
181,"People with sickle cell disease (pwSCD) are at risk of developing lung 
conditions that complicate their sickle cell disease (SCD) but often face 
healthcare access barriers. An interdisciplinary SCD-pulmonary clinic was 
created in 2014 at Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) to address access 
barriers that may prevent optimized treatment. We hypothesize that pwSCD and 
pulmonary disease would have fewer hospitalizations for acute chest syndrome 
(ACS), asthma, and vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) in the two years after their 
initial SCD-pulmonary clinic visit compared to the two years prior. From 
2014-2020,119 pwSCD were evaluated in the SCD-pulmonary clinic and followed at 
NCH for at least two years before and after this visit. Acute care outcomes, 
pulmonary function, polysomnography, echocardiogram, laboratory, and medication 
prescribing data were collected and analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed ranked 
and McNemar's tests. The median number of acute care visits for ACS (p<0.001) 
and asthma (p=0.006) were significantly lower during the two years after pwSCD's 
initial SCD-pulmonary clinic evaluation compared to the two years prior. Asthma 
and allergic rhinitis were more frequently diagnosed and prescriptions for 
hydroxyurea (p=0.005) and inhaled corticosteroids (p=0.005) were more common in 
the post SCD-pulmonary clinic period. The median number of prescribed systemic 
corticosteroids was lower in the two years following SCD-pulmonary clinic 
evaluation (p<0.0001). Lactate dehydrogenase and white blood cell counts also 
significantly decreased. Implementing a multidisciplinary SCD-pulmonary clinic 
is feasible and may allow improved management of pulmonary problems and lead to 
improvements in health and acute care utilization."
182,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells found in a variety of 
tissues in the body, including but not limited to bone marrow, adipose tissue, 
umbilical cord, and umbilical cord blood. Given their immunomodulatory effect 
and ability to be readily isolated from several tissues, they have great 
potential to be used as a therapeutic agent in a variety of immune-mediated 
disorders. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a persistent and relapsing immune skin 
condition that has recently become more common in several species such as 
humans, canines, equines, and felines. The use of MSCs to treat AD has piqued 
the great interest of researchers in recent years. In this article, we review 
the recent understanding of AD pathology and advances in preclinical and 
clinical studies of MSCs, MSCs-derived conditional media and exosomes as 
therapeutic tools to treat AD."
183,"Background: Anaplasma ovis are obligate intracellular bacteria that can endanger 
human and animal health, and they can be transmitted by arthropod vectors, such 
as Melophagus ovinus and ticks. Materials and Methods: In this study, 433 
specimens, including 370 M. ovinus and 63 sheep blood samples, were collected 
from nine districts of South Xinjiang to investigate the distribution and 
molecular epidemiology of A. ovis in M. ovinus and small ruminant. Results: DNA 
of A. ovis was detected in 109 (25.2%, 109/433) of the 433 samples using PCR and 
sequencing. The analysis of A. ovis msp4 sequences revealed four different 
genotypes, including genotype III (47.7%; 52/109), GB3 (34.0%; 37/109), AoGOv3 
(15.6%; 17/109), and XJ9 (2.8%; 3/109). Conclusions: To the best of our 
knowledge, A. ovis genotypes GB3, AoGOv3, and XJ9 detected in this study are the 
first to be reported in M. ovinus, and our data indicate that XJ9 is a novel A. 
ovis genotype presented herein for the first time. These findings provide 
important references for the new understanding and prevention of A. ovis in 
border counties in China."
184,"A triple-amplified and ratiometric electrochemical aptasensor for CA125 was 
designed based on hemin-graphene/SH-β-cyclodextrin@PdPt nanoflower 
(H-Gr/SH-β-CD@PdPtNF) composites and an exonuclease I (Exo I)-assisted strategy. 
In the nanocomposite, hemin acts as an internal reference signal owing to the 
reversible heminox/heminred pair. PdPtNFs can significantly improve the electron 
transfer rate. SH-β-CD can efficiently enrich quercetin probes through 
host-guest recognition and increase the second indicator signal. In the presence 
of CA125, due to the specific binding between the aptamer and CA125, the 
conformational change of dsDNA (designed by the CA125 aptamer and its 
complementary DNA) results in the release of quercetin embedded in dsDNA. 
Subsequently, the free quercetin and DNA fragments are enriched on the 
H-Gr/SH-β-CD@PdPtNF-modified electrode. Thus, an enhanced oxidation peak from 
quercetin (IQ) and a reduced peak from hemin (Ihemin) can indicate the same 
biological identification event. In addition, the recycling amplification of 
CA125 by Exo I can effectively assist the increase of the quercetin signal. The 
value of IQ/Ihemin is linear with the concentration of CA125 in the range from 
6.0 × 10-4 to 1.0 × 103 ng/mL, and the limit of detection is 1.4 × 10-4 ng/mL. 
The recovery of CA125 in human blood serum samples was from 99.2 to 104.4%. The 
proposed sensor is sensitive and reliable, which provides an avenue for the 
development of triple amplification and ratiometric signal strategies for 
detecting tumor markers in clinical diagnostics."
185,"Background: The validated SAMANTA questionnaire allows identification of women 
with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB); that is, with excessive menstrual bleeding 
that interferes with quality of life (QoL). We assessed its value for monitoring 
HMB treatment in clinical practice. Material and Methods: This is a prospective 
observational study conducted between December 2018 and March 2021 in 
consecutively recruited women with HMB attending gynecologists' offices who 
started a hormonal treatment. Sociodemographic characteristics were recorded at 
enrollment. At baseline and month 12, we assessed the HMB (SAMANTA 
questionnaire), the global impression of menstrual bleeding severity in patients 
(PGI-S) and clinicians (CGI-S), and the QoL (SF36). At month 12, we assessed the 
global impression of menstrual bleeding change in patients (PGI-C) and 
clinicians (CGI-C). Changes in SAMANTA questionnaire score at month 12 were 
compared with the presence of amenorrhea and changes in blood loss, menstrual 
period duration, and PGI-S, PGI-C, CGI-S, and CGI-C. Results: The study included 
371 women aged 41.2 ± 6.5 years, 87% of whom were using the levonorgestrel 
intrauterine system. The SAMANTA questionnaire score significantly decreased in 
97.3% of women. The decrease was greater in women reporting a reduction in blood 
loss, shorter menstrual bleeding duration, or a strong improvement in menstrual 
bleeding severity (PGI-S and CGI-S) or amount (PGI-C and CGI-C) (p < 0.001 for 
all), but not amenorrhea. SF-36 domains improved significantly; changes being 
inversely associated with changes in the SAMANTA questionnaire score. 
Conclusions: The SAMANTA questionnaire seems a valuable tool for monitoring 
hormonal treatment for HMB. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03751800."
186,"Background: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causes a highly 
contagious tick-borne disease with high case-fatality rates in humans. It is 
circulating not only in many Asian and African countries, but also spreading to 
and within Europe. To cope better with future outbreaks of Crimean-Congo 
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), the WHO has prioritized the need for the development 
and validation of CCHF diagnostics, including serological assays. In this study, 
we evaluated the performance of the new EUROIMMUN anti-CCHFV IgM and IgG 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Materials and Methods: Both ELISAs 
were compared to the Vector-Best VectoCrimean-CHF-IgM and -IgG ELISAs using the 
EUROIMMUN CCHFV Mosaic 2 IgM and IgG indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) as 
reference. Forty-nine acute-phase serum samples from patients with CCHFV 
infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
and/or anti-CCHFV IgM IFA positivity were used to determine assay sensitivity. 
The assessment of specificity was based on sera from 30 control patients, 30 
healthy blood donors, and 29 patients with hantavirus or sandfly fever virus 
infections. All samples originated from Turkey. Results: Sensitivity of the 
EUROIMMUN ELISAs (IgM 98.0%, IgG 47.1%) exceeded that of the Vector-Best ELISAs 
(IgM 95.9%, IgG 35.3%). Specificity of the EUROIMMUN ELISA IgM (86.4%) was 
slightly higher compared with the Vector-Best ELISA IgM (84.7%), while 
specificity for IgG was 100% for both assays. Qualitative agreement between the 
EUROIMMUN and Vector-Best ELISAs was substantial for detecting anti-CCHFV IgM 
(84.1%, ĸ = 0.673) and IgG (94.9%, ĸ = 0.791), whereas the quantitative results 
indicated a very strong positive correlation (IgM: r = 0.868, IgG: r = 0.913). 
Conclusion: The new EUROIMMUN anti-CCHFV ELISAs are standardized and easy-to-use 
tools that reliably support the identification of acute CCHF cases, and thus 
suitable for laboratories involved in on-site outbreak support."
187,"IMPORTANCE: Treatment at high-volume centers (HVCs) has been associated with 
improved overall survival (OS) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC); however, it is unclear how patterns of referral affect these findings.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the relative contributions of treatment site and 
selection bias in driving differences in outcomes in patients with PDAC and to 
characterize socioeconomic factors associated with referral to HVCs.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: A population-based retrospective review of the 
Oregon State Cancer Registry was performed from 1997 to 2019 with a median 4.3 
months of follow-up. Study participants were all patients diagnosed with PDAC in 
Oregon from 1997 to 2018 (n = 8026).
EXPOSURES: The primary exposures studied were diagnosis and treatment at HVCs 
(20 or more pancreatectomies for PDAC per year), low-volume centers ([LVCs] less 
than 20 per year), or both.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: OS and treatment patterns (eg, receipt of 
chemotherapy and primary site surgery) were evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis 
and logistic regression, respectively.
RESULTS: Eight thousand twenty-six patients (male, 4142 [52%]; mean age, 71 
years) were identified (n = 3419 locoregional, n = 4607 metastatic). Patients 
receiving first-course treatment at a combination of HVCs and LVCs demonstrated 
improved median OS for locoregional and metastatic disease (16.6 [95% CI, 
15.3-17.9] and 6.1 [95% CI, 4.9-7.3] months, respectively) vs patients receiving 
HVC only (11.5 [95% CI, 10.7-12.3] and 3.9 [95% CI, 3.5-4.3] months, 
respectively) or LVC-only treatment (8.2 [95% CI, 7.7-8.7] and 2.1 [95% CI, 
1.9-2.3] months, respectively; all P < .001). No differences existed in disease 
burden by volume status of diagnosing institution. When stratifying by site of 
diagnosis, HVC-associated improvements in median OS were smaller (locoregional: 
10.4 [95% CI, 9.5-11.2] vs 9.9 [95% CI, 9.4-10.4] months; P = .03; metastatic: 
3.6 vs 2.7 months, P < .001) than when stratifying by the volume status of 
treating centers, indicating selection bias during referral. A total of 94% 
(n = 1103) of patients diagnosed at an HVC received HVC treatment vs 18% 
(n = 985) of LVC diagnoses. Among patients diagnosed at LVCs, later year of 
diagnosis and higher estimated income were independently associated with higher 
odds of subsequent HVC treatment, while older age, metastatic disease, and 
farther distance from HVC were independently associated with lower odds.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: LVC-to-HVC referrals for PDAC experienced improved OS 
vs HVC- or LVC-only care. While disease-related features prompting referral may 
partially account for this finding, socioeconomic and geographic disparities in 
referral worsen OS for disadvantaged patients. Measures to improve access to 
HVCs are encouraged."
188,"The effects of combined administration of red ginseng (RG) extracts and 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on immunostimulatory activity and tumor 
metastasis inhibition were investigated in mice. For the immunostimulatory 
activity, splenocyte proliferation, natural killer (NK) cell activity, including 
the production of granzyme B (GrB) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and serum level 
of cytokine such as IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-21 were assessed. Peyer's 
patch cells obtained from mice administered with RG+GABA were cultured, and the 
cytokine level in the culture supernatant and bone marrow (BM) cell 
proliferation activity were examined. The proliferative activity of splenocytes 
was significantly higher in the RG-GABA treatment group than in RG or GABA alone 
(P < .05). In the experimental tumor metastasis model, oral administration of 
RG+GABA showed a higher antitumor metastatic effect compared to that of RG or 
GABA alone. Oral administration of RG+GABA significantly augmented NK 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity against YAC-1 tumor cells. In addition, the 
production of GrB and IFN-γ was stimulated in the culture supernatant of NK 
cells and YAC-1 cells. Serum concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-21 in mice 
with RG+GABA were significantly higher compared to the corresponding blood 
levels in mice administered with RG or GABA alone. The RG+GABA group showed 
significant BM cell proliferation and increased production of IL-6 and 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor compared to that in the 
monotherapy groups. Therefore, RG may have a synergistic effect with GABA for 
enhancing the host defense system such as BM proliferation and NK cell activity 
in a tumor metastasis model."
189,"IMPORTANCE: Lung cancer screening with chest computed tomography (CT) prevents 
lung cancer death; however, fewer than 5% of eligible Americans are screened. 
CXR-LC, an open-source deep learning tool that estimates lung cancer risk from 
existing chest radiograph images and commonly available electronic medical 
record (EMR) data, may enable automated identification of high-risk patients as 
a step toward improving lung cancer screening participation.
OBJECTIVE: To validate CXR-LC using EMR data to identify individuals at 
high-risk for lung cancer to complement 2022 US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS) lung cancer screening eligibility guidelines.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study compared CXR-LC 
estimates with CMS screening guidelines using patient data from a large US 
hospital system. Included participants were persons who currently or formerly 
smoked cigarettes with an outpatient posterior-anterior chest radiograph between 
January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014, with no history of lung cancer or 
screening CT. Data analysis was performed between May 2021 and June 2022.
EXPOSURES: CXR-LC lung cancer screening eligibility (previously defined as 
having a 3.297% or greater 12-year risk) based on inputs (chest radiograph 
image, age, sex, and whether currently smoking) extracted from the EMR.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 6-year incident lung cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 14 737 persons were included in the study population (mean 
[SD] age, 62.6 [6.8] years; 7154 [48.5%] male; 204 [1.4%] Asian, 1051 [7.3%] 
Black, 432 [2.9%] Hispanic, 12 330 [85.2%] White) with a 2.4% rate of incident 
lung cancer over 6 years (361 patients with cancer). CMS eligibility could be 
determined in 6277 patients (42.6%) using smoking pack-year and quit-date from 
the EMR. Patients eligible by both CXR-LC and 2022 CMS criteria had a high rate 
of lung cancer (83 of 974 patients [8.5%]), higher than those eligible by 2022 
CMS criteria alone (5 of 177 patients [2.8%]; P < .001). Patients eligible by 
CXR-LC but not 2022 CMS criteria also had a high 6-year incidence of lung cancer 
(121 of 3703 [3.3%]). In the 8460 cases (57.4%) where CMS eligibility was 
unknown, CXR-LC eligible patients had a 5-fold higher rate of lung cancer than 
ineligible (127 of 5177 [2.5%] vs 18 of 2283 [0.5%]; P < .001). Similar results 
were found in subgroups, including female patients and Black persons.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using routine chest radiographs and other data 
automatically extracted from the EMR, CXR-LC identified high-risk individuals 
who may benefit from lung cancer screening CT."
190,"Surface anchored polymer brushes prepared by surface-initiated controlled 
radical polymerization (SI-CRP) have raised considerable interest in 
biomaterials and bioengineering. However, undesired residues of noxious 
transition metal catalysts critically restrain their widespread biomedical 
applications. Herein, we present a robust and biocompatible surface-initiated 
controlled radical polymerization catalyzed by a Sn(0) sheet (SI-Sn0CRP) under 
ambient conditions. Through this approach, microliter volumes of vinyl monomers 
with diverse functions (heterocyclic, ionic, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic) could 
be efficiently converted to homogeneous polymer brushes. The excellent 
controllability of SI-Sn0CRP strategy is further demonstrated by the exquisite 
fabrication of predetermined block and patterned polymer brushes through chain 
extension and photolithography, respectively. Additionally, in virtue of 
intrinsic biocompatibility of Sn, the resultant polymer brushes present 
transcendent affinity toward blood and cell, in marked contrast to those of 
copper-based approaches. This strategy could provide an avenue for the 
controllable fabrication of biocompatible polymer brushes toward biological 
applications."
191,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analyses to examine 
the therapeutic effect of garlic on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases for 
retrieving articles investigating the impact of garlic on NAFLD patients. The 
comprehensive meta-analysis software version 2.0 was used for statistical 
analysis. The standardized mean difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI) 
was reported and the effect size was calculated.
RESULTS: A preliminary search yielded a total of 293 articles. After screening 
articles based on inclusion criteria, four articles were included in the final 
analyses. This systematic review included 186 patients with NAFLD. The result of 
the meta-analysis showed significant differences between the garlic and placebo 
groups regarding changes in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, 
triglyceride, and fasting blood sugar. Moreover, the probability of a decrease 
in hepatic steatosis was 2.75 times lower in the garlic group compared with the 
placebo group (RR [95% CI]: 2.75 [1.79, 4.23], p-value<0.001).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that garlic supplementation had a 
positive effect on hepatic steatosis, liver enzyme levels, and metabolic profile 
of patients with NAFLD. However, considering the potential limitation of the 
included studies, more high-quality clinical trials are needed."
192,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the 
pathological loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, which causes an 
insufficient release of dopamine (DA) and then induces motor and nonmotor 
symptoms. Hyperoside (HYP) is a lignan component with anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. In this study, 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its active neurotoxic 
metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) were used to induce 
dopaminergic neurodegeneration. The results showed that HYP (100 µg/mL) reduced 
MPTP-mediated cytotoxicity of SH-SY5Y cells in vitro, and HYP [25 mg/(kg d)] 
alleviated MPTP-induced motor symptoms in vivo. HYP treatment reduced the 
contents of nitric oxide (NO), H2O2, and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as the 
mitochondrial damage of dopaminergic neurons, both in vitro and in vivo. 
Meanwhile, HYP treatment elevated the levels of neurotrophic factors such as 
glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 
and recombinant cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor in vivo, but not in vitro. 
Finally, Akt signaling was activated after the administration of HYP in 
MPP+/MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, the blockage of the 
Akt pathway with Akt inhibitor did not abolish the neuroprotective effect of HYP 
on DA neurons. These results showed that HYP protected the dopaminergic neurons 
from the MPP+- and MPTP-induced injuries, which did not rely on the Akt pathway."
193,"Tirabrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treating B-cell 
malignancies. We report the final results of a Phase I study of tirabrutinib in 
17 Japanese patients with B-cell malignancies. Patients were administered 
tirabrutinib at a dose of 160 mg, 320 mg, or 480 mg once daily, or 300 mg twice 
daily (N = 3, 3, 4, and 7, respectively). Three patients continued tirabrutinib 
until study completion (November 30, 2020). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in all 
17 patients, with Grade 3-4 AEs in 8 (47.1%), serious AEs in 7 (41.2%), 
drug-related AEs in 16 (94.1%), and Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs in 6 (35.3%). 
Drug-related AEs reported in 3 or more patients were rash, vomiting, 
neutropenia, arthralgia, and malaise. One additional serious AE (benign neoplasm 
of the lung, unrelated to tirabrutinib) occurred after the previous data cutoff 
(January 4, 2018). Tirabrutinib administration and response assessment were 
continued for over 4 years in 4 patients. The overall response rate was 76.5% 
(13/17 patients). The median (range) time to response and duration of response 
were 0.9 (0.9-5.9) months and 2.59 (0.08-5.45) years, respectively. These 
findings demonstrate the long-term safety and efficacy of tirabrutinib in 
Japanese patients with B-cell malignancies.Clinical trial registration:

194,"The predictive value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) in severely 
burned patients remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential 
association between admission RDW and outcomes in patients with severe burns. 
Data of severely burned patients in the burn center of Changhai Hospital were 
retrospectively evaluated. The relationship between admission RDW and mortality 
was analyzed and displayed using the receiver operating characteristic curve, 
Kaplan-Meier curve, Cox proportional hazards regression, and the nomogram 
method. A total of 342 patients were identified according to the filter 
criteria. The 30-day mortality was 12.9%, and the mortality rates in 7 days and 
90 days were 2.9% and 16.7%, respectively. Patients with high admission RDW 
value were more likely to die than those with low RDW value. Multivariate 
analysis revealed that higher admission RDW, age, full-thickness burned area, 
and inhalation injury were independent risk factors with 30-day mortality. The 
nomogram based on these risk factors was established to predict survival 
probability in severe burn patients. The C-index of different follow-up times 
was computed between 0.867 and 0.904, and the nomogram model list fits the data 
well. Admission RDW played a valuable role in predicting short-term mortality in 
patients with severe burns. The nomogram containing admission RDW was 
established to predict mortality, which helps burn care providers identify the 
patients at higher risk of short-term mortality after severe burns. More 
attention should be paid to the application of these easy and inexpensive 
biochemical indicators in the early prediction of disease progression."
195,"Previous studies have extensively explored impacts of trace elements on human 
beings and complex relationships with cancers. However, contradictory 
conclusions may be more challenging to explain due to biological specimen 
differences. To investigate the distribution of trace elements inside body, we 
collected serum, whole blood and tissues from 77 patients with esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), as well as serum and whole blood from 100 
healthy individuals, and determined the concentrations of 13 elements (Al, V, 
Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Cd, and Pb) with inductively coupled 
plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Al, Ni, Cu, Sr, and Cd variations between 
patients and controls were found to be inconsistent in serum and blood. 
Concentrations of Cu, As, Se, and Sr in serum were positively correlated with 
that in whole blood in both case and control group (rs >0.450, P <0.01). 
Elements in serum had a higher accuracy (87.0%) than whole blood (74.0%) in 
classifying ESCC patients and healthy individuals with discriminant analysis. 
As, Cd, and Pb concentrations in cancerous tissues were positively correlated 
with those in normal epithelium (rs =0.397, 0.571, and 0.542, respectively), 
while Mn, Cu, and Se accumulated in malignant tissues, with V, Cr, Co, Ni, Sr, 
and Cd partitioning in normal epithelium (all P <0.05). Thus, certain elements 
in blood, such as Cu, As, Se, and Sr, were useful in assessing element exposure 
burdens and accumulation tendency of some elements (Mn, Cu and Se, etc.) was 
uncovered in tumors. Our investigation demonstrated the variations in trace 
element distribution for frequently used specimens and further evidence of 
etiological mechanism is necessary."
196,"Glucosamine is widely prescribed as a dietary supplement used to treat 
arthritis. In this study, the radioprotective ability of glucosamine was 
evaluated against radiation-induced genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes. Blood samples were collected from five healthy 
male donors and were divided into four groups. Isolated lymphocytes and blood 
samples were treated with 10 µM of glucosamine for 2 h before exposure to 2 Gy 
radiation. The radioprotective potential of glucosamine was assessed by 
micronucleus assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level analysis, and flow 
cytometry. Irradiation significantly increased the micronuclei frequency as 
compared to the control group. Contrary to that pretreatment with glucosamine 
before irradiation significantly reduced the frequency of micronuclei. 
Furthermore, pretreatment with glucosamine significantly prevented the 
percentage of apoptotic lymphocytes. Also, glucosamine pretreatment 
significantly reduced the production of ROS in irradiated lymphocytes. This 
study shows glucosamine to be a potent radioprotector against radiation that 
induces DNA damage and apoptosis in human lymphocytes. Several additional in 
vivo and in vitro studies are needed before glucosamine can be considered as a 
radioprotective candidate in patients undergoing radiation therapy."
197,"PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is frequently accompanied by 
hypertension, resulting in cardiovascular comorbidities. Continuous positive 
airway pressure is a standard therapy for OSA but has poor adherence. 
Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) may reduce airway collapsibility and 
sympathetic output, which may decrease OSA severity and blood pressure. In this 
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we evaluated the efficacy 
of IMT in patients with OSA.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and 
ClinicalTrials.gov databases for relevant RCTs published before November 2022.
RESULTS: Seven RCTs with a total of 160 patients with OSA were included. 
Compared with the control group, the IMT group exhibited significantly lower 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean difference [MD]: - 10.77 
and - 4.58 mmHg, respectively), plasma catecholamine levels 
(MD: - 128.64 pg/mL), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (MD: - 3.06), and Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale score (MD: - 4.37). No significant between-group differences 
were observed in the apnea-hypopnea index, forced vital capacity (FVC), ratio of 
forced expiratory volume in 1 s to FVC, or adverse effects. The data indicate 
comprehensive evidence regarding the efficacy of IMT for OSA. However, the level 
of certainty (LOC) remains low.
CONCLUSION: IMT improved blood pressure- and sleep-related outcomes without 
causing adverse effects and may thus be a reasonable option for lowering blood 
pressure in patients with OSA. However, additional studies with larger sample 
sizes and rigorous study designs are warranted to increase the LOC."
198,"BACKGROUND: Surgical intervention has been shown to have good post-operative 
outcomes in patients with chronic pancreatitis with pain refractory to oral 
analgesics. We present our initial experience with robotic lateral 
pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ) and modified Frey's procedure (MFP).
METHODOLOGY: Patients with chronic calcific pancreatitis were evaluated with 
routine biochemical and radiological investigations. The indication of surgery 
was intractable pain which was recorded by an Intensity Frequency, Consequence 
(IFC) pain score. The patient was placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position 
with four 8-mm robotic ports and one 12-mm assistant port. Robotic ultrasound 
was utilized to identify the pancreatic duct. After retrieving all the calculi, 
which was confirmed by pancreatoscopy with the help of a video choledochoscope 
and performing the head coring in particular cases, the Roux-en-Y LPJ was 
performed.
RESULTS: Among five patients (4 males, one female), robotic LPJ was performed in 
2 and MFP in 3 patients. The cohort's median age was 32 (interquartile range 
(IQR), 28, 40) years, and the median (IQR) pancreatic duct size was 9 (9, 13) 
mm. The median (IQR) duration of the procedure was 385 (380, 405) minutes, with 
a median (IQR) blood loss of 100 (50-100) ml, and the patients were discharged 
on median post-operative day 5. The patients continue to do well at a median 
follow-up of 3-30 months without the requirement of oral analgesics.
CONCLUSION: Robotic LPJ and MFP are feasible in experienced hands with good 
post-operative outcomes and enhanced quality of life. Intra-operative 
pancreatoscopy with the help of a choledochoscope can be utilized to ascertain 
the complete clearance of pancreatic duct stones and the consequent pain relief."
199,"PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the effect of repeated transforaminal epidural 
low-dose dexamethasone injections on glucose profiles and pituitary-adrenal axis 
functions of diabetic and non-diabetic patients with low back pain.
METHODS: A total of 28 patients (ten diabetic [DM group] and 18 non-diabetic 
patients [non-DM group]) with low back pain were followed-up. Transforaminal 
epidural low-dose dexamethasone (1.65 mg) injections were repeated every 
7-14 days for 8 weeks. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 
morning plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and cortisol levels were measured at 
baseline and during the 8-week follow-up period.
RESULTS: There were no significant changes in FBS and HbA1c levels between 
baseline and 8-week follow-up period in both DM and non-DM groups (difference in 
FBS [95% confidence Interval, CI]: - 0.6 mg/dL [- 6.4, 5.1], p = 0.83 in the 
non-DM group, - 0.2 mg/dL [- 26.2, 25.8], p = 0.99 in the DM group; difference 
in HbA1c [95% CI] - 0.02% [- 0.1, 0.1], p = 0.69 in the non-DM group, 0.04% 
[- 0.3, 0.4], p = 0.79 in the DM group). There were no significant longitudinal 
changes in ACTH and cortisol levels (ACTH, p = 0.38 [baseline vs. 8 week], 
p = 0.58 [non-DM vs. DM]; cortisol, p = 0.52 [baseline vs. 8 week], p = 0.90 
[non-DM vs. DM]).
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated transforaminal epidural low-dose dexamethasone injections 
provided no significant elevations in blood glucose or suppression of the 
pituitary-adrenal axis for two months from the first injection in both diabetic 
and non-diabetic patients. Our results indicate the intermediate-term safety of 
repeated transforaminal epidural low-dose dexamethasone injections with regard 
to the effect on glucose profile and pituitary-adrenal axis functions."
200,"African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most devastating infectious diseases 
affecting domestic pigs and wild boar. The grave socio-economic impact of 
African swine fever infection at a global level makes large-scale rapid and 
robust diagnosis a critical step towards effective control. Here, we describe 
multiple-probe-assisted DNA capture and amplification technology (MADCAT) - a 
novel, sensitive, simple, and high-throughput method for detecting ASFV directly 
from whole blood or other complex matrices. Through a unique DNA capture 
approach which specifically captures the target DNA onto 96-well plate for 
subsequent amplification, MADCAT abandons the complicated extraction protocol 
and achieves ultrafast and high-throughput detection. The sample-to-result time 
for 96 samples is about 90 min, as compared with the 3-4 h time of the 
conventional real-time qPCR method. The limit of detection (LOD) of MADCAT is 
0.5 copies/μL blood and is 5 times more sensitive than an extraction-based qPCR 
assay when testing serially diluted whole blood samples. The assay is 100% 
specific against other common swine pathogens. In the clinical diagnosis of 96 
field samples, all 22 positive samples were correctly identified with lower Ct 
values than extraction-based qPCR, confirming its high diagnostic sensitivity 
(100%). Owing to its high-throughput, specific high sensitivity, and direct 
detection features, MADCAT shows great potential for use in large-scale ASFV 
surveillance and monitoring for effective disease control. KEY POINTS: • No 
nucleic acid extraction, 100% capture efficiency, and high-throughput • 
Ultra-high sensitivity of 0.5 DNA copies/μL or 6 DNA copies/reaction • The 
sample-to-answer time for 96 samples is about 90 min."
201,"BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of posterior fossa tumors (PFT) in the pediatric 
age group often results in significant intraoperative blood loss. The primary 
objective was to assess the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) on blood loss and 
transfusion requirement in pediatric patients undergoing excision of PFT.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, all pediatric patients ≤ 18 years, who 
underwent PFT resection over a period of 7 years, were included. The patient and 
surgical characteristics, estimated blood loss (EBL), the need for blood and 
blood product transfusion, use of crystalloids, vasopressors, and any adverse 
events like seizures and thromboembolic events were recorded and compared 
between Group A who received TXA and Group B who did not.
RESULTS: The study included 50 patients, out of which 36 belonged to Group A and 
14 to Group B. The median age was 8 years (IQR, 2-17) and the mean BMI was 
16.46 ± 4.11 kg/m2. The mean EBL was 224.29 ± 110.36 ml in group A (n = 36) and 
362 ± 180.11 ml in group B (n = 14) (p = 0.007). The intraoperative volume of 
crystalloid use was significantly higher in group B (p = 0.04). The requirement 
of blood and blood product transfusion was similar between the groups, but the 
volume of blood transfusion per kg body weight was higher in group B, 8.3 (IQR, 
6.7-11.1) ml/kg in Group A versus 10.5 (IQR, 8.1-16.1) ml/kg in Group B (p-value 
0.3). The rates of complications noted in the form of seizures and 
thromboembolic events were comparable.
CONCLUSION: The use of TXA in the pediatric population undergoing PFT resection 
aids in reducing blood loss during the surgery without increasing complications."
202,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether radiomics features derived from 
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) can improve 
the differentiation between radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) and tumor 
recurrence (TR) in glioma patients.
METHODS: A total of 4199 radiomics features were extracted from conventional 
MRI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps, 
obtained from 96 pathologically confirmed WHO grade 2~4 gliomas with enhancement 
after standard treatment. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used 
to test segmentation stability between two doctors. Radiomics features were 
selected using the Mann-Whitney U test, LASSO regression, and RFE algorithms. 
Four machine learning classifiers were adopted to establish radiomics models. 
The diagnostic performance of multiparameter, conventional, and single-parameter 
MRI radiomics models was compared using the area under the curve (AUC). The 
models were evaluated in the subsequent independent validation set (n = 30).
RESULTS: Eight important radiomics features (3 from conventional MRI, 1 from 
ADC, and 4 from CBF) were selected. Support vector machine (SVM) was chosen as 
the optimal classifier. The diagnostic performance of the multiparameter MRI 
radiomics model (AUC 0.96) was higher than that of the conventional MRI (AUC 
0.88), ADC (AUC 0.91), and CBF (AUC 0.95) radiomics models. For subgroup 
analysis, the multiparameter MRI radiomics model showed similar performance, 
with AUCs of 0.98 in WHO grade 2~3 and 0.96 in WHO grade 4.
CONCLUSION: The incorporation of noninvasive DWI and ASL into the MRI radiomics 
model improved the diagnostic performance in differentiating RIBI from TR; ASL, 
especially, played a significant role.
KEY POINTS: • The multiparameter MRI radiomics model was superior to the 
conventional MRI radiomics model in differentiating glioma recurrence from 
radiation-induced brain injury. • Diffusion and perfusion MRI could improve the 
ability of the radiomics model in predicting the progression in patients with 
glioma. • Arterial spin labeling played an important role in predicting glioma 
progression using radiomics models."
203,"Relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is common and is 
associated with a dismal prognosis. Treatment options are limited and the 
understanding of molecular response patterns is still challenging. We analyzed 
the clonal response patterns of 15 patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated 
with selinexor in a phase II trial (SAIL). DNA was analyzed at three time points 
and showed a decline of mutated alleles in FLT3, SF3B1, and TP53 under SAIL 
treatment. Overall survival (OS) was similar between patients with declining 
versus persisting clones. We show an interesting long-term course of a patient 
who relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) with SF3B1- 
and SRSF2-mutated AML and received selinexor as maintenance treatment for 
4 years. Measurable residual disease (MRD) remained detectable for 2 weeks after 
donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in this patient and then remained negative under 
selinexor maintenance treatment. Selinexor was tolerated well and was stopped 
after 4 years of SAIL treatment. We present an exploratory study and identify 
subclonal patterns of patients treated with selinexor."
204,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess prognosis of patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma (NDMM) by combining [18F]-FDG positron emission tomography 
(PET)/CT parameters and clinical indices.
METHODS: Clinical data and PET/CT parameters of 133 NDMM patients were 
retrospectively analyzed for associations between clinical indices and PET/CT 
parameters. Independent predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) were determined. A new prognostic prediction system (NPPS) 
was constructed based on our findings. Prediction effectiveness was compared 
among the NPPS, International Staging System (ISS), Revised ISS (R-ISS), and 
R2-ISS.
RESULTS: Prevalence of elevated β2-microglobulin, serum creatinine (sCr), serum 
calcium (sCa), and C-reactive protein concentrations was higher in patients with 
higher SUVmax (≥ 5.3). Prevalence of elevated sCa, sCr, and extramedullary 
disease (EMD) was higher in patients with a higher number of focal lesions 
(≥ 10). SUVmax, serum free-light chain (sFLC) ratio, and EMD were independent 
predictors of PFS and OS. The NPPS used SUVmax, sFLC ratio, and EMD could 
effectively predict OS and was more effective at prognostication than the ISS, 
R-ISS, and R2-ISS.
CONCLUSIONS: [18F]-FDG PET/CT parameters play a significant role in predicting 
prognosis in NDMM patients. The NPPS based on SUVmax, sFLC ratio, and EMD 
outperformed the ISS, R-ISS, and R2-ISS in prognostication."
205,"Aim: To evaluate the cardiometabolic risk in patients with CAH (21 (OH) enzyme 
deficiency) on the basis of the visceral adiposity index (VAI), which indicates 
dysfunction of the visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Materials and Methods: A total 
of 41 patients and 38 body mass index (BMI), age, and gender-matched healthy 
controls (HC) were included. The patients' and HCs' age, gender, waist 
circumference (WC), BMI information and total cholesterol (TC), high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG) values, smoking, and medication history 
were obtained from medical charts. Weight, height, WC, and blood pressure levels 
were measured. Patients' and HCs' BMI, Framingham risk scores (FRS), VAI and 
Ferriman-Gallwey scores were calculated. The patients' and HCs' age, gender TC, 
HDL, and TG, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEASO4), 17 
hydroxyprogesterone (17(OH)P) values, smoking, and medication history were 
obtained from medical charts. Body fat and muscle mass levels were measured with 
Tanita T 6360. Results: Gender distribution, mean age, and BMI of patients with 
CAH were 34/7, 30 ± 8, 27 ± 5.4; HC subjects 30/8, 30 ± 6, 27 ± 3.8 (P = 0.9, 
0.6, 0.9, respectively). The VAI values of patients with a diagnosis of CAH 3.7 
(2.3-6.9) were found to be significantly higher than those of HC patients 2.5 
(1.8-3.9; P = 0.02). The mean glucocorticoid doses of the patients were 
17 ± 9 mg/day. The glucocorticoid dose level was determined as independent risk 
factor on the FRS (P = 0.03, β = 0.04) and VAI (P = 0.018, β = 0.17). 
Conclusion: Glucocorticoid dose optimization should be done more carefully to 
improve metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes in CAH patients."
206,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated community health volunteer (CHV) strategies to prevent 
non-communicable disease (NCD) care disruption and promote coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) detection among Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians, as 
the pandemic started.
METHODS: Alongside medication delivery, CHVs called patients monthly to assess 
stockouts and adherence, provide self-management and psychosocial support, and 
screen and refer for complications and COVID-19 testing. Cohort analysis was 
undertaken of stockouts, adherence, complications and suspected COVID-19. 
Multivariable models of disease control assessed predictors and non-inferiority 
of the strategy pre-/post-initiation. Cost-efficiency and patient/staff 
interviews assessed implementation.
RESULTS: Overall, 1119 patients were monitored over 8 mo. The mean monthly 
proportion of stockouts was 4.9%. The monthly proportion non-adherent (past 5/30 
d) remained below 5%; 204 (18.1%) patients had complications, with 63 requiring 
secondary care. Mean systolic blood pressure and random blood glucose remained 
stable. For hypertensive disease control, age 41-65 y (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.2 to 
0.78) and with diabetes (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98) had decreased odds, and 
with baseline control had increased odds (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2.31 to 4.13). 
Cumulative suspected COVID-19 incidence (2.3/1000 population) was suggestive of 
ongoing transmission. While cost-efficient (108 US${\$}$/patient/year), funding 
secondary care was challenging.
CONCLUSIONS: During multiple crises, CHVs prevented care disruption and 
reinforced COVID-19 detection."
207,"OBJECTIVE: Surgeons observed that the outcomes after the same repair technique 
in the same type of hypospadias performed by the same surgeon may be different. 
There may be some indeterminate factors that influence the results such as 
subclinical inflammation. Our study evaluated the predictor values of 
inflammatory hematologic parameters on the complications after hypospadias 
repair.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who 
underwent hypospadias repair between January 2016 and January 2019 in our 
clinic. Age at surgery, hypospadias type, repair technique, complications were 
recorded. Patients who underwent Snodgrass repair by a single surgeon were 
included in the study while patients who underwent different techniques or 
procedures that were performed by other surgeons were excluded. The levels of 
white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet and monocyte, the mean 
platelet volumes were recorded from blood test that were performed one day 
before surgery. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), plateletlymphocyte ratio 
(PLR), and other parameters were analyzed to determine their relationship with 
complications after hypospadias surgery.
RESULTS: WBC and neutrophil levels were statistically higher in patients with 
complications (p = 0.006 and 0.017 respectively). Other hematological parameters 
were not different between patients with or without complications. To predict 
the complications, the WBC cutoff was 9500/mm3, the neutrophil cutoff was 
3000/mm3.
CONCLUSIONS: WBC and neutrophil values were statistically significant in 
predicting the complications after Snodgrass repair in patients with 
hypospadias. Our result determined no relation between complications and NLR, 
PLR."
208,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated AB0 blood groups prevalence according to 
preoperative and pathological tumor characteristics, and their association with 
oncological outcomes, and renal function decline in a contemporary large cohort 
of bladder cancer (BCa) patients, who underwent radical cystectomy (RC) at a 
tertiary referral center.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data of patients with 
histologically confirmed and clinically non metastatic BCa, who underwent RC 
between 2014 and 2021 at our Institution. Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots and Cox 
regression (CR) models tested the relationship between AB0 blood groups and 
local recurrence-, metastasis-, cancer specific mortality-, and overall 
mortality-free survival. Logistic regression (LR) models tested the association 
between AB0 blood groups and renal function decline, defined as an estimated 
Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min, at post-operative day 1, 
discharge and 6- months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Of 301 included patients, 128 (42.5%) had group A, 126 (41.9%) had 
group 0, 28 (9.3%) had group B, and 19 (6.3%) had group AB. Patients with group 
0 developed higher rates of muscle- invasive BCa (p = 0.028) with high-grade 
features (p = 0.005) at last bladder resection, and less frequently received 
preoperative immunotherapy with Bacillus of Calmette-Guerin (p = 0.044), than 
their non-0 counterparts. Additionally, these patients harbored more advanced 
pathologic tumor stage at RC (p = 0.024). KM plots showed no differences among 
all tested cancer control outcomes between AB0 blood groups (p > 0.05 in all 
cases). Patients with group AB presented the lowest median eGFR at each time 
point. In multivariable LR analyses addressing renal function decline, group AB 
was independently associated with eGFR< 60 mL/min at discharge (Odds Ratio: 
4.28, p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: Among AB0 blood groups, patients with group 0 exhibited the most 
aggressive tumor profile. However, no differences were recorded in recurrence or 
survival rates. Group AB independently predicted renal function decline at 
discharge."
209,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if patients undergoing radical 
retropubic prostatectomy with localized prostate cancer under combined 
(epidural-spinal) anaesthesia have any benefit over patients undergoing the 
procedure under general anaesthesia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with clinically localised prostate cancer, 
scheduled for radical retropubic prostatectomy, were allocated to undergo the 
operation under either general anaesthesia (GA) or under combined 
(epidural-spinal) (CESA) anaesthesia. Several parameters were recorded both 
preoperatively (medical history, biometric data, PSA, biopsy Gleason score) and 
postoperatively (blood pressure, heart rate, haemoglobin levels, operation time 
and total hospital stay). In addition, mean arterial pressure, change in heart 
rate, total blood loss, blood transfusions, SAS score, intravenous fluid 
administration and operation time were also noted down intraoperatively. Patient 
pain levels and total satisfaction were evaluated using appropriate 
questionnaires. At the 12-month follow-up, biochemical recurrence using PSA 
levels and urinary continence status were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included (30 in each group). 
Intraoperatively, mean MAP and heart rate change was higher in the GA group 
(MAP+7,46, HR+27) and mean SAS was higher in the CESA group (+0.93). The time 
needed for patients' recovery was faster (-3.5 min) and hospitalization was 
shorter for patients in the CESA group (-0.6 days). Intraoperative blood loss, 
time for induction and duration of operation were not significantly different. 
Mean postoperative drop of haemoglobin was greater in the GA group (+0.56) while 
blood transfusions, VAS pain scores and amount of intravenous fluids did not 
differ significantly between the two groups. No complications were reported. 
Patient satisfaction and urinary continence were comparable between the groups 
and there were no cases of biochemical recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Radical retropubic prostatectomy can safely be performed under 
combined (spinal epidural anaesthesia, with possible benefits of lower blood 
loss, less post-operative complications and earlier discharge. Both procedures 
have equal oncological and functional outcomes at the 12-month follow-up."
210,"OBJECTIVE: To test the employment of the Goldfinger Dissector (GD) to bypass and 
en bloc stapling of renal hilus without vascular dissection. Thus far no study 
has experimented the use of this integrated technique.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 2002 to October 2020, clinical data were 
collected from 288 patients who underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic 
nephrectomies. They were divided into two groups: using GD with en bloc stapling 
(n = 174, group I) or the separation and ligation method (n = 114, group II) 
using the same Endo GIA Universal (Vascular) Stapler. Comparative analysis was 
carried out between the two groups, examining blood loss, operative time, intra 
and postoperative complications and hospital stay.
RESULTS: The mean age was 58.3 and 55.1 years in group I and II, respectively. 
Ratio of 90/84 and 55/59 males/females was found in group I and II, 
respectively.Blood loss was 65.5 ml and 188.9 ml, operative time was 156.5 and 
189.2 minutes, wound infection occurred in three patients in each group (1.7% 
and 2.6%), ileus in 4 (2.3%) and 1 (0.87%), atrial fibrillation in 1 (0.57%) and 
0%, incisional hernia in 0 (0%) and 2 (1.75%), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 0 
(0%) and 1 (0.87%), conversion to open surgery in 2 (1.15%) and 5 (4.39%), mean 
hospital stay 3.5 days and 4 days in group I and II, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of the GD and en bloc stapling of the renal pedicle in 
laparoscopic nephrectomy is safe and useful. This technique can decrease blood 
loss, operative time, and have some benefit in conversion to open surgery."
211,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous and complex disease with limited 
treatment options. Targeting transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and programmed

212,"BACKGROUND: In phase III TIVO-3 trial, tivozanib improved progression-free 
survival (PFS) compared to sorafenib for patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC). However, the effectiveness of this drug after exposure to 
other selective VEGFR agents has not yet been defined. Herein, we characterize 
the clinical efficacy of tivozanib in patients with mRCC previously treated with 
axitinib.
METHODS: We identified patients from the intention to treat (ITT) population, in 
the TIVO-3 trial, who received treatment with axitinib before enrolment in the 
study and evaluated PFS, response rate (RR), and safety.
RESULTS: Out of 350 patients, 172 (83:89, tivozanib:sorafenib) had received 
prior treatment with axitinib in TIVO-3. In this subgroup, PFS was 5.5 months 
with tivozanib and 3.7 months with sorafenib (HR 0.68). RR was 13% and 8% 
favoring tivozanib.
CONCLUSIONS: Tivozanib is active in the treatment of patients with mRCC who have 
progressed on prior therapies, including axitinib."
213,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening disorder that leads to the induction of 
inflammatory responses and organ failure. Phage therapy is a new approach to 
controlling infections resistant to common treatments, including sepsis. Several 
studies have shown the effect of lytic bacteriophages on infection control by 
reducing the bacterial load. The present study deals with lysogenic 
bacteriophage M13 on the inflammatory responses caused by cecal ligation and 
puncture (CLP) induced sepsis in a mouse model.
METHODS: Bacteriophage M13 harvested from ER2738, titrated, and confirmed by TEM 
analysis. In-vitro toxicity and immunomodulatory effect of bacteriophage M13 
were assessed on splenocytes by measurement of cell viability and the production 
level of cytokines, nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). For 
in-vivo experiments, eight weeks old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided 
into three groups: CLP + NS (treated with normal saline), CLP + M13 (treated 
with an intraperitoneal injection of 109 PFU/ml of bacteriophage M13), and sham+ 
NS (induced surgery but without ligation and puncture, treated with NS). The 
mice were sacrificed at different time points post-surgery (6,24,48, and 72, n = 
10 for each time point of each group). The kidney, liver, and lungs were 
harvested for histopathological analysis, and blood was obtained for cytokine 
and liver enzyme assay. The spleen was used to assess the bacterial load using 
colony forming unit (CFU) assay. The rectal temperature and survival were 
evaluated during the study.
RESULTS: According to the in-vitro results, 109 PFU/ml of bacteriophage M13 was 
not toxic and did not affect the level of cytokine, NO, and ROS production by 
splenocytes, but it reduced the inflammatory response of splenocytes in 
responses to LPS. In-vivo studies indicated that the amount of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, liver enzymes, bacterial load, and organ failure were decreased in 
the CLP + M13 group compared to CLP + NS, whereas the survival rate was 
increased.
CONCLUSION: These experiments demonstrated that bacteriophage M13 could lessen 
the consequences related to sepsis in CLP mice and can be considered a 
therapeutic approach in sepsis."
214,"The efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy is not as expected in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). YAP1 was overexpressed and activated in HCC. The mechanism of YAP1 in HCC 
immune escape is unclear. Anti-PD-1 treatment increased YAP1 expression in liver 
tumor cells, and exhausted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood and spleen of 
liver tumor mice. YAP1 knockdown suppressed PD-L1 expression, which was involved 
in JAK1/STAT1, 3 pathways. Moreover, Yap1 knockout elevated CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells in liver tumor niche. Consistently, verteporfin, YAP1 inhibitor, decreased 
TGF-β and IFN-γ in liver tumor niche and exhausted CD8+ T cell in the spleen. 
DHA suppressed YAP1 expression and break immune evasion in liver tumor niche, 
characterized by decreased PD-L1 in liver tumor cells and increased CD8+ T cell 
infiltration. Furthermore, DHA combined with anti-PD-1 treatment promoted CD4+ T 
cell infiltration in the spleen and CD8+ T cell in tumor tissues of mice. In 
summary, YAP1 knockdown in liver tumor cells suppressed PD-L1 expression and 
recruited cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), leading to break immune evasion in 
tumor niche. Mechanistically, YAP1 knockdown suppressed PD-L1 expression, which 
was involved in JAK1/STAT1, 3 pathways. Finally, DHA inhibited YAP1 expression, 
which not only inhibited liver tumor proliferation but also break the 
immunosuppressive niche in liver tumor tissues and improve the effect of 
anti-PD-1 therapy."
215,"BACKGROUND: Nuclear-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) molecules in blood plasma are 
nonrandomly fragmented, bearing a wealth of information related to tissues of 
origin. DNASE1L3 (deoxyribonuclease 1 like 3) is an important player in shaping 
the fragmentation of nuclear-derived cfDNA molecules, preferentially generating 
molecules with 5' ""CC"" dinucleotide termini (i.e., 5' CC-end motif). However, 
the fragment end properties of microbial cfDNA and its clinical implication 
remain to be explored.
METHODS: We performed end motif analysis on microbial cfDNA fragments in plasma 
samples from patients with sepsis. A sequence context-based normalization method 
was used to minimize the potential biases for end motif analysis.
RESULTS: The end motif profiles of microbial cfDNA appeared to resemble that of 
nuclear cfDNA (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.82, P value <0.001). The 
CC-end motif was the most preferred end motif in microbial cfDNA, suggesting 
that DNASE1L3 might also play a role in the fragmentation of microbe-derived 
cfDNA in plasma. Of note, differential end motifs were present between microbial 
cfDNA originating from infection-causing pathogens (enriched at the CC-end) and 
contaminating microbial DNA potentially derived from reagents or the environment 
(nearly random). The use of fragment end signatures allowed differentiation 
between confirmed pathogens and contaminating microbes, with an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99. The performance appeared to be 
superior to conventional analysis based on microbial cfDNA abundance alone.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of fragmentomic features could facilitate the 
differentiation of underlying contaminating microbes from true pathogens in 
sepsis. This work demonstrates the potential usefulness of microbial cfDNA 
fragmentomics in metagenomics analysis."
216,"OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is rare heterogeneous disorder 
characterized by red blood cell (RBC) destruction via auto-antibodies, and after 
RBC is destroyed, proinflammatory danger-associated molecular patterns including 
extracellular hemoglobin, heme, and iron which causing cell injury. And 
oxidative stress represents one of the most significant effects of chronic 
hemolysis. Jianpishengxue keli can improve the symptoms of anemia patients with 
kidney disease and tumors and are beneficial in promoting recovery from chronic 
inflammation. Therefore, it is presumed that Jianpishengxue keli can improve the 
symptoms of AIHA. We aimed to investigate iron metabolism in AIHA and effects of 
Jianpishengxue keli on AIHA murine model.
METHODS: Nineteen hemolytic episode AIHA patients, 10 remission patients and 10 
healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Serum hepcidin, ferritin and 
other related indicators of iron metabolism were measured. Mouse models of AIHA 
were established and received high, medium, or low doses of Jianpishengxue keli 
by gavage daily for 14 and 28 days respectively. The level of RBCs, Hb, 
bilirubin, LDH, hepcidin, and the expression level of hepcidin mRNA, and hepatic 
ferroportin 1(FPN1) protein were evaluated.
RESULTS: Serum hepcidin in hemolytic episode AIHA patients and remission 
patients were significantly higher than that in HCs (p = 0.0083 and p = 0.0473, 
respectively). Serum ferritin in hemolytic AIHA patients was significantly 
higher than that in HCs (p = 0.008). Serum transferrin saturation levels are 
increased in patients with AIHA[ (57.21 ± 8.96) %]. EPO in hemolytic group was 
higher than that in healthy control (p＜0.05). In AIHA mouse models, IBIL 
decreased after 14 days of high dose drug intervention. After 28 days, TBIL and 
IBIL both significantly decreased in all dose groups and LDH significantly 
decreased in the medium-and high-dose groups. Body weight improved, and the 
level of RBCs, Hb and hepcidin in the high-dose group returned to normal. After 
14 and 28 days of intervention, hepatic hepcidin mRNA in all dose group 
significantly decreased. Hepatic FPN1 protein which were significantly lower in 
the AIHA mouse models, increased in all dose groups after drug intervention for 
28 days.
CONCLUSION: Iron metabolism abnormalities exists in AIHA patients and 
Jianpishengxue keli can ameliorate hemolysis and improve iron metabolism in AIHA 
mouse models.KEY MESSAGESIron metabolism abnormalities exists in hemolytic 
episode AIHA patients. Hepcidin and ferritin levels significantly elevated and 
also correlated with the severity of AIHA patients. Jianpishengxue keli can 
ameliorate hemolysis and prompt the recovery of AIHA."
217,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).
METHODS: This retrospective study assessed adherence to prescribed enoxaparin 
for VTE prophylaxis in adults with SCD while hospitalized. A total of 172 
encounters of 72 unique patients were evaluated between 1 January and 31 
December 2019. Patients were grouped based on adherence to prescribed 
enoxaparin. Group 1 received 100% of doses ordered. Group 2 received between 99% 
and 1% of doses ordered. Group 3 received 0% of doses ordered.
RESULTS: Only 45 encounters (32.3%) received 100% of ordered doses and 81 
encounters (47%) did not receive any of the ordered enoxaparin doses. In total, 
only 37% of all prescribed enoxaparin doses were administered to patients.
CONCLUSION: This low level of administered enoxaparin is concerning in a patient 
population at an increased risk for VTE. VTE prophylaxis adherence needs to be 
addressed with each admission and, if appropriate, alterative options to 
enoxaparin should be considered."
218,"Abusive head trauma (AHT) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in 
infants. While the reported incidence is close to 40 cases per 100'000 
births/year, misdiagnoses are commonly observed in cases with atypical, subacute 
or chronic presentation. Currently, standard clinical evaluation of inflicted 
intracranial hemorrhagic injury (ICH) in infants urgently requires a screening 
test able to identify infants who need additional investigations. Blood 
biomarkers characteristic of AHT may assist in detecting these infants, 
improving prognosis through early medical care. To date, the application of 
innovative omics technologies in retrospective studies of AHT in infants is 
rare, due also to the blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid of AHT cases being 
scarce and not systematically accessible. Here, we explored the circulating 
blood proteomes of infants with severe AHT and their atraumatic controls. We 
discovered 165 circulating serum proteins that display differential changes in 
AHT cases compared with atraumatic controls. The peripheral blood proteomes of 
pediatric AHT commonly reflect: i) potentially secreted proteome from injured 
brain, and ii) proteome dysregulated in the system's circulation by successive 
biological events following acute ICH. This study opens up a novel opportunity 
for research efforts in clinical screening of AHT cases. This article is

219,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the iatrogenic risk factors for 
hypophosphatemia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A total of 120 patients were enrolled and further 
divided into 4 groups, namely normal, mild, moderate or severe, according to the 
degree of hypophosphatemia. A number of related factors were analyzed and 
compared among the 4 groups, including the treatment method and outcomes. 
Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were employed to identify and 
confirm the risk factors associated with the occurrence of hypophosphatemia.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the acute physiology and chronic health 
evaluation II (APACHEII), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), modified 
NUTrition Risk in Critically ill (NUTRIC) scores as well as the length of 
patient stays in ICUs exhibited a gradually increasing trend of aggravation of 
hypophosphatemia. Univariate regression analysis identified the use of 
dehydrating drugs to be closely associated with the occurrence of 
hypophosphatemia, which was further confirmed by a multivariate regression 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of dehydrating drugs led to hypophosphatemia; therefore 
blood phosphorus concentrations should be closely monitored during treatment of 
ICU patients."
220,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vitamin A is vital for the growth and health of 
children. This study aimed to estimate the current vitamin A status and the 
prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) among preschool children and explore 
the correlation between serum vitamin A concentration and changes in 
hematological parameters.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: The study included 697 children aged 1-6 years, 
presenting for routine checkups at the Department of Pediatrics, Peking 
University Shougang Hospital, Beijing, from April 2017 to December 2020. We 
obtained the complete laboratory test data of 630 children.
RESULTS: The mean serum vitamin A concentration among preschool children was 
0.29±0.08 mg/L, with a median of 0.29 mg/L. The proportion of children with VAD 
and marginal VAD (MVAD) was 9.84% and 43.49%, respectively. The highest 
prevalence of VAD and MVAD was in the 3- to 4-year age group. Compared with the 
normal vitamin A serum concentration group, other groups had lower mean 
corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration, and higher red blood cell distribution width. The mean serum 
vitamin A concentration among anemic children was significantly lower (0.27±0.07 
mg/L) than among those children who were not anemic (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: VAD constitutes a public health problem in northern China. The 
prevalence of VAD is highest, and the serum vitamin A concentration was the 
lowest among preschool children aged 3-4 years. Vitamin A serum concentration 
was associated with red blood cell indices. We should attach more importance to 
those children aged 3-4 years."
221,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have explored the relationship 
between lipid accumulation product (LAP) and hypertension or hyperuricemia. 
However, the association between LAP and hypertension with hyperuricemia (HWH) 
is inconclusive. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between LAP and 
HWH.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A total of 7897 participants aged 18 to 75 years from 
the 2009 wave of the China Health and Nutrition Survey were included in this 
study. General linear regression models were built to assess the association of 
LAP with systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and uric 
acid (UA) concentrations. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the 
association between LAP and HWH risk, restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used 
to analyze the dose-response relationship between them.
RESULTS: The prevalence of HWH was significantly higher in men (7.63%) than in 
women (1.99%) (X2=142; p<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, LAP 
scores were positively correlated with SBP, DBP, and UA concentrations in both 
genders (all p-trend <0.01). Compared with participants in the lowest quartile 
of LAP, those in the highest quartile had a higher risk of HWH [OR (95% CI)=12.2 
(7.22-20.5) for men, OR (95% CI)=14.5 (3.50- 60.2) for women]. The RCS results 
suggested a nonlinear relationship between the continuous change of LAP and HWH 
risk after adjustment for confounding factors in each gender (p for nonlinearity 
<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that higher LAP scores was strongly associated 
with greater HWH risk in Chinese adults."
222,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence showed that intermittent fasting may have 
beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome. However, the results are controversial 
and indefinite. This study intends to investigate and assess the effects of 
intermittent fasting (IF) on cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with 
metabolic syndrome.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and 
Cochrane Library databases up to July 31, 2022. Primary outcomes included body 
mass index, fat mass, fat free mass, body weight, blood pressure, the 
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (IR), fasting blood glucose, 
fasting insulin, and lipid profiles.
RESULTS: Of 4997 retrieved records, 6 met the inclusion criteria. The 
meta-analysis showed that IF can significantly reduce BMI (mean difference=-1.56 
kg/m2, 95% CI: -2.62 to -0.51), fat mass (mean difference=-1.35%, 95% CI: -2.03 
to -0.67), fat free mass (mean difference=-0.63%, 95% CI: -1.22 to -0.04), body 
weight (mean difference=-2.49 kg, 95% CI: -3.11 to -1.88), waist circumference 
(mean difference=-3.06 cm, 95% CI: -4.21 to -1.92), and HOMA-IR (mean 
difference=-0.62, 95% CI: -0.84 to -0.40) compared with non-fasting. However, no 
statistical difference was found in the SBP, DBP, TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, fasting 
blood glucose, and fasting insulin comparing fasting and non-fasting group. 
Subgroup analyses suggested that study duration and sample size may be the 
source of heterogeneity for LDL-C. Sensitivity analysis indicated that our 
results are reliable and robust.
CONCLUSIONS: IF could be used for patients with metabolic syndrome. Further 
studies with a larger sample size are needed to verify the effectiveness and 
safety of IF in patients with metabolic syndrome."
223,"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is widely present in plant foods and has attracted much 
attention due to biological activities such as those which are antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral. It plays a role in regulating 
glucose and lipid metabolism, improving insulin resistance, and reducing the 
risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The estimated dietary 
intake of CGA is 5 to 1000 mg/d. Based on the data from population intervention 
studies, daily oral doses of CGA at 13.5mg to 1200 mg can reduce fasting blood 
glucose (FBG), improve glucose tolerance, enable weight loss /prevent weight 
gain, and improve blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Daily intake of 200 
mg or more may reduce FBG, with a dose-effect relationship in the range 13.5-500 
mg/d. Therefore, a specific proposed level (SPL) of CGA to improve FBG could be 
≥200 mg/d. Data insufficiency does not allow formulation of a tolerable upper 
intake level (TUIL) for CGA."
224,"The DTacP-sIPV-Hib combination vaccine can replace the single-component 
acellular pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type 
B vaccines. In this study, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a newly 
developed DTacP-sIPV-Hib combination vaccine in animal models. We used 40 mice 
and 46 cynomolgus monkeys to evaluate acute and long-term toxicity. Thirty-six 
guinea pigs were used for sensitization assessment. For immunogenicity 
assessment, 50 NIH mice and 50 rats were equally randomized to receive 3 doses 
of 3 different batches of the tested vaccine at an interval of 21 d, or 
physiological saline solution (0.5 mL). Orbital blood was collected at an 
interval of 21 d post inoculation to detect related antibody titers or 
neutralizing antibody titers against poliovirus. Gross autopsy and 
histopathological examination revealed no abnormal toxicity or irritation in 
mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Sensitization assessment in guinea pigs indicated 
the lack of evident allergic symptoms in the high- and low-dose vaccine groups 
within 30 min after repeated stimulation. The DTacP-sIPV-Hib combination vaccine 
induced significant immune responses in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys, with 
100% seroconversion rates after 3 doses. The DTacP-sIPV-Hib combination vaccine 
is safe and immunogenic in animal models. Three doses of the vaccine elicited 
satisfactory antibody responses in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys."
225,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder causing demyelination and 
neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. MS is characterized by 
disturbed motor performance and cognitive impairment. Current MS treatments 
delay disease progression and reduce relapse rates with general 
immunomodulation, yet curative therapies are still lacking. Regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) are able to suppress autoreactive immune cells, which drive MS 
pathology. However, Tregs are functionally impaired in people with MS. 
Interestingly, Tregs were recently reported to also have regenerative capacity. 
Therefore, experts agree that Treg cell therapy has the potential to ameliorate 
the disease. However, to perform their local anti-inflammatory and regenerative 
functions in the brain, they must first migrate across the blood-brain barrier

227,"The aim of this study was to examine data demonstrating that Scarpa's fascia, a 
superficial fascia of the anterior abdominal wall, is a vascularized tissue. 
Specimens of the fascia of seven volunteers undergoing abdominoplasty surgical 
procedures at the Plastic Surgery Unit of the University of Padova Medical 
Center were collected. Fractal analysis and quantitative assessment of the 
vascular network of the fascia was carried out, exploiting the presence of blood 
in the vessels. Each sample was divided and processed for 
histological/immunohistochemical analysis (into 5 micron-paraffin embedded 
sections and cryo-sectioned free-floating samples) as well as for electron 
microscopy study. A rich vascular pattern forming a fine, dense meshwork with an 
area percentage of 6.20±2.10% von Willebrand factor stained vessels was noted in 
all the specimens of the fascia examined; the area percentage of the 
αSMA-stained vessels was 2.93 ± 1.80 %. The diameters of the vessels fell 
between the 13 - 65 μm range; the network was composed of arteries, veins, 
capillaries and lymphatic segments. Topological results showed that the vascular 
network within Scarpa's fascia is well-branched (segments: 6615 ± 3070 and 8.40 
± 3.40 per mm2 ; crossing points: 3092 ± 1490 and 3.40 ± 1.90 per mm2 ). Fractal 
analysis (fractal dimension = 1.063± 0.10; lacunarity = 0.60± 0.10) revealed 
that this particular vascular network has an optimal spatial distribution and 
homogeneity occupying the entire space of the superficial fascia. These findings 
could undoubtedly be useful to plastic surgeons as well as to pain management

A inhibition have yielded promising effects in DKD, a great part of patients 
inevitably continue to progress to uremia. Newly effective therapeutic options 
are urgently needed to postpone DKD progression. Recently, accumulating evidence 
suggests that targeted drug delivery strategies, such as macromolecular 
carriers, nanoparticles, liposomes and so on, can enhance the drug efficacy and 
reduce the undesired side effects, which will be a milestone treatment in the 
management of DKD. The aim of this article is to summarize the current knowledge 
of targeted drug delivery strategies and select the optimal renal targeting 
strategy to provide new therapies for DKD."
230,"BACKGROUND: Progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients who 
received avelumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib as first-line treatment for 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) in a randomized phase III trial. We report 
long-term safety and efficacy of avelumab plus axitinib as first-line treatment 
for patients with aRCC from the JAVELIN Renal 100 phase Ib trial (NCT02493751).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, phase Ib study, patients 
with untreated aRCC received avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus axitinib 5 mg 
twice daily or with axitinib for 7 days followed by avelumab plus axitinib. 
Safety and efficacy were assessed in all patients receiving at least one dose of 
avelumab or axitinib.
RESULTS: Overall, 55 patients were enrolled and treated. Median follow-up was 
55.7 months (95% CI, 54.5-58.7). Treatment-related adverse events of any grade 
or grade ≥3 occurred in 54 (98.2%) and 34 (61.8%) patients, respectively. The 
confirmed objective response rate was 60.0% (95% CI, 45.9-73.0), including 
complete response in 10.9% of patients. Median duration of response was 35.9 
months (95% CI, 12.7-52.9); the probability of response was 65.8% (95% CI, 
46.7-79.4) at 2 years. Median progression-free survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 
5.3-32.0). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI, 40.8-not estimable); 
the 5-year overall survival rate was 57.3% (95% CI, 41.2-70.5).
CONCLUSION: Five-year follow-up for combination treatment with avelumab plus 
axitinib in previously untreated patients with aRCC showed long-term clinical 
activity with no new safety signals, supporting use of this regimen within its 
approved indication in clinical practice (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02493751)."
231,"BACKGROUND: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a promising candidate 
blood-based biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and 
prognostication. The timing of its disease-associated changes, its clinical 
correlates, and biofluid-type dependency will influence its clinical utility.
METHODS: We evaluated plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP in 
families with autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), leveraging the predictable age at 
symptom onset to determine changes by stage of disease.
RESULTS: Plasma GFAP elevations appear a decade before expected symptom onset, 
after amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation and prior to neurodegeneration and 
cognitive decline. Plasma GFAP distinguished Aβ-positive from Aβ-negative ADAD 
participants and showed a stronger relationship with Aβ load in asymptomatic 
than symptomatic ADAD. Higher plasma GFAP was associated with the degree and 
rate of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Serum GFAP showed similar 
relationships, but these were less pronounced for CSF GFAP.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support a role for plasma GFAP as a clinical biomarker 
of Aβ-related astrocyte reactivity that is associated with cognitive decline and 
neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) elevations appear a 
decade before expected symptom onset in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease 
(ADAD). Plasma GFAP was associated to amyloid positivity in asymptomatic ADAD. 
Plasma GFAP increased with clinical severity and predicted disease progression. 
Plasma and serum GFAP carried similar information in ADAD, while cerebrospinal 
fluid GFAP did not."
232,"Probiotics positively influence age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) given 
their propensity to attenuate oxidative and inflammatory stress. We addressed 
the impact of probiotics on metabolic profiles, clinical indices, inflammatory 
and oxidative stress parameters in ARMD patients. We performed a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial analyzing 57 subjects with ARMD aged 
between 50 and 85 years. Subjects were randomized into two groups, and received 
daily for 8 weeks either probiotic capsule or placebo. Fasting blood samples 
were obtained at baseline and after the 8-week intervention for the 
determination of metabolic profiles and oxidative stress biomarkers. After the 
8-week intervention, compared with the placebo, probiotic supplementation 
significantly increased means HDL-cholesterol (Probiotic group: +3.86±4.42 vs. 
Placebo group: -0.55±4.93 mg/dL, P = .001), plasma total antioxidant capacity 
(TAC) (Probiotic group: +77.43±168.30 vs. Placebo group: -23.12±169.22 mmol/L, P 
= .02) and significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (Probiotic 
group: -0.18±0.46 vs. Placebo group: +0.18±0.25 µmol/L, P = .001). There was no 
significant effect of probiotic administration on other metabolic profiles and 
clinical symptoms. Overall, an eight-week probiotic administration among ARMD 
patients had beneficial effects on TAC, MDA and HDL-cholesterol levels; however, 
it did not affect clinical signs and other metabolic profiles."
233,"BACKGROUND: Renal tubular injury is the main feature of diabetic nephropathy 
(DN). We intend to investigate the function and related mechanisms of lncRNA 
SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT) in high glucose (HG)-induced oxidative 
stress and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs).
METHODS: To construct diabetes models, the human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells were 
treated with HG (30 mM), and mice were injected with streptozotocin. The levels 
of intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed 
by dihydroethidium staining and MitoSox staining. The cell apoptosis was 
assessed by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Levels of serum creatinine, blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), Urinary ACR, and oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2' 
-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were detected by relevant kits. In addition, 
fluorescence in situ hybridization staining, RNA-pull down, RNA 
immunoprecipitation (RIP), co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), dual-luciferase 
reporter gene assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) were also 
executed.
RESULTS: Levels of SOX2OT and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) were 
down-regulated in HG-cultured HK-2 cells. Overexpressing SOX2OT reduced 
intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels and cell apoptosis in vitro. 
Moreover, SOX2OT overexpression also reduced serum creatinine, BUN, urinary ACR, 
8-OHdG, renal tubular injury markers KIM1 and NGAL, ROS levels, and cell 
apoptosis in vivo. In addition, SOX2OT promoted SIRT1 expression by suppressing 
its ubiquitination. Besides, interference with SIRT1 reversed the inhibitory 
effect of SOX2OT overexpression on HG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. 
Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) levels were up-regulated in HG-cultured HK-2 cells. 
Foxa2 could bind to the SOX2OT promoter and suppress its expression. 
Furthermore, interfering with SOX2OT reversed the inhibitory effect of Foxa2 
interference on HG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Foxa2-mediated SOX2OT up-regulation reduced oxidative stress and 
apoptosis of RTECs by promoting SIRT1 expression, thus alleviating the 
progression of DN. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
234,"OBJECTIVE: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although it is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous 
disease, it is usually treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Here, we aimed to 
investigate gene expression frequency with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and 
the relation of gene mutations with remission and relapse status in patients 
with DLBCLs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated gene mutation profiles by NGS in patients 
with DLBCL-NOS and analyzed the correlation between gene mutations and response 
and relapse rates and other clinical indices.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight of forty patients were evaluated. The most commonly 
mutated genes were ANKRD, BRCA1, BRCA2, EZH2, KMTC2, MYC, MYD88, NF1, NOTCH1, 
PMS2, PTEN, and WRN. The relapse rate was found higher in DLBCL patients with 
ANKRD26, BRCA2, MYD88, and NOTCH1 mutations. Also, remission duration was found 
shorter in patients with ANKRD26, BRCA2, and MYD88 mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the presence of some genetic mutations 
is effective on prognosis in patients with DLBCL. NGS-based evaluation of DLBCL 
treatment can be used in the future."
235,"PURPOSE: Clinically, the management of cystic renal masses is tricky. The study 
aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic microwave 
ablation-assisted partial nephrectomy (LMAPN) for cystic renal tumors.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 2017 and January 2022, LMAPN was 
performed on 43 patients (29 men and 14 women; age range: 22-80 years; median 
age 54 years) with Bosniak category III (n = 15) or IV (n = 28) cystic renal 
tumors (size range: 1.2-5.0 cm; mean size 2.8 cm). The median follow-up period 
was 26 months (range: 7-56 months). Baseline and perioperative data, 
pathological features, renal function, postoperative complications and oncologic 
outcomes were collected and evaluated.
RESULTS: Forty-three cystic renal tumors were successfully managed by LMAPN. The 
mean operating time was 79 min (range: 40-130 min). The mean time of renal 
pedicle clamping was 19 min (range: 12-25 min). Mean intraoperative blood loss 
was 28.4 mL (range: 10-80 mL). The mean postoperative hospitalization duration 
was 4 days (range: 2-6 days). Negative surgical margins were diagnosed in all 
cases. During the follow-up, no patient appeared with distant metastasis, wound 
or peritoneal cavity implantation. No major but minor complications of 
Clavien-Dindo grade I were encountered after the operation. The 1-, 3- and 
4-year overall survival rate was 100%, 96.6% and 88.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study focusing on LMAPN for cystic renal tumors, 
demonstrating its favorable feasibility, safety and disease control. Long-term 
follow-up is necessary to draw conclusions on the preference and advantages of 
the new therapeutic approach."
236,"OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the effect of blood group on cochlear 
function in a large participant sample across different age groups. The study 
hypothesis was that participants with blood group O would show relatively 
reduced cochlear function as reflected in otoacoustic emission (OAE) measures.
DESIGN: Data were collected from transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), 
distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), DPOAE input/output (I/O) 
function, and spontaneous otoacoustic emission (SOAE) recordings.
STUDY SAMPLE: Four hundred and sixty-three normal hearing adults aged 
20-59 years among the four ABO blood groups participated in the study.
RESULTS: TEOAE and DPOAE amplitudes did not reveal significant differences for 
participants with blood group O compared with participants with non-O blood 
groups. No significant differences in I/O function categories were found among 
participants with different blood groups. SOAE prevalence was also not 
significantly different across blood groups. However, previously reported age 
and gender differences for OAE variables were confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants with blood group O were not found to have 
significantly reduced cochlear function, based on OAE measures. Results from the 
current study do not support the hypothesis that normal hearing individuals with 
different ABO blood groups differ in level of cochlear function."
237,"In the current study supplementations of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) powder 
(CNP) and turmeric (Curcuma longa L) powder (TP) as an antibiotic growth 
promoter substitutions on growth performance, intestinal microbiota and 
hematological profile of broiler chickens have been investigated. A total of 
240, one day old as-hatched broiler chickens (ROSS 308) were randomly assigned 
into five treatments with four replicates per treatment and 10 chickens per 
replicate. Treatment groups were C: control (fed basal diet); CNP1: 0.5% CNP; 
CNP2: 1.0% CNP; TP1: 0.5% TP; TP2: 1.0% TP and 500 mg oxytetracycline (OTC)/kg 
of diet. Body weight gain (BWG), feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) 
were improved (p < 0.05) by CNP and TP while OTC improved BWG and FCR. Ileal and 
cecal Lactobacillus and total aerobes were significantly improved while 
coliforms and Escherichia coli were decreased by CNP, TP, and OTC. The 
percentage of packed cell volume (%PCV), hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC) 
count, and white blood cell (WBC) count was increased by CNP and TP while OTC 
decreased %PCV, Hb, RBC, and increased WBC count. In conclusion, the results 
showed that OTC can be safely replaced by CNP and TP at 1.0% dose rate in 
broiler chicken's diets."

complication from MMA embolization in this patient population."
239,"Introduction: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided natural orifice transluminal 
gallbladder polypectomy provides a minimally invasive alternative to 
cholecystectomy. The study aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of 
protocol for gallbladder endoscopic mucosal resection (gEMR) under EUS guidance 
using a porcine model.Material and methods: Fifteen Bama mini pigs were randomly 
divided into the control (CG, n = 3) and experimental (EG, n = 12) groups. 
EUS-guided fine needle aspiration was performed in the CG and used to establish 
a gallbladder pathway for polyp resection under EUS guidance in the EG. 
Procedural safety was evaluated using routine blood and biochemical tests, 
microbial bile cultures, histopathological tests, and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays for inflammatory adhesion factors.Results: EUS-guided metal 
stents were successfully deployed in all 12 pigs. Two cases of stent 
displacement occurred postoperatively, and one pig died of infectious 
peritonitis on the first day after stent implantation. In 11 surviving 
experimental animals, mature gallbladder paths were formed at 7-14 days after 
gastro-cholecystostomy, through which gEMR of gallbladder polyps was 
successfully performed. There were no significant changes in levels of 
inflammatory and adhesion factors during the postoperative process.Conclusions: 
EUS-gEMR may be a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment approach for 
gallbladder polyps."
240,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a neoplasm of B-cells in the blood and 
monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a precursor state to CLL. This 
narrative review provides an overview of the genetic studies that identified 43 
common variants associated with risk of CLL among individuals of European 
ancestry. Emerging studies found that ∼50% of these variants are associated with 
MBL risk. Moreover, the polygenic risk score (PRS) calculated from these CLL 
variants has been shown to be a robust predictor for both CLL and MBL risk among 
European ancestry individuals but a weak predictor among African ancestry 
individuals. By summarizing these genetic studies, we conclude that additional 
studies are needed in other race/ethnic populations to identify race-specific 
susceptibility variants, that functional studies are needed to validate the 
biological mechanisms of the variants, and that the clinical utility of the PRS 
is limited until preventive strategies for CLL are developed."
241,"This study was designed to assess the effect of cinnamon powder (CNP) and 
turmeric powder (TP) on growth performance, antioxidant status, liver function, 
meat quality and lactate dehydrogenase activity of broiler chickens under heat 
stress conditions. A total of 200, one day old as-hatched broiler chickens (ROSS 
308) were randomly allotted into five treatments with four replicates (n = 10). 
Treatment groups were control (C): fed basal diet; T1: 0.5% CNP; T2: 1.0% CNP; 
T3: 0.5% TP and T4: 1.0% TP. Results indicated that body weight gain, feed 
intake and feed conversion ratio were improved significantly (p < 0.05) in 
treatments fed CNP and TP. Serum malondialdehyde and lactate dehydrogenase 
activity were decreased (p < 0.05) while blood superoxide dismutase, catalase 
and glutathione peroxidase activity were increased (p < 0.05) in treatments fed 
CNP and TP. Addition of CNP and TP decreased (p < 0.05) serum aspartate 
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity. 
Treatments fed CNP and TP resulted increased (p < 0.05) breast and thigh meat 
monounsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid, oleic 
acid and water holding capacity while decreased (p < 0.05) saturated fatty acid 
and cook loss. In conclusion CNP and TP possess advantageous effect on growth 
performance, antioxidant status, liver function, meat quality and lactate 
dehydrogenase activity."
242,"Haemoglobin (Hb)-O2 binding affinity typically decreases with increasing 
temperature, but several species of ectothermic and regionally endothermic 
fishes exhibit reduced Hb thermal-sensitivity. Regionally endothermic sharks, 
including the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) and lamnid sharks such as 
the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), can maintain select tissues and 
organs warmer than ambient temperature by retaining metabolic heat with vascular 
heat exchangers. In the ectothermic bigeye thresher shark (Alopias 
superciliosus), diurnal movements above and below the thermocline subject the 
tissues, including the blood, to a wide range of operating temperatures. 
Therefore, blood-O2 transport must occur across internal temperature gradients 
in regionally endothermic species, and over the range of environmental 
temperatures encountered by the ectothermic bigeye thresher shark. While 
previous studies have shown temperature-independent Hb-O2 affinity in lamnid 
sharks, including shortfin mako, the Hb-O2 affinity of the common and bigeye 
thresher sharks is unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect of temperature on 
whole blood Hb-O2 affinity in common thresher shark and bigeye thresher shark. 
For comparison, analyses were also conducted on the shortfin mako shark and two 
ectothermic species, blue shark (Prionace glauca) and spiny dogfish (Squalus 
acanthias). Blood-O2 binding affinity was temperature-independent for common 
thresher shark and shortfin mako shark, which should prevent internal 
temperature gradients from negatively affecting blood-O2 transport. Blue shark 
and spiny dogfish blood-O2 affinity decreased with increasing temperature, as 
expected, but bigeye thresher shark blood exhibited both a reduced 
temperature-dependence and a high Hb-O2 affinity, which likely prevents large 
changes in environment temperature and low environmental oxygen from affecting 
O2 uptake."
243,"The blood sample from 60 Damani does were collected and genomic DNA was 
extracted, and DNA integrity were investigated. A 447 bp promoter fragment of 
the GDF9 gene was amplified and Sanger sequenced for the identification of GDF9 
gene polymorphism. Three novel SNPs were identified at positions g. 97(T > A), 
g. 142 (G > G) and g. 313(C > T) in the promoter region of the caprine GDF9 gene 
which significantly (P < 0.05) influenced litter size, body measurement, and 
milk production traits in Damani goats. The genotype CT of SNP1 significantly 
(P < 0.05) improved litter size, genotype GG of SNP2 significantly (P < 0.05) 
enhanced milk production, while the genotypes CC of SNP3 significant (P < 0.05) 
increased body measurement traits in Damani goats. Moreover, in SNP1 loss of 3 
transcription factors (TF) binding sites occurred, SNP2 caused loss of two TFs 
binding sites, and SNP3 caused loss of a single TF binding site. Similarly, SNP1 
and SNP2 caused the gain of three new potential TF binding sites, and SNP3 
caused gain of two new TF binding sites. It is concluded that caprine GDF9 gene 
could be used as a candidate gene for litter size, milk production and body 
measurement traits in Damani goats through marker-assisted selection for future 
breeding program."
244,"Seals haul out of water for extended periods during the annual molt, when they 
shed and regrow their pelage. This behavior is believed to limit heat loss to 
the environment given increased peripheral blood flow to support tissue 
regeneration. The degree to which time in water, particularly during the molt, 
may affect thermoregulatory costs is poorly understood. We measured the resting 
metabolism of three spotted (Phoca largha), one ringed (Pusa hispida), and one 
bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seal during and outside the molting period, while 
resting in water and hauled out. Metabolic rates were elevated in spotted and 
ringed seals during molt, but comparable in water and air for individuals of all 
species regardless of molt status. Our data indicate that elevated metabolism 
during molt primarily reflects the cost of tissue regeneration, while increased 
haul out behavior is driven by the need to maintain elevated skin temperatures 
to support tissue regeneration."
245,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) mostly causes transient symptoms, but 
repeated (r)mTBI can lead to neurodegenerative processes. Diagnostic tools to 
evaluate the presence of ongoing occult neuropathology are lacking. In a mouse 
model of rmTBI we investigated MRI and plasma biomarkers of brain damage before 
chronic functional impairment arose. Anesthetized adult male and female C57BL/6J 
mice were subjected to rmTBI or a sham procedure. Sensorimotor deficits were 
evaluated up to 12 months post-injury in SNAP and Neuroscore tests. Cognitive 
function was assessed in the novel object recognition test at 6 and 12 months. 
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
were done at 6 and 12 months to examine white matter and structural damage 
respectively. Plasma levels of neurofilament light (NfL) were assessed 
longitudinally up to 12 months. Brain histopathology was done at 12 months. 
Independent groups of mice were used to examine the effects of 2-, 7- and 
14-days inter-trial intervals on acute plasma NfL levels and on hyperactivity. 
Twelve months after an acute transient impairment sensorimotor function declined 
again in rmTBI mice (p <0.001 vs sham), but not earlier. Similarly, rmTBI mice 
showed memory impairment at 12 (p <0.01 vs sham) but not at 6 months. White 
matter damage examined by DTI was evident in rmTBI mice at both 6 and 12 months 
(p <0.001 vs sham). This was associated with callosal atrophy (p <0.001 vs sham) 
evaluated by structural MRI. Plasma NfL at 1 week was elevated in rmTBI (p 
<0.001 vs sham), and its level correlated with callosal atrophy at 12 months 
(Pearson r=0.72, p <0.01). Histopathology showed thinning of the corpus callosum 
and marked astrogliosis in rmTBI mice. NfL levels were higher in mice subjected 
to short (2d) compared to longer (7 and 14d) inter-injury intervals (p <0.05) 
and this correlated with hyperactivity in mice (Pearson r=0.50; p <0.05). These 
findings show that rmTBI causes white matter pathology detectable by MRI before 
chronic functional impairment. Early quantification of plasma NfL correlates 
with the degree of white matter atrophy one year after after rmTBI, and can 
serve to monitor the brain's susceptibility to a second mTBI, supporting its 
potential clinical application to guide the return to practice in sport-related 
TBI."
246,"The introduction of continuous glucose monitoring inaugurated a new era in 
clinical practice by shifting the characterization of glycemic control from 
HbA1c to novel metrics. The one that gained widespread attention over the past 
decades was glycemic variability (GV), which typically refers to peaks and 
nadirs of blood glucose measured over a given time interval. GV can be 
dichotomized into two main categories: short-term and long-term. Short-term GV 
reflects within-day and between-day glycemic oscillations, and its contribution 
to diabetic complications remains an enigma. In this review, we summarize the 
available data about short-term GV and its possible association with both 
microvascular and macrovascular complications, evaluating different pathogenic 
mechanisms and demonstrating nonpharmaceutical, as well as pharmaceutical, 
therapeutic interventions."
247,"MOTIVATION: As non-coding driver mutations move more into the focus of cancer 
research, a comprehensive and easy to use software solution for regulatory 
variant analysis and data visualization is highly relevant. The interpretation 
of regulatory variants in large tumor genome cohorts requires specialized 
analysis and visualization of multiple layers of data, including for example 
breakpoints of structural variants, enhancer elements and additional available 
gene locus annotation, in the context of changes in gene expression.
RESULTS: We introduce a user-friendly tool, Revana (REgulatory Variant 
ANAlysis), that can aggregate and visually represent regulatory variants from 
cancer genomes in a gene-centric manner. It requires whole genome (WGS) and RNA 
sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of a cohort of tumor samples and creates interactive 
HTML reports summarizing the most important regulatory events.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Revana is implemented in R and JavaScript. It 
is available for download as an R package under 
<https://github.com/KiTZ-Heidelberg/revana>. Sample results can be viewed under 
<https://github.com/KiTZ-Heidelberg/revana-demo-report> and a short walkthrough 
is available under <https://github.com/KiTZ-Heidelberg/revana-demo-data>.

248,"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultra-low-dose (ULD) protocol for 
computed tomography (CT)-guided lung radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Patients who 
had undergone lung RFA between November 2017 and January 2021 were consecutively 
and retrospectively included. Thirty patients were treated using a conventional 
standard protocol (SP), including helical acquisitions with mA automatic 
adjustment and sequential CT at 80 kVp; and 31, with a ULD protocol defined with 
helical acquisitions with fixed mA and sequential series at 100 kVp. These 
parameters were selected from those used for a diagnostic lung low-dose CT 
scanner. Patient characteristics, dose indicators, technical efficacy (minimal 
margin [MM], recurrence during follow-up), and complications (pneumothorax, 
alveolar haemorrhage, and haemoptysis) were recorded. We included 61 patients 
(median age, 65 [54-73] and 33 women), with no significant differences according 
to the type of protocol, except for the type of anaesthesia. Even if the number 
of helical acquisitions did not significantly change, all dose indicators 
significantly decreased by 1.5-fold-3-fold. The median dose-length-product and 
effective dose, with their ranges, respectively, were 465 mGy cm (315-554) and 
6.5 mSv (4.4-7.8) in the SP group versus 178 mGy cm (154-267) and 2.5 mSv 
(2.2-3.7) in the ULD group, (p< 001). The ULD group exhibited lower 
intraoperator variability and better interoperator alignment than those of the 
SP group. The MM was not significantly different between the two groups (4.6 mm 
versus 5 mm,p= 16). One local recurrence was observed in each group at 8 months 
in the SP and at one year in the ULD group (p= 1). The complication rates did 
not differ significantly. Implementing an ULD protocol during lung RFA may 
provide similar efficacy, a reduction of dose indicators, and intra- and 
interoperator variability, without increasing complication rates, compared to 
those associated with an SP."
249,"BACKGROUND: Dysbiosis of gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in vascular 
dysfunction and microbial diversity was reported to be inversely correlated with 
arterial stiffness. However, the causal role of gut microbiota in the 
progression of arterial stiffness and the specific species along with the 
molecular mechanisms underlying this change remain largely unknown.
METHODS: Participants with elevated arterial stiffness and normal controls free 
of medication were matched for age and sex. The microbial composition and 
metabolic capacities between the 2 groups were compared with the integration of 
metagenomics and metabolomics. Subsequently, AngII (angiotensin II)-induced and 
humanized mouse model were employed to evaluate the protective effect of 
Flavonifractor plautii (F. plautii) and its main effector cis-aconitic acid.
RESULTS: Human fecal metagenomic sequencing revealed a significantly high 
abundance and centrality of F. plautii in normal controls, which was absent in 
the microbial community of subjects with elevated arterial stiffness. Moreover, 
blood pressure only mediated part of the effect of F. plautii on lower arterial 
stiffness. The microbiome of normal controls exhibited an enhanced capacity for 
glycolysis and polysaccharide degradation, whereas, those of subjects with 
increased arterial stiffness were characterized by increased biosynthesis of 
fatty acids and aromatic amino acids. Integrative analysis with metabolomics 
profiling further suggested that increased cis-aconitic acid served as the main 
effector for the protective effect of F. plautii against arterial stiffness. 
Replenishment with F. plautii and cis-aconitic acid improved elastic fiber 
network and reversed increased pulse wave velocity through the suppression of 
MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2) and inhibition of MCP-1 (monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1) and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-B) activation in both 
AngII-induced and humanized model of arterial stiffness.
CONCLUSIONS: Our translational study identifies a novel link between F. plautii 
and arterial function and raises the possibility of sustaining vascular health 
by targeting gut microbiota."
250,"BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) nasal screening appears promising for antimicrobial stewardship programs. 
However, a paucity of data remains on the diagnostic performance of 
culture-based MRSA screen in the intensive care unit (ICU) for pneumonia and 
bacteremia.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the predictive value of 
culture-based MRSA nasal screening for pneumonia and bacteremia in ICU and 
general ward patients.
METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study was conducted over a 23-month 
period. Adult patients with MRSA nasal screening ≤48 hours of collecting a 
respiratory and/or blood culture with concurrent initiation of anti-MRSA therapy 
were included. The primary endpoint was to compare the negative predictive value 
(NPV) associated with culture-based MRSA nasal screening between ICU and general 
ward patients with suspected pneumonia.
RESULTS: A total of 5106 patients representing the ICU (n = 2515) and general 
ward (n = 2591) were evaluated. The NPV of the MRSA nares for suspected 
pneumonia was not significantly different between ICU and general ward patient 
populations (98.3% and 97.6%, respectively; P = 0.41). The MRSA nares screening 
tool also had a high NPV for suspected bacteremia in ICU (99.8%) and general 
ward groups (99.7%) (P = 0.56). The overall positive MRSA nares rates in the ICU 
and general ward patient populations were 9.1% and 8.2%, respectively (P = 
0.283). Moreover, MRSA-positive respiratory and blood cultures among ICU 
patients were 5.8% and 0.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our findings support the routine use of MRSA nasal 
screening using the culture-based method in ICU patients with pneumonia. Further 
research on the clinical performance for MRSA bacteremia in the ICU is 
warranted."
251,"The impact of the 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) of 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) needs study. We analysed data from 989 MDS 
subjects classified using the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to 
determine the impact of the new proposal. Our analyses suggested the ICC 
criteria of MDS-SF3B1 identifies a more homogenous disease entity than the WHO 
2016 criteria of myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS). MDS, 
not otherwise specified with single lineage dysplasia (MDS, NOS-SLD) patients 
had a better prognosis than MDS, NOS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS, NOS-MLD) 
patients. MDS with mutated TP53 and MDS/acute myeloid leukaemia with mutated 
TP53 patients had the briefest survivals. These data support the ICC of MDS, 
which allows more accurate diagnoses and risk stratification."
252,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents 90% of liver tumors. Statins may 
reduce HCC incidence. Its antitumor activities may be mediated by disrupting 
several hepatocarcinogenic pathways. To evaluate in vivo and in vitro the 
antiproliferative and antiangiogenic action of atorvastatin (AT) in the 
development of HCC as well as its mechanisms of action. In vivo model: 
hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was used to promote the development of HCC in Balb/C 
nude mice. Number of hepatic tumor, liver cell proliferation parameters 
(proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA), angiogenesis, and VEGF levels were 
analyzed. In vitro model: Hep-G2 and Ea-hy926 cells were used to evaluate the 
effect of different doses of AT on HCB induced cell proliferation, migration, 
and vasculogenesis and to analyze proliferative parameters. In vivo: AT 
prevented liver growth and tumor development and inhibited PCNA, TGF-β1, and 
pERK levels increase. AT prevented skin blood vessel formation. In vitro, AT 
prevented cell proliferation and migration as well as tubular formation in the 
endothelial cell line by inhibiting the MAPK ERK pathway. We were able to 
demonstrate the potential AT antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects in an 
HCC model and the involvement of TGF-β1 and pERK pathways."
253,"Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione-class antidiabetic drug that reduces blood 
glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. We here investigated the interaction of 
rosiglitazone with Kv3.1 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using the 
whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Rosiglitazone rapidly and reversibly inhibited 
Kv3.1 currents in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 29.8 μM) and 
accelerated the decay of Kv3.1 currents without modifying the activation 
kinetics. The rosiglitazone-mediated inhibition of Kv3.1 channels increased 
steeply in a sigmoidal pattern over the voltage range of -20 to +30 mV, whereas 
it was voltage-independent in the voltage range above +30 mV, where the channels 
were fully activated. The deactivation of Kv3.1 current, measured along with 
tail currents, was also slowed by the drug. In addition, the steady-state 
inactivation curve of Kv3.1 by rosiglitazone shifts to a negative potential 
without significant change in the slope value. All the results with the use 
dependence of the rosiglitazone-mediated blockade suggest that rosiglitazone 
acts on Kv3.1 channels as an open channel blocker."
254,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) involves multi-factorial conditions linked to an 
elevated risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. 
Pre-metabolic syndrome (pre-MetS) possesses two MetS components but does not 
meet the MetS diagnostic criteria. Although cardiac autonomic derangements are 
evident in MetS, there is little information on their status in pre-MetS 
subjects. In this study, we sought to examine cardiac autonomic functions in 
pre-MetS and to determine which MetS component is more responsible for impaired 
cardiac autonomic functions. A total of 182 subjects were recruited and divided 
into healthy controls (n=89) and pre-MetS subjects (n=93) based on inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. We performed biochemical profiles on fasting blood samples 
to detect pre-MetS. Using standardized protocols, we evaluated anthropometric 
data, body composition, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability 
(HRV), and autonomic function tests (AFTs). We further examined these parameters 
in pre-MetS subjects for each MetS component. Compared to healthy controls, we 
observed a significant cardiac autonomic dysfunction (CAD) through reduced BRS, 
lower overall HRV, and altered AFT parameters in pre-MetS subjects, accompanied 
by markedly varied anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters. 
Furthermore, all examined BRS, HRV, and AFT parameters exhibited an abnormal 
trend and significant correlation toward hyperglycemia. This study demonstrates 
CAD in pre-MetS subjects with reduced BRS, lower overall HRV, and altered AFT 
parameters. Hyperglycemia was considered an independent determinant of 
alterations in all the examined BRS, HRV, and AFT parameters. Thus, 
hyperglycemia may contribute to CAD in pre-MetS subjects before progressing to 
MetS."
255,"Dragon's Blood is a member of the Chinese medicinal herb, having anti-oxygen and 
anti-inflammatory activity for the photoprotective effect. However, the poor 
water solubility of raw Dragon's Blood powder has limited its intradermal 
delivery process. In this study, we evaluated nanosuspensions to enhance 
intradermal delivery of Dragon's Blood exerting a photoprotective effect. The 
prepared nanosuspension was added to a composite hydrogel patch matrix for 
better skin application. In the present research, we used biocompatible 
materials hyaluronic acid and amino acid surfactants as nanosuspension 
stabilizers and agar/gelatin/sodium polyacrylate as hydrogel patch matrix. The 
prepared Dragon's Blood nanosuspension had a particle size of 447.0 ± 48.6 nm. 
The micro-structures morphology and viscoelasticity characteristics by SEM and 
rheological testing confirmed a sufficient crosslinked hydrogel network. The 
skin retention amount of Dragon's Blood nanosuspension was 1.48 times of raw 
Dragon's Blood powder water suspension, and the skin penetration amount of 
Dragon's Blood nanosuspension was only about 1/3 of Dragon's Blood DMSO 
solution. In the UVB-irradiated HaCaT cell phototoxicity model, Dragon's Blood 
nanosuspension also significantly increased cell viability by about 1 time of 
the model group and decreased the production of reactive oxygen species about 
1/2 times of model group. In vivo safety and efficiency evaluation experiment 
illustrated that DB-NS hydrogel patch processes have favorable safety and 
photoprotective effect with no skin irritancy and phototoxicity. Furthermore, 
DB-NS and DB-NS hydrogel patches could protect skin from UVA and UVB irritating 
skin reactions. Overall, our study of the combined use of biocompatible and 
biodegradable materials as excipients of nanosuspension and hydrogel patch could 
be used as an effective additive of Intradermal delivery and skin 
photoprotection."
256,"Although human hepatocyte-transplanted immunodeficient mice support infection 
with hepatitis viruses, these mice fail to develop viral hepatitis due to the 
lack of an adaptive immune system. In this study, we generated new 
immunodeficiency cDNA-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/SCID/Rag2-/- 
/Jak3-/- mice and established a mouse model with both a humanized liver and 
immune system. Transplantation of human hepatocytes with human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-A24 resulted in establishment of a highly replaced liver in 
cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mice. These mice were successfully infected with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) for a prolonged period and 
facilitate analysis of the effect of anti-HCV drugs. Administration of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from an HLA-A24 donor 
resulted in establishment of 22.6-81.3% human CD45-positive mononuclear cell 
chimerism in liver-infiltrating cells without causing graft-versus-host disease 
in cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mice without human hepatocyte transplantation. 
When mice were transplanted with human hepatocytes and then administered 
HLA-A24-positive human PBMCs, an alloimmune response between transplanted human 
hepatocytes and PBMCs occurred, with production of transplanted 
hepatocyte-specific anti-HLA antibody. In conclusion, we succeeded in 
establishing a humanized liver/immune system characterized by an allo-reaction 
between transplanted human immune cells and human liver using a novel 
cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mouse. This mouse model can be used to generate a 
chronic hepatitis mouse model with a human immune system with application not 
only to hepatitis virus virology but also to investigation of the pathology of 
post-transplantation liver rejection."
257,"OBJECTIVES: To clarify the efficacy of low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave 
therapy for patients with erectile dysfunction, compare the efficacy between two 
types of lithotripters (ED1000 [focused type] and Renova [linear type]), and 
detect factors indicative of therapeutic gain with the treatment.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 76 patients (52.8 ± 11.7 years) 
treated by ED1000 (12 times over 9 weeks) and 484 patients (52.5 ± 11.6 years) 
treated by Renova (4 times over 4 weeks). Age, sexual symptoms scores, and blood 
examinations were assessed. Efficacy was judged by improvement of the scores and 
patient satisfaction and compared between patients at 1 month after treatment 
with the lithotripters. Independent factors influencing efficacy by Renova were 
also assessed.
RESULTS: Sexual symptom scores were improved significantly by both 
lithotripters, although the changes in the scores did not differ significantly 
between them. Efficacy rate as judged by patient satisfaction was 65.8% with the 
ED1000 and 71.1% with Renova, also without significant difference. Among several 
factors including age, sexual symptoms scores, endocrinological factors, 
metabolic factors, and the rate of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use, only 
age was found to be an independent factor influencing the efficacy of Renova.
CONCLUSION: We clearly showed the high efficacy of both lithotripters. Although 
the efficacy rate did not differ between them, we speculated that the fewer 
treatment sessions needed with the Renova versus the ED1000 would be a great 
advantage for patients. We also suggest that Renova should be recommended for 
patients younger than 70 years of age."
258,"BACKGROUND: We analyzed our experience with descending necrotizing mediastinitis 
(DNM) treatment and investigated the efficacy of video-assisted thoracoscopic 
surgery (VATS) for mediastinal drainage.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis included patients who underwent surgical 
drainage for DNM at our hospital from 2005 to 2020. We analyzed patients' 
baseline characteristics, surgical data, and perioperative outcomes and compared 
them according to the mediastinal drainage approach among patients with type II 
DNM.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (male-to-female ratio, 18:7) with a mean age of 
54.0±12.9 years were enrolled in this study. The most common infection sources 
were pharyngeal infections (60%). Most patients had significantly increased 
white blood cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein levels, and decreased 
albumin levels on admission. The most common DNM type was type IIB (n=16, 64%), 
while 5 and 4 patients had types I and IIA, respectively. For mediastinal 
drainage, the transcervical approach was used in 15 patients and the 
transthoracic approach (VATS) in 10 patients. The mean length of hospital stay 
was 26.5±23.8 days, and the postoperative morbidity and in-hospital mortality 
rates were 24% and 12%, respectively. No statistically significant differences 
were found among patients with type II DNM between the transcervical and VATS 
groups. However, the VATS group showed shorter mean antibiotic therapy duration, 
drainage duration, and hospital stay length than the transcervical group.
CONCLUSION: DNM manifested as severe infection requiring long-term inpatient 
treatment, with a mortality rate of 12%. Thus, active treatment with a 
multidisciplinary approach is crucial, and mediastinal drainage using VATS is 
considered relatively safe and effective."
259,"The fusion peptide domain is necessary for the fusogenic activity of spike 
proteins in a variety of enveloped viruses, allowing the virus to infect the 
host cell, and is the only part of the protein that interacts directly with the 
target membrane lipid tails during fusion. There are consistent findings of 
poration by this domain in experimental model membrane systems, and in certain 
conditions, the isolated fusion peptides (FPs) can generate pores. Here, we use 
molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the specifics of how these 
FP-induced pores form in membranes with different compositions of lysolipid and 
POPC. The simulations show that pores form spontaneously at high lysolipid 
concentrations via hybrid intermediates, where FP aggregates in the cis leaflet 
tilt to form a funnel-like structure that spans the leaflet and locally reduces 
the hydrophobic thickness that must be traversed by water to form a pore. By 
restraining a single FP within an FP aggregate to this tilted conformation, 
pores can be formed in lower lysolipid-content membranes, including pure POPC, 
on the 100-ns timescale, much much more rapidly than in unbiased simulations in 
bilayers with the same composition. The pore formation pathway is similar to the 
spontaneous formation in high lysolipid. Depending on the membrane composition, 
the pores can be metastable (as seen in POPC) or lead to membrane rupture."
260,"BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported on platelet activity ex vivo 
and responsiveness in vitro among COVID-19 patients with or without 
thromboembolic complications.
OBJECTIVES: To assess platelet reactivity in moderate disease at early stages of 
COVID-19.
PATIENTS/METHODS: We performed a prospective, descriptive analysis on 100 
consecutive patients presenting with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the 
University Medical Center Freiburg during the first or second pandemic wave. 
Following PCR testing and compliance with study inclusion criteria, 20 
SARS-CoV-2 positive and 55 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (serving as patient 
controls) were enrolled. In addition, 15 healthy subjects were included. 
Platelet reactivity was assessed using whole blood impedance aggregometry and 
flow cytometry in response to various agonists.
RESULTS: Platelet aggregation was significantly impaired in COVID-19 patients as 
compared to patient controls or healthy subjects. The reduced platelet 
responsiveness in COVID-19 patients was associated with impaired activation of 
GPIIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3). By contrast, low P-selectin expression at baseline and 
intact secretion upon stimulation in vitro suggest that no pre-activation in 
vivo leading to ""exhausted"" platelets had occurred. The proportion of 
circulating platelet-neutrophil complexes was significantly higher in COVID-19 
patients (mean±SD, 41±13%) than in patient controls (18±7%; 95% CI:11.1-34.1; 
P=0.0002) or healthy subjects (17±4%; 95% CI:13.8-33.8; P<0.0001). Analysis of 
neutrophil adhesion receptors revealed up-regulation of CD11b (α-subunit of 
αMβ2) and CD66b (CEACAM8) but not of CD162 (PSGL-1) in COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite reduced platelet responsiveness, platelet-neutrophil 
complexes are increased at early stages of moderate disease. Thus, this cellular 
interaction may occur in COVID-19 without preceding platelet activation."
261,"Blood feeding patterns of mosquitoes are a key component in the dynamics of 
arboviral encephalitides transmission. In temperate Argentina, the members of 
the Culex pipiens complex include Cx. pipiens molestus, Cx. quinquefasciatus and 
their hybrids. To characterize their blood feeding patterns, adult resting 
mosquitoes were collected monthly during the warm season in urban and rural 
equestrian fields. The availability of birds and domestic mammals per site was 
characterized. The blood source and the complex member were successfully 
identified for 89 specimens using PCR. Blood of 19 vertebrate species was 
isolated including four mammals (most common feeds from dog, Canus lupus 19% of 
the blood meals; and horse, Equus caballus 18%) and 15 birds (picazuro pigeon, 
Patagioenas picazuro 11%; eared dove, Zenaida auriculata 10%; chicken, Gallus 
gallus 9%). The Forage Ratio (FR), calculated as the proportion of feeds taken 
from a given host species with respect to that host availability in the 
environment, suggested preference for dog by all members of the complex (FR 
≥4.5). On the contrary, FR values suggested avoidance for horse by Cx. 
quinquefasciatus and the hybrid (FR ≤0.8), and a use proportional to its 
abundance by Cx. pipiens molestus (FR = 1.1-1.2 in urban and rural sites, 
respectively). FR values suggesting preference were obtained for avian species 
of the orders Passeriformes (7 species in total) and Columbiformes (5) by all 
members of the complex (FR ≥ 3.3), whereas values for monk parakeet (Myiopsitta 
monachus, Psiitaciformes) suggested avoidance by Cx. quinquefasciatus in urban 
sites (FR = 0.4) and by Cx. pipiens molestus in rural sites (FR = 0.3) but not 
in urban sites (FR = 1.4). A mammal-bird index (MBI, from -1 all avian to +1 all 
mammalian blood meals) was calculated for each member of the complex and 
urbanization category. Values were negative for Cx. quinquefasciatus (MBIurban 
 = -0.60, MBIrural  = -0.33) and positive for Cx. pipiens molestus (MBIurban 
 = 0.20, MBIrural  = 0.60), indicating a higher proportion of feeds taken on 
birds and mammals, respectively, regardless of the urbanization category. In 
temperate Argentina, the members of the Cx. pipiens complex fed both on horses 
and on birds, thus representing a real risk of transmission of arboviral 
encephalitides from avian enzootic cycles to horse epizootics."
262,"OBJECTIVE: There were limited randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 
epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) versus tranexamic acid (TXA) in total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety 
of TXA and EACA in the combination of intravenous (IV) and intra-articular (IA) 
administration on reducing blood loss in patients following primary TKA.
METHODS: From January 2020 to January 2021, a total of 181 patients undergoing a 
primary unilateral TKA were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled 
trial. Patients in the TXA group (n = 90) received 20 mg/kg of intravenous TXA 
preoperatively, 1 g of intra-articular TXA intraoperatively, and three doses of 
20 mg/kg intravenous TXA at 0, 3, 6 h postoperatively. Patients in the EACA 
group (n = 91) received 120 mg/kg of intravenous EACA preoperatively, 2 g of 
intra-articular EACA intraoperatively, and three doses of 40 mg/kg intravenous 
EACA at 0, 3, 6 h postoperatively. The primary outcomes were total blood loss 
(TBL), transfusion rates and drop of hemoglobin (HB) level. The secondary 
outcomes included postoperative hospital stays and postoperative complications. 
The chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests were utilized to compare 
categorical variables, while the independent-samples t-tests and Mann-Whitney 
tests were used to compare continuous variables.
RESULTS: The patients who received TXA averaged less TBL than the patients who 
received EACA (831.83 ml vs 1065.49 ml, P = 0.015), and HB drop in TXA group was 
generally less than that of EACA group on postoperative day 1 and 3 
(20.84 ± 9.48 g/L vs 24.99 ± 9.40 g/L, P = 0.004; 31.28 ± 11.19 vs 
35.46 ± 12.26 g/L, P = 0.047). The length of postoperative stays in EACA group 
was 3.66 ± 0.81 day, which is longer than 2.62 ± 0.68 day in TXA group 
(P < 0.001). No transfusions were required in either group. The risk of nausea 
and vomiting in TXA group was significantly higher than that in EACA group 
(11/90 vs 0/91, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Although the TBL and HB drop were slightly greater in EACA group, 
these results were not clinically important, given that no transfusions were 
required. EACA could be an alternative to TXA, especially for patients with 
severe nausea and vomiting after using TXA postoperatively. Further studies are 
needed to adjust dosage of EACA to make better comparison of the two drugs."
263,"INTRODUCTION: Autistic individuals often have difficulties with recognizing what 
another person is saying in noisy conditions such as in a crowded classroom or a 
restaurant. The underlying neural mechanisms of this speech perception 
difficulty are unclear. In typically developed individuals, three cerebral 
cortex regions are particularly related to speech-in-noise perception: the left 
inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the right insula, and the left inferior parietal 
lobule (IPL). Here, we tested whether responses in these cerebral cortex regions 
are altered in speech-in-noise perception in autism.
METHODS: Seventeen autistic adults and 17 typically developed controls (matched 
pairwise on age, sex, and IQ) performed an auditory-only speech recognition task 
during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Speech was presented either 
with noise (noise condition) or without noise (no noise condition, i.e., clear 
speech).
RESULTS: In the left IFG, blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses 
were higher in the control compared to the autism group for recognizing 
speech-in-noise compared to clear speech. For this contrast, both groups had 
similar response magnitudes in the right insula and left IPL. Additionally, we 
replicated previous findings that BOLD responses in speech-related and auditory 
brain regions (including bilateral superior temporal sulcus and Heschl's gyrus) 
for clear speech were similar in both groups and that voice identity recognition 
was impaired for clear and noisy speech in autism.
DISCUSSION: Our findings show that in autism, the processing of speech is 
particularly reduced under noisy conditions in the left IFG-a dysfunction that 
might be important in explaining restricted speech comprehension in noisy 
environments."
264,"OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of patients 
with vasoproliferative retinal tumor (VPRT) in India.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 50 eyes in 47 patients.
RESULTS: Of the 50 eyes, 25 (50%) were primary and 25 (50%) were secondary. 
Common ocular pathologies related to secondary VPRT included retinal detachment 
(n = 8, 32%) and Coats disease (n = 7, 28%). Overall, the mean age at 
presentation was 35 years (range; 3-74 years) and included 30 (64%) males and 17 
(36%) females. The lesions were unilateral in 44 (94%) patients. Secondary 
retinal features included intra/subretinal exudation (n = 41, 82%), vascularity 
(n = 32, 64%), subretinal fluid (n = 21, 42%), retinal neovascularisation 
(n = 9, 18%) and vitreous hemorrhage (n = 8, 16%). Thirty-four eyes (68%) 
underwent cryotherapy, of which 16 eyes (47%) received adjunct intravitreal 
anti-VEGF (12 eyes) or corticosteroid injection (4 eyes). Primary surgery 
included vitrectomy with/without encirclage and cryotherapy (n = 12, 24%) and 
plaque brachytherapy (n = 3, 6%). At last follow-up (mean 9.7 months, range 3-67 
months), 42 eyes (84%) had complete tumor regression with no improvement in 
visual outcomes when comparing presenting and final best corrected visual 
acuity. Comparing primary versus secondary VPRT, secondary VPRT presented a 
decade earlier (31 vs 40 years), needed surgical intervention (48% vs 20%), had 
poor tumor control (72% vs 92%) and worse visual outcomes (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: VPRTs commonly present as a unilateral lesions in the adult 
population with equal prevalence of primary and secondary variants. Compared 
with primary VPRT, secondary VPRTs require surgical treatment and are associated 
with poor visual outcome."
265,"Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) causes lacunar stroke and intracerebral 
hemorrhage, and is the most common pathology underlying vascular cognitive 
impairment. Increasingly, the importance of other clinical features of SVD is 
being recognized including motor impairment, (vascular) parkinsonism, impaired 
balance, falls, and behavioral symptoms, such as depression, apathy, and 
personality change. Epidemiological data show a high prevalence of the 
characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of white matter 
hyperintensities and lacunar infarcts in community studies, and recent data 
suggest that it is also a major health burden in low- and middle-income 
countries. In this review, we cover advances in diagnosis, imaging, clinical 
presentations, pathogenesis, and treatment.The two most common pathologies 
underlying SVD are arteriolosclerosis caused by aging, hypertension, and other 
conventional vascular risk factors, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) caused 
by vascular deposition of β-amyloid. We discuss the revised Boston criteria of 
CAA based on MRI features, which have been recently validated. Imaging is 
providing important insights into pathogenesis, including improved detection of 
tissue damage using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) leading to its use to monitor 
progression and surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. Advanced MRI techniques 
can demonstrate functional or dynamic abnormalities of the blood vessels, while 
the high spatial resolution provided by ultrahigh field MRI at 7 T allows 
imaging of individual perforating arteries for the first time, and the 
measurement of flow velocity and pulsatility within these arteries. DTI and 
structural network analysis have highlighted the importance of network 
disruption in mediating the effect of different SVD pathologies in causing a 
number of symptoms, including cognitive impairment, apathy, and gait 
disturbance.Despite the public health importance of SVD, there are few proven 
treatments. We review the evidence for primary prevention, and recent data 
showing how intensive blood pressure lowering reduces white matter 
hyperintensities (WMH) progression and delays the onset of cognitive impairment. 
There are few treatments for secondary prevention, but a number of trials are 
currently evaluating novel treatment approaches. Recent advances have implicated 
molecular processes related to endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide synthesis, 
blood-brain barrier integrity, maintenance and repair of the extracellular 
matrix, and inflammation. Novel treatment approaches are being developed to a 
number of these targets. Finally, we highlight the importance of large 
International collaborative initiatives in SVD to address important research 
questions and cover a number which have recently been established."
266,"Long noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs; LncRNAs) endowed with both 
protein-coding and noncoding functions are referred to as 'dual functional 
lncRNAs'. Recently, dual functional lncRNAs have been intensively studied and 
identified as involved in various fundamental cellular processes. However, apart 
from time-consuming and cell-type-specific experiments, there is virtually no in 
silico method for predicting the identity of dual functional lncRNAs. Here, we 
developed a deep-learning model with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, 
LncReader, to identify dual functional lncRNAs. Our data demonstrated that 
LncReader showed multiple advantages compared to various classical machine 
learning methods using benchmark datasets from our previously reported cncRNAdb 
project. Moreover, to obtain independent in-house datasets for robust testing, 
mass spectrometry proteomics combined with RNA-seq and Ribo-seq were applied in 
four leukaemia cell lines, which further confirmed that LncReader achieved the 
best performance compared to other tools. Therefore, LncReader provides an 
accurate and practical tool that enables fast dual functional lncRNA 
identification."
267,"Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of 
multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg 
cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic 
strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, we report a ""Trojan 
horse""-like hybrid system, nanocapsule-coupled Th17 cells, for MS treatment. 
Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently 
transmigrated across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and homed to the inflamed MS 
niche. Aminooxy-acetic acid (AOA), a transdifferentiation inducer, was locally 
released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. We 
demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enabled in situ phenotypic 
transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti-inflammatory Treg cells. This 
phenotypic conversion led to a domino-like immune response that was conducive to 
MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation 
of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory 
to anti-inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients 
suffering from other autoimmune diseases. This article is protected by

268,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of intraumbilical vein oxytocin injection with 
standard management in reducing blood loss during the third and fourth stages of 
labor. Acute complications threaten the mother's life during the third and 
fourth stages of labor. The most common complication is postpartum hemorrhage, 
which remains a leading cause of maternal mortality, particularly in developing 
countries.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Gynecology and 
Obstetrics Department of Leonardo Martínez Valenzuela Hospital from January to 
June 2021. A probabilistic sample was used: 332 pregnant patients were enrolled 
in the study and randomized into the case (166 patients) and control (166 
patients) groups. The volume of blood lost was compared between the groups.
RESULTS: The median estimated blood loss was 120 mL (interquartile range [IQR], 
80-218.75 mL). There was a statistically significant difference between the 
groups, showing less estimated blood loss in the international unit group with a 
median of 80 mL (IQR, 60-100 mL) (P<0.001), and 200 mL (IQR, 143.75-300 mL) in 
the intramuscular (IM) group, highlighting that 66.8% of the IM group had an 
estimated blood loss >251 mL.
CONCLUSION: Any reduction in bleeding during labor is clinically relevant 
because it improves patient prognosis. The use of intraumbilical oxytocin 
injection with active management of the third stage of labor significantly 
reduced postpartum blood loss and the duration of the third stage compared with 
the IM group."
269,"BACKGROUND: BMP9-stimulated DPSCs, SCAPs and PDLSCs are effective candidates for 
repairing maxillofacial bone defects in tissue engineering, while the most 
suitable seed cell source among these three hDMSCs and the optimal combination 
of most suitable type of hDMSCs and BMP9 have rarely been explored. Moreover, 
the orthotopic maxillofacial bone defect model should be valuable but laborious 
and time-consuming to evaluate various candidates for bone regeneration. Thus, 
inspired from the maxillofacial bone defects and the traditional in vivo ectopic 
systems, we developed an intrabony defect repair model to recapitulate the 
healing events of orthotopic maxillofacial bone defect repair and further 
explore the optimized combinations of most suitable hDMSCs and BMP9 for bone 
defect repair based on this modified ectopic system.
METHODS: Intrabony defect repair model was developed by using decellularized 
bone matrix (DBM) constructs prepared from the cancellous part of porcine lumbar 
vertebral body. We implanted DBM constructs subcutaneously on the flank of each 
male NU/NU athymic nude mouse, followed by directly injecting the cell 
suspension of different combinations of hDMSCs and BMP9 into the central hollow 
area of the constructs 7 days later. Then, the quality of the bony mass, 
including bone volume fraction (BV/TV), radiographic density (in Hounsfield 
units (HU)) and the height of newly formed bone, was measured by micro-CT. 
Furthermore, the H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed to 
exam new bone and new blood vessel formation in DBM constructs.
RESULTS: BMP9-stimulated periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) exhibited the 
most effective bone regeneration among the three types of hDMSCs in DBM 
constructs. Furthermore, an optimal dose of PDLSCs with a specific extent of 
BMP9 stimulation was confirmed for efficacious new bone and new blood vessel 
formation in DBM constructs.
CONCLUSIONS: The reported intrabony defect repair model can be used to identify 
optimized combinations of suitable seed cells and biological factors for bone 
defect repair and subsequent development of efficacious bone tissue engineering 
therapies."
270,"BACKGROUND: Pyrotinib (an irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor) plus capecitabine has 
survival benefits and acceptable tolerability in patients with HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer. We further assessed addition of pyrotinib to 
trastuzumab and docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.
METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 study (PHEDRA), 
treatment-naive women with HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer 
were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of oral 
pyrotinib or placebo (400 mg) once daily, plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg 
loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg) and docetaxel (100 mg/m2) every 3 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was the total pathological complete response (tpCR; ypT0/is and 
ypN0) rate per independent central review.
RESULTS: Between Jul 23, 2018, and Jan 8, 2021, 355 patients were randomly 
assigned, 178 to the pyrotinib group and 177 to the placebo group. The majority 
of patients completed four cycles of neoadjuvant treatment as planned (92.7% and 
97.7% in the pyrotinib and placebo groups, respectively). The tpCR rate was 
41.0% (95% CI 34.0 to 48.4) in the pyrotinib group compared with 22.0% (95% CI 
16.6 to 28.7) in the placebo group (difference, 19.0% [95% CI 9.5 to 28.4]; 
one-sided P < 0.0001). The objective response rate per investigator was 91.6% 
(95% CI 86.6 to 94.8) in the pyrotinib group and 81.9% (95% CI 75.6 to 86.9) in 
the placebo group after the neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in an increase of 
9.7% (95% CI 2.7 to 16.6). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were 
diarrhea (79 [44.4%] in the pyrotinib group and nine [5.1%] in the placebo 
group), neutropenia (33 [18.5%] and 36 [20.3%]), and decreased white blood cell 
count (29 [16.3%] and 24 [13.6%]). No deaths were reported during neoadjuvant 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint of the study was met. Neoadjuvant pyrotinib, 
trastuzumab, and docetaxel significantly improved the tpCR rate compared with 
placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel, with manageable toxicity, providing a new 
option for HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer.

271,"BACKGROUND: The strongest risk factor of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) is 
aging. Spontaneous asparaginyl deamidation leading to formation of isoaspartate 
(isoAsp) has been correlated with protein aggregation in NDDs.
METHODS: Two cohorts consisting of 140 subjects were studied. Cohort 1 contained 
patients with AD and healthy controls, while Cohort 2 recruited subjects with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular dementia (VaD), frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls. The levels of 
isoAsp in plasma human albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in plasma, as 
well as the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific against deamidated HSA 
were measured. Apart from the memory tests, plasma biomarkers for NDDs reported 
in literature were also quantified, including amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides Aβ40 
and Aβ42, neurofilament light protein (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) protein.
RESULTS: Deamidation products of blood albumin were significantly elevated in 
vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia (P < 0.05), but less so in PD. 
Intriguingly, the deamidation levels were significantly (P < 0.01) associated 
with the memory test scores for all tested subjects. Deamidation biomarkers 
performed superiorly (accuracy up to 92%) compared with blood biomarkers 
Aß42/Aß40, NfL, GFAP and p-tau181 in separating mild cognitive impairment from 
healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the diagnostic capacity of deamidation-related 
biomarkers in predicting NDDs at the early stage of disease, and the biomarker 
levels significantly correlated with cognitive decline, strongly supporting the 
role of deamidation in triggering neurodegeneration and early stages of disease 
development. Prospective longitudinal studies with a longer observation period 
and larger cohorts should provide a more detailed picture of the deamidation 
role in NDD progression."
272,"BACKGROUND: High glycemic variability (GV) is a poor prognostic marker in 
cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to investigate the association of GV with 
all-cause mortality in patients with acute heart failure (HF).
METHODS: The Korean Acute Heart Failure registry enrolled patients hospitalized 
for acute HF from 2011 to 2014. Blood glucose levels were measured at the time 
of admission, during hospitalization, and at discharge. We included those who 
had 3 or more blood glucose measurements in this study. Patients were divided 
into two groups based on the coefficient of variation (CoV) as an indicator of 
GV. Among survivors of the index hospitalization, we investigated all-cause 
mortality at 1 year after discharge.
RESULTS: The study analyzed 2,617 patients (median age, 72 years; median 
left-ventricular ejection fraction, 36%; 53% male). During the median follow-up 
period of 11 months, 583 patients died. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed 
that high GV (CoV > 21%) was associated with lower cumulative survival (log-rank 
P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional analysis showed that high GV was 
associated with an increased risk of 1-year (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.26-1.92) 
mortality. High GV significantly increased the risk of 1-year mortality in 
non-diabetic patients (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.47-2.54) but not in diabetic patients 
(HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.86-1.65, P for interaction = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: High in-hospital GV before discharge was associated with all-cause 
mortality within 1 year, especially in non-diabetic patients with acute HF."
273,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer has been a serious public health dilemma for women 
worldwide, with not only physical and social impairments but also psychological 
stress responses such as rumination. Rumination is a constant preoccupation with 
thoughts. The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of 
mindfulness-based stress reduction training in lowering rumination among women 
diagnosed with breast cancer.
METHOD: This randomized controlled trial with a pretest, posttest, control 
group, and one-month follow-up design included 46 female breast cancer 
survivors, recruited from the clinics and hematology wards of Bushehr, Iran. The 
inclusion criterion was that at least three months should have passed since the 
last chemotherapy/radiotherapy. The participants were randomly assigned to two 
experimental and control groups. The experimental group received eight sessions 
of mindfulness-based stress reduction training. A demographic information form 
and a rumination questionnaire were used for data collection, and the 
participants completed the questionnaire in the pretest, posttest, and follow-up 
stages. Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and repeated-measures ANOVA were used to 
analyze the data. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the rumination scores of the 
experimental group at three measurement stages. For the control group, the mean 
rumination scores on the posttest and follow-up were both significantly higher 
than on the pre-test (P < 0.001). The control group's mean follow-up rumination 
score was significantly higher than that of the post-test (P = 0.02). A 
comparison of the two groups adjusted for the baseline showed a significant 
difference between them in terms of the mean rumination score on the post-test 
(P = 0.01) and follow-up (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The experimental group was more successful in avoiding increased 
rumination than the control group, an ability that can be attributed to the 
effect of mindfulness training. The use of this method is recommended because it 
is non-invasive, non-pharmacological, free from complications, and can be easily 
performed by women. However, future studies should consider larger samples and 
long-term follow-ups."
274,"BACKGROUND: Sprouting angiogenesis is an important mechanism for morphogenetic 
phenomena, including organ development, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. 
In regenerative medicine, therapeutic angiogenesis is a clinical solution for 
recovery from ischemic diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been 
clinically used given their pro-angiogenic effects. MSCs are reported to promote 
angiogenesis by differentiating into pericytes or other vascular cells or 
through cell-cell communication using multiple protein-protein interactions. 
However, how MSCs physically contact and move around ECs to keep the sprouting 
angiogenesis active remains unknown.
METHODS: We proposed a novel framework of EC-MSC crosstalk analysis using human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and MSCs obtained from mice 
subcutaneous adipose tissue on a 3D in vitro model, microvessel-on-a-chip, which 
allows cell-to-tissue level study. The microvessels were fabricated and cultured 
for 10 days in a collagen matrix where MSCs were embedded.
RESULTS: Immunofluorescence imaging using a confocal laser microscope showed 
that MSCs smoothed the surface of the microvessel and elongated the angiogenic 
sprouts by binding to the microvessel's specific microstructures. Additionally, 
three-dimensional modeling of HUVEC-MSC intersections revealed that MSCs were 
selectively located around protrusions or roots of angiogenic sprouts, whose 
surface curvature was excessively low or high, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of our microvessel-on-a-chip system for 3D 
co-culture and image-based crosstalk analysis demonstrated that MSCs are 
selectively localized to concave-convex surfaces on scaffold structures and that 
they are responsible for the activation and stabilization of capillary vessels."
275,"BACKGROUND: Advances in ultrasensitive detection of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 
in plasma has enabled the use of blood tests to measure Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biomarker changes. Examination of postmortem brains of participants with 
antemortem plasma p-tau levels remains critical to understanding comorbid and 
AD-specific contribution to these biomarker changes.
METHODS: We analyzed 35 population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants 
with plasma p-tau at threonine 181 and threonine 217 (p-tau181, p-tau217) 
available within 3 years of death. Autopsied participants included cognitively 
unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia, and non-AD neurodegenerative 
disorders. Global neuropathologic scales of tau, amyloid-β, TDP-43, and 
cerebrovascular disease were examined. Regional digital pathology measures of 
tau (phosphorylated threonine 181 and 217 [pT181, pT217]) and amyloid-β (6F/3D) 
were quantified in hippocampus and parietal cortex. Neurotransmitter hubs 
reported to influence development of tangles (nucleus basalis of Meynert) and 
amyloid-β plaques (locus coeruleus) were evaluated.
RESULTS: The strongest regional associations were with parietal cortex for tau 
burden (p-tau181 R = 0.55, p = 0.003; p-tau217 R = 0.66, p < 0.001) and 
amyloid-β burden (p-tau181 R = 0.59, p < 0.001; p-tau217 R = 0.71, p < 0.001). 
Linear regression analysis of global neuropathologic scales explained 31% of 
variability in plasma p-tau181 (Adj. R2 = 0.31) and 59% in plasma p-tau217 
(Adj. R2 = 0.59). Neither TDP-43 nor cerebrovascular disease global scales 
independently contributed to variability. Global scales of tau pathology 
(β-coefficient = 0.060, p = 0.016) and amyloid-β pathology 
(β-coefficient = 0.080, p < 0.001) independently predicted plasma p-tau217 when 
modeled together with co-pathologies, but only amyloid-β (β-coefficient = 0.33, 
p = 0.021) significantly predicted plasma p-tau181. While nucleus basalis of 
Meynert neuron count/mm2 was not associated with plasma p-tau levels, a lower 
locus coeruleus neuron count/mm2 was associated with higher plasma p-tau181 
(R = -0.50, p = 0.007) and higher plasma p-tau217 (R = -0.55, p = 0.002). 
Cognitive scores (Adj. R2 = 0.25-0.32) were predicted by the global tau scale, 
but not by the global amyloid-β scale or plasma p-tau when modeled 
simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher soluble plasma p-tau levels may be the result of an 
intersection between insoluble deposits of amyloid-β and tau accumulation in 
brain, and may be associated with locus coeruleus degeneration."
276,"BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES) strongly predicts morbidity and premature 
mortality, especially for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, the effect 
of these factors on Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is not clear yet. This study was 
conducted to assess the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and MetS.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 10,009 people aged 35-70 enrolled 
from May 2016 to August 2018. The MetS was defined according to The Standard 
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-adult treatment panel III (ATP 
III) or NCEP-ATP III criteria. Demographics and socioeconomic data were gathered 
face-to-face through trained interviews. Also, lab, anthropometrics, and blood 
pressure measurements were assayed for participants. Logistic regression was 
used to estimate the association between SES and MetS, adjusted for the 
potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of MetS in the participants was 39.1%. The crude 
odds ratios were statistically significant for all the assessed variables 
(p < 0.05). After adjustment for age, sex, physical activity, smoking, and 
alcohol use as potential confounders, the results indicated significant direct 
independent associations between skill level (p = 0.006) and Townsend index 
(p = 0.002) with MetS. In contrast, no significant associations between 
educational level and wealth status with MetS.
CONCLUSION: The results of our study showed that SES is related to MetS. Among 
the four assessed SES indicators, skilled levels and Townsend score are strongly 
associated with MetS. We recommend considering people's SES when interventional 
programs are planned and conducted on MetS in similar communities."
277,"BACKGROUND: Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN) accounts for a 
main cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic renal failure and uremia. 
This paper aimed to examine the effect of Ntrk1 on MsPGN development, so as to 
identify a novel therapeutic target for MsPGN.
METHODS: The MsPGN rat model was constructed by single injection of Thy1.1 
monoclonal antibody via the tail vein. Additionally, the Ntrk1 knockdown rat 
model was established by injection of Ntrk1-RNAi lentivirus via the tail vein. 
Periodic acid-schiff staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on 
kidney tissues. Moreover, the rat urinary protein was detected. Mesangial cells 
were transfected and treated with p38 inhibitor (SB202190) and ERK inhibitor 
(PD98059). Meanwhile, the viability and proliferation of mesangial cells were 
analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays. 
Gene expression was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) and Western-blot (WB) assays.
RESULTS: The proliferation of mesangial cells was enhanced in glomerulus and 
Ki67 expression was up-regulated in renal tubule of MsPGN rats. The urine 
protein level increased in MsPGN rats. Pro-inflammatory factors and Ntrk1 
expression were up-regulated in glomerulus of MsPGN rats. Ntrk1 up-regulation 
promoted the viability, proliferation, expression of pro-inflammatory factors 
and activation of the STAT3, p38 and ERK signaling pathways in mesangial cells. 
Ntrk1 knockdown reduced mesangial cell proliferation, urine protein, 
pro-inflammatory factors, activation of STAT3, p38 and ERK signaling pathways in 
glomerulus, and decreased Ki67 expression in renal tubule of MsPGN rats. 
Treatment with SB202190 and PD98059 reversed the effect of Ntrk1 on promoting 
the viability, proliferation and inflammatory response of mesangial cells.
CONCLUSION: Ntrk1 promoted mesangial cell proliferation and inflammation in 
MsPGN rats by activating the STAT3 and p38/ERK MAPK signaling pathways."
278,"BACKGROUND: In the treatment of ischemic cerebral stroke (ICS), most 
conventional treatments, including carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery 
stenting, may cause cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). For treated ICS 
patients, changes in cerebral blood flow are directly related to brain function. 
At present, computed tomography perfusion, dynamic susceptibility 
contrast-enhanced perfusion weighted imaging and magnetic resonance arterial 
spin labeling perfusion imaging are used to monitor cerebral blood flow, but 
they still have some limitations. Our study aimed to monitor the changes in 
cerebral cortical blood flow by laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) in CIRI 
model mice and to propose a new method for predicting outcomes after CIRI. 
C57BL/6 N mice were used to establish a mouse CIRI model based on a modified 
thread-occlusion method and divided into a good outcome group and a poor outcome 
group according to survival within 7 days. The cerebral cortical blood flow of 
the area supplied by the left middle cerebral artery was monitored by LSCI at 
baseline (before modeling), 1 h after ischemia, immediately after reperfusion 
and 24 h after reperfusion. Then, the brains of the mice were removed 
immediately and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to observe the pathological 
changes in brain neurons.
RESULTS: The cerebral cortical blood flow in the poor outcome group was 
obviously reduced compared with that less in the good outcome group at 24 h 
after reperfusion (180.8 ± 20.9 vs. 113.9 ± 6.4, p = 0.001), and at 24 h after 
reperfusion, the cerebral cortical blood flow was negatively correlated with the 
severity of brain tissue injury (p = - 0.710, p = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: LSCI can monitor the changes in cerebral cortical blood flow during 
CIRI in mice and could be used as a feasible method for predicting outcomes 
after CIRI in mice."
279,"BACKGROUND: The serum is rich in nutrients and plays an essential role in 
electrolyte and acid-base balance, maintaining cellular homeostasis. In 
addition, serum parameters have been commonly used as essential biomarkers for 
clinical diagnosis. However, little is known about the genetic mechanism of the 
serum parameters in ducks.
RESULTS: This study measured 18 serum parameters in 320 samples of the F2 
segregating population generated by Mallard × Pekin duck. The phenotypic 
correlations showed a high correlation between LDH, HBDH, AST, and ALT 
(0.59-0.99), and higher coefficients were also observed among TP, ALB, HDL-C, 
and CHO (0.46-0.87). And then, we performed the GWAS to reveal the genetic basis 
of the 18 serum biochemical parameters in ducks. Fourteen candidate 
protein-coding genes were identified with enzyme traits (AST, ALP, LDH, HBDH), 
and 3 protein-coding genes were associated with metabolism and protein-related 
serum parameters (UA, TG). Moreover, the expression levels of the above 
candidate protein-coding genes in different stages of breast muscle and 
different tissues were analyzed. Furthermore, the genes located within the 
high-LD region (r2 > 0.4 and - log10(P) < 4) neighboring the significant locus 
also remained. Finally, 86 putative protein-coding genes were used for GO and 
KEGG enrichment analysis, the enzyme-linked receptor protein signaling pathway 
and ErbB signaling pathway deserve further focus.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results can contribute to new insights into blood 
metabolism and provide new genetic biomarkers for application in duck breeding 
programs."
280,"Rasagiline has a certain potential in neuroprotection and delaying the 
progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the poor pharmacokinetics (PK) 
characteristics of conventional oral tablets and poor medication compliance 
limit the optimal efficacy of rasagiline. Based on this, we designed and 
optimized a sustained-release rasagiline in situ gel based on in vitro release 
and in vivo PK results. Among them, we found for the first time that aluminum 
hydroxide can effectively shorten the lag phase and promote early and late 
release, making the daily release more uniform. After subcutaneous 
administration of the optimized gel formulation at a monthly dose, the Cmax 
(64 ng/ml) was lower than that of free rasagiline (494 ng/ml) administered 
subcutaneously at a daily dose and comparable to that of oral administration of 
Azilect® (59.1 ng/ml) at a daily dose. In the meantime, the plasma concentration 
of rasagiline was mainly maintained at 5-10 ng/ml for about 1 month, and the 
active metabolite 1-aminoindane in plasma was also able to maintain a steady 
state. The rasagiline in situ gel has suitable viscosity and injectability, good 
repeatability of subcutaneous injection, and controllable impurities and can 
achieve sustained release in vivo with small burst release, which may have the 
clinical application advantages of maximizing the disease-modifying effect of 
rasagiline and improving medication compliance. The rasagiline in situ gel was 
optimized through the feedback of in vitro release and in vivo pharmacokinetics 
(PK), in which the addition of aluminum hydroxide had a modulating effect on 
uniform release. The gel has low burst release and maintains steady-state blood 
drug concentration for about 1 month."
281,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis) 
is a chronic inflammation-induced cholestatic process in the liver. 
Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) are observed in around 90% of patients, 
which suggests that PBC is an autoimmune disease. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), 
ADH isoenzymes and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are localized in the liver, and 
they are useful markers of liver dysfunction. In this study, the activity of 
total ADH, ADH isoenzymes and ALDH was evaluated in the blood serum of patients 
with PBC. The experimental group comprised 50 PBC patients, both male and 
female, aged 28-67. The control group consisted of 50 healthy subjects, both 
male and female, aged 25-65. The serum activity of class I ADH, class II ADH and 
ALDH was measured by spectrofluorophotometry, whereas total ADH and class III 
ADH activity was determined by photometry methods. The activity of class I ADH 
and total ADH was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the 
control group (p < 0.001). An increase in class I ADH and total ADH activity 
indicates that the isoenzyme class I ADH is released by compromised liver cells 
and can be useful diagnostic markers of PBC."
282,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Periodontitis is a highly prevalent disease in 
psychiatric patients, including those undergoing symptomatic treatment with 
second-generation antipsychotics. Some of these drugs, such as clozapine (CLO) 
and olanzapine (OLA), have prominent metabolic effects such as weight gain, 
hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, which are risk factors for periodontitis. In 
addition to the metabolic effects, there are reports of changes in salivary 
flow, gingival bleeding, and caries. In this context, we aimed to evaluate if 
the metabolic effects of OLA and CLO alter periodontal parameters in an animal 
model of periodontitis without the environmental and psychosocial biases 
inherent to human diseases.
METHODS: In the first set of experiments, male and female adult Wistar rats 
received oral administration of CLO, OLA, or vehicle for 45 days. They were 
evaluated for body mass composition and weight gain, blood glucose parameters 
(fasting and glucose tolerance and insulin resistance tests), and lipid profile 
(HDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides). In a second set of experiments, the 
same measurements were performed in female rats exposed to the antipsychotics 
for 45 days and ligature-induced periodontitis on the 30th day of treatment. 
Macroscopic measurements of exposed roots, microtomography in the furcation 
region of the first molar, and histological evaluation of the region between the 
first and second molars were evaluated to assess bone loss. Additionally, 
gingival measurements of myeloperoxidase activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine 
TNF-α were made.
RESULTS: Only females exposed to OLA had more significant weight gain than 
controls. They also exhibited differences in glucose metabolism. 
Ligature-induced periodontitis produced intense bone retraction without changing 
the density of the remaining structures. The bone loss was even higher in rats 
with periodontitis treated with OLA or CLO and was accompanied by a local 
increase in TNF-α caused by CLO. These animals, however, did not exhibit the 
same metabolic impairments observed for animals without periodontitis.
CONCLUSION: The use of clozapine and olanzapine may be a risk factor for 
periodontal disease, independent of systemic metabolic alterations."
283,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are utilized as a carrier of 
anti-tumor agents in targeted anti-cancer therapy. Despite the improvements in 
this area, there are still some unsolved issues in determining the appropriate 
dose, method of administration and biodistribution of MSCs. The current study 
aimed to determine the influence of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation on 
the potential of MSCs migration to the neoplasm environment in the mouse 
melanoma model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) were isolated from the GFP+ 
transgenic C57BL/6 mouse and treated with different doses (1 µg/ml and 10 µg/ml) 
of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, the related TLR3 agonist, at various time 
points (1 and 4 h). Following the treatment, the expression of targeted genes 
such as α4, α5, and β1 integrins and TGF-β and IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokines 
was determined using real-time PCR. In vivo live imaging evaluated the migration 
index of the intraperitoneally (IP) injected treated ADMSCs in a lung 
tumor-bearing mouse (C57BL/6) melanoma model (n = 5). The presented findings 
demonstrated that TLR3 stimulation enhanced both migration of ADMSCs to the 
tumor area compared with control group (n = 5) and expression of α4, α5, and β1 
integrins. It was also detected that the engagement of TLR3 resulted in the 
anti-inflammatory behavior of the cells, which might influence the directed 
movement of ADMSCs.
CONCLUSION: This research identified that TLR3 activation might improve the 
migration via the stimulation of stress response in the cells and depending on 
the agonist concentration and time exposure, this activated pathway drives the 
migratory behavior of MSCs."
284,"To report clinical outcomes following ocular injury from foam dart (nerf) 
blasters - a spring-loaded toy guns that fire foam-coated darts or bullets at a 
relatively low velocity. These guns gained popularity in recent years among 
children and adolescents. Eleven patients with ocular injuries from foam dart 
blasters were included in this retrospective, single-center study. Visual acuity 
(VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and anterior segment, glaucoma-related, and 
vitreoretinal complications were recorded at each visit. The average age at 
presentation was 13.4 years and 82% were male. Mean initial VA was 6/12 (range 
6/6 - 1/18); On initial examination, nine patients (82%) had hyphema, three 
(27%) had corneal abrasions, three (27%) had vitreous hemorrhage, and two (18%) 
had traumatic mydriasis. Four patients (36%) experienced glaucoma-related 
complications, including three (27%) with angle recession and three (27%) with 
increased IOP. Three patients (27%) were diagnosed with posterior segment 
injuries, including three (27%) with commotio retinae and one (9%) with severe 
retinal photoreceptor damage. No patients required surgical intervention.
CONCLUSION: Foam dart blasters can cause severe blunt ocular trauma and 
permanent visual loss, illustrating the need for eye protection when handling 
these toys.
WHAT IS KNOWN: • Foam dart blasters, a blanket term for spring-loaded toy guns 
that fire foam-coated darts or bullets at a relatively low velocity, have gained 
popularity in recent years among pediatric populations, with an increase in 
associated ocular injuries. • To date, scattered case reporting provides 
insufficient insight into the full clinical spectrum of injury and prognosis of 
foam dart blasters related ocular injury.
WHAT IS NEW: • This case series characterizes the myriad foam dart blasters 
injuries that may afflict the eye, most of which are self-limiting, but some of 
which may result in poor visual outcomes and lifelong disability in pediatric 
patients. • We strongly recommend that all users wear eye protection while using 
foam dart blasters."
285,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of intact cord 
resuscitation (ICR) in very preterm infants using a custom-equipped mobile 
resuscitation trolley (LifeStart®). We collected maternal and neonatal data of 
all inborn infants < 32 weeks eligible for ICR per our protocol over 9 months 
from ICR implementation. We compared rates of ICR between the beginning and the 
end of the study period. We reviewed maternal and neonatal adverse events 
related to the procedure and direct outcomes. In order to assess potential 
quality improvements related to the procedure, we collected the same data in the 
infants born in the 9-month period preceding ICR implementation. Out of 44 
infants born < 32 weeks during the period, 27 were eligible for ICR. Failure to 
initiate ICR occurred in 9/27, exclusively in the first 5.5 months of the study. 
In one infant, ICR was interrupted prior to 2 min due to placental abruption. No 
ICR procedure had to be interrupted due to insufficient cord length. Among the 
18 infants who completed ICR, cord clamping timing increased significantly over 
the study period, from 3.0 [2.5-3.5] to 4.2 min [3.1-8.3] (p = 0.02). No 
significant maternal blood loss or wound complications were noted. No infant 
deaths were attributable to failure or direct consequence of ICR, and no infant 
experienced hypoxic respiratory failure (intubation, FiO2 ≥ 0.4), asphyxia 
(pH < 7.2), or blood pressure instability (< 2 SD) following stabilization. 
Hemoglobin level after cord clamping was higher in the ICR cohort than in the 
pre-implementation group. Seven out of 18 infants exposed to ICR had a 
temperature < 36.5 °C on admission.   Conclusion: ICR is feasible in very 
preterm infants. Temperature management requires special attention. 
Multidisciplinary simulation training before implementation and systematic 
post-implementation quality improvement meetings may significantly increase ICR 
program success. What is Known: • Because infants born < 32 weeks often require 
cardiorespiratory resuscitation at birth, they are not offered delayed cord 
clamping in the majority of neonatal intensive care units. • Recently, fully 
equipped mobile trolleys have been developed in order to allow bedside 
resuscitation with an intact cord. What is New: • Variable timing of cord 
clamping based on the infant's transition and respiratory stability, i.e., 
""physiology-based cord clamping,"" is safely achievable in very preterm infants. 
• Intact cord resuscitation requires specific equipment, operational protocols, 
and a high level of preparation from both obstetrical and neonatal teams, with a 
learning curve that can be streamlined by multidisciplinary simulation training."
286,"The international precision oncology program INFORM enrolls relapsed/refractory 
pediatric cancer patients for comprehensive molecular analysis. We report a 
two-year pilot study implementing ex vivo drug sensitivity profiling (DSP) using 
a library of 75-78 clinically relevant drugs. We included 132 viable tumor 
samples from 35 pediatric oncology centers in seven countries. DSP was conducted 
on multicellular fresh tumor tissue spheroid cultures in 384-well plates with an 
overall mean processing time of three weeks. In 89 cases (67%), sufficient 
viable tissue was received; 69 (78%) passed internal quality controls. The DSP 
results matched the identified molecular targets, including BRAF, ALK, MET, and 
TP53 status. Drug vulnerabilities were identified in 80% of cases lacking 
actionable (very) high-evidence molecular events, adding value to the molecular 
data. Striking parallels between clinical courses and the DSP results were 
observed in selected patients. Overall, DSP in clinical real-time is feasible in 
international multicenter precision oncology programs."
287,"There is a paucity of data on management strategies and clinical outcomes after 
recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). In a multicenter registry enrolling 3027 
patients with acute symptomatic VTE, the current study population was divided 
into the following 3 groups: (1) First recurrent VTE during anticoagulation 
therapy (N = 110); (2) First recurrent VTE after discontinuation of 
anticoagulation therapy (N = 116); and (3) No recurrent VTE (N = 2801). Patients 
with first recurrent VTE during anticoagulation therapy more often had active 
cancer (45, 25 and 22%, P < 0.001). Among 110 patients with first recurrent VTE 
during anticoagulation therapy, 84 patients (76%) received warfarin at recurrent 
VTE with the median prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) 
value at recurrent VTE of 1.6, although patients with active cancer had a 
significantly higher median PT-INR value at recurrent VTE compared with those 
without active cancer (2.0 versus 1.4, P < 0.001). Within 90 days after 
recurrent VTE, 23 patients (20.9%) during anticoagulation therapy and 24 
patients (20.7%) after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy died. Active 
cancer was a major cause of recurrent VTE during anticoagulation therapy as a 
patient-related factor, while sub-optimal intensity of anticoagulation therapy 
was a major cause of recurrent VTE during anticoagulation therapy as a 
treatment-related factor, particularly in patients without active cancer."
288,"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous preterm birth is challenging to prevent. Only few 
predictors of spontaneous preterm birth risk have been reported, and further 
studies on spontaneous preterm birth should be conducted to reduce the number of 
cases.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to explore if anti-β2-glycoprotein I 
antibody can be used to predict the risk of spontaneous preterm birth, and its 
clinical value in assessing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth.
METHODS: A total of 302 pregnant women who had delivered between January 2019 
and December 2021 were enrolled into the study. The subjects were assigned to 
the case group (28-33+6 weeks, n = 41; 34-36+6 weeks, n = 96) and control group 
(37-42 weeks, n = 165) according to the gestational period. The age, body mass 
index, and gestational days of the two groups were recorded. Blood samples were 
collected and the levels of anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody, white blood cell, 
red blood cell, hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine 
aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, creatinine, glucose, triglyceride, 
and total cholesterol were evaluated. Pregnant women diagnosed with sPTB that 
met the standards after evaluation by the clinician were included in the study.
RESULTS: The level of anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody was higher in case group 
than in the control group [(23.93 ± 8.11)Ru/mL vs (11.50 ± 5.33)Ru/mL]. The 
results showed that anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody was an independent risk 
factor for spontaneous preterm birth. The area under ROC curve of 
anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody to predict spontaneous preterm birth was 0.8875 
(95%CI 0.8443-0.9307). The highest predicted value of anti-β2-glycoprotein I 
antibody was 16.49Ru/ml.
CONCLUSION: Anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody has a high clinical significance and 
can be used by clinicians to evaluate the probability of spontaneous preterm 
birth."
289,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia has a 
high mortality rate; however, its treatment methods have not been standardized.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis developed acute 
respiratory failure about 3 weeks after lung cancer surgery. There were 
increased diffuse frosted shadows in both lung fields. His condition was 
diagnosed as an acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia associated with 
rheumatoid arthritis, and he was started on steroid pulse therapy; however, his 
respiratory condition deteriorated. He was urgently intubated and started on 
veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Further, intensive care, 
including blood purification therapy, was initiated. The blood purification 
therapy comprised a combination of hemodiafiltration and 6-h polymyxin 
B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion. The patient was weaned off 
veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, extubated, and discharged from 
the intensive care unit on the ninth day.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood purification therapy was effective for acute exacerbation of 
interstitial pneumonia."
290,"The present study investigates the natural dyeing of nylon fabric using the 
dragon's blood resin extract. Response surface methodology was used to optimize 
the process variables including pH (3-9), temperature (50-100 °C), concentration 
(10-50%owf), and time (30-90 min). From a visual point of view, diverse 
eco-friendly shades with a rather diverse color gamut of varied hue and tone 
were generated by applying a wide range of natural and eco-label mordants. The 
impact of 4 bio-mordants (including peppermint, mugworts (Artemisia), Dorema 
ammoniacum (DA) gum, and pomegranate rind), as well as 4 mineral mordants (alum, 
copper (II) sulfate, potassium dichromate, and iron (II) sulfate) on the color 
and fastness properties of the dyed nylon samples, was assessed. The 
concentration of the used mordants was 5%owf, and the dyeing experiments were 
conducted by applying the pre-mordanting technique. Measurement of the color 
strength (K/S) of the dyed fabric was done using a reflectance 
spectrophotometer. The dyed nylon fastness qualities and the colorimetric 
characteristics were then evaluated by applying the related standards. The 
results showed that the optimum conditions for obtaining the highest color 
strength were dye concentration = 50%owf, pH = 6, temperature = 100 °C, and 
dyeing tome = 60 min. The proposed ISO standards in relation to colorfastness 
displayed acceptable ratings for the color strength of dragon's blood resin dyed 
fabric while its treatment was done by applying bio-mordants in comparison to 
its metallic counterparts. Therefore, dragon's blood resin could be regarded as 
a promising eco-friendly natural colorant source for the purpose of sustainable 
nylon dyeing."
291,"Cardiovascular function is related to age, sex, and state of consciousness. We 
hypothesized that cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) demonstrates 
different patterns in both sexes before and after 50 years of age and that these 
patterns are associated with patterned changes during the sleep-wake cycle. We 
recruited 67 healthy participants (aged 20-79 years; 41 women) and divided them 
into four age groups: 20-29, 30-49, 50-69, and 70-79 years. All the participants 
underwent polysomnography and blood pressure measurements. For each participant, 
we used the average of the arterial pressure variability, heart rate variability 
(HRV), and BRS parameters during the sleep-wake stages. BRS and HRV parameters 
were significantly negatively correlated with age. The BRS indexes were 
significantly lower in the participants aged ≥ 50 years than in those 
aged < 50 years, and these age-related declines were more apparent during 
non-rapid eye movement sleep than during wakefulness. Only BRS demonstrated a 
significantly negative correlation with age in participants ≥ 50 years old. 
Women exhibited a stronger association than men between BRS and age and an 
earlier decline in BRS. Changes in BRS varied with age, sex, and consciousness 
state, each demonstrating a specific pattern. The age of 50 years appeared to be 
a crucial turning point for sexual dimorphism in BRS. Baroreflex modulation of 
the cardiovascular system during sleep sensitively delineated the age- and 
sex-dependent BRS patterns, highlighting the clinical importance of our results. 
Our findings may aid in screening for neurocardiac abnormalities in apparently 
healthy individuals."
292,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an effective target for those 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancers that retain the wild-type RAS gene. 
However, its efficacy in many cancers, including bladder cancer, is unclear. 
Here, we studied the in vitro effects of cetuximab monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
targeting EGFR on the bladder cancer cells and role of CD46. Cetuximab was found 
to inhibit the growth of both colon and bladder cancer cell lines. Furthermore, 
cetuximab treatment inhibited AKT and ERK phosphorylation in the bladder cancer 
cells and reduced the expression of CD46 membrane-bound proteins. Restoration of 
CD46 expression protected the bladder cancer cells from cetuximab-mediated 
inhibition of AKT and ERK phosphorylation. We hypothesized that CD46 provides 
protection to the bladder cancer cells against mAb therapies. Bladder cancer 
cells were also susceptible to cetuximab-mediated immunologic anti-tumor 
effects. Further, cetuximab enhanced the cell killing by activating both 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) in bladder cancer cells. Restoration of CD46 expression 
protected the cells from both CDC and ADCC induced by cetuximab. Together, CD46 
exhibited a cancer-protective effect against both direct (by involvement of PBMC 
or complement) and indirect cytotoxic activity by cetuximab in bladder cancer 
cells. Considering its clinical importance, CD46 could be an important link in 
the action mechanism of ADCC and CDC intercommunication and may be used for the 
development of novel therapeutic strategies."
293,"BACKGROUND: The predictive value of hematological markers in the outcomes after 
laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair (IPOM) remains to be 
investigated. We aim to evaluate the role of platelet-related parameters after 
laparoscopic IPOM in patients with incisional hernias.
METHODS: The data of 95 patients who underwent laparoscopic IPOM for 
appendicectomy-related incisional hernias were retrospectively analyzed. The 
complete blood count analyses were measured preoperatively, and the outcomes 
were obtained from hospital records and follow-up calls to patients. 
Platelet-multiple-lymphocyte index (PLM), neutrophil-leukocyte ratio (NLR), 
lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and systemic 
immune-inflammation index (SII) values were calculated. The patients were 
grouped based on the recurrence and the postoperative complications after 
surgery.
RESULTS: Using cutoff values acquired by the Youden Index, we found platelet 
levels < 212.0 × 1000/μl, NLR > 2.33, LMR < 3.17, and PLM < 365.5 were revealed 
to be statistically significant in the recurrence of hernias based on univariant 
or multivariant analysis (p =  < 0.05). We further divided the patients into two 
groups based on the cutoff value of PLM and found that a PLM value < 365.5 was 
significantly associated with the recurrence of incisional hernia (p = 0.018), 
the occurrence of postoperative seroma (p = 0.044), and there is a tendency that 
patients with PLM < 365.5 may suffer from other postoperative complications such 
as cardiopathy, respiratory infection, and hypoproteinemia (p = 0.089).
CONCLUSION: The preoperative hematological values, especially PLM, may indicate 
the outcomes in incisional hernias after laparoscopic IPOM."
294,"Sedentary time is associated with increased risks of detrimental health 
outcomes. Prolonged sedentary time associates with cardiometabolic risk factors 
and increased mortality regardless of physical activity. Therefore, the purpose 
of this study was to examine the associations of sedentary time and 
cardiometabolic risk factors among university employees in Eastern Ethiopia. A 
cross-sectional study was conducted among 1200 participants. Data were collected 
using the World Health Organization STEPS survey instrument, and sedentary 
behavior questionnaire in hour per day. Sedentary time is the time spent for any 
duration (minutes per day or hours per day) by considering a local context. 
Study participants were asked how many minutes or hours they spent in sedentary 
time at work, their leisure time and in transportation. Finally, the total 
sedentary time was calculated by the sum of the individual spent in sedentary 
time at work, leisure, and transportation. Cardiometabolic risk factors were 
assessed with blood samples analysis and anthropometric measurements. The 
associations between sedentary time and cardiometabolic risk factors were 
examined using linear regression models. An adjusted coefficient (β) with the 
95% confidence interval (CI) was used to report the results. p value < 0.05 was 
considered for statistical significance. The mean age of the study participants 
were (35 ± 9.4 years). Almost half of the study participants, 566 (48.6) were 
women and 598 (51.4%) were men. As the total sedentary time was increased by one 
unit, the body mass index increased by β = 0.61; (95% CI 0.49-0.71),waist 
circumference increased by β = 1.48; (95% CI 1.14-1.82), diastolic blood 
pressure increased by β = 0.87; (95% CI 0.56-1.18), systolic blood pressure 
increased by β = 0.95; (95% CI 0.45-1.48), triglycerides increased by β = 7.07; 
(95% CI 4.01-10.14), total cholesterol increased by β = 3.52; (95% CI 
2.02-5.02), fasting plasma glucose increased by β = 4.15; (95% CI 5.31-4.98) and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by β = 2.14; (95% CI 0.96-3.33) 
with the effects of other variables maintain constant. These findings depict the 
need for strategies that policymakers should promote physical activity and 
encouraging the breaking up of prolonged sedentary time to reduce 
cardiometabolic risk factors among university employees in Ethiopia."
295,"Heart development is a continuous process involving significant remodeling 
during embryogenesis and neonatal stages. To date, several groups have used 
single-cell sequencing to characterize the heart transcriptomes but failed to 
capture the progression of heart development at most stages. This has left gaps 
in understanding the contribution of each cell type across cardiac development. 
Here, we report the transcriptional profile of the murine heart from early 
embryogenesis to late neonatal stages. Through further analysis of this dataset, 
we identify several transcriptional features. We identify gene expression 
modules enriched at early embryonic and neonatal stages; multiple cell types in 
the left and right atriums are transcriptionally distinct at neonatal stages; 
many congenital heart defect-associated genes have cell type-specific 
expression; stage-unique ligand-receptor interactions are mostly between 
epicardial cells and other cell types at neonatal stages; and mutants of 
epicardium-expressed genes Wt1 and Tbx18 have different heart defects. 
Assessment of this dataset serves as an invaluable source of information for 
studies of heart development."
296,"OBJECTIVE: This study compared intermittent fasting and protein pacing (IF-P) 
versus a heart-healthy caloric restriction (CR) diet, matched for energy intake 
and physical activity energy expenditure, on body weight, total and visceral fat 
mass, and cardiometabolic health outcomes in adults with obesity.
METHODS: IF-P (n = 21) and CR (n = 20) were assessed pre- (week 0), mid- (week 
5), and post- (week 9) intervention.
RESULTS: Both groups reduced (p < 0.05) weight, total and visceral fat mass, 
blood pressure and lipids, and desire to eat food and increased proportion of 
fat-free mass. IF-P resulted in greater (p < 0.05) reductions in weight (-9% vs. 
-5%), total (-16% vs. -9%) and visceral (-33% vs. -14%) fat mass, and desire to 
eat (-17% vs. 1%) and increased fat-free mass percent (6% vs. 3%) compared with 
CR. These improvements were despite similar weekly total energy intake (IF-P, 
9470 ± 550 vs. CR, 9095 ± 608 kcal/wk; p = 0.90) and physical activity energy 
expenditure (IF-P, 300 ± 150 vs. CR, 350 ± 200 kcal/d; p = 0.79).
CONCLUSIONS: IF-P and CR optimize weight loss, body composition, cardiometabolic 
health, and hunger management, with IF-P providing greater benefits."
297,"Antithrombotic therapy and digestive endoscopy Antithrombotic therapy comprises 
anticoagulation and antiplatelet treatment. The number of patients treated with 
various forms of antithrombotic therapy is growing. Procedures of digestive 
endoscopy are very frequently indicated by general practitioners and doctors of 
various specialisations. Interdisciplinary cooperation and mutual understanding 
are required in order for digestive endoscopy to be effective and safe. Hence, 
we present an overview based on recent European, British (1), and North American 
guidelines (2) for endoscopic procedures, with respect to guidelines for 
perioperative care in general (3). Antithrombotic therapy management in patients 
undergoing digestive endoscopy procedures is based on individual consideration 
of postprocedural bleeding (particularly a delayed one) on one hand, and 
thromboembolic risk on the other hand, ideally in cooperation with the physician 
prescribing antithrombotic therapy. Despite all efforts, patients taking 
antithrombotic medication are at a higher risk of postprocedural bleeding in 
comparison with those without this risk; this fact should be accepted by 
attending physicians and patients should be informed of it. Postprocedural 
bleeding is mostly manageable with a subsequent endoscopic procedure. By 
contrast, cerebral and cardiovascular thromboembolic complications are often 
life-threatening and not uncommonly disabling. One should always consider 
postponing an elective procedure in a patient with temporary antithrombotic 
therapy (after pulmonary embolism or after coronary stent insertion). Basic 
principles of administration of antithrombotic therapy in the context of an 
endoscopic procedure are described in Table 1. Digestive endoscopy procedures 
can be categorized according to postprocedural bleeding risk (Table 2). 
Postprocedural bleeding risk can be specifically reduced in some procedures 
(ERCP with papillary balloon dilation instead of sphincterotomy, mechanical 
securing of polypectomy base, etc.). Acetylsalicylic acid administered as 
secondary prevention (primary preventive indications are very narrow nowadays) 
should not be discontinued perioperatively (discontinuation is associated with 
an approximately threefold increase in thrombotic complications!). The riskiest 
procedures are the only exception in which discontinuation is explicitly 
requested by the digestive endoscopist. Reduction of dual antiplatelet therapy 
is better abandoned in high-risk patients - particularly those with recently 
implanted coronary stents (Table 3) - and postponement of an elective procedure 
should always be considered. Bridging of warfarin with low-molecular-weight 
heparin (LMWH) is not indicated routinely (in some cases, this practice 
increases the bleeding risk). Bridging with LMWH is appropriate in patients with 
high (or moderate) thromboembolic risk (Table 5). Furthermore, LMWH therapy 
carries specific risks, particularly in patients with renal function impairment 
(Table 4). In patients with a high thromboembolic risk, a statement of the 
physician indicating anticoagulation is always appropriate before an elective 
procedure (Table 6). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) should not be 
administered on the day of the procedure, not even in one with a low risk (e.g., 
biopsy); a longer withdrawal is recommended in high-risk procedures (this 
cessation should not be bridged with LMWH given the rapid onset and elimination 
half-time) (Table 7). Recommencement of antithrombotic therapy after a high-risk 
endoscopic procedure should always be determined by the endoscopist and the 
recommended intervals should be considered minimal: 1-2 days after the procedure 
in the case of P2Y12 inhibitors; 2-3 days after the procedure in the case of 
DOACs; in the evening of the day of the procedure for warfarin with a 
maintenance (not saturation) dose; and 48 hours after the procedure in the case 
of LMWH at a therapeutic dose. Earlier administration of a 
lower-than-therapeutic dose of LMWH (twice a day per weight) can be considered 
in this context: prophylactic (once a day) or higher prophylactic (once a day 
per weight) doses. In general, a full anticoagulation effect should not be 
achieved earlier than approximately 48 hours after the procedure. The patient 
should be properly informed of the course of antithrombotic therapy before and 
after the endoscopic procedure, including a written form (a calendar can be 
downloaded online for this purpose)."
298,"In the Czech Republic, due to the population aging, the prevalence of cognitive 
dysfunction is increasing. Researchers estimate that by 2050 the number of 
patients with dementia in the Czech Republic will more than double. Since 
dementia cannot be cured, it is important to prevent the cognitive dysfunction 
development by influencing modifiable risk factors. Arterial hypertension (AH) 
is one of the main risk factors for the development of cognitive dysfunction and 
dementia. Elevated blood pressure values in youth are associated with a higher 
risk of cognitive decline in middle age and with the development of dementia in 
old age. Blood pressure control in low-risk patients with stage I hypertension 
reduces the risk of dementia development, including Alzheimers disease. 
Therefore, improving the AH control in the population since younghood will be 
needed to influence the emerging cognitive dysfunction pandemic."

300,"Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories are necessary to study microorganisms 
that are highly pathogenic to humans and have no prevention or therapeutic 
measures. Currently, most BSL-4 facilities have suit-type laboratories to 
conduct experiments on highly pathogenic microorganisms. In 2021, the first 
Japanese suit-type BSL-4 laboratory was constructed at Nagasaki University. 
Positive pressure protection suit (PPPS) is a primary barrier that protect and 
isolate laboratory workers from pathogens and the laboratory environment. Here, 
we developed a novel PPPS originally designed to be used in the Nagasaki BSL-4 
laboratory. We modified several parts of the domestic chemical protective suit, 
including its front face shield, cuff, and air supply hose, for safe handling of 
microbiological agents. The improved suit, PS-790BSL4-AL, showed resistance to 
several chemicals, including quaternary ammonium disinfectant, and did not show 
any permeation against blood and phages. To validate the suit's integrity, we 
also established an airtight test that enabled the elimination of individual 
differences for quantitative testing. Thus, our developed suit is sufficient as 
a primary barrier and allows for the safe handling of pathogens in our new BSL-4 
laboratory."
301,"Primary effusion lymphoma-like lymphoma (PEL-LL) is a rare lymphoma, localized 
in the body cavity without detectable tumor masses. Tuberculous pleural effusion 
is a form of extra pulmonary tuberculous. We herein report three cases of PEL-LL 
in patients with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. Despite the presentation 
with lymphocyte predominance and high levels of adenosine deaminase, a notable 
characteristic of tuberculous pleural effusion, the patients were ultimately 
diagnosed with PEL-LL. Pleural fluid laboratory tests yield similar results for 
PEL-LL and tuberculous pleural effusion; therefore, cytological and 
immunophenotyping examinations are useful for their differential diagnosis and 
the determination of treatment."
302,"Speech-induced atrial tachycardia (AT) with presyncope is extremely rare. A 
52-year-old woman employed at a supermarket reported recurrent presyncope while 
speaking out loud at her job. Holter electrocardiography revealed AT while 
swallowing without presyncope. The patient's blood pressure decreased during AT, 
and she experienced presyncope while saying ""IRASSHAIMASE"" loudly during a tilt 
table test. Accordingly, bisoprolol 1.25 mg was prescribed, and the patient did 
not experience episodes of presyncope with recurrence of AT for 2 years. This 
case suggests that provocation of arrhythmia in the tilting position may be 
useful for demonstrating a relationship between arrhythmia and presyncope and/or 
syncope."
303,"Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) usually involves bone marrow (BM) and sometimes 
lymph nodes and spleen. LPL presenting as a hepatic mass lesion is extremely 
rare, with only one case reported in the English literature. A 70-year-old 
Japanese female presented to us with a right hypochondriac mass with tenderness. 
Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 14 cm-sized bulky hepatic mass. Laboratory 
findings showed a normal white blood cell count of 4.1×109/L with 4% 
plasmacytoid lymphocytes; normocytic anemia, Hb 9.4 g/dL; high soluble IL-2 
receptor level, 2,290 U/mL; and elevated IgG, 10,306 mg/dL. Furthermore, IgG-κ 
monoclonal protein was detected. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography/CT revealed abnormal uptake in the liver mass; left supraclavicular, 
parasternal, abdominal, and left inguinal lymph nodes; and bilateral lung bases. 
Magnetic resonance imaging showed no bone lesions. BM aspiration and liver 
biopsy showed predominant infiltration of small lymphocytes admixed with 
plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells. In the liver specimen, 
lymphoepithelial lesions were not observed. The small lymphocytes were positive 
for CD20, CD79a, and bcl-2, and negative for CD5, CD10, cyclin D1, and IRTA1; 
plasma cells in BM were positive for CD19, CD45, IgG, and κ-chain, and negative 
for CD20, and CD56. MYD88 L265P mutation, reported in approximately 40% of 
non-IgM LPL cases, was not detected in the liver specimen and BM cells. The 
frequency is lower than that of typical IgM LPL. These findings led us to a 
diagnosis of LPL with IgG-κ paraproteinemia. The patient underwent four courses 
of R-CHOP and two courses of Bendamustine-R. Partial remission was achieved."
304,"3q27 chromosomal translocation involving the BCL6 gene is one of the most 
frequent forms of cytogenetic abnormality observed in B-cell lymphoma. We report 
a case with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presenting dual 3q27 
translocations. The patient was a 71-year-old man who presented with swelling of 
multiple abdominal lymph nodes (LNs) and obstructive jaundice. LN biopsy 
exhibited dense proliferation of atypical large cells expressing CD20, 
MUM1/IRF4, BCL2, BCL6, and MYC, but not CD10. He was diagnosed with non-GCB/ABC 
type DLBCL and showed an initially good response to R-CHOP chemotherapy, but 
relapsed soon after the completion of therapy. Chromosomal analysis of the 
biopsied LN exhibited multiple abnormalities including t(3;14)(q27;q32) and 
t(3;22)(q27;q11). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using BCL6 
break-apart probes confirmed chromosomal breaks occurring on both BCL6 alleles. 
Molecular analysis revealed two independent rearrangements of BCL6, either with 
the IGH or the IGL gene. 3q27 breakpoints were located 1.2kb apart from each 
other within the first intron of BCL6, while the IGH and IGL breaks occurred at 
the 5' of IGHG2 and within IGLV3-1, respectively. The results suggest that 
biallelic BCL6 rearrangements might be a rare but recurrent genetic event in 
B-cell lymphoma."
305,"Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare malignancy showing morphologic and 
immunophenotypic features of histiocytes. HS has morphologic overlap with many 
other diseases, including various kinds of lymphomas. Gray zone lymphoma (GZL) 
is a rare B-cell lymphoma subtype characterized by overlapping features between 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma. The histologic 
overlap with other diverse diseases of HS and the pathological diversity of GZL 
make it difficult to render a diagnosis. A 44-year-old woman who was initially 
diagnosed with HS was diagnosed with GZL after reexamination, including a 
genetic alteration test. After 6 cycles of brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, 
vinblastine, and dacarbazine, she achieved a complete response. Genomic 
alteration assessment may be useful for the accurate diagnosis of malignant 
lymphomas, which are difficult to diagnose, such as GZL."
306,"In this study, we examined a cohort of Japanese patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) with cup-like nuclei. In particular, we attempted to provide a 
detailed definition of the clinical features of AML with cup-like nuclei. The 
clinical records of patients diagnosed with de novo AML were collected 
retrospectively. We showed that approximately 23% of all patients with AML 
diagnosed during the study period had AML with cup-like nuclei. All three 
cup-like AML cases had FLT3-ITD mutations. In addition, we reported a high 
incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute cerebral 
infarction in patients with AML with cup-like nuclei. Our results show that AML 
with cup-like nuclei may be more common than expected. Due to these unique 
characteristics, recognition of this morphology is recommended."
307,"The cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) regimen, 
containing doxorubicin (DXR), which is a key drug for aggressive non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL), is a standard chemotherapeutic regimen; however, its 
administration in elderly patients is often intolerable. Pirarubicin 
(tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin [THP]) is an anthracycline developed in Japan. We 
have conducted a phase II trial of a full-dose THP-COP (modified CHOP regimen 
with DXR replaced by THP) regimen for elderly patients with newly diagnosed, 
advanced-stage, aggressive NHL. Patients aged 70-79 years old with previously 
untreated NHL according to the Working Formulation (D through H and J), disease 
stage I with a bulky mass or stage II-IV, and performance status of 0-1 were 
eligible. The THP-COP regimen, which consisted of 750-mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 
50-mg/m2 THP, 1.4-mg/m2 vincristine (capped at 2.0 mg) on day 1, and 100-mg 
prednisolone daily on days 1 to 5, was delivered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. The 
primary endpoint was complete response (CR) rate. Twenty-nine patients were 
enrolled in the study. The CR rate was 65.5% (95% confidence interval, 
45.7-82.1%). The 3-year failure-free and overall survival rates were 54.1% and 
53.9%, respectively. The most frequent observed grade 3 or 4 toxicity was 
neutropenia, which occurred in 80% of the patients. Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction 
was observed in one patient. The full-dose THP-COP regimen exhibited similar 
efficacy and safety, and a tendency for less cardiac toxicity, when compared 
with the standard CHOP regimen in elderly Japanese patients with newly 
diagnosed, advanced-stage, aggressive NHL."
308,"PURPOSE: Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) has a high mortality rate, and the 
occurrence of clinical complications is high. Several studies have reported the 
efficacy of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for BTAI. This study 
aimed to clarify the use of TEVAR for BTAI.
METHODS: We analyzed 10 cases of TEVAR for BTAI from July 2011 to December 2020 
at our hospital. Five of 10 cases of BTAI were caused by road traffic accidents, 
while five were caused by falls from a height.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 59.3 years. When arriving at our hospital, 
seven of 10 patients were in shock. Nine of 10 cases of BTAI were at the aortic 
isthmus. With respect to BTAI severity, five of 10 patients were categorized as 
grade IV. Ps of non-survivors were extremely low. All patients underwent TEVAR. 
The mean surgical duration and volume of intraoperative blood loss were 77.5 
minutes and 234 ml, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results of TEVAR for BTAI at our institution support previous 
reports, which show excellent clinical results. To further improve the outcomes, 
we must clarify the adaptation of nonoperative management (delayed repair), the 
optimal timing of invasive treatment, and the importance of long-term follow-up."
309,"Direct contact between cells expressing either ephrin ligands or Eph receptor 
tyrosine kinase produces diverse developmental responses. Transmembrane ephrinB 
ligands play active roles in transducing bi-directional signals downstream of 
EphB/ephrinB interaction. However, it has not been well understood how ephrinB 
relays transcellular signals to neighboring cells and what intracellular 
effectors are involved. Here, we report that kindlin2 can mediate bi-directional 
ephrinB signaling through binding to a highly conserved NIYY motif in the 
ephrinB2 cytoplasmic tail. We show this interaction is important for 
EphB/ephrinB-mediated integrin activation in mammalian cells and for blood 
vessel morphogenesis during zebrafish development. A mixed two-cell population 
study revealed that kindlin2 (in ephrinB2-expressing cells) modulates 
transcellular EphB4 activation by promoting ephrinB2 clustering. This mechanism 
is also operative for EphB2/ephrinB1, suggesting that kindlin2-mediated 
regulation is conserved for EphB/ephrinB signaling pathways. Together, these 
findings show that kindlin2 enables EphB4/ephrinB2 bi-directional signal 
transmission."
310,"Herewith, we provide novel original data about the prevalence of FCN3 
rs532781899 and MASP2 rs72550870 variants among the newborns of aboriginal 
Siberian Arctic populations (Nenets and Dolgan-Nganasans) and Russians of East 
Siberia. This novel data has been analyzed along with the genetic data about 
other proteins of the lectin pathway of the complement system (mannose-binding 
lectin and ficolin-2) obtained earlier.
METHODS: A total of 926 specimens of dried blood spots of the newborns were 
genotyped. The newborns represented four populations: Nenets, Dolgan-Nganasans, 
Mixed aboriginal population, and Russians (Caucasians) to study the prevalence 
of single nucleotide polymorphisms of FCN3 rs532781899 and MASP2 rs72550870.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the deletion allele of the rs532781899 variant in the 
FCN3 gene associated with the decreased production of ficoline-3 was found to be 
increased in Russians compared to the Nenets aboriginal populations (p = 0.002). 
The prevalence of the rs72550870*G allele in the MASP2 gene associated with low 
serum protease activity was found to be increased in Russians compared with 
Nenets and Dolgan-Nganasans (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The results of the current study and our previous findings 
corroborate with a hypothesis that human evolution has been directed toward the 
accumulation of genotypes associated with low activity of the lectin complement 
activation pathway."
311,"Excessive stress can precipitate depression and anxiety diseases, and damage 
gastrointestinal functionality and microbiota changes, favoring the development 
of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) - defined by dysregulation in 
the brain-gut interaction. Therefore, the present study investigated if 
Emotional-Single Prolonged Stress (E-SPS) induces depressive/anxiety-like 
phenotype and gut dysfunction in adult Swiss male mice. For this, mice of the 
E-SPS group were subjected to three stressors sequential exposure: 
immobilization, swimming, and odor of the predator for 7 days (incubation 
period). Next, animals performed behavior tests and 24h later, samples of feces, 
blood, and colon tissue were collected. E-SPS increased the plasma 
corticosterone levels, immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim 
test, decreased the grooming time in the splash test, OAT%, and OAE% in the 
elevated plus-maze test, as well as increased anxiety index. Mice of E-SPS had 
increased % of intestinal transit rate, % of fecal moisture content, and fecal 
pellets number, and decreased Claudin1 content in the colon. E-SPS decreased the 
relative abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroidia class, Bacteroidales 
order, Muribaculaceae and Porphyromonadaceae family, Muribaculum, and 
Duncaniella genus. However, E-SPS increased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria 
phylum, Coriobacteriales order, and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, and 
demonstrated Mucispirillum genus presence. The present study showed that E-SPS 
induced depressive/anxiety-like phenotype, predominant diarrhea gut dysfunction, 
and modulated the gut bacterial microbiota profile in male adult Swiss mice. 
E-SPS might be a promising model for future studies on the brain-gut interaction 
and the development of FGIDs with psychological comorbidities."
312,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety profile of bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea (BCNU) 
wafer implantation after malignant glioma resection with or without ventricular 
opening (VO).
METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 66 consecutive patients 
with BCNU wafer implantation after malignant glioma resection between March 2013 
and August 2021. The patients were categorized into two groups based on whether 
VO occurred during the malignant glioma resection. Fifty-eight patients had 
glioblastoma, and eight had anaplastic astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. 
Forty-eight patients underwent an initial treatment, and 18 underwent recurrent 
surgeries. Infection, hydrocephalus, subcutaneous fluid collection, chronic 
subdural hematoma, early seizure after surgery within one month, symptomatic 
edema surrounding the resected cavity, cyst formation, and postoperative 
hemorrhage were defined as adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent resection with VO, and 33 without. The 
median survival time was 28 months in the initial treatment group and 11.5 
months in the recurrent treatment group. The with and without VO groups had 
similar median survival times. Postoperative AEs occurred in 7/33 patients 
(21.2%) with VO and 10/33 (30.3%) without VO, with no difference between them (p 
= 0.574).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that VO during surgery with BCNU wafer 
implantation might not influence the occurrence of postoperative AEs. If VO 
happens, BCNU wafer implantation can be performed safely with accurate closing 
of the ventricle."
313,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of microwave 
ablation (MWA) for soft tissue venous malformations (VMs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients with symptomatic 
VMs of the lower extremities and trunk. MWA was performed in all patients. 
Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) was performed immediately and one month 
after ablation. The data on complete ablation rate, improvement of symptoms, and 
patient satisfaction were collected. Follow-up began one- month after ablation 
for two to 19 months.
RESULTS: MWA was performed on 20 patients. The overall complete ablation rate 
was 75% (n=15/20). The complete ablation rates in patients with lesions <5 cm 
and >5 cm were 100% (11/11) and 44% (4/9), respectively. The complete ablation 
rates in patients with localized and extensive lesions were 93% (13/14) and 33% 
(2/6), respectively. Five patients had incomplete ablation; one had a >5 cm 
lesion with ectopic drainage vessels; one had multiple lesions adherent to blood 
vessels and nerves; three had large and extensive lesions. Thirteen patients 
showed significant improvements in clinical symptoms; six showed slight 
improvement; one showed no change in symptoms. No complications or recurrences 
were observed. All patients were satisfied with the therapeutic effect (n = 20; 
100%); 12 patients were significantly satisfied, and eight were slightly 
satisfied.
CONCLUSION: MWA with ultrasound guidance is a safe, effective, and minimally 
invasive therapy for symptomatic soft-tissue VMs and may be a promising approach 
in the future."
314,"Platelets are increasingly recognized as key regulators of inflammatory and 
immune responses, through their interaction with endothelium and immune cells. 
Therefore they might have a role in transfusion-related acute lung injury 
(TRALI), in which endothelial cells and neutrophils are the key players. In this 
study, by a classic TRALI animal model, combining a custom-designed system for 
intravital confocal microscopy of pulmonary microvasculature and a platelet 
tracking technique, we found that thrombin-activated platelets transfusion 
aggravated TRALI while resting platelets transfusion alleviated TRALI. Promoting 
endogenous platelets activation also aggravated TRALI while inhibiting 
endogenous platelets activation alleviated TRALI. Activated platelets interfered 
with the stability of endothelial barrier function while resting platelets 
modulated the activation of neutrophils. Anti-thrombin could alleviate TRALI, 
which was not reproduced upon anti-GPIIbIIIa or anti-P-selectin In conclusion, 
platelets might play a dual role (protective and pathogenic) in TRALI, the 
balance between the two roles is highly dependent on whether platelets are 
activated by thrombin or not. This might explain the conflicting results of 
previous researches studying the contribution of platelets in TRALI by platelet 
depletion technology, in which the induction of TRALI and the condition of 
animals were different, hence the state of platelets during TRALI was different. 
Moreover, anti-platelet-activation (such as anti-thrombin) might be a better 
approach than anti-activated-platelets (such as anti-P-selectin) to search for 
potential therapies in TRALI. Considering the involvement of thrombin-activated 
platelets in TRALI, anti-thrombin might be needed when blood component 
transfusion is performed."
315,"PURPOSE: To determine the in vivo effectiveness of bone marrow aspirate-derived 
(BMA) fibrin clots for avascular meniscal defect healing in a rabbit model.
METHODS: In 42 Japanese white rabbits, a 2.0-mm cylindrical defect was 
introduced into the avascular zone of the anterior part of the medial meniscus 
in the bilateral knees. The rabbits were grouped according to implantation of a 
BMA fibrin clot (BMA group) or a peripheral blood (PB)-derived clot (PB group) 
into the defect and non-implantation (control group). Macroscopic and 
histological assessments were performed using a scoring system at 4 and 12 weeks 
postoperatively. At 12 weeks postoperatively, compressive stress was analyzed 
biomechanically.
RESULTS: The meniscal score in the BMA group (12.1) was greater than that in the 
PB group (5.5) (P = .031) and control group (4.4) (P = .013) at 4 weeks. The 
meniscal score in the BMA group (13.1) was greater than that in the control 
group (6.4) (BMA = 13.1, P = .0046) at 12 weeks. In the biomechanical analysis, 
the BMA group demonstrated significantly higher compressive strength than the PB 
group (6.6 MPa) (BMA = 15.4 MPa, P = .0201) and control group (3.6 MPa) (BMA = 
15.4 MPa, P = .007) CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of BMA fibrin clots into the 
meniscal defect of the avascular zone in a rabbit model improved the meniscal 
score at 4 weeks and strengthened the reparative meniscal tissue at 12 weeks 
compared with the implantation of PB fibrin clots."
316,"Adequate mass and function of adipose tissues (ATs) play essential roles in 
preventing metabolic perturbations. The pathological reduction of ATs in 
lipodystrophy leads to an array of metabolic diseases. Understanding the 
underlying mechanisms may benefit the development of effective therapies. 
Several cellular processes, including autophagy and vesicle trafficking, 
function collectively to maintain AT homeostasis. Here, we investigated the 
impact of adipocyte-specific deletion of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) on AT homeostasis and systemic 
metabolism in mice. We report that PIK3C3 functions in all ATs and that its 
absence disturbs adipocyte autophagy and hinders adipocyte differentiation, 
survival, and function with differential effects on brown and white ATs. These 
abnormalities cause loss of white ATs, whitening followed by loss of brown ATs, 
and impaired ""browning"" of white ATs. Consequently, mice exhibit compromised 
thermogenic capacity and develop dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin 
resistance, and type 2 diabetes. While these effects of PIK3C3 largely contrast 
previous findings with the autophagy-related (ATG) protein ATG7 in adipocytes, 
mice with a combined deficiency in both factors reveal a dominant role of the 
PIK3C3-deficient phenotype. We have also found that dietary lipid excess 
exacerbates AT pathologies caused by PIK3C3 deficiency. Surprisingly, glucose 
tolerance is spared in adipocyte-specific PIK3C3-deficient mice, a phenotype 
that is more evident during dietary lipid excess. These findings reveal a 
crucial yet complex role for PIK3C3 in ATs, with potential therapeutic 
implications."
317,"Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV), made from glutaraldehyde-fixed xenografts, are 
widely used for surgical and transcatheter valve interventions but suffer from 
limited durability due to structural valve degeneration (SVD). We focused on 
metabolic syndrome (MetS), a risk factor for SVD and a highly prevalent 
phenotype in patients affected by valvular heart disease with a well-recognized 
cluster of comorbidities. Multicenter patient data (N = 251) revealed that 
patients with MetS were at significantly higher risk of accelerated SVD and 
required BHV replacement sooner. Using a next-generation proteomics approach, we 
identified significantly differential proteomes from leaflets of explanted BHV 
from MetS and non-MetS patients (N = 24). Given the significance of protein 
infiltration in MetS-induced SVD, we then demonstrated the protective effects of 
polyoxazoline modification of BHV leaflets to mitigate MetS-induced BHV 
biomaterial degeneration (calcification, tissue cross-linking, and 
microstructural changes) in an ex vivo serum model and an in vivo with MetS rat 
subcutaneous implants."
318,"A growing body of work has addressed human adaptations to diverse environments 
using genomic data, but few studies have connected putatively selected alleles 
to phenotypes, much less among underrepresented populations such as Amerindians. 
Studies of natural selection and genotype-phenotype relationships in 
underrepresented populations hold potential to uncover previously undescribed 
loci underlying evolutionarily and biomedically relevant traits. Here, we worked 
with the Tsimane and the Moseten, two Amerindian populations inhabiting the 
Bolivian lowlands. We focused most intensively on the Tsimane, because long-term 
anthropological work with this group has shown that they have a high burden of 
both macro and microparasites, as well as minimal cardiometabolic disease or 
dementia. We therefore generated genome-wide genotype data for Tsimane 
individuals to study natural selection, and paired this with blood mRNA-seq as 
well as cardiometabolic and immune biomarker data generated from a larger sample 
that included both populations. In the Tsimane, we identified 21 regions that 
are candidates for selective sweeps, as well as 5 immune traits that show 
evidence for polygenic selection (e.g., C-reactive protein levels and the 
response to coronaviruses). Genes overlapping candidate regions were strongly 
enriched for known involvement in immune-related traits, such as abundance of 
lymphocytes and eosinophils. Importantly, we were also able to draw on extensive 
phenotype information for the Tsimane and Moseten and link five regions 
(containing PSD4, MUC21 and MUC22, TOX2, ANXA6, and ABCA1) with biomarkers of 
immune and metabolic function. Together, our work highlights the utility of 
pairing evolutionary analyses with anthropological and biomedical data to gain 
insight into the genetic basis of health-related traits."
319,"T cells differentiate into highly diverse subsets and display plasticity 
depending on the environment. Although lymphocytes are key mediators of 
inflammation, functional specialization of T cells in inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) has not been effectively described. Here, we performed deep profiling of T 
cells in the intestinal mucosa of IBD and identified a CD4+ tissue-resident 
memory T cell (Trm) subset that is increased in Crohn's disease (CD) showing 
unique inflammatory properties. Functionally and transcriptionally distinct CD4+ 
Trm subsets are observed in the inflamed gut mucosa, among which a CD-specific 
CD4+ Trm subset, expressing CD161 and CCR5 along with CD103, displays previously 
unrecognized pleiotropic signatures of innate and effector activities. These 
inflammatory features are further enhanced by their spatial proximity to gut 
epithelial cells. Furthermore, the CD-specific CD4+ Trm subset is the most 
predominant producer of type 1 inflammatory cytokines upon various stimulations 
among all CD4+ T cells, suggesting that the accumulation of this T cell subset 
is a pathological hallmark of CD. Our results provide comprehensive insights 
into the pathogenesis of IBD, paving the way for decoding of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying this disease."
320,"After natalizumab (NAT) cessation, some multiple sclerosis (MS) patients 
experience a severe disease rebound. The rebound pathophysiology is still 
unclear; however, it has been linked to interleukin-17-producing T-helper (Th17) 
cells. We demonstrate that during NAT treatment, MCAM+CCR6+Th17 cells gradually 
acquire a pathogenic profile, including proinflammatory cytokine production, 
pathogenic transcriptional signatures, brain endothelial barrier impairment, and 
oligodendrocyte damage via induction of apoptotic pathways. This is accompanied 
by an increase in Th17 cell frequencies in the cerebrospinal fluid of 
NAT-treated patients. Notably, Th17 cells derived from NAT-treated patients, who 
later developed a disease rebound upon treatment cessation, displayed a distinct 
transcriptional pathogenicity profile associated with altered migratory 
properties. Accordingly, increased brain infiltration of patient Th17 cells was 
illustrated in a humanized mouse model and brain histology from a rebound 
patient. Therefore, peripheral blood-accumulated MCAM+CCR6+Th17 cells might be 
involved in rebound pathophysiology, and monitoring of changes in Th17 cell 
pathogenicity in patients before/during NAT treatment cessation might enable 
rebound risk assessment in the future."
321,"Mutations in GBA1, encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase), cause Gaucher disease 
(GD) and are also genetic risks in developing Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Currently, the approved therapies are only effective for directly treating 
visceral symptoms, but not for primary neuronopathic involvement in GD (nGD). 
Progranulin (PGRN), encoded by GRN, is a novel modifier of GCase, but the impact 
of PGRN in GBA1 mutation-associated pathologies in vivo remains unknown. Herein, 
Grn-/- mice crossed into Gba9v/9v mice, a Gba1 mutant line homozygous for the 
Gba1 D409V mutation, generating Grn-/-Gba9v/9v (PG9V) mice. PG9V mice exhibited 
neurobehavioral deficits, early onset, and more severe GD phenotypes compared to 
Grn-/- and Gba9v/9v mice. Moreover, PG9V mice also displayed PD-like phenotype. 
Mechanistic analysis revealed that PGRN deficiency caused severe 
neuroinflammation with microgliosis and astrogliosis, along with impaired 
autophagy associated with the Gba1 mutation. A PGRN-derived peptide, termed ND7, 
ameliorated the disease phenotype in GD patient fibroblasts ex vivo. 
Unexpectedly, ND7 penetrated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and effectively 
ameliorated the nGD manifestations and PD pathology in Gba9v/null and PG9V mice. 
Collectively, this study not only provides the first line of in vivo but also 
ex vivo evidence demonstrating the crucial role of PGRN in GBA1/Gba1 
mutation-related pathologies, as well as a clinically relevant mouse model for 
mechanistic and potential therapeutics studies for nGD and PD. Importantly, a 
BBB penetrant PGRN-derived biologic was developed that may provide treatment for 
rare lysosomal storage diseases and common neurodegenerative disorders, 
particularly nGD and PD."
322,"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, which are dimers of 
a glycosylated polymorphic transmembrane heavy chain and the small-protein 
β2-microglobulin (β2m), bind peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum that are 
generated by the cytosolic turnover of cellular proteins. In virus-infected 
cells, these peptides may include those derived from viral proteins. 
Peptide-MHC-I complexes then traffic through the secretory pathway and are 
displayed at the cell surface where those containing viral peptides can be 
detected by CD8+ T lymphocytes that kill infected cells. Many viruses enhance 
their in vivo survival by encoding genes that down-regulate MHC-I expression to 
avoid CD8+ T cell recognition. Here, we report that two accessory proteins 
encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 
down-regulate MHC-I expression using distinct mechanisms. First, ORF3a, a 
viroporin, reduces the global trafficking of proteins, including MHC-I, through 
the secretory pathway. The second, ORF7a, interacts specifically with the MHC-I 
heavy chain, acting as a molecular mimic of β2m to inhibit its association. This 
slows the exit of properly assembled MHC-I molecules from the endoplasmic 
reticulum. We demonstrate that ORF7a reduces antigen presentation by the human 
MHC-I allele HLA-A*02:01. Thus, both ORF3a and ORF7a act post-translationally in 
the secretory pathway to lower surface MHC-I expression, with ORF7a exhibiting a 
specific mechanism that allows immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2."
323,"Adoptively transferred virus-specific T-cells (VSTs) have shown remarkable 
safety and efficacy for the treatment of virus-associated diseases and 
malignancies in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, for whom 
VSTs are derived from the HSCT donor (DD-VSTs). Autologous VSTs have also shown 
promise for the treatment of virus-driven malignancies outside the HSCT setting. 
In both cases VSTs are manufactured as patient-specific products and the time 
required for procurement, manufacture, and release testing precludes their use 
in acutely ill patients. Further, good manufacturing practices (GMP)-compliant 
products are expensive, and failures are common in virus naive HSCT donors and 
in patient-derived VSTs rendered anergic by immunosuppressive tumors. Hence, 
highly characterized, banked VSTs (B-VSTs) that can be used for multiple 
unrelated recipients are highly desirable. The major challenges facing B-VSTs 
result from the inevitable mismatches in the highly polymorphic and immunogenic 
human leukocyte antigens (HLA) that presents internally processed antigens to 
the T-cell receptor leading to the requirement for partial HLA matching between 
B-VST and recipient. HLA mismatches lead to rapid rejection of allogenic T-cell 
products, and graft versus host disease induced by alloreactive T-cells in the 
infusion product. Here we summarize clinical outcomes to date of trials of 
B-VSTs used for the treatment of viral infections and malignancies, and their 
potential as a platform for chimeric antigen receptors targeting non-viral 
tumors. We will highlight the properties of VSTs that make them attractive 
off-the-shelf cell therapies, as well as the challenges that must be overcome 
before they can become mainstream."
324,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have emerged in the past years as 
significant pharmacological targets in the development of new therapeutics due 
to their key roles in determining pathological pathways. Herein, we present 
fragments on energy surfaces, a simple and general design strategy that 
integrates the analysis of the dynamic and energetic signatures of proteins to 
unveil the substructures involved in PPIs, with docking, selection, and 
combination of drug-like fragments to generate new PPI inhibitor candidates. 
Specifically, structural representatives of the target protein are used as 
inputs for the blind physics-based prediction of potential protein interaction 
surfaces using the matrix of low coupling energy decomposition method. The 
predicted interaction surfaces are subdivided into overlapping windows that are 
used as templates to direct the docking and combination of fragments 
representative of moieties typically found in active drugs. This protocol is 
then applied and validated using structurally diverse, important PPI targets as 
test systems. We demonstrate that our approach facilitates the exploration of 
the molecular diversity space of potential ligands, with no requirement of prior 
information on the location and properties of interaction surfaces or on the 
structures of potential lead compounds. Importantly, the hit molecules that 
emerge from our ab initio design share high chemical similarity with 
experimentally tested active PPI inhibitors. We propose that the protocol we 
describe here represents a valuable means of generating initial leads against 
difficult targets for further development and refinement."
325,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, phosphorylated-tau181 
(p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light 
(NfL) are putative blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
head-to-head cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons of the aforementioned 
biomarkers across the AD continuum are lacking.
METHODS: Plasma Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were measured utilizing 
the Single Molecule Array (Simoa) platform and compared cross-sectionally across 
the AD continuum, wherein Aβ-PET (positron emission tomography)-negative 
cognitively unimpaired (CU Aβ-, n = 81) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI Aβ-, 
n = 26) participants were compared with Aβ-PET-positive participants across the 
AD continuum (CU Aβ+, n = 39; MCI Aβ+, n = 33; AD Aβ+, n = 46) from the 
Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) 
cohort. Longitudinal plasma biomarker changes were also assessed in MCI (n = 27) 
and AD (n = 29) participants compared with CU (n = 120) participants. In 
addition, associations between baseline plasma biomarker levels and prospective 
cognitive decline and Aβ-PET load were assessed over a 7 to 10-year duration.
RESULTS: Lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and elevated p-tau181 and GFAP were 
observed in CU Aβ+, MCI Aβ+, and AD Aβ+, whereas elevated plasma NfL was 
observed in MCI Aβ+ and AD Aβ+, compared with CU Aβ- and MCI Aβ-. Among the 
aforementioned plasma biomarkers, for models with and without AD risk factors 
(age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status), p-tau181 performed 
equivalent to or better than other biomarkers in predicting a brain Aβ-/+ status 
across the AD continuum. However, for models with and without the AD risk 
factors, a biomarker panel of Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP performed 
equivalent to or better than any of the biomarkers alone in predicting brain 
Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum. Longitudinally, plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, 
p-tau181, and GFAP were altered in MCI compared with CU, and plasma GFAP and NfL 
were altered in AD compared with CU. In addition, lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and 
higher p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were associated with prospective cognitive 
decline and lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, and higher p-tau181 and GFAP were 
associated with increased Aβ-PET load prospectively.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that plasma biomarkers are altered 
cross-sectionally and longitudinally, along the AD continuum, and are 
prospectively associated with cognitive decline and brain Aβ-PET load. In 
addition, although p-tau181 performed equivalent to or better than other 
biomarkers in predicting an Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum, a panel of 
biomarkers may have superior Aβ-/+ status predictive capability across the AD 
continuum.
HIGHLIGHTS:  Area under the curve (AUC) of p-tau181 ≥ AUC of Aβ42/40, GFAP, NfL 
in predicting PET Aβ-/+ status (Aβ-/+).  AUC of Aβ42/40+p-tau181+GFAP panel ≥ 
AUC of Aβ42/40/p-tau181/GFAP/NfL for Aβ-/+.  Longitudinally, Aβ42/40, p-tau181, 
and GFAP were altered in MCI versus CU.  Longitudinally, GFAP and NfL were 
altered in AD versus CU.  Aβ42/40, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL are associated with 
prospective cognitive decline.  Aβ42/40, p-tau181, and GFAP are associated with 
increased PET Aβ load prospectively."
326,"Acute canine monocytic ehrlichiosis due to Ehrlichia canis (aCME), and primary 
immune thrombocytopenia (pITP) are major differentials for dogs presented with 
thrombocytopenia, and the two diseases may clinically overlap. The aim of this 
study was to compare dogs diagnosed with naturally occurring aCME and pITP, to 
establish potentially useful clinical and clinicopathologic discriminators. A 
clinical record-based retrospective study was performed in 35 dogs diagnosed 
with aCME and 29 dogs with pITP. Dogs with aCME were significantly younger, and 
were more likely to experience depression or lethargy, anorexia, body weight 
loss, fever, lymphadenomegaly, tick infestation and ocular discharge on 
admission, compared to dogs with pITP. In contrast, dogs with pITP presented 
more frequently with overt bleeding and had a significantly higher bleeding 
score compared to dogs with aCME. Dogs with aCME were more likely to be anemic 
and hypoalbuminemic on presentation compared to dogs with pITP. Dogs with pITP 
had higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts as well as lower platelet 
counts than dogs with aCME and were more likely to present with leukocytosis, 
neutrophilia and monocytosis. These clinical, hematological, and biochemical 
findings may be helpful discriminators between aCME and pITP, on the 
understanding that they will be interpreted in the context of disease-specific 
testing."
327,"OBJECTIVES: Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) is a subset of 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), divided into two subtypes according to the 
presence of rheumatoid factor : pJIA without rheumatoid factor (pJIA RF-) and 
pJIA with positive rheumatoid factor (pJIA RF+), this latter is characterised 
with more structural damage. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) are 
often associated with RF. The respective performance of ACPA versus RF in 
structural outcome in pJIA, and in particular in adulthood pJIA remains unknown. 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether ACPA could be of value 
to assess structural damage in pJIA persisting in adulthood.
METHODS: Patients with pJIA and available data for ACPA, RF and X-ray were 
included retrospectively. Structural damage was assessed by two independent 
blinded investigators using Sharp Van Der Heijde scores.
RESULTS: 56 pJIA adult patients were included : 62% (35/56) had pJIA RF+ and 38% 
(21/56) pJIA RF-. ACPA positivity in pJIA was significantly associated with 
presence of RF (96% vs 26%, p<0.001 ). RF positivity was significantly 
associated with higher Sharp van Der Heijde erosion and total scores 
(respectively p< 0.01 and p< 0.05 ). There were higher Sharp Van Der Heijde 
erosion, joint space narrowing and total scores in the pJIA ACPA+ subgroup than 
in the pJIA ACPA- subgroup, although there was no statistical significance. 
However, when adjusted on disease duration, pJIA ACPA+ patients had 
significantly higher erosion and total scores than pJIA ACPA- patients (p<0.05), 
and pJIA ACPA+ patients required more bDMARDs than pJIA ACPA- patients (p<0.05). 
Moreover, pJIA patients with high Sharp van Der Heijde joint space narrowing and 
total scores had significantly higher ACPA levels (p<0.01). A correlation was 
identified between ACPA levels and Sharp van Der Heijde total score ( r=0.54, 
p<0.05). In the pJIA RF+ subgroup the presence of ACPA was associated with 
additional structural damage compared to no ACPA: sharp Van Der Heijde erosion, 
joint space narrowing and total scores were higher in the pJIA RF+ ACPA+ 
subgroup than in the pJIA RF+ ACPA- subgroup although these results did not 
reach significance.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pJIA RF+ ACPA+ adult patients may have a 
more severe articular phenotype than pJIA RF+ ACPA- patients. ACPA could bring 
an additional value to RF for pJIA patients regarding structural damage. 
Altogether our results show that RF and ACPA are associated with structural 
damage measured by Sharp Van Der Heijde score in pJIA persisting in adulthood."
328,"BACKGROUND: Peri-operative anemia and transfusions are associated with adverse 
operative outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Their 
individual association with long-term outcomes is unclear.
METHODS: CABG patients 65 and older in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult 
Cardiac Surgery Database (STS ACSD) (N=504,596; 2011-2018) were linked to 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) data to assess long-term 
survival. The association of intra-operative anemia defined by nadir 
intra-operative hematocrit (nadir-Hct) and red blood cell transfusions 
(RBC-transfusion), and their interactions on long-term mortality were assessed 
with Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable Cox regression. Restricted cubic 
splines were used to explore the association between nadir-Hct as a continuous 
variable and long-term mortality.
RESULTS: 258,398 on-pump CABG STS ACSD patients surviving the peri-operative 
period were linked to CMS. 41% had pre-operative anemia per World Health 
Organization criteria. Mean intra-operative nadir-Hct was 24%. RBC-transfusion 
rate was 43.7%. Univariable analysis associated both RBC-transfusion and lower 
nadir-Hct with worse survival. Lower nadir-Hct was only marginally associated 
with risk-adjusted mortality: adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 
(95%CI)=1.04(1.01-1.06) and 1.07(1.00-1.14) at nadir-Hct=20% and at 
nadir-HCT=14%, respectively. RBC-transfusion were associated with significantly 
higher adjusted mortality irrespective of timing of transfusion [AHR(95%CI): 
AHR(IntraOp)=1.21(1.18-1.27); AHR(PostOp)=1.26(1.22-1.30); 
AHR(Both)=1.46(1.40-1.52) and across all levels of nadir-Hct. RBC-transfusion 
was not associated with improved survival at any level of nadir-Hct.
CONCLUSIONS: In Medicare CABG patients, RBC-transfusions were associated with 
increased risk-adjusted late mortality across all levels of nadir-Hct while 
intra-operative anemia was only marginally so. Tolerance of lower 
intra-operative nadir-Hct than currently accepted may be preferable to 
transfusions."
329,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common form of pediatric cancer 
affecting the lymphoblast, a type of white blood cell found in the bone marrow. 
In this disease, the normal lymphoblast cells transform into leukemic cells and 
subsequently enter the bloodstream. Leukemic cells found in patients with ALL 
have shown differences in cholesterol uptake and utilization. Current treatment 
consists of chemotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, and 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In addition, minimal residual 
disease (MRD) has become an effective tool in measuring treatment efficacy and 
the potential for relapse. Chemotherapy resistance remains a significant barrier 
in the treatment of ALL. Biomarkers such as an upregulated Akt signaling pathway 
and an overexpressed VLA-4 integrin-protein have been associated with drug 
resistance. Nanoparticles have been used to favorably alter the pharmacokinetic 
profile of conventional drug agents. These drug-delivery systems are designed to 
selectively deliver their drug payloads to desired targets. Therefore, 
nanoparticles offer advantages such as improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. 
This review highlights conventional treatment options, distinctive 
characteristics of pediatric ALL, therapeutic challenges encountered during 
therapy, and the key role that nanotherapeutics play in the treatment of ALL."
330,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are environmentally persistent 
endocrine-disrupting chemicals associated with long-term health outcomes. PFAS 
are transferred from maternal blood to human milk, an important exposure source 
for infants, and understanding of this transfer is evolving. We characterized 
concentrations of 10 PFAS in human milk (n = 426) and compared milk-to-plasma 
concentrations of 9 PFAS among a subset of women with paired samples (n = 294) 
from the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study using liquid chromatography-isotope 
dilution tandem mass spectrometry. We examined the relationship between 
perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in plasma versus 
milk and fit linear regression models to assess relationships between milk PFOA 
and PFOS and participant characteristics. The median plasma PFOA concentration 
was 0.94 ng/mL (interquartile range, IQR, 0.59-1.34) and that of PFOS was 2.60 
ng/mL (IQR 1.80-3.90); the median milk PFOA concentration was 0.017 ng/mL (IQR 
0.012-0.027) and that of PFOS was 0.024 ng/mL (IQR 0.016-0.036). PFOA and PFOS 
plasma and milk concentrations showed correlations of ρ = 0.83 and 0.77, 
respectively (p < 0.001). Parity, previous lactation, week of milk collection, 
and body mass index were inversely associated with milk PFAS. We estimate that 
even among our general population cohort, some infants (∼6.5%) are exposed to 
amounts of PFAS via milk that may have long-term health impacts."
331,"Craniopharyngiomas are clinically aggressive tumours due to their invasive 
behaviour and recalcitrant tendency to recur after therapy. There are two types 
based on their distinct histology and molecular features: The papillary 
craniopharyngioma (PCP), which is associated with BRAF-V600E mutations and the 
adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP), characterised by mutations in CTNNB1 
(encoding β-catenin). Patients with craniopharyngioma show symptoms linked to 
the location of the tumour close to the optic pathways, hypothalamus and 
pituitary gland, such as increased intracranial pressure, endocrine deficiencies 
and visual defects. Treatment is not specific and mostly non-curative, and 
frequently includes surgery, which may achieve gross-total or partial resection, 
followed by radiotherapy. In cystic tumours, frequent drainage is often required 
and intracystic instillation of drugs has been used to help manage cyst 
refilling. More recently targeted therapies have been used, particularly in 
papillary craniopharyngioma, but also now in adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma 
and clinical trials are underway or in development. Although patient survival is 
high, the consequences of the tumour and its treatment can lead to severe 
comorbidities resulting in poor quality of life, in particular for those 
patients that bear tumours with hypothalamic involvement. Accordingly, in these 
patients at risk for the development of a hypothalamic syndrome 
hypothalamus-sparing treatment strategies such as limited resection followed by 
irradiation are recommended. In this review, we provide an update on various 
aspects of craniopharyngioma, with emphasis on recent advances in the 
understanding of tumour pathogenesis, clinical consequences, management and 
therapies."
332,"INTRODUCTION: The ""problem joint"" (PJ) concept was developed to address 
patient-centric needs for a more holistic assessment of joint morbidity for 
people with haemophilia (PwH).
AIM: To quantify the humanistic burden of PJs in PwH to further support 
validation of the PJ outcome measure.
METHODS: Multivariable regression models evaluated the relationship between PJs 
and health-related quality of life (HRQoL, EQ-5D-5L) and overall work 
productivity loss (WPL) using data from the 'Cost of HaEmophilia: a 
Socioeconomic Survey' population studies (adults: CHESS II, CHESS US+; 
children/adolescents: CHESS-Paeds). Covariates included were haemophilia 
severity, age, comorbidities and education.
RESULTS: The CHESS II sample included 292 and 134 PwH for HRQoL and WPL 
analyses, mean age 38.6 years (39% ≥1 PJ, 61% none). CHESS US+ included 345 and 
239 PwH for HRQoL and WPL, mean age 35 years (43% ≥1 PJ, 57% none). CHESS-Paeds 
included 198 PwH aged 4-17 (HRQoL only), mean age 11.5 years (19% ≥1 PJ, 81% 
none). In CHESS II and CHESS US+, presence of PJs was associated with worse 
HRQoL (Both p < .001). Few CHESS-Paeds participants had PJs, with no significant 
correlation with HRQoL. In CHESS II, upper body PJs were significantly 
correlated to WPL (p < .05). In CHESS US+, having ≥1 PJ or upper and lower body 
PJs were significantly correlated to WPL (vs. none; both p < .05).
CONCLUSION: This study has shown a meaningful burden of PJs on PwH, which should 
be considered in clinical and health policy assessments of joint health."
333,"Advances in genomic diagnostics hold promise for improved care of rare 
hematologic diseases. Here we describe a novel targeted therapeutic approach for 
Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia, an autosomal recessive disease characterized 
by severe normocytic anemia and bone abnormalities due to loss-of-function 
mutations in Thromboxane A Synthase 1 (TBXAS1). TBXAS1 metabolizes prostaglandin 
(PG)H2, the cyclooxygenase (COX) product of arachidonic acid, into thromboxane 
A2. Loss-of-function in TBXAS results in an increase in PGH2 availability for 
other PG synthases. Current treatment for Ghosal syndrome consists of 
corticosteroids. We hypothesized that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), which inhibit COX-1 and COX-2, could ameliorate the effects of TBXAS1 
loss and improve hematologic function by reducing prostaglandin formation. We 
treated two patients with Ghosal syndrome, one adult and one pediatric, with 
standard doses of NSAIDs (aspirin or ibuprofen). Both patients had rapid 
improvement of hematologic parameters and inflammatory markers without adverse 
events. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that urinary PG metabolites were 
increased along with proinflammatory lipoxygenase (LOX) products 
5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene E4. Our data show that NSAIDs at 
standard doses surprisingly reduced both COX and LOX products, leading to the 
resolution of cytopenias, and should be considered for first-line treatment for 
Ghosal syndrome."
334,"CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells have demonstrated efficacy in graft-versus-host 
disease (GvHD) prevention and treatment. Preclinical and clinical studies 
indicate that Treg are able to protect from GvHD without interfering with the 
graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), 
although the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. To elucidate 
Treg suppressive function during in vivo suppression of acute GvHD, we performed 
paired T cell receptor (TCRa, TCRb genes) repertoire sequencing and RNA 
sequencing analysis on conventional T cells (Tcon) and Treg before and after 
transplantation in an MHC major-mismatch mouse model of HCT. We show that both 
Treg and Tcon underwent clonal restriction and that Treg did not interfere with 
the activation of alloreactive Tcon clones and the breadth of their TCR 
repertoire, however, markedly suppressed their expansion. Transcriptomic 
analysis revealed that Treg predominantly affected the transcriptome of CD4 Tcon 
and to a lesser extent of CD8 Tcon, modulating the transcription of genes 
encoding pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules as well as enzymes involved in 
metabolic processes, inducing a switch from glycolysis to oxidative 
phosphorylation. Finally, Treg did not interfere with the induction of gene sets 
involved in the GvT effect. Our results shed light into the mechanisms of acute 
GvHD suppression by Treg and will support the clinical translation of this 
immunoregulatory approach."
335,"OBJECTIVE: To report outcomes of thoracoscopic (TL) and thoracoscopic-assisted 
lung lobectomy (TAL) for treatment of non-neoplastic pulmonary consolidation 
(PC) in dogs.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
ANIMALS: Twelve client-owned dogs.
METHODS: The medical records of 12 dogs that underwent TL or TAL for PC at 3 
veterinary institutions between 2011 and 2020 were reviewed. Signalment, 
history, physical examination, diagnostics, days in hospital, anesthetic and 
procedure times, intraoperative/postoperative complications, conversion rates, 
duration of indwelling thoracic drain, and long-term outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: Nine patients underwent a TL approach and 3 underwent TAL. In those 
that underwent TL, conversion to an intercostal thoracotomy was performed in 4 
out of 9 dogs. Conversion was performed due to adhesions (n = 3) or poor 
visualization (1). Histopathologic examination was consistent with pneumonia due 
to an infectious process (n = 10), bronchioalveolar malformation with abnormal 
cilia (1), and left-sided cardiac insufficiency vs. pulmonary alveolar 
proteinosis (1). The mean duration of hospital stay was 4 days (range, 
1-6 days). Complications occurred postoperatively in 7 dogs and included 
self-limiting hemorrhage (n = 3), self-resolving pneumothorax (2), incisional 
dehiscence (1), and severe dyspnea in a brachycephalic breed leading to 
euthanasia (1). For the 11 dogs that survived the perioperative period, there 
was no evidence of recurrence with a median follow up of 24 months (range, 
5-120 months).
CONCLUSION: Thoracoscopic (TL) and thoracoscopic-assisted lung lobectomy (TAL) 
is a reasonable surgical approach in select dogs with PC.
CLINICIAL RELEVANCE: Conversion rates were higher than those historically 
reported for dogs undergoing thoracoscopic lung lobectomy for primary lung 
tumors."
336,"Disorders of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are known to influence the 
incidence and mortality of various diseases. It remains largely unknown whether 
and how the UPS affects the onset and progression of acute graft-versus host 
disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(allo-HSCT). The present study demonstrated that the deubiquitinase OTUD1 is an 
essential regulator of aGVHD. Activation of CD4+ T cells after allo-HSCT 
elevated the protein levels of OTUD1, which in turn interacted with the 
Notch2-ICD (NICD) to cleave the ubiquitin of NICD at the K1770 site, thereby 
inducing NICD protein accumulations in T cells. OTUD1-driven NICD signaling 
promoted the differentiation and functions of Th1 and Th17 cells and amplified 
the cascade of aGVHD. Moreover, by screening a FDA-approved drugs library the 
study identified dapagliflozin as an inhibitor targeting the OTUD1/NICD axis. 
Dapagliflozin administration significantly prolonged the survival of aGVHD mice. 
The present study characterized a previously unknown role of OTUD1 in T 
cell-mediated allogeneic responses and provided a promising therapeutic strategy 
to target OTUD1 for the alleviation of aGVHD."
337,"PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy of MR imaging for diagnosis of meningitis in 
infants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of infants less than 1 year of age 
who underwent a brain MR imaging for meningitis from 2010-2018. Gold standard 
for diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was a positive bacterial CSF culture or a 
positive blood culture with an elevated CSF WBC count, and diagnosis of viral 
meningitis was a positive CSF PCR result and elevated CSF WBC count. 
Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for MR imaging diagnosis of 
meningitis were calculated.
RESULTS: Two hundred nine infants with mean age 80 days (range 0-347 days) were 
included. There were 178 true positives with the most common pathogens being: 
Group B Streptococcus (58), E. coli (50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (21), H. 
influenzae (4); Herpes simplex virus 1 or 2 (18); Enterovirus (4); and other 
(23). There were 31 true negatives. Range of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, 
and accuracy of MR imaging for detection of meningitis was 67.4-83.5%, 
92.3-95.7%, 95.0-98.6%, 33.3-76.5%, and 71.3-86.5% respectively. MR imaging 
sensitivity decreased after 10 days from time of presentation while specificity 
remained stable. Among individual MR imaging findings, leptomeningeal 
enhancement was the most sensitive finding, while cerebritis, infarction, 
ventriculitis, abscess, and intraventricular purulent material were the most 
specific findings.
CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging of the brain demonstrates high specificity and moderate 
sensitivity for diagnosis among infants presenting with signs and symptoms of 
meningitis. The results reflect current standard of care for imaging of infants 
with meningitis however a selection bias for imaging of more severe meningitis 
may affect these results."
338,"Central integration of peripheral appetite-regulating signals ensures 
maintenance of energy homeostasis. Thus, plasticity of circulating molecule 
access to neuronal circuits involved in feeding behavior plays a key role in the 
adaptive response to metabolic changes. However, the mechanisms involved remain 
poorly understood despite their relevance for therapeutic development. Here, we 
investigated the role of median eminence mural cells, including smooth muscle 
cells and pericytes, in modulating gut hormone effects on 
orexigenic/anorexigenic circuits. We found that conditional activation of median 
eminence vascular cells impinged on local blood flow velocity, and altered 
ghrelin-stimulated food intake by delaying ghrelin access to target neurons. 
Thus, activation of median eminence vascular cells modulates food intake in 
response to peripheral ghrelin by reducing local blood flow velocity and access 
to the metabolic brain."
339,"T helper 17 (Th17) cells have a prominent role in autoimmune diseases. In 
contrast, the nature of these cells in cancer is controversial, with either pro 
or anti-tumorigenic activities depending on various cancer settings. Chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a B-cell malignancy, is characterized by an 
imbalance in T-cell immune responses contributing to disease progression and 
increased mortality. Many clinical reports indicate an increase in Th17 cells 
and/or IL-17 serum cytokine levels in CLL patients compared to healthy 
individuals which correlates with various prognostic markers and significant 
changes in the tumor microenvironment. The exact mechanisms by which Th17 might 
contribute to CLL progression is still less investigated. In this review, we 
provide an updated presentation of the clinical information related to the 
significance of Th17 cells in CLL, and their interaction with the complex 
leukemic microenvironment including various mediators, immune and non-immune 
cells. Herein, we also address the available data regarding the effects of CLL 
targeted therapies on Th17 cells, and the potential of using these cells in 
adoptive cell therapies. Having a sound understanding of the role played by Th17 
in CLL is crucial for designing novel therapies that can achieve immune 
homeostasis and maximize clinical benefits."
340,"BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health (SDoH), such as geographic 
neighborhoods, access to health care, education, and social structure, are 
important factors affecting people's health and health outcomes. The SDoH of 
patients are scarcely documented in a discrete format in electronic health 
records (EHRs) but are often available in free-text clinical narratives such as 
physician notes. Innovative methods like natural language processing (NLP) are 
being developed to identify and extract SDoH from EHRs, but it is imperative 
that the input of key stakeholders is included as NLP systems are designed.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the feasibility, challenges, and 
benefits of developing an NLP system to uncover SDoH from clinical narratives by 
conducting interviews with key stakeholders: (1) oncologists, (2) data analysts, 
(3) citizen scientists, and (4) patient navigators.
METHODS: Individuals who frequently work with SDoH data were invited to 
participate in semistructured interviews. All interviews were recorded and 
subsequently transcribed. After coding transcripts and developing a codebook, 
the constant comparative method was used to generate themes.
RESULTS: A total of 16 participants were interviewed (5 data analysts, 4 patient 
navigators, 4 physicians, and 3 citizen scientists). Three main themes emerged, 
accompanied by subthemes. The first theme, importance and approaches to 
obtaining SDoH, describes how every participant (n=16, 100%) regarded SDoH as 
important. In particular, proximity to the hospital and income levels were 
frequently relied upon. Communication about SDoH typically occurs during the 
initial conversation with the oncologist, but more personal information is often 
acquired by patient navigators. The second theme, SDoH exists in numerous forms, 
exemplified how SDoH arises during informal communication and can be difficult 
to enter into the EHR. The final theme, incorporating SDoH into health services 
research, addresses how more informed SDoH can be collected. One strategy is to 
empower patients so they are aware about the importance of SDoH, as well as 
employing NLP techniques to make narrative data available in a discrete format, 
which can provide oncologists with actionable data summaries.
CONCLUSIONS: Extracting SDoH from EHRs was considered valuable and necessary, 
but obstacles such as narrative data format can make the process difficult. NLP 
can be a potential solution, but as the technology is developed, it is important 
to consider how key stakeholders document SDoH, apply the NLP systems, and use 
the extracted SDoH in health outcome studies."
341,"BACKGROUND: Knowing the variability of blood coagulation responses to liver 
damage of different origins can provide a key to curing liver tissues or to 
mitigating treatment side effects. The aim of the present work was to compare 
the changes in the main components of hemostasis under experimental drug-induced 
hepatosis and hepatitis in rats.
METHODS: We modeled diclofenac-induced hepatitis and tetracycline-induced 
hepatosis. Hemostasis response was gauged by measuring fibrinogen, factor X, 
protein C (PC), and prothrombin in plasma. The decarboxylated form of 
prothrombin was detected by measuring prothrombin index and ecamulin index. 
Platelet reactivity was studied using aggregometry.
RESULTS: Both hepatitis and hepatosis decreased the synthesis of fibrinogen, 
factor X, and prothrombin. However, protein carboxylation was not disrupted in 
hepatosis but was much impaired in hepatitis. PC decreased in both models as a 
consequence of its consumption possibly during inflammatory response. Platelet 
aggregation rate was lower in hepatosis but higher in hepatitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply the need for a thorough monitoring of the 
hemostasis system in liver diseases to avoid possible thrombotic complications. 
Its state indicates the disorder's rate and character."
342,"Aim To examine a relation of thyroid function, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 
with left ventricular function measured through the left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods This prospective research 
involved 160 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patients 
were divided into those with normal thyroid hormone status (n=80) and those with 
hypothyroidism (newly diagnosed) (n=80). Inflammatory parameters and parameters 
of hormonal status were taken for analysis: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 
thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (FT4), and free 
triiodothyronine (FT3). All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiographic 
examination (TTE) five days upon admission, and left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) was analysed. Results Significant difference between the two 
groups was verified in values of T3, T4, erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, 
neutrophil, lymphocytes, NLR, C-reactive protein (CRP) and sedimentation rate. 
Patients with euthyroidism had a higher frequency of coronary single-vessel 
disease (p=0.035) and a significantly lower frequency of triple vessel disease 
(p=0.046), as well as a higher median value of LVEF (p=0.003). There was a 
significant correlation between LVEF with haemoglobin values (p=0.002), NLR 
(p=0.001), and CRP (p=001). Conclusion The altered status of the thyroid gland 
in acute myocardial infarction is associated with the severity of the coronary 
blood vessel lesion, LVEF and correlates with inflammatory response."
343,"Contractile epithelial tubes are found in various organs, such as lung airways 
and blood capillaries. Their ability to sense luminal pressure and respond with 
adequate contractility is essential for their physiology, and its mis-regulation 
results in diseases such as asthma and hypertension. Here, we describe a 
mechanoresponsive regulatory pathway downstream of tissue stretching that 
controls contraction of the C. elegans spermatheca, a tubular structure where 
fertilization occurs. Using live-imaging, we show that ovulation-induced 
stretching of spermathecal cells leads to recruitment of the RhoGEF RHGF-1 to 
stress fibers, which activates RHO-1 and myosin II in a positive feedback loop. 
Through deletion analysis, we identified the PDZ domain of RHGF-1 as responsible 
for F-actin binding, and genetic epistasis analysis with the RhoGAP spv-1 
demonstrated that tension-dependent recruitment of RHGF-1 to F-actin is required 
for robust spermathecal contractility. Our study illustrates how 
mechanosensitive regulators of Rho GTPases provide epithelial tubes the ability 
to tune their contractility in response to internal pressure."
344,"IMPORTANCE: The role of endovascular thrombectomy is uncertain for patients 
presenting beyond 24 hours of the time they were last known well.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate functional and safety outcomes for endovascular 
thrombectomy (EVT) vs medical management in patients with large-vessel occlusion 
beyond 24 hours of last known well.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational cohort study 
enrolled patients between July 2012 and December 2021 at 17 centers across the 
United States, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand. Eligible patients had 
occlusions in the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (M1 or M2 
segment) and were treated with EVT or medical management beyond 24 hours of last 
known well.
INTERVENTIONS: Endovascular thrombectomy or medical management (control).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was functional independence 
(modified Rankin Scale score 0-2). Mortality and symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage (sICH) were safety outcomes. Propensity score (PS)-weighted 
multivariable logistic regression analyses were adjusted for prespecified 
clinical characteristics, perfusion parameters, and/or Alberta Stroke Program 
Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and were repeated in subsequent 1:1 PS-matched cohorts.
RESULTS: Of 301 patients (median [IQR] age, 69 years [59-81]; 149 female), 185 
patients (61%) received EVT and 116 (39%) received medical management. In 
adjusted analyses, EVT was associated with better functional independence (38% 
vs control, 10%; inverse probability treatment weighting adjusted odds ratio 
[IPTW aOR], 4.56; 95% CI, 2.28-9.09; P < .001) despite increased odds of sICH 
(10.1% for EVT vs 1.7% for control; IPTW aOR, 10.65; 95% CI, 2.19-51.69; 
P = .003). This association persisted after PS-based matching on (1) clinical 
characteristics and ASPECTS (EVT, 35%, vs control, 19%; aOR, 3.14; 95% CI, 
1.02-9.72; P = .047); (2) clinical characteristics and perfusion parameters 
(EVT, 35%, vs control, 17%; aOR, 4.17; 95% CI, 1.15-15.17; P = .03); and (3) 
clinical characteristics, ASPECTS, and perfusion parameters (EVT, 45%, vs 
control, 21%; aOR, 4.39; 95% CI, 1.04-18.53; P = .04). Patients receiving EVT 
had lower odds of mortality (26%) compared with those in the control group (41%; 
IPTW aOR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27-0.89; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of treatment beyond 24 hours of last 
known well, EVT was associated with higher odds of functional independence 
compared with medical management, with consistent results obtained in PS-matched 
subpopulations and patients with presence of mismatch, despite increased odds of 
sICH. Our findings support EVT feasibility in selected patients beyond 24 hours. 
Prospective studies are warranted for confirmation."
345,"OBJECTIVE: Aberrations in glucose, insulin, and other postprandial (PP) markers 
are common in obesity and cardiometabolic disorders. One potentially simple 
lifestyle/dietary modification to manage these issues is to change the order in 
which foods are consumed within meals. Carbohydrate exerts the largest effect on 
PP glucose, and there is some evidence that ingesting dietary fat or protein 
before carbohydrate delays gastric emptying of carbohydrate and reduces PP 
glucose. Additionally, certain dietary proteins may augment insulin release if 
ingested with carbohydrate, thereby improving blood glucose clearance. This 
review aimed to systematically evaluate evidence from acute experiments that 
modified the order in which foods were consumed in isocaloric meals.
METHODS: Outcomes of interest were PP glucose and insulin (including area under 
the curve for both), C-peptide, gut hormones, and perceptual responses. Three 
databases were searched (PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science) in February 
2022. Additionally, reference lists of identified reports were searched, and an 
author of several studies was consulted to verify that relevant literature was 
included. The review included acute interventions that administered isocaloric 
meals of the same foods but with foods eaten in different orders. Studies were 
not excluded based on participant characteristics.
RESULTS: Eleven reports were identified. All reports that assessed glucose and 
insulin showed a tendency toward lower levels, at least over parts of the PP 
period, by consuming carbohydrates last. GLP-1 tended to be higher in 
carbohydrate-last conditions, though this was only measured in a few studies. 
Perceptual responses (hunger, fullness, etc.) were not consistently different 
between conditions in two studies, but the certainty of evidence was very low.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that, at least acutely, there may be benefits to 
eating carbohydrate after vegetable and/or protein-rich foods. The most 
consistent effect (judged as moderate certainty) is that carbohydrate-last meal 
orders tend to lower blood glucose and insulin excursions."
346,"IMPORTANCE: Peripheral neuropathies are common conditions and can result in 
numbness, paresthesia, motor deficits, and pain. There is increasing evidence 
for the use of biomarkers as clinical indicators of the presence, severity, and 
prognosis of nerve lesions; however, biomarker identification has largely been 
focused on disorders of the central nervous system, and less is known about 
their role in the peripheral nervous system.
OBJECTIVE: To assess blood-based biomarker concentrations associated with nerve 
involvement in patients with peripheral neuropathy compared with control 
participants.
DATA SOURCES: Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL were searched from inception to 
September 23, 2021.
STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies reporting on blood biomarkers in patients 
diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy were included. This review was 
preregistered on PROSPERO and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Data were 
abstracted by 1 investigator and independently reviewed by a second.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were meta-analyzed when at least 2 studies 
reported the same biomarker with comparable methodology. Fixed-effects models 
were used when only 2 studies were included; random-effects models were used 
when more than 2 studies were included.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome of interest was concentration of 
biomarkers.
RESULTS: This review included 36 studies reporting on 4414 participants, 
including 2113 control participants and 2301 patients with peripheral neuropathy 
with 13 distinct peripheral neuropathy diagnoses. Diabetic neuropathy was the 
most common neuropathy diagnosis (13 studies), followed by Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
disease (6 studies) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (6 studies). Overall, 16 
different blood-based biomarkers associated with nerve involvement were 
evaluated. The most used were neurofilament light chain, S100B, brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor, and neuron-specific enolase. Patients with peripheral 
neuropathy demonstrated significantly higher levels of neurofilament light chain 
compared with controls (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.82 
to 1.05]; P < .001). There were no significant differences in levels of S100B 
(SMD, 1.10 [95% CI, -3.08 to 5.28]; P = .38), brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(SMD, -0.52 [95% CI, -2.23 to 1.19]; P = .40), or neuron-specific enolase (SMD, 
-0.00 [95% CI, -1.99 to 1.98]; P = .10) in patients with peripheral neuropathy 
compared with control participants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis support the use of neurofilament light chain as a blood-based 
measure associated with the presence of neuronal injury in patients with 
peripheral neuropathy."
347,"Restoration of international normalized ratio (INR) to value <1.5 is commonly 
targeted to achieve hemostasis in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients 
with major bleeding or undergoing urgent surgery. However, the relationship 
between corrected INR and vitamin K-dependent factor (VKDF) levels for 
hemostasis is uncertain. The objectives of the study were to (1) examine the 
impact of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) or plasma on INR 
correction and VKDF restoration and (2) evaluate the relationship between INR 
values and VKDF levels in patients with acute major bleeding or requiring an 
urgent surgical procedure.. Adult VKA-treated patients with an elevated INR 
(≥2.0 within 3 hours before study treatment) who received 4F-PCC or plasma 
following major bleeding or prior to urgent surgery/invasive procedure were 
included in this retrospective analysis of data from two prospective phase IIIb 
randomized controlled trials. Of the 370 patients included in this analysis, 185 
received 4F-PCC and 185 received plasma. In the 4F-PCC group, 85.9% (159/185) 
had INR ≤1.5 at 30 minutes after the end of infusion compared with only 39.1% 
(72/184) in the plasma group. Following 4F-PCC treatment, all VKDF levels 
exceeded 50% activity regardless of post-infusion INR value. However, following 
plasma administration, mean activity levels for factors II and X were below 50% 
at all time points assessed within 3 hours after starting the infusion, 
regardless of post-infusion INR value. This retrospective analysis demonstrated 
that treatment with 4F-PCC in VKA-treated patients rapidly restores VKDFs to 
hemostatic levels irrespective of post-infusion INR value whereas plasma does 
not."
348,"BACKGROUND: Ubiquitination plays an essential role in many biological processes, 
including viral infection, and can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes 
(DUBs). Although some studies discovered that DUBs inhibit or enhance viral 
infection by various mechanisms, there is lack of information on the role of 
DUBs in virus regulation, which needs to be further investigated.
METHODS: Immunoblotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, in vivo/in vitro 
deubiquitination, protein immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and 
co-localization biological techniques were employed to examine the effect of 
ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3) on APOBEC3G (A3G) stability and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. To analyse the relationship between 
USP3 and HIV disease progression, we recruited 20 HIV-infected patients to 
detect the levels of USP3 and A3G in peripheral blood and analysed their 
correlation with CD4+ T-cell counts. Correlation was estimated by Pearson 
correlation coefficients (for parametric data).
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that USP3 specifically inhibits HIV-1 
replication in an A3G-dependent manner. Further investigation found that USP3 
stabilized 90% to 95% of A3G expression by deubiquitinating Vif-mediated 
polyubiquitination and blocking its degradation in an enzyme-dependent manner. 
It also enhances the A3G messenger RNA (mRNA) level by binding to A3G mRNA and 
stabilizing it in an enzyme-independent manner. Moreover, USP3 expression was 
positively correlated with A3G expression (r = 0.5110) and CD4+ T-cell counts 
(r = 0.5083) in HIV-1-infected patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that USP3 restricts HIV-1 viral infections by increasing 
the expression of the antiviral factor A3G. Therefore, USP3 may be an important 
target for drug development and serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against 
viral infections."
349,"Myelodysplastic neoplasms, formerly known as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 
represent a group of clonal disorders characterized by a high degree of clinical 
and molecular heterogeneity, and an invariable tendency to progress to acute 
myeloid leukemia. MDS typically present in the elderly with cytopenias of 
different degrees and bone marrow dysplasia, the hallmarks of the disease. 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the sole curative approach to 
date. Nonetheless, given the disease's demographics, only a minority of patients 
can benefit from this procedure. Currently used prognostic schemes such as the 
Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (R-IPSS), and most recently the 
molecular IPSS (IPSS-M), guide clinical management by dividing MDS into two big 
categories: lower- and higher-risk cases, based on a cut-off score of 3.5. The 
main clinical problem of the lower-risk group is represented by the management 
of cytopenias, whereas the prevention of secondary leukemia progression is the 
goal for the latter. Herein, we discuss the non-transplant treatment of MDS, 
focusing on current practice and available therapeutic options, while also 
presenting new investigational agents potentially entering the MDS therapeutic 
arsenal in the near future."
350,"Diabetes is a risk factor for greater severity of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is an independent predictor of 
critical illness, and it is reported to have a stronger association than 
absolute hyperglycemia. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of 
absolute hyperglycemia and SHR with the severity of COVID-19, since there are no 
studies investigating SHR in patients with COVID-19. We conducted a 
retrospective observational study on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the 
first months of the pandemic, regarding absolute hyperglycemia, SHR, and 
severity outcomes. Of the 374 patients, 28.1% had a previous diagnosis of type 2 
diabetes. Absolute hyperglycemia (64.8% versus 22.7%; p < 0.01) and SHR [1.1 
(IQR 0.9-1.3) versus 1.0 (IQR 0.9-1.2); p < 0.001] showed a statistically 
significant association with previous diabetes. Absolute hyperglycemia showed a 
significant association with clinical severity of COVID-19 (79.0% versus 62.7%; 
p < 0.001), need for oxygen therapy (74.8% versus 54.4%; p < 0.001), invasive 
mechanical ventilation (28.6% versus 11.6%; p < 0.001), and intensive care unit 
(30.3% versus 14.9%; p = 0.002), but not with mortality; by contrast, there was 
no statistically significant association between SHR and all these parameters. 
Our results are in agreement with the literature regarding the impact of 
absolute hyperglycemia on COVID-19 severity outcomes, while SHR was not a 
significant marker. We therefore suggest that SHR should not be evaluated in all 
patients admitted in the hospital for COVID-19, and we encourage the standard 
measures at admission of blood glucose and HbA1c levels."
351,"This report presents a case of malignant melanoma in a 40-year-old male who 
underwent resection of the tumor in his right ankle. Eleven months after the 
resection, a subcutaneous mass was observed on his right femur. Ultrasound 
examination revealed a hypoechoic tubular structure in the right thigh, with a 
small amount of blood flow in the lesion. Using ultrasound and fine-needle 
aspiration, the patient was diagnosed with metastasis and lymphovascular 
invasion of malignant melanoma. Treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor 
was originally scheduled, but the lesion disappeared spontaneously after the 
fine-needle aspiration."
352,"BACKGROUND: The most reliable quantitative variable on Rubidium-82 (82Rb) 
cardiac PET/CT for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has not 
been characterized with low-dose silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) technology, 
which allows halving injected activity and radiation dose delivering less than 
1.0 mSv in a 70-kg individual.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 234 consecutive participants with 
suspected myocardial ischemia. Participants underwent 82Rb cardiac SiPM PET/CT 
(5 MBq/kg) and were followed up for MACE over 652 days (interquartile range 
559-751 days). For each participant, global stress myocardial blood flow (stress 
MBF), global myocardial flow reserve (MFR), and regional severely reduced 
myocardial flow capacity (MFCsevere) were measured. The Youden index was used to 
select optimal thresholds. In multivariate analysis after adjustments for 
clinical risk factors, reduced global stress MBF < 1.94 ml/min/g, reduced global 
MFR < 1.98, and regional MFCsevere > 3.2% of left ventricle emerged all as 
independent predictors of MACE (HR 4.5, 3.1, and 3.67, respectively, p < 0.001). 
However, only reduced global stress MBF remained an independent prognostic 
factor for MACE after adjusting for clinical risk factors and the combined use 
of global stress MBF, global MFR, and regional MFCsevere impairments (HR 2.81, 
p = 0.027).
CONCLUSION: Using the latest SiPM PET technology with low-dose 82Rb halving the 
standard activity to deliver < 1 mSv for a 70-kg patient, impaired global stress 
MBF, global MFR, and regional MFC were powerful predictors of cardiovascular 
events, outperforming traditional cardiovascular risk factors. However, only 
reduced global stress MBF independently predicted MACE, being superior to global 
MFR and regional MFC impairments."
353,"BACKGROUND: Characteristics of AL amyloidosis across Asia are not well-described 
in the literature. Thus, we overviewed the incidence and disease characteristics 
of AL amyloidosis in Korea.
METHODS: We collected medical records of 302 AL amyloidosis patients and 
compared survival outcomes by predominant treatment strategy and at four time 
points: 1995-2003, 2004-2008, 2009-2013, and 2014-2018.
RESULTS: The median age was 62 years (36-83). One hundred forty-one patients 
were classified as stage III (26.3%) or IV (47.9%). The patients diagnosed 
between 2014 and 2018 survived longer than those diagnosed at other time points 
due to the introduction of bortezomib (p < 0.01). In addition, patients who 
received upfront ASCT survived longer than those who received salvage ASCT or 
chemotherapy alone (p < 0.01). However, most of the 85 patients who experienced 
early death within 6 months were older than 75 years, had BMI less than 20, and 
had a high disease burden.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AL amyloid has increased and survival outcomes 
have improved gradually, most likely due to introduction of novel agents and 
upfront ASCT. However, not all patients are suitable for these potent treatment 
modalities, and avoiding early death within 6 months remains a challenge."
354,"The relationship between fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and disease prognosis in 
patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is unclear. This study aimed to 
clarify the relationship between HbF level and the prognosis of MDS. To this 
end, data from 217 patients diagnosed with MDS between April 2006 and August 
2020 at Ebina General Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The primary 
endpoint was leukemia-free survival (LFS) for 5 years after diagnosis. HbF 
levels were significantly higher in patients with MDS than in control patients 
without MDS (n = 155), with a cut-off value of 0.4%. Higher-risk patients had a 
similar prognosis regardless of HbF level, but lower-risk patients had longer 
LFS at intermediate HbF levels. Although prognosis based on pre-treatment HbF 
levels did not differ significantly among azacitidine-treated patients, 
prognosis tended to be better in lower-risk patients with intermediate HbF 
levels. Multivariate analysis showed that the intermediate HbF category 
correlated with LFS, independently of MDS lower-risk prognostic scoring system 
(LR-PSS)-related factors. This study is the first to assess the association 
between HbF levels and the new World Health Organization 2016 criteria for MDS, 
demonstrating the significance of HbF levels in the prognosis of MDS."
355,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative treatment is performed for locally advanced colon 
cancer with extensive tumor proximity or suspected invasion of skeletal muscles, 
major organs, and blood vessels. Oxaliplatin-based regimens are often used in 
preoperative chemotherapy. However, microsatellite instability (MSI)-high 
colorectal cancer is often resistant to cytotoxic anticancer agents. Herein, we 
describe a case of treatment of anticancer drug-resistant MSI-high locally 
advanced colon cancer and review cases of complete response to immune checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy for colorectal cancer.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a large 
tumor in the descending colon and extensive thoracic and abdominal wall 
involvement, including the ribs and diaphragm. No distant metastasis was 
observed. The tumor had perforated the abdominal wall and formed an abscess. 
Upon visiting our hospital, emergency surgery was performed. An abdominal wall 
incision was made to drain the abscess and laparoscopic colostomy was performed. 
Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens revealed an adenocarcinoma 
with positive immunohistochemical expressions of both CDX2 and CK20. The patient 
was diagnosed with a descending colon cancer. Genetic examination found 
MSI-high, Kras mutation (F12G), and wild-type BRAF. After the inflammation 
improved, chemotherapy with the FOLFIRI regimen was initiated, but the tumor 
grew rapidly. As a second-line treatment, nivolumab and ipilimumab combination 
therapy was initiated. After four cycles of these therapies, the patient was 
administered nivolumab alone for five cycles. Tumor shrinkage was observed and 
radical surgery was performed. The patient underwent laparoscopic descending 
colon and partial thoracic and abdominal wall resection. The abdominal wall 
muscle was dissected from the abdominal cavity, and subcutaneous tissues, 
diaphragm, ribs were dissected from the body surface. Pathological examination 
revealed mucus components, fibrous tissues, and no malignant cells, indicating a 
complete pathological response (pCR). The patient had a good postoperative 
course and returned to work after being discharged. No recurrence was observed 
six months postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report a case of anticancer drug-resistant MSI-high 
colon cancer that was resected after treatment with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, and a pCR was achieved. This new treatment strategy can be used for 
the treatment of cases that are not responsive to conventional therapies."
356,"In early brain injury (EBI), oxidative stress occurs following subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH), and mitochondria are intricately linked to this process. SS31, 
a mitochondria-targeting antioxidative peptide, has been demonstrated to be 
beneficial for multiple diseases because of its powerful antioxidant and 
neuroprotective properties. Although our previous study revealed that SS31 was 
involved in the powerful antioxidant effect following SAH, the underlying 
molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the 
neuroprotective effects of SS31 by reversing mitochondrial dysfunction in EBI 
following SAH, via activating the Nrf2 signaling and PGC-1α pathways. Our 
findings confirmed that SS31 ameliorated SAH-triggered oxidative insult. SS31 
administration decreased redundant reactive oxygen species, alleviated lipid 
peroxidation, and elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Concomitant 
with the inhibited oxidative insult, SS31 dramatically attenuated neurological 
deficits, cerebral edema, neural apoptosis, and blood-brain barrier disruption 
following SAH. Moreover, SS31 remarkably promoted nuclear factor-erythroid 2 
related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear shuttle and upregulated the expression levels of 
heme oxygenase-1 and NADPH: quinine oxidoreductase1. Additionally, SS31 enhanced 
the expression levels of PGC-1α and its target genes, and increased the mtDNA 
copy number, promoting mitochondrial function. However, PGC-1α-specific 
inhibitor SR-18292 pretreatment dramatically suppressed SS31-induced Nrf2 
expression and PGC-1α activation. Furthermore, pretreatment with SR-18292 
reversed the neuroprotective and antioxidant roles of SS31. These significant 
beneficial effects were associated with the activation of the Nrf2 signaling and 
PGC-1α pathways and were antagonized by SR-18292 administration. Our findings 
reveal that SS31 exhibits its neuroprotective activity by reversing 
mitochondrial dysfunction via activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which could 
be mediated through PGC-1α activation."
357,"PURPOSE: Using a comprehensive flow cytometric panel, simultaneously obtained 
mid-luteal immunophenotypes from peripheral blood and endometrium were compared 
and values correlated. Is a peripheral blood evaluation of reproductive 
immunophenotype status meritorious relative to local endometrial evaluation to 
directly assess the peri-implantation environment?
METHODS: Fifty-five patients had a mid-luteal biopsy to assess the local 
endometrial immunophenotype, while simultaneously providing a peripheral blood 
sample for analysis. Both samples were immediately assessed using a 
comprehensive multi-parameter panel, and lymphocyte subpopulations were 
described and compared.
RESULTS: Distinct lymphocyte proportions and percentage differences were noted 
across the two compartments, confirming the hypothesis that they are distinct 
environments. The ratio of CD4 + to CD8 + T cells were reversed between the two 
compartments, as were Th1 and Th2-type CD4 + T cell ratios. Despite these 
differences, some direct relationships were noted. Positive Pearson correlations 
were found between the levels of CD57 + expressing natural killer cells, 
CD3 + NK-T cells and CD4 + Th1 cells in both compartments.
CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric evaluation provides a rapid and objective analysis 
of lymphocyte subpopulations. Endometrial biopsies have become the gold standard 
technique to assess the uterine immunophenotype in adverse reproductive outcome, 
but there may still a place for peripheral blood evaluation in this context. The 
findings demonstrate significant variations in cellular proportions across the 
two regions, but some positive correlations are present. Immunological 
assessment of these specific peripheral blood lymphocyte subtypes may provide 
insight into patients with potential alterations of the uterine immune 
environment, without the risks and inconveniences associated with an invasive 
procedure."
358,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to initially explore the efficiency and safety of 
mizoribine (MZR) combined with steroids and dietary sodium restriction on the 
treatment of primary membranous nephropathy (MN) compared with cyclophosphamide 
(CPM)-based steroids.
METHODS: Patients with primary MN were enrolled. According to the therapy, they 
were divided into the MZR combined with steroids and dietary sodium restriction 
group (N = 30) and CPM-based steroids group (N = 30). Both groups were followed 
up for 1 year to monitor safety and efficacy.
RESULTS: Compared with the CPM-based steroids group, the MZR combined with 
steroids and dietary sodium restriction group had significantly lower daily 
sodium intake, serum sodium, blood pressure (BP), and 24 h urine protein (all 
P < 0.05). Conversely, plasma albumin and complete remission rate in the MZR 
group were higher at the 12th follow-up (40.39 ± 5.14 g/L vs. 37.63 ± 5.40 g/L; 
86.67% vs. 66.67%; all P < 0.05). These two groups showed similar adverse events 
rates (20.00% vs. 26.67%, P = 0.54).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that MZR combined with steroids and dietary 
sodium restriction is superior to CPM-based steroids in terms of 
complete remission and 24 h urine protein in patients with primary MN."
359,"BACKGROUND: High-risk screening for Fabry disease in dialysis patients is an 
effective means for reducing the number of undiagnosed cases. However, such 
screening has not been conducted in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Herein, we aimed to 
estimate the prevalence of Fabry disease among patients undergoing hemodialysis 
in Chiba Prefecture by high-risk screening using α-galactosidase A (αGal A) 
activity measurement, and examine the hemodialysis effect on αGal A activity.
METHODS: Patients who underwent maintenance hemodialysis at 25 facilities in 
Chiba Prefecture were recruited. The αGal A activity was measured using the 
dried blood spot (DBS) test as the first screening. If the enzyme activity was 
lower than the cut-off, the second screening was performed with the same method 
before and after dialysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 2924 patients (2036 men and 888 women) were included from 
which 94 cases (45 men and 48 women) showed decreased αGAL activity in the first 
screening and 3 (two men and one women) in the second screening. Genetic testing 
was performed in 3 patients, and the c.1078G > A mutation in GLA gene was 
detected in one male patient (0.03%). There has been a statistically significant 
decrease in αGal A activity of DBS at post-dialysis compared to that at 
pre-dialysis (20.5 ± 10.4 pmol/h/disk and 22.7 ± 11.5 pmol/h/disk, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Fabry disease among patients undergoing 
hemodialysis in Chiba Prefecture was estimated as 0.03%. This is the first time 
that dialysis has been shown to affect the αGal A activity."
360,"PURPOSE: To investigate whether BP is related to postbiopsy bleeding in patients 
undergoing native percutaneous kidney biopsy (PKB) and to evaluate the dynamic 
changes in blood pressure (BP) pre- and post-kidney biopsy.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted. The 
whole-procedural systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP for patients undergoing 
ultrasound-guided native PKB from October 2017 to December 2020 were recorded in 
the study. Propensity score matching was used to minimize selection bias. SBP 
and DBP were analyzed as the main risk factors for bleeding complications. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to explore the 
optimal BP thresholds to differentiate between bleeding and nonbleeding. The 
rates of major bleeding complications were analyzed according to BP thresholds 
through logistic analysis.
RESULTS: Of 1146 biopsies, 432 (37.7%) patients suffered from postbiopsy 
bleeding, 88 (7.7%) patients had major bleeding complications, and 344 (30.0%) 
patients had minor bleeding complications. In the original data, for patients 
with SBP ≥ 160 mmHg before PKB, the rate of major bleeding complications was 
17.6% (7.5% for SBP < 160 mmHg), and the rate of major bleeding complications 
was 19.0% in patients with DBP ≥ 100 mmHg (7.5% for DBP < 100 mmHg). For 
patients with DBP ≥ 85 mmHg to 100 mmHg after PKB, the rate of major bleeding 
complications ranged from 9.5 to 17.5%. The rate of major bleeding complications 
was lower (6.6-7.3%) in patients with DBP < 100 mmHg to 85 mmHg.
CONCLUSION: Patients who have high-level BP during the native PKB perioperative 
period are at higher risk for postbiopsy bleeding. High-level BP here does not 
refer to traditional hypertension according to the guidelines for the diagnosis 
and treatment of hypertension, but rather BP above a certain threshold related 
to bleeding risk."
361,"Identifying hyperglycaemia during postoperative period is essential for 
neonates. The objective of the study was to analyse the accuracy and reliability 
of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device for detecting hyperglycaemia 
during postoperative period in neonates. In this prospective study, hourly 
glucose recordings by CGM device and six hourly by glucometer glucose 
(GG-reference test for patient management) were collected in ten surgical 
neonates during first three postoperative days. Mean absolute relative 
difference (MARD) and proportion of CGM values within ± 15%/15 mg/dL, ± 20%/20 
mg/dL, and ± 30%/30 mg/dL of GG, were analysed from matched pair CGM and GG 
recordings. The diagnostic performance of CGM for neonatal hyperglycaemia (> 150 
mg/dL) was expressed as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value 
(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV); and the clinical reliability was 
assessed in Clarke Error Grid Analysis. A total of 720 CGM glucose readings, 120 
matched -paired glucose readings by CGM --GG, and 37 episodes were 
hyperglycaemia by GG. The MARD was 10.76 %; the percentages of glucose readings 
within 15%/15 mg/dL, 20%/20 mg/dL, and 30%/30 mg/dL were 94.6%, 97.3% and 100% 
during the hyperglycaemia period. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV to 
detect hyperglycaaemia by CGM device were 100%, 93.9%, 88% and 100 % 
respectively. In Clarke Error Grid Analysis, 97.3 % points were in zone A and B 
during the hyperglycaemia period.
CONCLUSION: CGM device can be a clinically reliable tool for hyperglycaemia 
management during postoperative period in neonates.
WHAT IS KNOWN: • Neonates are vulnerable for hyperglycaemia during 
post-operative period and bed side glucometers are used for frequent glucose 
monitoring in them. • Continuous glucose monitor(CGM) devices are used for the 
glucose monitoring in adult and paediatric diabetes care.
WHAT IS NEW: • For the first time, this study analysed the accuracy and clinical 
reliability of FreeStyle Libre (CGM device) for identifying hyperglycaemia 
during post-operative period in neonates. • CGM device has very good accuracy 
for detecting hyperglycaemia in neonates, it may help the clinician for better 
glucose stability during post-operative period."
362,"PURPOSE: Existing biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk 
prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors 
for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.
METHODS: An animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR 
technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA 
sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of 
different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were 
subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes 
involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological 
function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and 
apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.
RESULTS: We identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis 
and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. 
Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes 
(RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was 
constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural 
network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified 
patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better 
prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction 
model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA 
successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated 
apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and 
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for 
metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications."
363,"PURPOSE: To examine the associations of healthy dietary patterns with 
cardiometabolic biomarkers and all-cause mortality among individuals with 
prediabetes.
METHODS: This cohort study included 8363 adults with prediabetes from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2014. Healthy dietary 
patterns including Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), Alternate 
Mediterranean Diet score (AMED), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension score 
(DASH), and Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) were calculated based on 24-h 
dietary recall data. Mortality status was obtained by linkage to National Death 
Index records. Cardiometabolic biomarkers, including blood glucose, insulin, 
HbA1c, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lipids, were measured at recruitment.
RESULTS: During 61,991 person-years of follow-up, 991 deaths occurred. Comparing 
the extreme quartiles, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality were 0.65 (0.49, 0.85) for 
AHEI-2010 (P-trend = 0.002), 0.68 (0.50, 0.92) for AMED (P-trend = 0.004), 0.72 
(0.53, 0.98) for DASH (P-trend = 0.03), and 0.78 (0.58, 1.05) for HEI-2015 
(P-trend = 0.08). Besides, the HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality per 
20-percentile increment in scores were 0.78 (0.67, 0.90) for AHEI-2010 
(P = 0.001), 0.73 (0.62, 0.86) for AMED (P < 0.001), 0.84 (0.69, 1.02) for DASH 
(P = 0.08), and 0.86 (0.74, 1.00) for HEI-2015 (P = 0.04). In addition, higher 
dietary scores were associated with favorable blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, 
blood lipids, and CRP (all P-trend < 0.05). The high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol and CRP explained 1.53-9.21% of the associations between dietary 
patterns and all-cause mortality (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Diets with higher AHEI-2010, AMED, DASH, and HEI-2015 were 
associated with improved cardiometabolic factors and lower all-cause mortality 
among individuals with prediabetes. These findings suggest that multiple healthy 
dietary patterns instead of a one-size-fits-all diet plan might be beneficial 
and acceptable for individuals with prediabetes."
364,"Laser therapy has become the golden standard of port wine stain (PWS), but 
complete clearance of resistant PWSs is still difficult. The application of 
photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of PWS shows potential in clinical 
practice, especially for large-area and deep lesions. In this work, in vivo 
animal experimental investigation on the coupling effect of PDT with multi-pulse 
laser (MPL) irradiation on the treatment of PWS was conducted by using a dorsal 
skin window chamber model. Through visualization of the thermal response of 
blood vessels and damage evaluation, it is found that the combination of PDT 
with MPL results in 96.2% more vascular injury than PDT alone and 90% more than 
MPL alone, thus reducing side effects such as purpura after treatment. The 
combined therapy also has the benefit of large treatment area, uniform fading 
effect, shortened light duration, and reduced photosensitizer admit."
365,"PURPOSE: Current management of pediatric intramedullary ependymoma is 
extrapolated from adult series since large studies in children are unavailable. 
This has led us to share our experience with this rare tumor and compare it to 
the literature and to review and highlight important aspects of current 
management and point out inconsistencies.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with intramedullary 
ependymoma managed at our institution between 2004 and 2021.
RESULTS: During the study period, 5 patients were treated for intramedullary 
ependymoma. Cases of myxopapillary ependymoma were excluded. The mean age of our 
cohort was 11.2 years. We identified 4 cases of grade II ependymoma and 1 case 
of grade III ependymoma. Gross tumor removal (GTR) was achieved in two patients 
(40%) of patients. One patient was treated with radiotherapy for recurrence and 
two patients received chemotherapy. There were no cases of recurrence among 
patients treated with GTR, but in all patients treated with STR. Eighty percent 
of patients either improved or stayed stable neurologically. During follow-up 
(mean 73 months), 2 patients died of disease.
CONCLUSION: GTR and tumor grade remain the key prognostic factor of long-term 
tumor-free survival. Many questions prevail regarding outcomes, correct use of 
adjuvant therapy, and prognostic factors."
366,"Astatine-211 (211At) is an alpha emitter applicable to radioimmunotherapy (RIT), 
a cancer treatment that utilizes radioactive antibodies to target tumors. In the 
preparation of 211At-labeled monoclonal antibodies (211At-mAbs), the possibility 
of radionuclide-induced antibody denaturation (radiolysis) is of concern. Our 
previous study showed that this 211At-induced radiochemical reaction disrupts 
the cellular binding activity of an astatinated mAb, resulting in attenuation of 
in vivo antitumor effects, whereas sodium ascorbate (SA), a free radical 
scavenger, prevents antibody denaturation, contributing to the maintenance of 
binding and antitumor activity. However, the influence of antibody denaturation 
on the pharmacokinetics of 211At-mAbs relating to tumor accumulation, blood 
circulation time, and distribution to normal organs remains unclear. In this 
study, we use a radioactive anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(anti-HER2) mAb to demonstrate that an 211At-induced radiochemical reaction 
disrupts active targeting via an antigen-antibody interaction, whereas SA helps 
to maintain targeting. In contrast, there was no difference in blood circulation 
time as well as distribution to normal organs between the stabilized and 
denatured immunoconjugates, indicating that antibody denaturation may not affect 
tumor accumulation via passive targeting based on the enhanced permeability and 
retention effect. In a high-HER2-expressing xenograft model treated with 1 MBq 
of 211At-anti-HER2 mAbs, SA-dependent maintenance of active targeting 
contributed to a significantly better response. In treatment with 0.5 or 0.2 
MBq, the stabilized radioactive mAb significantly reduced tumor growth compared 
to the denatured immunoconjugate. Additionally, through a comparison between a 
stabilized 211At-anti-HER2 mAb and radioactive nontargeted control mAb, we 
demonstrate that active targeting significantly enhances tumor accumulation of 
radioactivity and in vivo antitumor effect. In RIT with 211At, active targeting 
contributes to efficient tumor accumulation of radioactivity, resulting in a 
potent antitumor effect. SA-dependent protection that successfully maintains 
tumor targeting will facilitate the clinical application of alpha-RIT."
367,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated diagnostic yield of small volume biopsies 
(SVB) for the diagnosis and management of follicular lymphoma (FL).
METHODS: The authors performed a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of 
SVBs including fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and needle core biopsy (NCB) for 
initial FL diagnosis and suspected recurrence or transformation of FL. A total 
of 676 workups beginning with SVB were assessed for the mean number of biopsies 
per workup, the proportion of workups requiring multiple biopsies, and the 
proportion with a complete diagnosis including grade, on initial biopsy.
RESULTS: Compared to workups performed for question transformation/recurrence, 
those done for initial FL diagnosis were significantly more likely to require 
multiple biopsies (p < .01), had a higher mean number of biopsies per workup 
(1.7 vs. 1.1, absolute standardized difference = 1.1), and a lower complete 
diagnosis rate at initial biopsy (39% vs. 56%). At initial FL diagnosis, NCB +/- 
FNA was associated with fewer biopsies per workup compared to FNA +/- CB (1.2 
vs. 1.9), fewer workups requiring multiple biopsies (23% vs. 83%), and a higher 
complete diagnosis rate (71% vs. 18%). In contrast, during assessment for 
transformation/recurrence, NCB and FNA showed a similar mean number of biopsies 
per workup (1.2 vs. 1.2) and few workups required multiple biopsies (6% vs. 
19%).
CONCLUSIONS: SVB at initial FL diagnosis often required additional biopsies to 
establish a complete diagnosis. In contrast, when assessing for 
transformed/recurrent FL, additional biopsies were generally not obtained 
regardless of SVB type, suggesting that in these clinical settings SVB may be 
sufficient for clinical decision-making."
368,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. 
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the first choice for treatment of CRC, but it cannot 
avoid the negative effects from local high glucose (Glu) in tumor. Recently, 
5-FU therapy has been combined with other treatment modalities for CRC 
synergistic therapy. Although these combination therapy strategies are more 
effective in cancer therapy, the toxicity side effects to the liver and cause 
metabolic acidosis still exist. Herein, we report an emerging amorphous 
honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped carbon (N/C) nanozyme with nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase and catalase (CAT) activity and cascade it with 
natural glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) to realize NAD+ regeneration and further 
hyperglycemia management. In this case, by the coupling of N/C nanozyme with 
natural GDH to form a N/C-GDH system, the electron transfer route can switch 
from Glu to a common but limited electron receptor, i.e., NAD+ to ubiquitous 
large amounts of oxygen, achieving the purpose of sustainable consumption of Glu 
under NAD+ circulation and regeneration, and importantly escaping the generation 
of toxic H2O2. The combination of the N/C-GDH system and 5-FU on CRC cells was 
investigated to assess their synergistic bioeffects. Notably, our results showed 
that the N/C-GDH system and 5-FU in combination significantly suppress the 
proliferation of human colon cancer cells (HCT-116) by reducing the sugar level 
and induced apoptosis compared with either material or drug used alone. This 
work expands the nanozymes in blood Glu management as well as the promising 
cancer cell inhibition and provides the possibility of nonmetallic nanomaterials 
in the realization of effective treatment of cancer."
369,"Advanced therapies have transformed the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; 
however, many patients fail to respond, highlighting the need for therapies 
tailored to the underlying cell and molecular disease drivers. The 
first-in-class oral molecule ABX464 (obefazimod), which selectively up-regulates 
miR-124, has demonstrated its ability to be a well-tolerated treatment with 
rapid and sustained efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we 
provide evidence that ABX464 impacts the immune system in vitro, in murine model 
of IBD, as well as in patients with UC. In vitro, ABX464 treatment up-regulated 
miR-124 and led to decreases in proinflammatory cytokines including IL17 and 
IL6, and in the chemokine CCL2. Consistently, miR-124 expression was upregulated 
in the rectal biopsies and blood samples of UC patients and a parallel reduction 
in Th17 cells and IL17a levels was observed in serum samples. In a mouse model 
of induced intestinal inflammation with dextran sulfate sodium, ABX464 reversed 
the increases in multiple proinflammatory cytokines in the colon and the 
upregulation of IL17a secretion in the mesenteric lymph nodes. By up-regulating 
miR-124, ABX464 acts as ""a physiological brake"" of inflammation which may 
explain the efficacy of ABX464 with a favorable tolerability and safety profile 
in UC patients."
370,"Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The disease progression 
of sepsis is very fast, and there is a 7-9% increase in mortality every hour. 
Therefore, rapid and sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria is crucial for 
the timely treatment of sepsis as well as the reduction of mortality. Herein, we 
present a sensitive near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence identification and a rapid 
magnetic capture based on bioorthogonal nanoprobes for the detection of multiple 
bacteria in whole blood. The nanoprobes with NIR fluorescence/magnetic 
properties were modified with dibenzocyclooctyne groups and used to capture and 
recognize the bacteria via bioorthogonal reaction. The magnetic nanoprobes 
showed superparamagnetic properties with a saturation magnetization as high as 
63 emu/g. Through clicking with the azide groups inserted on the bacteria walls 
by metabolic engineering, the bioorthogonal magnetic nanoprobes allow fast and 
broad-spectrum capture of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The 
bioorthogonal NIR fluorescent nanoprobes with a maximum emission at 900 nm can 
effectively avoid background interference, further enabling sensitive 
identification of the bacteria in whole blood. The detection limit was as low as 
4 CFU/mL in less than 2.5 h and the nanoprobes were successfully applied to the 
detection of bacteria in blood samples from the patients with sepsis, showing 
the potential application in early sepsis diagnosis and clinical studies."
371,"Battlefield acupuncture is a specific auricular acupuncture protocol that can be 
performed by nonacupuncturists in military and civilian clinical settings. 
Battlefield acupuncture is purported to be efficacious in controlling pain, is 
quickly administered, and requires minimal postadministration observation. With 
very low risk and a negligible adverse reaction profile, this technique can be 
used as an alternative or complement to manage pain. More large randomized 
controlled trials are needed to compare acupuncture with standard therapy in 
military and civilian settings."
372,"This article describes an unusual presentation of a blue finger in a middle-aged 
woman with no significant past medical history. The patient was diagnosed with 
Achenbach syndrome, a rare condition that is generally considered transient and 
benign. The underlying pathophysiology of this condition is unclear, but may be 
related to transient subcutaneous ecchymosis, possibly from microtrauma. If the 
condition recurs, a workup can include laboratory tests for autoimmune diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis. Clinician awareness of this presentation may 
reduce patient anxiety and unnecessary testing."
373,"INTRODUCTION: Genetic associations for variants identified through genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) tend to be overestimated in the original discovery 
data set as, if the association was underestimated, the variant may not have 
been detected. This bias, known as winner's curse, can affect Mendelian 
randomization estimates, but its severity and potential impact are unclear.
METHODS: We performed an empirical investigation to assess the potential bias 
from winner's curse in practice. We considered Mendelian randomization estimates 
for the effect of body mass index (BMI) on coronary artery disease risk. We 
randomly divided a UK Biobank data set 100 times into three equally sized 
subsets. The first subset was treated as the 'discovery GWAS'. We compared 
genetic associations estimated in the discovery GWAS to those estimated in the 
other subsets for each of the 100 iterations.
RESULTS: For variants associated with BMI at P < 5 × 10-8 in at least one 
iteration, genetic associations with BMI were up to 5-fold greater in iterations 
in which the variant was associated with BMI at P < 5 × 10-8 compared with its 
mean association across all iterations. If the minimum P-value for association 
with BMI was P = 10-13 or lower, then this inflation was <25%. Mendelian 
randomization estimates were affected by winner's curse bias. However, bias did 
not materially affect results; all analyses indicated a deleterious effect of 
BMI on coronary artery disease risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Winner's curse can bias Mendelian randomization estimates, although 
its practical impact may not be substantial. If avoiding sample overlap is 
infeasible, analysts should consider performing a sensitivity analysis based on 
variants strongly associated with the exposure."
374,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is 
unlikely to be a major transfusion-transmitted pathogen, however, convalescent 
plasma is a treatment option used in some regions. The risk of 
transfusion-transmitted infections can be minimised by implementing Pathogen 
Inactivation (PI), such as THERAFLEX MB-Plasma and THERAFLEX UV-Platelets 
systems. Here we examined the capability of these PI systems to inactivate 
SARS-CoV-2.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 spiked plasma units were treated using the 
THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system in the presence of methylene blue (~0.8 μmol/L; 
visible light doses: 20, 40, 60 and 120 [standard] J/cm2 ). SARS-CoV-2 spiked 
platelet concentrates (PCs) were treated using the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system 
(UVC doses: 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 [standard] J/cm2 ). Samples were taken 
prior to the first and after each illumination dose and viral infectivity was 
assessed using an immunoplaque assay.
RESULTS: Treatment of spiked plasma with the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system resulted 
in an average ≥5.03 log10 reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity at one third (40 
J/cm2 ) of the standard visible light dose. For the platelet concentrates (PCs), 
treatment with the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system resulted in an average ≥5.18 
log10 reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity at the standard UVC dose (0.2 J/cm2 ).
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was reduced in plasma and platelets 
following treatment with the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma and THERAFLEX UV-Platelets 
systems, to the limit of detection, respectively. These PI technologies could 
therefore be an effective option to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted 
emerging pathogens. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
375,"OBJECTIVE: The main concern about measuring the concentration of rivaroxaban by 
anti-Xa assay in some laboratories is the lack of a commercial specific 
calibrator in emergencies. Therefore, this study aimed at providing a homemade 
anti-Xa calibrator and commercial low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anti-Xa 
calibrator.
METHODS: The anti-Xa plasma concentration of rivaroxaban was measured in 70 
patients using a commercial specific anti-Xa calibrator, a commercial LMWH 
anti-Xa calibrator, and a homemade anti-Xa calibrator.
RESULTS: We demonstrated a significant correlation and agreement (P < .001) 
between LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa and the commercial specific calibrator. A 
significant correlation (P < .001) was found between homemade calibrated anti-Xa 
made by normal pooled plasma and that calibrated with a commercial specific 
drug. The nonspecific homemade and LMWH calibrators had excellent agreement (P < 
.001) and can be used interchangeably.
CONCLUSION: Our data showed that for estimating rivaroxaban concentrations, the 
LMWH calibrator could be used as an alternative calibrator in the anti-Xa assay."
376,"BACKGROUND: Data regarding risk factors for superficial thrombophlebitis (STP) 
cases presenting to a hospital is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate and stratify clinical and laboratory risk factors for 
STP.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case control study comparing patients 
presenting to the emergency department with STP and age- and gender-matched 
controls. We collected data on multiple risk factors and five blood indices.
RESULTS: The study comprised 151 patients and matched controls. Patients with 
STP were more likely to have varicose veins (43.7% vs. 5.3%, P < 0.001), recent 
immobilization (14.6% vs. 1.3%, P < 0.001), obesity (36.4% vs. 18.5%, P = 
0.001), a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or STP (27.2% vs. 0.7%, P < 
0.001), and inherited thrombophilia (9.3% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.002). Following 
multivariate analysis, all five risk factors remained significant, with a 
history of VTE or STP associated with the largest risk (odds ratio [OR] 35.7), 
followed by immobilization (OR 22.3), varicose veins (OR 12.1), inherited 
thrombophilia (OR 6.1), and obesity (OR 2.7). Mean platelet volume was higher 
(8.5 vs 7.9 fl, P = 0.003) in STP cases.
CONCLUSIONS: A history of VTE or STP, immobilization, varicose veins, inherited 
thrombophilia, and obesity serve as independent clinical risk factors for STP 
presenting to hospital."
377,"BACKGROUND: Vaginal hysterectomy (VH) and colpocleisis are both used for the 
treatment of advanced pelvic organ prolapse (POP).
OBJECTIVES: To compare short- and long-term outcomes of vaginal hysterectomy vs. 
colpocleisis for advanced POP.
METHODS: Hospital and outpatient charts of patients who underwent VH or 
colpocleisis at our institution between January 2006 and December 2015 were 
reviewed. Clinical data were obtained and analyzed.
RESULTS: In this study, 188 patients underwent VH and 32 patients underwent 
colpocleisis. The colpocleisis group was significantly older than the VH group 
(79.5 ± 4.5 vs. 69 ± 6.1 years respectively, P < 0.0001) and presented with 
significantly higher co-morbidity rates and a higher degree of POP. 
Perioperative blood loss was significantly lower (250 ± 7.6 ml vs. 300 ± 115 ml, 
P < 0.0001) and postoperative hospitalization was significantly shorter (2 ± 2.7 
vs. 3 ± 2.2 days, P = 0.015) among the colpocleisis group. None of the patients 
from the colpocleisis group required an indwelling urethral catheter after 
discharge, compared to 27.5% of the patients from the VH group (P = 0.001). 
Total postoperative complication rate was significantly lower among the 
colpocleisis group (25% vs. 31% P < 0.0001). Objective recurrence of POP was 
significantly more common among the VH group (7% vs. 0% and 21% vs. 0% for the 
anterior and posterior compartments, respectively, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Colpocleisis is associated with faster recovery, lower 
perioperative morbidity, and higher success rates than VH and should be 
considered for frail and elderly patients."
378,"BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) is routinely measured while triaging children 
presenting to the pediatric emergency department (PED).
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a medical clown shortens the time to acquire a 
BP measurement among children undergoing triage in the PED.
METHODS: The study comprised 133 children. Patients were assigned to one of two 
groups: with a medical clown or without a medical clown.
RESULTS: The presence of a medical clown led to a significantly shorter time to 
acquire a blood pressure measurement (60 ± 23 seconds vs. 81 ± 43.5 seconds, P < 
0.001. Clowns had a significant effect on shortening total triage length among 
children of Jewish ethnicity compared to Arab ethnicity (113 ± 353.6 seconds vs. 
154 ± 418 seconds, P = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Using medical clowns while measuring BP during triage when used in 
a culturally appropriate manner shortens time."
379,"BACKGROUND: APOE genotype strongly affects plasma lipid levels and risk for 
cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. Studies of apo-e allelic and APOE 
genotype frequencies among several populations have revealed interesting ethnic 
variations that might affect cardiovascular morbidity and cognition 
deterioration.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate apo-e allelic frequency among Israeli newborns based on 
known variances in apo-e allelic frequencies in different countries.
METHODS: We examined 498 consecutive neonates born at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical 
Center. Umbilical cord blood was sampled for genotyping and lipids. Birth 
weights were recorded. Demographics and parental risk factors for 
atherosclerosis were obtained from the mothers.
RESULTS: Most parents were native-born Israelis. Other countries of origin of 
grandparents were Morocco, Russia, and Iraq. The prevalence of APOE genotypes in 
Israel is APOE 2/2: 1.4%, APOE 2/3: 8.2%, APOE 3/3: 77.7%, and APOE 4/4: 11.8%. 
There were no associations of APOE genotype with parental country of origin. 
However, there was a tendency for APOE 3/4 to be more frequent in newborns of 
parents of Asian and African origin. Genotype 3/3 was more frequent in newborns 
whose parents came from Europe and America (78%) compared to those from Asia or 
Africa (69%).
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to determine risk factors such as APOE genotype for 
evaluation of premature atherosclerosis. Determining genetic and environmental 
risk factors may facilitate earlier treatment and prevent heart and brain 
atherosclerosis. APOE genotypes did not appear to affect total cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or 
triglyceride levels in newborns."
380,"Donor safety remains an important concern. We introduced preoperative 
bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in living donor hepatectomy, as it is a 
practical method for volemia assessment with the advantages of noninvasiveness, 
rapid processing, easy handling, and it is relatively inexpensive. We analyzed 
51 living donors who underwent right hemihepatectomy between July 2015 and May 
2022. The ratio of extracellular water:total body water (ECW/TBW; an index of 
volemic status) was measured. ECT/TBW &lt; 0.378 was correlated to central 
venous pressure (CVP) &lt; 5 mm Hg in a previous study and we used this value 
for personalized preoperative management. In the BIA group (n = 21), donors with 
ECW/TBW ≥ 0.378 (n = 12) required whole-day nothing by mouth (NPO), whereas 
those with ECW/TBW &lt; 0.378 (n = 9) required midnight NPO, similar to the 
control group (n = 30). In comparison with the control group, the BIA group had 
a significantly lower central venous pressure (p &lt; 0.001) from the start of 
surgery to the end of surgery, leading to a better surgical field grade (p = 
0.045) and decreased operative duration (240.5 ± 45.6 vs. 276.5 ± 54.0 min, p = 
0.016). A cleaner surgical field (surgical field grade 1) was significantly 
associated with decreased operative duration (p = 0.001) and estimated blood 
loss (p &lt; 0.001). Preoperative BIA was the only significant predictor of a 
cleaner surgical field (odds ratio, 6.914; 95% confidence interval, 
1.6985-28.191, p = 0.007). In conclusion, preoperative volemia assessment using 
BIA can improve operative outcomes by creating a favorable surgical environment 
in living donor hepatectomy."
381,"(1) Background: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a blood dyscrasia that 
accounts for about 20% of all leukemia cases. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
are used as first line treatment of CML. The 2019 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak raised new 
concerns for CML patients, such as whether CML increases the risk of contracting 
COVID-19, whether TKIs increase that risk, whether these drugs are safe to use 
during the infection, and whether any other hematologic parameters influence 
infection outcomes. (2) Methods: In our study we addressed these intriguing 
questions by using a retrospective analysis of 51 CML patients treated at the 
Ion Chiricuta Cancer Center, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Furthermore, we investigated 
the effects of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines in our CML patients treated 
with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. (3) Results: Our results have shown that 
hemoglobin level upon diagnosis of CML has been the only hematologic parameter 
correlated to the risk of contracting COVID-19 in our CML patients. (4) 
Conclusions: TKI treatment did not negatively influence COVID-19 risk or the 
response to the vaccine in our patients. The safety profile of the currently 
approved COVID-19 vaccines was similar to that of the general population."
382,"Personalized management of diseases by considering relevant patient features 
enables optimal treatment, instead of management according to an average 
patient. Precision management of hypertension is important, because both 
susceptibility to complications and response to treatment vary between 
individuals. While the use of genomic and proteomic personal features for 
widespread precision hypertension management is not practical, other features, 
such as age, ethnicity, and cardiovascular diseases, have been utilized in 
guidelines for hypertension management. In precision medicine, more 
blood-pressure-related clinical and physiological characteristics in the 
patient's profile can be utilized for the determination of the threshold of 
hypertension and optimal treatment. Several non-invasive and simple-to-use 
techniques for the measurement of hypertension-related physiological features 
are suggested for use in precision management of hypertension. In order to 
provide precise management of hypertension, accurate measurement of blood 
pressure is required, but the available non-invasive blood pressure measurement 
techniques, auscultatory sphygmomanometry and oscillometry, have inherent 
significant inaccuracy-either functional or technological-limiting the precision 
of personalized management of hypertension. A novel photoplethysmography-based 
technique for the measurement of systolic blood pressure that was recently found 
to be more accurate than the two available techniques can be utilized for more 
precise and personalized hypertension management."
383,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most devastating brain tumor and highly resistant to 
conventional chemotherapy. Herein, we introduce biomimetic nanosonosensitizer 
systems (MDNPs) combined with noninvasive ultrasound (US) actuation for 
orthotopic GBM-targeted delivery and sonodynamic-enhanced chemotherapy. MDNPs 
were fabricated with biodegradable and pH-sensitive polyglutamic acid (PGA) and 
the chemotherapeutic agent and sonosensitizer doxorubicin (DOX), camouflaged 
with human GBM U87 cell membranes. MDNPs presented homologous targeting 
accumulation and in vivo long-term circulation ability. They effectively passed 
through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under US assistance and reached the 
orthotopic GBM site. MDNPs exhibited controllable US-elicited sonodynamic effect 
by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS not only induced cancer cell 
apoptosis but also downregulated drug-resistance-related factors to disrupt 
chemoresistance and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy. The in vivo study of 
orthotopic GBM treatments further proved that MDNPs exhibited US-augmented 
synergistic antitumor efficacy and strongly prolonged the survival rate of mice. 
The use of low-dose DOX and the safety of US enabled repeated treatment (4 
times) without obvious cardiotoxicity. This effective and safe US-enhanced 
chemotherapy strategy with the advantages of noninvasive brain delivery and high 
drug sensitivity holds great promise for deep-seated and drug-resistant tumors."
384,"High blood concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) provoke various 
metabolic disorders and are associated with mammary tissue injury and decreased 
milk production in dairy cows. Nuciferine, an alkaloid found in Nelumbo nucifera 
leaves, has great potential for correcting lipid metabolism derangements and 
lipotoxicity. In this study, we evaluated the lipotoxicity induced by excessive 
NEFA in bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) and investigated whether 
nuciferine alleviates NEFA-induced lipotoxicity and the underlying molecular 
mechanisms. We found that excessive NEFA (1.2 and 2.4 mM) induced lipid 
accumulation, apoptosis, and migration ability impairment in bMECs, whereas 
nuciferine could ameliorate these disarrangements, as indicated by decreasing 
triglyceride content, protein abundance of SREBP-1c, cytoplasmic cytochrome c, 
and cleaved caspase-3 and increasing protein abundance of PPARα and migration 
ability. Moreover, nuciferine could reverse NEFA-induced LKB1/AMPK signaling 
inhibition, and the protective effect of nuciferine on lipotoxicity caused by 
NEFA was abrogated by AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin. Furthermore, transfection 
with LKB1 siRNA (si-LKB1) largely abolished the activation effect of nuciferine 
on AMPK. Overall, nuciferine can protect bMECs from excessive NEFA-induced lipid 
accumulation, apoptosis, and impaired migration by activating LKB1/AMPK 
signaling pathway."
385,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are accurate prognostic indicators and 
correlate with illness severity scores in critically ill dogs.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study from December 2016 to May 2017.
SETTING: ICU at a veterinary teaching hospital.
ANIMALS: Seventy-two client-owned dogs admitted to the ICU with CBCs and 
abbreviated and complete acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation 
(APPLEfast and APPLEfull ) scores were enrolled.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The NLR, PLR, APPLEfast , and APPLEfull scores 
were calculated for each patient on the day of admission. Patients were followed 
from admission to discharge, and diagnosis, survival, and length of 
hospitalization were recorded. The patient population was assessed as a whole 
and as subcategories of patients with neoplastic disease, infectious disease, 
sepsis, and severe hemorrhage. Dogs with nonseptic disease processes (n = 52) 
that died had a significantly higher median PLR (P = 0.04) of 441 (range: 
106-986) compared to those that survived with a median PLR of 217 (range: 
28.4-3225). The PLR was strongly predictive of ICU length of stay in dogs with 
severe hemorrhage (P = 0.03, Spearman's rho = 0.84). The NLR had a poor positive 
correlation with APPLEfull score (P = 0.04, Spearman's rho = 0.24), and PLR had 
a poor negative correlation with APPLEfast score (P = 0.02, Spearman's 
rho = -0.27).
CONCLUSIONS: The PLR correlated with ICU length of stay for patients with severe 
hemorrhage and with survival for patients with nonseptic disease processes. The 
PLR and NLR correlated with illness severity as measured by APPLE scores. Future 
studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further determine the merit of 
NLR and PLR as indicators of morbidity, mortality, and illness severity."
386,"BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Converging lines of evidence suggest that dysfunction 
of cortical GABAergic inhibitory interneurons is a core feature of psychosis. 
This dysfunction is thought to underlie neuroimaging abnormalities commonly 
found in patients with psychosis, particularly in the hippocampus. These include 
increases in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glutamatergic metabolite 
levels, and decreases in ligand binding to GABAA α5 receptors and to the 
synaptic density marker synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). However, direct 
links between inhibitory interneuron dysfunction and these neuroimaging readouts 
are yet to be established. Conditional deletion of a schizophrenia 
susceptibility gene, the tyrosine kinase receptor Erbb4, from cortical and 
hippocampal inhibitory interneurons leads to synaptic defects, and behavioral 
and cognitive phenotypes relevant to psychosis in mice.
STUDY DESIGN: Here, we investigated how this inhibitory interneuron disruption 
affects hippocampal in vivo neuroimaging readouts. Adult Erbb4 conditional 
mutant mice (Lhx6-Cre;Erbb4F/F, n = 12) and their wild-type littermates 
(Erbb4F/F, n = 12) were scanned in a 9.4T magnetic resonance scanner to quantify 
CBF and glutamatergic metabolite levels (glutamine, glutamate, GABA). 
Subsequently, we assessed GABAA receptors and SV2A density using quantitative 
autoradiography.
RESULTS: Erbb4 mutant mice showed significantly elevated ventral hippccampus CBF 
and glutamine levels, and decreased SV2A density across hippocampus sub-regions 
compared to wild-type littermates. No significant GABAA receptor density 
differences were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that specific disruption of cortical 
inhibitory interneurons in mice recapitulate some of the key neuroimaging 
findings in patients with psychosis, and link inhibitory interneuron deficits to 
non-invasive measures of brain function and neurochemistry that can be used 
across species."
387,"In this work, we design a bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator (BA-TENG) as a 
first-aid rescue for instant and robust wound sealing, and ultrasound-driven 
accelerated wound healing. This BA-TENG is fabricated with biocompatible 
materials, and integrates a flexible TENG as the top layer and bioadhesive as 
the bottom layer, resulting in effective electricity supply and strong 
sutureless sealing capability on wet tissues. When driven by ultrasound, BA-TENG 
can produce stable voltage of 1.50 V and current of 24.20 μA underwater. The ex 
vivo porcine colon organ models showed that BA-TENG sealed defects instantly (∼ 
5 s) with high interfacial toughness (∼ 150 J m-2 ), while the rat bleeding 
liver incision model confirmed that BA-TENG performed rapid wound closure and 
hemostasis, reducing the blood loss by 82%. When applied in living rats, BA-TENG 
not only sealed skin injuries immediately but also produced a strong electric 
field (E-field) of about 0.86 kV m-1 stimulated by ultrasound to accelerate skin 
wound healing significantly. The in vitro studies confirmed that these effects 
were attributed to the E-field-accelerated cell migration and proliferation. In 
addition, these TENG adhesives could be applied to not only wound treatment, 
nerve stimulation and regeneration, and charging batteries in implanted devices.

388,"BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a class of 
chemicals used in nearly all sectors of industry and many consumer products. 
Their resistance to degradation, however, means that PFAS are ubiquitous in the 
environment and bioaccumulate. PFAS exposure has also been linked to a variety 
of adverse health effects. Occupational PFAS exposure is of particular concern 
as research on PFAS exposure in worker populations has historically been limited 
and generally restricted to fluorochemical plant workers involved in PFAS 
production.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed scientific literature was 
conducted to investigate which worker populations may experience occupational 
exposure to PFAS. Serum PFAS levels reported in various occupations were 
analyzed and compared to serum PFAS levels published on the general public 
exposed to PFAS-contaminated drinking water and the study population of the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that professional ski waxers and firefighters 
may be exposed to several different PFAS at levels often similar to or higher 
than levels among fluorochemical plant workers and individuals in communities 
with PFAS-contaminated drinking water, and higher than levels in the general 
public. PFAS serum level data on other occupations were largely absent.
CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight a need for additional research on occupational 
PFAS exposures and concomitant environmental exposures in these populations. 
Research on exposure levels in occupations and industries known or suspected to 
utilize PFAS is critically needed to foster informed recommendations for 
exposure mitigation measures to protect workers from adverse health effects of 
PFAS exposure."
389,"For stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a high risk of recurrence, 
intensified adjuvant chemotherapy can improve overall survival. We aimed to 
develop a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation marker model for predicting 
the relapse risk of stage III CRC patients. Differentially methylated markers 
identified between 53 normal mucosa samples and 165 CRC tissue samples, as well 
as between plasma samples from 75 stage I/II (early-stage) CRC patients and 55 
stage IV (late-stage) CRC patients, were analyzed using Student's t-tests. The 
overlapping methylation markers shared by plasma and tissue samples were used to 
establish a methylation marker model to evaluate the tumor burden in the 
peripheral blood of CRC patients by using the random forest method. This model 
was verified in the validation cohort (n= 44) and then applied to predict 
recurrence risk in 50 stage III CRC patients and monitor the clinical disease 
course in serial samples from 4 CRC patients. We built a five-marker-based ctDNA 
methylation model that had high sensitivity (84.21%) and specificity (84%) in 
identifying late-stage CRC in a validation cohort containing 24 stage I/II CRC 
patients and 20 stage IV CRC patients. The model achieved high sensitivity 
(87.5%) and specificity (94.12%) in predicting tumor relapse in an independent 
cohort of 50 stage III CRC patients and could be an independent recurrence risk 
factor for stage III patients (HR, 60.4; 95% CI: 7.68-397; P = 9.73e-5). 
Analysis of serial blood samples of CRC showed that the model could monitor 
disease relapse earlier than imaging examination and serum carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA) and so may provide an opportunity for the early adjustment of 
therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the model could potentially monitor the 
clinical course and treatment response dynamically. This article is protected by

390,"OBJECTIVE: To introduce the Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation 
(RECOVER) CPR registry and report cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and CPR event 
data collected to date.
DESIGN: International, multi-institutional veterinary CPR registry data report.
SETTING: Veterinary private practice and university teaching hospitals.
ANIMALS: Data from 514 dogs and 195 cats undergoing CPR entered in the RECOVER 
CPR registry between February 2016 and November 2021.
INTERVENTIONS: The RECOVER CPR registry is an online medical database created 
for standardized collection of hospital, animal, arrest, and outcome information 
on dogs and cats undergoing CPR. Data were collected according to the veterinary 
Utstein-style guidelines for standardized reporting of in-hospital CPR in dogs 
and cats. Case records were downloaded, duplicate and incomplete cases were 
removed, and summary descriptive data were reported.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen hospitals in the United States, Europe, 
and Australia contributed data on 709 CPR events to the registry. One hundred 
and forty-two (28%) dogs and 58 (30%) cats attained return of spontaneous 
circulation (ROSC), 62 (12%) dogs and 25 (13%) cats had ROSC >20 minutes, and 14 
(3%) dogs and 4 (2%) cats survived to hospital discharge. The reason for CPR 
discontinuation was reported as owner choice in 321 cases (63%). The most common 
suspected causes for CPA were respiratory failure (n = 142, 20%), heart failure 
(n = 86, 12%), and hemorrhage (n = 76, 11%).
CONCLUSION: The RECOVER CPR registry contains the first multicenter data set on 
small animal CPR. It confirms poor outcomes associated with CPA, emphasizing the 
need for large-sized studies to gain adequate information on characteristics 
associated with favorable outcomes."
391,"Recently, the therapeutic armamentarium against Sars-CoV-2 has been enriched 
with oral antivirals that can be used in the early phases of covid-19. Real-life 
data on their efficacy in multiple myeloma (Mm) outpatients with 
mild-to-moderate covid-19 are lacking. We described the clinical outcomes at 30 
days in Mm subjects with covid-19 treated with oral antivirals. Nirmatrelvir/r 
was prescribed in 10 subjects whereas molnupiravir in 5. Despite two 
hospitalizations were reported, we did not observe deaths due to covid-19 in 
this vulnerable group. Our preliminary observations reinforce the early use of 
oral antivirals as a useful means to contain severe covid-19 in high-risk 
patients such as Mm individuals characterized by an impaired immune response."

395,"A 77-year-old Asian female with a history of left orbit exenteration and 
lid-sparing reconstruction for recurrent sebaceous carcinoma presented with 
fluid-like sensation of the left orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
demonstrated bright T2 signal and a cyst-like cavity within the exenterated 
orbit. Decision was made to proceed with surgical exploration and excision. A 
calcified, bone-like cavity was encountered intraoperatively and removed. 
Histopathology revealed dense fibrous connective tissue with areas of 
calcification without osseous metaplasia, suggestive of retained blood in the

396,"BACKGROUND: Manufacturers of point-of-care (POC) analyzers recommend immediate 
processing and anaerobic collection of blood samples. However, it is not 
uncommon for clinical scenarios to result in delayed sample processing or room 
air exposure that could impact the test results.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of time delay and sample storage method on 
key POC analytes in canine venous blood samples processed with an Element POC 
analyzer.
METHODS: Blood gas analysis was performed on venous blood samples at times 0 
(T0), 15, 30, and 60 minutes after sampling using three different storage 
methods: preheparinized plastic syringes and two different lithium heparin 
tubes. To determine clinical relevance, results were compared with allowable 
total error of the respective parameter. Significance was set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Significant differences between the three storage methods at baseline 
were found for partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2 ), partial pressure of 
oxygen (PO2 ), base excess, and total hemoglobin. No significant differences up 
to T60 were found within collection methods for actual bicarbonate (HCO3 - ), 
base excess, sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium (iCa), glucose, and 
BUN. Significant differences within collection methods were found after T0 for 
creatinine, after 15 minutes for lactate, and after 30 minutes for pH and 
hematocrit. No significant differences were found for PO2 in samples stored in 
preheparinized plastic syringes at any time point.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HCO3 - , sodium, potassium, chloride, 
iCa, glucose, and BUN are comparable within the three storage methods for up to 
60 minutes after sampling without resulting in clinically relevant changes."
397,"Acne fulminans (AF) is an uncommon variant of inflammatory acne with abrupt

associated with systemic symptoms. Paradoxical adverse reactions to tumor 
necrosis (TNF)-alpha inhibitors have been reported, and rare cutaneous 
complications include pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet syndrome-like hypersensitivity 
eruptions, and pustular folliculitis. We report an unusual case of AF in a 
patient with Crohn disease that worsened with doses of adalimumab, which is 
considered a second-line treatment for AF. This case highlights that acneiform 
eruptions may be an underreported paradoxical adverse reaction to anti-TNF alpha 
therapy."
398,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to protect against fatty 
liver diseases, but the mechanism is still not clear. Menstrual blood-derived 
endometrial stem cells (MenSCs) are a substantial population of MSCs that can be 
obtained in a noninvasive manner. In the present study, we investigated the 
therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of MenSC transplantation in mouse 
models of diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The results 
revealed that MenSCs markedly promoted hepatic glycogen storage and attenuated 
lipid accumulation after transplantation. We further identified Rnf186 as a 
novel regulator involved in MenSC-based therapy for NAFLD mice. Rnf186 
deficiency substantially inhibited high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and 
abnormal hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in mice. Mechanistically, Rnf186 
regulated glucose and lipid metabolism through the AMPK-mTOR pathway. More 
importantly, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is identified as the key functional 
cytokine secreted by MenSCs and decreases the expression of hepatic Rnf186. HGF 
deficient MenSCs can't attenuate glucose and lipid accumulation after 
transplantation in NAFLD mice. Collectively, our results provide preliminary 
evidence for the protective roles of HGF secreted by MenSCs in fatty liver 
diseases through downregulation of hepatic Rnf186 and suggest that MenSCs or 
Rnf186 may be an alternative therapeutic approach/target for the treatment of 
NAFLD."
399,"Autophagy plays works by degrading misfolded proteins and dysfunctional 
organelles and maintains intracellular homeostasis. Apelin-13 has been 
investigated as an agent that might protect the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from 
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this study, we examined whether 
apelin-13 protects cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, important 
components of the BBB, from I/R injury by regulating autophagy. To mimic I/R 
injury, the mouse cerebral microvascular endothelia l cell line bEnd 3 undergoes 
the process of oxygen and glucose deprivation and re feeding in the process of 
culture. Cell viability was detected using a commercial kit, and cell migration 
was monitored by in vitro scratch assay. The tight junction (TJ) proteins ZO-1 
and occludin; the autophagy markers LC3 II, beclin 1, and p62; and components of 
the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway were detected by Western blotting and 
immunofluorescence. To confirm the role of autophagy in OGD/R and the protective 
effect of apelin-13, we treated the cells with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a 
pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Our results demonstrated that OGD/R 
increased autophagic activity but decreased viability, abundance of TJs, and 
migration. Viability and TJ abundance were further reduced when the OGD/R group 
was treated with 3-MA. These results indicated that bEnd.3 upregulates autophagy 
to ameliorate the effects of OGD/R injury on viability and TJs, but that the 
autophagy induced by OGD/R alone is not sufficient to protect against the effect 
on cell migration. Treatment of OGD/R samples with apelin-13 markedly increased 
viability, TJ abundance, and migration, as well as autophagic activity, whereas 
3-MA inhibited this increase, suggesting that apelin-13 exerted its protective 
effects by upregulating autophagy."
400,"Emergence of various circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) promotes 
the identification of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines and broadly neutralizing 
antibodies (bNAbs). Here, to characterize monoclonal antibodies cross-reactive 
against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and to search the criterion for bNAbs 
against all emerging SARS-CoV-2, we isolated several SARS-CoV-1-cross-reactive 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from a wildtype SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donor. 
These antibodies showed broad binding capacity and cross-neutralizing potency 
against various SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 
(Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), but failed to efficiently neutralize Omicron 
variant and its sublineages. Structural analysis revealed how Omicron 
sublineages, but not other VOCs, efficiently evade an antibody family 
cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-1 through their escape mutations. Further 
evaluation of a series of SARS-CoV-1/2-cross-reactive bNAbs showed a negative 
correlation between the neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-1 and 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Together, these results suggest the necessity of 
using cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron as criteria 
for rational design and development of potent pan-sarbecovirus vaccines and 
bNAbs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
401,"Sulfur mustard (SM) is a chemical warfare agent with well-known severe toxic 
effects and may cause long-term debilitating injuries. We aimed to evaluate 
aging and longevity in Iranian SM-exposed survivors using some endocrine and 
molecular biomarkers for the first time. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 
prolactin (PRL), cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) were 
measured in 289 male SM-veterans and 66 age-matched males using the ELISA 
method. Leukocyte Telomere Length (LTL) measurement and p16INK4a expression were 
measured in the peripheral blood leukocytes of 55 males who were exposed to SM. 
We found a significantly lower serum DHEAS level and higher serum PRL level in 
SM-exposed groups (without any related to the severity of lung injuries) 
compared to healthy controls, but no significant difference in serum levels of 
cortisol, testosterone, and LH. The molar ratio of DHEAS/cortisol was 
significantly higher in controls compared to the SM-exposed individuals 
especially those with severe lung damage. Some biological parameters of 
allostatic load score such as DHEAS and DHEAS/cortisol ratio significantly 
decreased long-term after the SM exposure. Additionally, we found that LTL was 
shorter in SM-exposed veterans rather than unexposed controls while p16INK4a 
gene expression significantly increased in these groups. It seems that DHEAS, 
DHEAS/cortisol ratio, LTL, and p16INK4a gene expression have changed 
significantly in favor of cellular senescence in SM-exposed patients. Therefore, 
it seems that SM exposure increases biological age compared to chronological age 
in SM-exposed survivors."
402,"OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events are emerging as 
frequent complications in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, there is 
insufficient data regarding epidemiology, risk factors and impact on outcomes. 
The optimal approach to balance risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage remains 
unclear. This retrospective single-center study in AML patients undergoing 
induction chemotherapy between 2007-2018 assessed incidence, risk factors, 
features and outcomes of early-onset VTE.
RESULTS: 423 patients (median age 59 years) were enrolled. VTE was diagnosed in 
31 patients (7.3 %) within 3 months of admission. The median time to VTE was 
3 days. Non-central venous catheter (CVC)-related VTE occurred in 19 patients 
(61 %). Main risk factor for VTE was leukocytosis at admission, independent of 
platelet counts/INR. Four patients (13 %) exhibited VTE recurrence. No deaths 
directly related to VTE or major bleeding events associated with 
platelet-adjusted anticoagulation in patients with VTE were recorded. There was 
no clear impact of VTE on one-year overall survival, however, non-CVC-related 
VTE may be associated with adverse outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset VTE is a common complication in newly diagnosed AML 
patients admitted for induction chemotherapy. Leukocytosis is an independent VTE 
risk factor. The potentially adverse impact of non-CVC-related VTE merits 
further study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
403,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated mental disorders have been attributed to 
the excessive accumulation of hemodialysis-resistant indoxyl-3-sulfate (I3S) in 
the brain. I3S not only induces oxidative stress but is also a potent endogenous 
agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Here, we investigated the role 
of AhR in CKD-induced brain disorders using a 5/6 nephrectomy-induced CKD mouse 
model, which showed increased I3S concentration in both blood and brain, anxiety 
and impaired novelty recognition, and AhR activation in the anterior cortex. 
GFAP+ reactive astrocytes were increased accompanied with the reduction of 
glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) on perineuronal astrocytic processes (PAPs) in 
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in CKD mice, and these alterations were 
attenuated in both neural lineage-specific and astrocyte-specific Ahr 
conditional knockout mice (nAhrCKO and aAhrCKO). By using chronic I3S treatment 
in primary astrocytes and glia-neuron (GN) mix cultures to mimic the CKD brain 
microenvironment, we also found significant reduction of GLT1 expression and 
activity in an AhR-dependent manner. Chronic I3S treatment induced AhR-dependent 
pro-oxidant Nox1 and AhR-independent anti-oxidant HO-1 expressions. Notably, AhR 
mediates chronic I3S-induced neuronal activity enhancement and synaptotoxicity 
in GN mix, not neuron-enriched cortical culture. In CKD mice, neuronal activity 
enhancement was observed in ACC and hippocampal CA1, and these responses were 
abrogated by both nAhrCKO and aAhrCKO. Finally, intranasal AhR antagonist 
CH-223191 administration significantly ameliorated the GLT1/PAPs reduction, 
increase in c-Fos+ neurons, and memory impairment in the CKD mice. Thus, 
astrocytic AhR plays a crucial role in the CKD-induced disturbance of 
neuron-astrocyte interaction and mental disorders."
404,"OBJECTIVES: Fetal blood circulation may be modified in congenital heart disease 
(CHD). This retrospective analysis was performed to study whether the type of 
CHD is associated with specific placental pathology.
METHODS: 3 types of CHD based on presumed proportion of placental and systemic 
blood distribution in fetal circulation were analyzed: Group 1: 89 cases with 
low placental blood content (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, transposition of 
great arteries, coarctation of aorta), Group 2: 71 placentas with intermediate 
placental and systemic blood content due to increased intracardiac blood mixing 
(tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, double inlet/outlet ventricle), and 
Group 3: 24 placentas with high placental blood content (tricuspid or pulmonary 
atresia, Ebstein anomaly). Frequencies of 27 independent clinical and 47 
placental phenotypes of 184 placentas in those three groups were statistically 
compared.
RESULTS: The most advanced gestational age at delivery, and large vessel 
(global) fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM) were most common in Group 1, while 
macerated stillbirths, neonatal mortality, abnormal amniotic fluid volume 
(oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios), other congenital anomalies, distal villous 
lesions of FVM, placental edema and amnion nodosum were most common in Groups 2 
and 3, although the frequencies of placental lesions were statistically not 
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Left heart obstructive lesions potentially associated with brain 
maldevelopment show increase in lesions of global FVM (in aggregate and 
individually fetal vascular ectasia, stem vessel obliteration and intramural 
fibrin deposition) as may be seen in umbilical cord compromise. CHD with 
increased intracardiac blood mixing or with right heart defects is associated 
with average preterm gestational age at delivery and placental lesions of distal 
villous FVM, villous edema and amnion nodosum."
405,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are contingent upon clinical manifestations 
and serological markers. However, researchers are struggling to find biomarkers 
with higher sensitivity and specificity. DNA methylation has been the most 
studied epigenetic feature in SLE. So, in this study, we performed a systematic 
review of studies about DNA methylation alterations in SLE patients compared to 
healthy controls.
METHODS: By searching PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to July 2022, all 
case-control studies in which DNA methylation of specific genes was assessed by 
a non-high-throughput technique and passed the quality of bias assessment were 
included.
RESULTS: In total, 44 eligible studies underwent a data extraction process. In 
all, 3471 SLE patients and 1028 healthy individuals were included. Among the 
studies that reported the patients' gender (n = 2853), 89.41% were female and 
10.59% were male. Forty studies have been conducted on adult patients. The 
number of works on fractionated and unfractionated blood cells was almost equal. 
In this regard, 22 studies were conducted on whole blood or peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells and two studies on unfractionated white blood cells. Sorted 
blood cells were biological sources in 20 studies. The most investigated gene 
was IFI44L. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic power of methylation levels 
were only reported for IFI44L in five studies. The most employed methylation 
profiling method was bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction. The 
correlation between methylation patterns and clinical parameters was explored in 
22 studies, which of them 16 publications displayed a remarkable association 
between DNA methylation status and clinical indices.
CONCLUSIONS: The methylation status of some genes especially IFI44L, FOXP3, and 
MX1 has been suggested as promising SLE biomarkers. However, given the 
conflicting findings between studies because of potential confounders such as 
different sample types, methylation profiling methods, and ethnicity as well as 
shared DNA methylation patterns of SLE and other autoimmune diseases, DNA 
methylation biomarkers are currently not reliable diagnostic biomarkers and do 
not represent surrogate markers of SLE disease activity. Future investigations 
on a larger scale with the discarding of limitations of previous studies would 
probably lead to a consensus."
406,"Studies prior to next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed that the frequent 
indolent course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is related to most cells 
remaining quiescent in the G0 -G1 cell cycle phase, due to the expression of 
dysregulated cyclin genes. Of note, the activating nature of the NOTCH1 mutation 
in T lymphoblastic leukaemia also drives the dysregulation of cell cycle genes. 
Our goal was to comprehensively revisit the cell cycle in NOTCH1-mutated CLL 
(NOTCH1MUT ) to test for potential therapeutic targets. Among 378 NGS-annotated 
CLL cases, NOTCH1MUT cells displayed a unique transcriptome profile of G0 -G1 
cell cycle components, with an overexpression of early-phase effectors, reaching 
a 38-, 27- and ninefold change increase for the complex elements CCND3, CDK4 and 
CDK6, respectively. This NOTCH1MUT cells' profile was related to more cells 
traversing through the cell cycle. In-vitro targeted inhibition of NOTCH1 
gamma-secretase and CDK4/6 reversed the distribution of cells through the cycle 
phases and enhanced the killing of NOTCH1MUT CLL cells, suggesting new 
therapeutic approaches."
407,"BACKGROUND: A recent survey of pediatric hematology oncology (PHO) physicians 
identified that a majority believe fellows are struggling to find jobs that 
align with their goals. Career development for trainees has historically been 
home institution-specific, limiting fellows' exposures to career path 
possibilities. The ""virtual-Symposium of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology of New 
York (v-SYMPHONY)"" instituted a tristate Career Development Series for PHO 
trainees to better address their needs and increase awareness of the variety of 
PHO career opportunities.
PROCEDURE: The v-SYMPHONY Career Development Series incorporated three sessions: 
(a) institutional perspective, (b) individual perspectives, and (c) nuts and 
bolts of job search. Pre- and post-series surveys were administered to 
participants to measure impact.
RESULTS: Forty-one fellows registered for the series and completed a pre-survey. 
Over half (54%) were in their third or later year of fellowship. Careers with a 
clinical focus were the most commonly desired career path (59%). Most had 
received career development advice only from faculty within their institutions 
(90%). Post-surveys were completed by 11 PHO fellows. Overall, 100% of 
respondents reported benefiting from the career sessions and recommended the 
series should be repeated annually. Over 90% learned new information to prepare 
for the job search.
CONCLUSIONS: The v-SYMPHONY Career Development Series for PHO fellows across 
multiple institutions was established and was extremely well received by its 
participants. PHO fellows agreed that these sessions were beneficial in helping 
prepare them for the job search process. An annual regional Career Development 
Series is feasible and is strongly suggested to support PHO fellows."
408,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the leading cause 
of pediatric cancer mortality. Research addressing genomic biomarkers and 
clinical outcomes is needed to inform therapeutic decision-making.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients (age <21) 
diagnosed with a primary CNS tumor at four upstate New York hospitals from 2008 
to 2021. Clinical and histopathologic data were identified from each patient, 
including genomic analysis of somatic mutations and tumor mutational burden 
(TMB) where available. These variables were each compared with overall survival 
using Cox regression analyses. Multivariable analysis was conducted to identify 
patient characteristics that may independently predict survival.
RESULTS: We identified 119 patients. Common tumor types included low-grade 
glioma (N = 51), high-grade glioma (N = 29), and medulloblastoma (N = 11). 
Common driver mutations included TP53 inactivation (N = 16), BRAF-KIAA1549 
fusion (N = 16), FGFR1 amplification (N = 12), BRAF V600E mutation (N = 12), NF1 
loss (N = 12), and H3F3A K28M mutation (N = 6). Median TMB was one 
mutation/megabase (mut/Mb, range = 0-132). Overall survival was 79.9%. Variables 
associated with poorer survival on univariable analysis were higher TMB 
(p = .002, HR 4.97), high-grade tumors (p = .009, HR 84.3), and high-grade 
glioma histology (p = .021, HR 3.14). Multivariable analyses further identified 
TMB (p = .011, HR 4.46) and high-grade histology (p = .015, HR 5.28) as 
independently predictive of worse survival. Tumor progression was more common in 
high-TMB (N = 15, 44%) than in low-TMB tumors (N = 19, 35%).
CONCLUSIONS: High TMB is correlated with higher rates of progression and death 
as compared to low-TMB tumors. These findings may help identify patients who may 
benefit from alternative treatments, such as immunotherapies."
409,"AIMS: The amount and pattern of cigarette and alcohol consumption are highly 
associated with cardiovascular risk. The aim of the present study was the 
assessment of changes in arterial stiffness and classical risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease after alcohol withdrawal and detoxification in persons 
with alcohol use disorder.
METHODS: Two hundred and forty-one individuals (men and women) participated in 
the investigation. The photoplethysmographic method was applied to assess 
arterial stiffness in three stages within 6 weeks. Participants were divided 
into subgroups based on age and sex. Analyses were performed using analysis of 
variance with repeated measures.
RESULTS: Different variations in time of stiffness index (SI) and reflection 
index (RI) values were recorded. Some increases in triglycerides, total 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and a decrease in high-density lipoproteins 
were observed in all analyzed groups. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(DP) changed significantly during the 3 weeks of the study only in a group of 
younger men. The SI is correlated with age and gender. No correlation of RI with 
sex was found; however, RI was strongly correlated with age, pulse and DP.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented study shows that some groups of patients (older women 
and younger men) after detoxification may be particularly vulnerable to vascular 
system disorders, i.e. arterial stiffness, making it suggested to include 
additional observation during therapy."
410,"Hypopituitarism refers to insufficiency of one or more hormones of the pituitary 
and can be due to myriad causes. The clinical and radiological spectrum of the 
condition is heterogeneous, based on the age, gender, clinical setting and/or 
other past medical history. Hypopituitarism includes central hypocortisolism, 
hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and growth hormone deficiency. Both hypo- and 
hyperprolactinemia can be associated with hypopituitarism, with low prolactin 
signifying more extensive pituitary damage. Posterior pituitary insufficiency 
(arginine vasopressin deficiency), occurs either in isolation or with anterior 
pituitary hormone deficiency. Clinical symptomatology of hypopituitarism is 
usually non-specific and insidious in onset and progression. Overall, the most 
common cause of hypopituitarism is a pituitary adenoma and/or its management 
(surgery, radiotherapy, pharmacotherapy or a combination of these). However, it 
is this subset of patients which is more likely to be identified and managed 
timely, possibly alleviating the premature mortality associated with 
hypopituitarism. What is more challenging is the recognition of hypopituitarism 
in less common settings, which may be either due to direct involvement of the 
pituitary (infection, traumatic brain injury, or infiltrative causes) or 
indirectly as a consequence of the primary process (thalassemia, vasculotoxic 
snakebite, subarachnoid hemorrhage). These entities are often under-recognised, 
and increased awareness can help in greater recognition of the problem burden. 
Further, pituitary insufficiency in most of these settings is dynamic, which may 
progress, or rarely, show recovery of function. This renders complexity to the 
problem, but makes it even more imperative to suspect, screen and appropriately 
manage patients with less common causes of hypopituitarism."
411,"OBJECTIVE: Fluid extravasation is a potentially dangerous complication 
associated with shoulder arthroscopy. Most relevant studies have involved 
respiratory system, while the primary purpose was to reveal the effects of the 
fluid extravasation on cardiovascular system and postoperative function.
METHODS: The clinical data of 92 patients was retrospective analyzed, in which 
84 cases with rotator cuff injury, three cases with shoulder instability, three 
cases with fractures of the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and two cases 
with frozen shoulder. All the patients were undergoing shoulder arthroscopy. The 
relationship between the basic information of the patients and cardiac index 
(CI) or pulse pressure variation (PPV) were evaluated by linear regression 
analysis. The change of CI or PPV at different states were evaluated by the 
one-way analysis of variance. The liquid retention (TR) and postoperative 
clinical outcomes was analyzed using linear regression.
RESULTS: The preoperative CI was affected by anesthesia status and body 
position, while PPV was not affected. Multivariate mixed-effects model analysis 
of CI found that there was a statistically significant difference in groups of 
older than 55 years old and those with obesity (BMI > 24). After the operation, 
the retention of irrigation fluid significantly influenced the circumference of 
the deltoid (P < 0.001 (95%CI: [0.30, 1.00])), but not on the circumference of 
the deltoid, neck, and arm. The multivariate analysis of the American Shoulder 
and Elbow Surgery (ASES) scores at 3 and 6 months after surgery showed that the 
fluid retention volume was correlated with the ASES score at 3 months after 
surgery, especially when the retention volume was greater than 2 L (P = 0.001 
(95%). %CI: [-12.49, -3.22]).
CONCLUSION: The retention of irrigation fluid after shoulder arthroscopic 
surgery causes swelling of local limbs, and has an effect on peripheral blood 
vessels, which is mainly reflected in its influence on PPV and the postoperative 
function. Therefore, surgeons need to improve their surgical technique, shorten 
the operation time and reduce fluid retention."
412,"OBJECTIVES: The transtibial pull-out repair (TP) is a relatively new method for 
treating meniscal root tear; however, the clinical evaluation of its healing 
effect remains controversial. Due to ethical constraints and limitations of 
imaging techniques in humans, here we dynamically observe the healing effects of 
TP and TP with platelet-rich plasma gel (PRG) at the histological level using an 
animal model.
METHODS: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and PRG of rabbits were prepared. 
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) 
levels in PRP and PRG were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. A rabbit model of anterior horn tear of the medial meniscus and TP 
surgery were created. PRG was injected between the anterior horn of the medial 
meniscus and the tibial tunnel. Rabbits were divided into three groups: the 
anterior horn tear group (Tear group), the anterior horn tear + TP group (TP 
group), and the anterior horn tear + TP + PRG group (TP + PRG group). The 
healing effect was observed dynamically using histopathological studies and 
biomechanical experiments.
RESULTS: The platelet content in PRP significantly increased to approximately 
4.57 times that of whole blood. PDGF and TGF-β1 concentrations in PRG increased 
to 2.46 and 4.15 times those in PRP, respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 
and Masson staining showed that the number of inflammatory cells in healing 
tissue decreased and the collagen fibers significantly increased in TP and 
TP + PRG groups at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively compared to those in Tear 
group. Neatly arranged, interlaced, and dense collagen fibers were found between 
the anterior horn and bone at 12 weeks. H&E and toluidine blue staining showed 
that the injury to the femoral condyle cartilage was alleviated. The healing 
performance in TP + PRG group was better and faster than that in TP group. The 
maximum tensile fracture strength of the meniscus progressively increased at 8 
and 12 weeks postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior horn injury of the medial meniscus in rabbits can be 
repaired using the TP technique, and the addition of autologous PRG to the bone 
tunnel promotes early healing of the meniscus and bone postoperatively. 
Meanwhile, both treatments can reduce the secondary damage to the cartilage due 
to osteoarthritis."
413,"CONTEXT: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions (CSIIs) and continuous 
glucose monitors (CGMs) have revolutionized the management of diabetes mellitus 
(DM). Over the last two decades the development of advanced, small, and 
user-friendly technology has progressed substantially, essentially closing the 
loop in the fasting and post-absorptive state, nearing the promise of an 
artificial pancreas. The momentum was mostly driven by the diabetes community 
itself, to improve its health and quality of life.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Literature regarding CSII and CGM was reviewed.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Management of DM aims to regulate blood glucose to prevent 
long term micro and macrovascular complications. CSIIs combined with CGMs 
provide an integrated system to maintain tight glycemic control in a safe and 
uninterrupted fashion, while minimizing hypoglycemic events. Recent advances 
have allowed to 'close the loop' by better mimicking endogenous insulin 
secretion and glucose level regulation. Evidence supports sustained improvement 
in glycemic control with reduced episodes of hypoglycemia using these systems, 
while improving quality of life. Ongoing work in delivery algorithms with or 
without counterregulatory hormones will allow for further layers of regulation 
of the artificial pancreas.
CONCLUSION: Ongoing efforts to develop an artificial pancreas have created 
effective tools to improve the management of DM. CSIIs and CGMs are useful in 
diverse populations ranging from children to the elderly, as well as in various 
clinical contexts. Individually and more so together, these have had a 
tremendous impact in the management of DM, while avoiding treatment fatigue. 
However, cost and accessibility are still a hindrance to its wider application."
414,"OBJECTIVES: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) with prognosis in various 
infectious diseases. For fractured patients admitted to the intensive care units 
(ICU), an accurate and fast appraisal is essential. To investigate the 
association between RDW and prognosis in fractured patients admitted to the ICU 
utilizing the MIMIC-III database.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort from the MIMIC III database from 2001 and 2012 
was constructed. RDW and other information were collected with in-hospital 
mortality as the primary outcome and 90-day mortality and hospital and intensive 
care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) as secondary outcomes. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression models with propensity score inverse 
probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to investigate the 
prognostic value of RDW. A nomogram was built with significant prognostic 
factors to predict in-hospital mortality, and the performance of the nomogram 
was evaluated and compared with other severity assessment scores. Subgroup 
analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 2721 fracture patients admitted to the ICU were identified. 
After IPTW, the group with higher RDW was significantly associated with elevated 
in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.19-2.37), 90-day mortality (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04-1.86), prolonged hospital 
LOS (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03-1.50), and ICU LOS significantly (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 
1.05-1.53) in the multivariate logistics model. The nomogram showed optimal 
discriminative ability and predictive accuracy with an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.77.
CONCLUSION: RDW independently predicted in-hospital mortality, 90-day mortality, 
and hospital and ICU LOS in fractured patients admitted to ICU. The nomogram 
including RDW could also be a promising tool with potential clinical benefits."
415,"INTRODUCTION: NHS Lothian policy has recently changed to avoid first-line use of 
trimethoprim for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in patients with 
risk factors for trimethoprim resistance, in line with national guidance. This 
study aimed to identify risk factors for antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia 
coli bacteraemia related to UTI.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 687 patients with E. coli bacteraemia 
related to UTI in NHS Lothian from 01/02/18 to 29/02/20 was undertaken. 
Demographics and comorbidities were collected from electronic patient records. 
Community prescribing and microbiology data were collected from the prescribing 
information system and Apex. Univariate and multivariate analysis was undertaken 
using RStudio to analyse trimethoprim, gentamicin and multi-drug resistance 
(MDR).
RESULTS: Trimethoprim resistance was present in 282/687(41%) of blood culture 
isolates. MDR was present in 278/687(40.5%) isolates. Previous urinary 
trimethoprim resistant E. coli was a significant risk factor for both 
trimethoprim resistance (OR 9.44, 95%CI 5.83-15.9) and MDR (OR 4.81, 95%CI 
3.17-7.43) on multivariate modelling. Trimethoprim prescription (OR 2.10, 95% CI 
1.33-3.34) and the number of community antibiotic courses (OR 1.19, 95%CI 
1.06-1.35) were additional risk factors for trimethoprim resistance. Multiple 
independent risk factors were also identified for trimethoprim resistance, MDR 
and gentamicin resistance.
DISCUSSION: This study showed a high prevalence of trimethoprim resistance and 
MDR in patients with E. coli bacteraemia related to UTI. This supports the 
withdrawal of trimethoprim from first-line treatment of UTIs in patients with 
risk factors for trimethoprim resistance. It has also identified risk factors 
for MDR in E. coli bacteraemia."
416,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects the world's aging population, is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disease requiring markers or tools to accurately 
and easily diagnose and monitor the process accurately and easily.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, serum Sirtuin-1(SIRT-1), High Mobility Group Box 1 
(HMGB1), Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR4), Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB), 
Interleukine-6 (IL-6), Amyloid βeta-42 (Aβ-42), and p-tau181 levels in patients 
diagnosed with AD according to NINCS-ADRA criteria were studied. We investigated 
the inflammatory pathways that lead to progressive neuronal loss and highlight 
their possible relationship with dementia severity in the systemic circulation.
METHODS: Patients over 60 years of age were grouped according to their Standard 
Mini Mental Test results, MRI, and/or Fludeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography or according to their CT findings as Control n:20; AD n:32; Vascular 
Dementia (VD) n:17; AD + VD; n=21. Complete blood count, Glucose, Vitamin B12, 
Folic Acid, Enzymes, Urea, Creatinine, Electrolytes, Bilirubin, and Thyroid 
Function tests were evaluated. ELISA was used for the analysis of serum SIRT1, 
HMGB1, TLR4, NF-kB, IL-6, Aβ-42, and p-tau181 levels.
RESULTS: Levels of serum Aβ-42, SIRT1, HMGB1, and IL-6 were significantly higher 
(p˂0.001, p<0.01, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively), and TLR4 levels were 
significantly lower (p˂0.001) in the dementia group than in the control group. 
No significant difference was observed between dementia and control groups for 
serum NF-kB and p-tau181 levels.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the levels of the Aβ42, SIRT 1, HMGB1, and 
TLR4 pathways are altered in AD and VD. SIRT 1 activity plays an important role 
in the inflammatory pathway of dementia development, particularly in AD."
417,"BACKGROUND Carney complex (CNC) is a rare multiple neoplasia syndrome with 
autosomal dominant inheritance. CNC is frequently misdiagnosed owing to its 
diverse clinical characteristics. We reported the case of a 14-year-old Saudi 
boy with a history of gynecomastia, Cushing syndrome, large-cell calcifying 
Sertoli cell tumor of the testis, and CNC. CASE REPORT The patient was referred 
to the pediatric endocrine clinic for evaluation of bilateral slow progressing 
gynecomastia for 1-year duration. His clinical examination revealed lentigenes, 
bilateral diffuse breast enlargement (consistent with Tanner stage III), and 
asymmetrical testicular enlargement, more on the left side. Other systemic 
examinations were unremarkable. The initial blood workup showed elevated 
estradiol level with unsuppressed cortisol after an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone 
suppression test. Breast ultrasound (US) confirmed true gynecomastia. Testicular 
US revealed microcalcification and the testicular biopsy confirmed diagnoses of 
large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor (LCCSCT). A 2-step dexamethasone 
suppression test showed a paradoxical rise in serum and urine cortisol levels, 
which are characteristic for PPNAD. LCCSCT and PPNAD are 2 major criteria 
fulfilling a diagnosis of CNC. The gene test showed heterozygous mutation in the 
PRKAR1A gene, which is diagnostic for CNC. The patient underwent bilateral 
mastoplasty and was planned for radical left orchiectomy. CONCLUSIONS 
Gynecomastia and LCCSCT can be presenting features of CNC, which mandates 
careful, thorough clinical examination and tailored investigation to reach a 
diagnosis."
418,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of isolated common femoral 
endarterectomy with patch angioplasty (IFEA) in the endovascular era.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2012-2022, 189 limbs underwent femoral endarterectomy 
with patch angioplasty. Of them, 45 IFEAs were included. We evaluated safety 
based on early complications; efficacy with primary patency (PP) and 
reintervention, above-ankle amputation, or stenosis (RAS)-free survival. We also 
evaluated lesion characteristics and outcomes according to the inclusion 
criteria (IC) of vascular mimetic implant-common femoral artery (VMI-CFA) 
stenting trial.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients were male, and 30 IFEAs were required for 
claudication. No cases of early mortality occurred. Ten limbs (22%) developed 
local/nonvascular complications (hematoma, 3; lymphocele, 5; wound infection, 
2), of which 8 resolved spontaneously. The overall PP and secondary patency 
rates were 100% at 1 year and 87% and 97% at 3 years, respectively. Twenty-one 
lesions (47%) did not meet the IC. The PP within the IC was 100% at 1 and 3 
years, and the PP outside the IC was 100% at 1 year and 73% at 3 years 
(P=0.068). The overall RAS-free survival rates were 91% at 1 year and 81% at 3 
years. All cases of RAS occurred in lesions outside the IC. The multivariate 
analysis showed that dialysis was associated with poor RAS-free survival 
(adjusted odds ratio, 8.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-35.5; P=0.005).
CONCLUSION: The recent VMI-CFA trial results should be interpreted with caution. 
IFEA is a low-risk and durable procedure; however, careful follow-up is 
warranted in patients undergoing dialysis."
419,"Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, with a 
5-year survival rate of about 10%. Early warning signs and symptoms of 
pancreatic cancer are vague or nonexistent, and most patients are diagnosed in 
Stage IV, when surgery is not an option for about 80%-85% of patients. For 
patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer, current conventional treatment 
modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) have suboptimal efficacy. 
Tumor progression is closely associated with the tumor microenvironment, which 
includes peripheral blood vessels, bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells, 
fibroblasts, immune cells, signaling molecules, and extracellular matrix. Tumor 
cells affect the microenvironment by releasing extracellular signaling 
molecules, inducing peripheral immune tolerance, and promoting tumor 
angiogenesis. In turn, the immune cells of the tumor affect the survival and 
proliferation of cancer cells. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are key cellular 
components in the tumor microenvironment and exert immunosuppressive functions 
by producing cytokines, recognizing other immune cells, and promoting tumor 
growth and metastasis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are the main regulator 
of the tumor immune response and a key target for tumor treatments. Since the 
combination of RT and immunotherapy is the main strategy for the treatment of 
pancreatic cancer, it is very important to understand the immune mechanisms 
which lead to MDSCs generation and the failure of current therapies in order to 
develop new target-based therapies. This review summarizes the research advances 
on the role of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the progression of pancreatic 
cancer and its treatment application in recent years."
420,"INTRODUCTION: Medicines Management Technicians have been shown to be an 
underused resource in medicines optimisation and medicines waste. In the United 
Kingdom, there are national recommendations for the clinical pharmacy service in 
cancer services ambulatory units, despite these recommendations, there was no 
clinical pharmacy service on the day case unit at a specialist tertiary centre 
in England. A lot of the patient pathways had been in place for many years and 
had not progressed with the changes in the clinical pathways. The main 
objectives of this study were to analyse how a medicines management technician 
could reduce medicines waste, improve the current pathway, increase medicines 
optimisation and ultimately improve the patient experience in an oncology day 
case unit at a specialist tertiary centre in England.
METHODS: A prospective mixed methods study was carried out at Weston Park 
Hospital. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted on the quantitative 
data collected, and thematic analysis was carried out on the qualitative data 
collected by questionnaire to staff members and patients.
RESULTS: This study has shown that a medicines management technician can 
complete some of the tasks more traditionally done by the chemotherapy nurses on 
the day case unit, increasing their capacity for more clinically appropriate 
tasks. A medicines management technician can work as part of the wider 
multidisciplinary team on a day case unit contributing to medicines optimisation 
and cost savings for the oncology directorate.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that a medicines management technician can act 
as a valued member of the wider multidisciplinary team, improving communication 
and patient pathways, improving medicines optimisation and contributing to cost 
saving initiatives. Further studies are required to assess whether a medicines 
management technician role can be of the same value on a haematology day case 
unit."
421,"BACKGROUND: Many biomarkers show high diagnostic values for diabetic kidney 
disease (DKD), but fewer studies focus on the predictive assessment of DKD 
progression by blood and urinary biomarkers.
AIM: This study aims to find powerful risk predictors and identifying biomarkers 
in blood and urine for DKD progression.
METHODS: A total of 117 patients with type 2 DKD including early and advanced 
stages and their laboratory parameters were statistically assessed. A receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the 
significance of discriminating between early and advanced DKD, and the 
predictive power for advanced DKD was analyzed by regression analysis and 
trisector grouping.
RESULTS: N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase-creatine (NAG/CR) level in advanced DKD 
was statistically higher than that in early DKD (p < 0.05), and there was a 
higher incidence of advanced DKD (72% vs. 56%) and high odds ratio (OR: 3.917, 
95% CI: 1.579-10.011) of NAG/CR with ≥2.79 U/mmol compared with <2.79 U/mmol 
(p < 0.05). NAG/CR ratio also showed a higher area under the ROC curve of 0.727 
(95% CI: 0.616-0.828, p = 0.010) with a high sensitivity (0.75) and a moderate 
specificity (0.66) when 1.93 U/mmol was set as the optimal cutoff value. The 
adjusted-multivariable analysis revealed that NAG/CR had an OR of 1.021 (95% CI: 
1.024-1.038) and 2.223 (95% CI: 1.231-4.463) based on a continuous and 
categorical variable, respectively, for risk of advanced DKD. Moreover, the 
prevalence of advanced DKD exhibited an increasing tendency by an increment of 
the trisector of NAG/CR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that NAG/CR ratio is an independent predictor 
for advanced DKD, and it also can be used as a powerful identifying marker 
between early and advanced DKD."
422,"Pediatric oncology and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients are 
facing many gastrointestinal side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, 
vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea. International guidelines advise early enteral 
tube feeding as the first option of nutritional support in children undergoing 
myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. When using enteral 
feeding tubes for nutritional purposes as well as drug administration, some 
pharmaceutical, nursing, and technical issues have to be taken into account. 
Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone, widely used because of its broad spectrum 
antimicrobial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. However, its 
co-administration with polyvalent cations (as present in enteral feeding) makes 
the absorption of ciprofloxacin more difficult and may alter the pharmacokinetic 
parameters. Literature data are conflicting on how long the enteral feeding 
should be discontinued for patients receiving ciprofloxacin via an enteral 
feeding tube, ranging from 2 h before to 6 h after the administration of 
ciprofloxacin. Our research question was guided by challenges and concerns of 
nurses about the delay time between ciprofloxacin administration and restart of 
the enteral feeding without compromising the nutritional intake of the children. 
Our guideline was adapted, nurses were instructed accordingly, and patient 
leaflets with correct information were created."
423,"INTRODUCTION: Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are frequently managed 
by endovascular embolization with a growing number of centers embolizing with 
intent to cure. Hemorrhage post-embolization is a severe and poorly understood 
complication. We present a novel imaging finding associated with 
post-embolization hemorrhage that has significantly impacted the management of 
patients at our institution.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing embolization of BAVM 
at a single center was performed. Post-embolization magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) was reviewed for the presence of T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery 
(FLAIR) hyperintense vessels (FHVs). Bivariate analysis was performed to 
determine associations between patient characteristics and risk of hemorrhage.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients underwent 75 embolization procedures. Forty-six 
post-embolization MRIs were available for review. There were four hemorrhages 
and 100% of those presented with FHV. In contrast, only 11.9% of embolization 
procedures without post-procedural hemorrhage had FHVs on MRI. In total, 18.7% 
of embolizations led to some morbidity or mortality, with only 6.7% leading to 
permanent morbidity or mortality. In bivariate analysis, only the presence of 
FHVs was correlated with the risk of hemorrhage (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first series to describe the finding of hyperintense 
blood vessels on FLAIR imaging after embolization of BAVMs and correlate it with 
hemorrhage post embolization. This finding can help guide practitioners and 
potentially identify patients at risk of delayed hemorrhage post embolization."
424,"BACKGROUND: Congenital coagulation factor VII (FVII) deficiency is a rare, 
autosomal-recessive haemorrhagic disorder with an estimated incidence of 
1:500,000. This disorder is caused by mutations in the F7 gene.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we report a pedigree of congenital FVII deficiency. The 
proband was a 30-year-old female with severely low FVII activity and a history 
of menorrhagia and epistaxis since her childhood who was subsequently diagnosed 
with congenital compound heterozygous FVII deficiency. A genetic study revealed 
a novel combination of compound heterozygous mutations (c.64G 〉 A, p.Gly22Ser 
and c.1027G 〉 A, p.Gly343Ser). Her father and older son had the c.64G 〉 A, 
p.Gly22Ser (heterozygous) mutation. Her mother and younger son had the c.1027G 〉 
A, p.Gly343Ser (heterozygous) mutation. The predicted results of PolyPhen-2 and 
MutationTaster indicated that these mutations were probably damaging and 
disease-causing, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified a novel combination of genetic 
mutations that could expand the mutant library and help in elucidating the 
pathogenesis of hereditary human coagulation FVII deficiency. A novel 
combination of compound heterozygous mutations was reported for the first time 
in Chinese individuals."
425,"BACKGROUND: Some spinal hemangioblastomas (HBLs) resemble spinal vascular 
malformations. Intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) secondary to spinal 
HBL has rarely been reported.
OBSERVATIONS: A 67-year-old man with a prolonged von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) 
history presented with sudden headache and vomiting. Cranial and cervical 
computed tomography (CT) revealed severe infratentorial, supratentorial, and 
cervical SAH. Cranial CT angiography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 
mismatch in hemorrhage and intracranial tumor localization, with no vascular 
lesions that could lead to intracranial SAH. Cervical CT angiography revealed 
abnormal blood vessels originating from 5 spinal tumors suspected to be HBLs. We 
considered that the SAH was caused by venous reflex from vascular 
malformation-like spinal HBLs. Transarterial embolization (TAE) of the feeding 
artery of HBLs was performed to improve symptoms and reduce rebleeding risk. 
Nine months after TAE, angiography showed no venous reflux into the intracranial 
space. Ten months later, the authors excised the T1-2 tumor because the patient 
complained of progressive paralysis of the right upper extremity.
LESSONS: In HBL with prolonged VHL, intracranial hemorrhage due to venous 
regurgitation via a mimicked vascular malformation may occur. Reducing venous 
reflux with TAE may improve symptoms and prevent rebleeding."
426,"BACKGROUND: Wyburn-Mason syndrome (WMS) is a neurocutaneous disorder consisting 
of vascular malformations of the brain, eye, and skin. These include 
characteristically high-flow intracranial and intraorbital arteriovenous 
malformations (AVMs) that present commonly with visual deterioration, headache, 
and hemiplegia. Complete removal of these lesions is challenging. Most patients 
are followed closely, and intervention occurs only in the setting of worsening 
symptoms secondary to AVM growth or hemorrhage. Here the authors present the 
first known case of a patient with WMS and a pituitary macroadenoma.
OBSERVATIONS: A 62-year-old man with a 30-year history of WMS with right basal 
ganglia and orbital AVMs and right eye blindness presented for new-onset 
left-sided vision loss. A pituitary adenoma was identified compressing the optic 
chiasm and left optic nerve. Magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction 
angiography studies were obtained for surgical planning, and the patient 
underwent an endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal resection, with significant 
postoperative vision improvement.
LESSONS: Given the variable presentation and poor characterization of this rare 
syndrome, patients with WMS presenting with new symptoms must undergo evaluation 
for growth and hemorrhage of known AVMs, as well as new lesions. Further, in 
patients undergoing intracranial surgery, extensive preoperative imaging and 
planning are crucial for safe and successful procedures."
427,"PURPOSE: To investigate the association of red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin 
(Hb), red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV), and red 
cell distribution width-standard deviation (RDW-SD) with preoperative deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA).
METHODS: A total of 2059 TJA patients were enrolled. We used the ratios of RBC, 
Hb, RDW-CV, and RDW-SD to DVT before TJA to create the receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve, thereby calculating the cut-off values and the area 
under the curve (AUC). The patients were categorized into groups based on 
cut-off value, and risk factors for DVT before TJA were subsequently analyzed. 
We included the variates that were statistically significant in the univariate 
analysis in the multivariate binary logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Preoperative DVT occurred in 107 cases (5.20%). Based on the ROC curve, 
we found that the AUC for RBC, Hb, RDW-CV, and RDW-SD were 0.658, 0.646, 0.568, 
and 0.586, respectively. Multivariate binary regression analysis revealed that 
the risk of preoperative DVT in TJA patients with RBC≤3.92*109 /L, Hb≤118g/L, 
RDW-CV≥13.2%, and RDW-SD≥44.6fL increased 3.02 (P < 0.001, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) [2.0-4.54]), 2.15 (P < 0.001, 95% CI [1.42-3.24]), 1.54 
(P = 0.038, 95% CI [1.03-2.3]), and 1.98 times (P = 0.001, 95% CI [1.32-2.98]), 
respectively. The risk of preoperative DVT in patients with corticosteroid use 
increased approximately 2.6 times (P = 0.002, 95% CI [1.22-5.81]).
CONCLUSION: We found that decreased RBC and Hb, increased RDW-CV and RDW-SD, and 
corticosteroid use were independent risk factors for preoperative DVT in 
patients undergoing TJA."
428,"Support with VV-ECMO requires anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin to 
prevent thrombotic complications. This must be monitored due to bleeding risk. A 
point-of-care (POC) method of testing aPTT and APR was evaluated for agreement 
with laboratory methods. In a prospective observational study, patients 
supported on VV-ECMO as a result of severe respiratory failure secondary to 
Covid-19 infection were given heparin as part of standard therapy. The aPTT was 
measured (i) at the bedside using the Hemochron Signature Elite device and (ii) 
at the hospital laboratory. Duplicate results were compared. Agreement between 
the POC and laboratory tests was poor, as assessed using the Bland-Altman 
method. The maximum difference between POC and laboratory methods was 133% and 
the minimum was 0%. Overall bias was 7.3% and limits of agreement were between 
-43.8% and 58.5%. Correlation increased when results were normalised to platelet 
count and creatinine. This POC test is insufficiently accurate for use as the 
primary method of heparin monitoring in patients requiring VV-ECMO for Covid-19. 
Platelets and renal function may influence the result of this whole blood POC 
test."
429,"BACKGROUND: Donkeys with clinical signs of PPID are treated with oral pergolide 
mesylate despite the lack of species-specific pharmacokinetic data.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intragastric and oral pergolide 
mesylate in healthy donkeys (Equus asinus).
STUDY DESIGN: Pharmacokinetic study.
METHODS: Six healthy donkeys were administered pergolide mesylate [Prascend®] at 
2 μg/kg bodyweight (bwt) intragastrically once, then once daily per os (PO) for 
5 days. Blood samples were collected at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 
4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after the single intragastric dose, once daily 
immediately before the PO dose, and then again at the above times after day 5 of 
once daily oral dosing. Plasma pergolide concentration was quantified via 
ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Pergolide 
concentration versus time data after the first and last doses were analysed 
based on noncompartmental pharmacokinetics using commercial software. Paired 
t-tests were used to compare single and multiple doses (P<0.05). In a follow-up 
study, a single oral dose was then administered to two donkeys followed by 
concurrent blood sampling from the jugular and cephalic veins to evaluate the 
effect of route of administration on pergolide pharmacokinetics.
RESULTS: Cmax , Tmax , AUC, and t½λz differed significantly (P<0.03) after 
single and multiple doses, with significantly lower Cmax (0.16 ± 0.16 ng/ml) and 
t½λz (9.74 ± 1.35 h) after intragastric dosing on Day 1 than after 5 days of 
oral dosing (3.74 ± 2.26 ng/ml and 16.35 ± 5.21 h, respectively). Pergolide 
plasma concentrations were higher in jugular vein samples compared to cephalic 
vein samples after a single oral dose.
MAIN LIMITATIONS: Small sample size; varied administration routes.
CONCLUSIONS: Pergolide mesylate (dosed at 2 μg/kg bwt) is bioavailable in 
donkeys after intragastric and PO administration. Differences in 
pharmacokinetics were noted after multiple doses, likely related to different 
routes of administration and sublingual absorption of pergolide. This article is

430,"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a frequent event in patients 
undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and is 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to eventual progress to 
end-organ disease. Letermovir prophylaxis for CMV infections has become a 
standard of care in adult HCT recipients due to its efficacy and high 
tolerability. However, it is not yet approved for paediatric patients.
OBJECTIVE: In a retrospective single-centre observational study we evaluated the 
use of letermovir for prophylaxis or pre-emptive treatment of cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) infection in seropositive paediatric HCT recipients receiving the compound 
outside of clinical trials. The primary endpoint was CMV reactivation requiring 
a change of medication.
METHODS: A total of 17 patients (seven female/ten male; median age 12.2 
[range 3.5-19] years, median body weight 39.5 [range 15-63] kg; median follow-up 
time 463.7 [range 41-1022] days) were identified who were started on oral (14) 
or intravenous (3) followed by oral (2) letermovir shortly after neutrophil 
engraftment at doses determined on the basis of age, weight, and concomitant 
cyclosporine use.
RESULTS: Five patients had no evidence of viral replication (prophylactic use), 
while 12 patients had varying extents of viral replication (pre-emptive 
therapy). A change of therapy was required in one patient due to a sustained 
increase in CMV viral load, and in two patients, letermovir was stopped without 
later reactivation after initiation of palliative care for recurrent leukaemia. 
Of the 14 patients who completed treatment, 3 had evidence of transient viral 
replication after end of treatment that required no further antiviral treatment. 
No patients (of 17) discontinued letermovir due to an adverse event.
CONCLUSION: Letermovir was effective in controlling CMV infection in 
seropositive paediatric allogeneic HCT recipients and was overall well 
tolerated. Pending completion of the still ongoing paediatric investigation 
plans, letermovir will be an important adjunct to our options for control of 
infectious complications in this special population."
431,"Salmonella Heidelberg (SH) is responsible for economic losses in poultry farming 
and food infections in humans and is a serious public health problem. Recently, 
there has been an increase in the frequency of isolation of this serotype in 
batches of broilers raised in Brazil. It is necessary to find new ways to help 
control this pathogen. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of diets 
containing the compound Original XPC, which is a prebiotic-like fermented 
compound (PFC), and/or Sangrovit, which is a sanguinarine-based phytobiotic 
(SAN), on SH infection in broiler chicks. For this purpose, SH colonization in 
the cecum and its invasion into the spleen and liver were evaluated, as were the 
histopathological changes caused in these organs. The lowest cecal SH counts 
were observed in birds that ingested SAN, followed by those fed PFC (P < 0.05), 
with no added effect when the two bioproducts were used together (SAN + PFC). 
The mean SH and liver spleen counts did not differ between groups (P > 0.05). In 
general, birds from all groups challenged with SH showed similar macroscopic 
changes, such as hemorrhagic areas, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, such changes 
being more intense in the infected control group. The microscopic changes 
observed in the liver included hepatocyte congestion, heterophil infiltration in 
the sinusoid capillaries, areas of necrosis, and mononuclear inflammation. In 
the cecum, heterophilic infiltrate and thickening of the lamina propria were 
observed. In the ileum, the most common changes were congestion and thickening 
of the lamina propria and atrophy of the villi and crypts. The microscopic 
changes were less intense in the supplemented birds than the infected control 
group, and those supplemented with SAN developed the least changes. As ideal 
conditions for histomorphometric parameters of the ileum, the villus:crypt ratio 
in birds should be high, the villi should be long, and the crypts should be 
shallow. In the present study, higher mean heights and villus areas were 
observed in uninfected control and SAN group birds, and the crypt depth was 
lower in birds in the negative control group. The lowest villus:crypt ratio was 
observed in the birds of the infected control group. Although additional studies 
are needed, the preliminary results of the current investigation indicated that 
the addition of bioproducts, especially SAN, to the diet of birds helped to 
control SH infection, reducing its count in the cecum and improving overall and 
intestinal health."
432,"Complex karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (CK-AML) has been classified as an 
adverse-risk subtype. Although a few reports have further classified CK-AML as 
typical (including monosomy of chromosomes 5, 7 and 17 or deletion of 5q, 7q 
and/or 17p) or atypical, the clinical features of these subtypes in Japanese 
patients remain unclear. We retrospectively analyzed a total of 115 patients 
with CK-AML, including 77 with typical CK-AML and 38 with atypical CK-AML. 
Median overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in patients with typical 
CK-AML than atypical CK-AML (143 days vs. 369 days, P = 0.009). Among patients 
with typical CK-AML, those with monosomy 17 or deletion of 17p had significantly 
shorter OS than patients without such abnormalities (105 days vs. 165 days, 
P = 0.033). TP53 mutations were more predominant in patients with typical CK-AML 
than in patients with atypical CK-AML (69.7% vs. 32.4%, P < 0.001). Patients 
with typical CK-AML had a poor prognosis regardless of TP53 mutation status. 
Among patients with atypical CK-AML, however, prognosis was worse for those with 
the TP53 mutation than those without the mutation. In conclusion, prognosis is 
extremely poor for both typical CK-AML and atypical CK-AML with TP53 mutation."
433,"BACKGROUND: Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged 
hepatectomy (ALPPS) may rescue remnant liver hypertrophy after failure of portal 
vein embolization (PVE).1 Venous reconstruction is unusual during the first step 
of ALPPS.2 We report herein an ALPPS for colorectal liver metastases with 
reconstruction of the hepato-caval junction during the first step.
METHODS: After failure of left PVE, a total ALPPS procedure was performed to 
achieve left trisectionectomy. A complete transection of the parenchyma was done 
to avoid extensive dissection during the second step in the context of the 
venous reconstruction. Total vascular exclusion (TVE) was applied selectively 
during venous reconstruction using a peritoneal patch.3 RESULTS: The first step 
lasted 285 min with 200 ml of blood loss, and 29 min of TVE. On postoperative 
day (POD) 5 there was a good recovery of liver function [prothrombin time 75%; 
bilirubin 25 µmol/L]. On POD 14, imaging showed an increase of the future 
remnant liver volume and function to 50% and 48%, respectively. The second step 
of ALPPS lasted 120 min, with transfusion of one unit of blood, allowing 
resection of seven liver metastases. Postoperative course experienced a biliary 
fistula, the patient was discharged on POD 31 and received adjuvant 
chemotherapy. There was recurrence of one liver metastasis, treated by 
percutaneous ablation before later resection of the primary. The patient was 
free of recurrence 12 months after ALPPS.
CONCLUSION: Hepato-caval junction reconstruction can be performed during the 
first step of an ALPPS procedure, facilitated by the availability of a 
peritoneum patch."
434,"OBJECTIVE: To identify novel candidate genes whose expression is associated with 
bone mineral density (BMD) and body lean mass (LM) in children.
METHODS: A tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was 
conducted utilizing a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset 
associated with BMD and LM and involving 10,414 participants. The measurement of 
BMD and LM phenotypes was made based on total-body dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (TB-DXA) scans. TWAS was conducted by using FUSION software. 
Reference panels for muscle skeleton (MS), peripheral blood (NBL) and whole 
blood (YBL) were used for TWAS analysis. Functional enrichment and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses of the genes identified by TWAS were 
performed by using the online tool Metascape ( http://metascape.org ).
RESULTS: For BMD, we identified 174 genes with P < 0.05, such as IKZF1 
(P = 1.46 × 10-9) and CHKB (P = 8.31 × 10-7). For LM, we identified 208 genes 
with P < 0.05, such as COPS5 (P = 3.03 × 10-12) and MRPS33 (P = 5.45 × 10-10). 
Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the BMD-associated genes revealed 200 
GO terms, such as protein catabolic process (Log P = -5.09) and steroid 
hormone-mediated signaling pathway (Log P = -3.13). GO enrichment analysis of 
the LM-associated genes detected 287 GO terms, such as the apoptotic signaling 
pathway (Log P = -8.08) and lipid storage (Log P = -3.55).
CONCLUSION: This study identified several candidate genes for BMD and LM in 
children, providing novel clues to the genetic mechanisms underlying the 
development of childhood BMD and LM."
435,"PURPOSE: SHC014748M is a potent, novel selective PI3Kδ isoform inhibitor and is 
proposed for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. This study investigated the 
pharmacokinetics, mass balance, metabolism and excretion of SHC014748M in 
Chinese male subjects following a single oral dose of 150 mg (100 μCi) [14C] 
SHC014748M.
METHODS: Six healthy Chinese male subjects administrated an oral suspension of 
150 mg (100 μCi) [14C] SHC014748M and the samples of blood, urine and feces were 
collected for measuring. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and 
liquid scintillation counter were utilized to obtain mass balance and the 
pharmacokinetic data.
RESULTS: The median Tmax for [14C]-radioactivity was 1.6 ± 0.5 h after the oral 
administration of [14C] SHC014748M and the mean Cmax was 3863 ± 354 ng Eq./mL in 
plasma, while the mean Cmax, t1/2 values and AUC0-∞ values for total 
radioactivity in whole blood were 2466 ± 518 ng Eq./mL, 32.2 ± 30.5 h and 
66,236 ± 44,232 h * ng Eq./mL, respectively. Fecal excretion was proposed as the 
predominant elimination route, accounting for a mean of 90.68 ± 11.38% of the 
administered dose, whereas the mean urine excretion was 6.00 ± 1.48% within 
336 h post-dose. The proposed major metabolic pathway of [14C] SHC014748M in the 
human body were as follows: (I) monooxidation, (II) glucuronide acid 
conjugation, and (III) monoxide-hydrogenation.
CONCLUSIONS: SHC014748M was absorbed, metabolized and excreted with unchanged 
SHC014748M as its main circulating component in plasma following oral 
administration. In addition, it was speculated that fecal excretion was the 
principal excretion pathway; meanwhile, monohydroxy, glucuronide conjugation, 
oxygen, and hydrogenation were the major clearance pathways of SHC014748M 
through urine and/or feces.

436,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that 
even at very low levels can cause cancer by increasing the activity of tumor 
cells and suppressing the immune system. There is also little information on 
OCPs and survival after diagnosis. The aim of this study was to monitor the 
concentration of OCPs in the blood serum of cancer patients and its relationship 
with their socio-demographic characteristics and ultimately that impact on 
survival time and hazard ratio (HR). This cross-sectional study included 89 
diagnosed patients with cancer in Isfahan, Iran. 12 types of OCPs were measured 
in serum by gas chromatography (7GC) with an electron capture detector and 
equipped with mass spectrometer (MS). Also, participants' questionnaire was 
completed to collect information. T-test, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests were used 
to evaluate the association between serum levels of OCPs and quantitative and 
qualitative information of patients. Survival analysis was also examined based 
on Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox model. The mean of total OCPs in 
patients' serum was calculated to be 1.82 ± 1.36 μg/L. Concentration of 2,4' DDE 
had a significant relationship with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (P < 0.05). In 
addition, gender revealed a significant correlation in estimating survival time 
(P < 0.05). Non-exposure to OCPs showed a positive effect on increasing the life 
expectancy of patients. Lindane and endosulfan increased the risk of death by 
16% and 37%, respectively, with insignificant P value (P > 0.05). The findings 
of the present study showed adverse effects of OCPs on patients' survival time 
and increased mortality of HR. Moreover, as the first research conducted in the 
study area, it is suggested management of environmental, individual and social 
factors that could be influenced the biological accumulation of OCPs in humans 
and cause health promotion."
437,"The study's objective was to ascertain the results of sub-chronic therapy of 
various diuretics on the ischemia/reperfusion dysfunction of the heart in 
hypertensive rats by a global ischemia in an isolated rat heart model. The 
research included 40 spontaneously hypertensive male rats (Wistar Kyoto strain, 
body mass 250 ± 30 g, 8 weeks old) grouped into four groups. The animals were 
treated for 4 weeks with 10 mg/kg of hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, or 
spironolactone per os. After a period of sub-chronic treatment, we analyzed 
hemodynamic measurements, echocardiography, and myocardial function according to 
the Langendorff retrograde perfusion method. The hearts were subjected to 20 min 
of global ischemia and then reperfused for 30 min (I20:R30). Cardiovascular 
parameters that depict the left ventricle functions were continuously monitored, 
while flowmetry was used to determine coronary flow values. Markers of oxidative 
stress were estimated from coronary venous effluent using spectrophotometry. All 
three examined diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone, indapamide) 
lowered the production of the majority of the detected prooxidants, reducing 
myocardial oxidative damage. The cardiological examination of heart function in 
vivo demonstrated that treatment with indapamide and spironolactone mitigates 
left ventricular hypertrophy but without significant lowering of blood pressure 
or increment in ejection fraction. Additionally, monitoring of cardiac function 
ex vivo indicated the cardiodepressant effect of spironolactone in spontaneously 
hypertensive rats."
438,"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a 
potentially curative therapy for malignant hematologic disorders. Novel 
anti-infection agents have successfully decreased the risk of fatal infections 
post-HSCT in recent years, but the relapse of primary disease and 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remain the major causes of death for transplant 
recipients, and significantly deteriorate the quality of life. Thus, it is 
crucial to maintain the immune homeostasis in transplant recipients and balance 
the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and GVHD.
METHODS: We reviewed the recently published literatures on immune checkpoint 
(IC) and targeted agents in relapse and GVHD after allogeneic HSCT RESULTS: 
Emerging data suggest that IC is an attractive target to modulate immune 
responses, and accumulating evidences of IC-targeted agents have been published 
for the treatment of malignancies and autoimmune disorders. The unique mechanism 
of IC-targeted agents, which affects the immune homeostasis of the transplant 
recipient by modulating alloreactivity, minimizes the risk of organ toxicity and 
immunosuppression associated with conventional therapy CONCLUSION: There is an 
increase in literature reporting the application of immune checkpoint-targeted 
agents in HSCT settings, and an overview will benefit further exploration in 
this field."
439,"The study aimed to assess plasma Myeloperoxidase enzyme (MPO) and 
Ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in obese dogs and compare them with 
ideal body weight dogs. Thirty-two dogs were distributed into two groups 
according to a 9-point body condition score (BCS), as follows: Control group 
(n = 16), dogs with a BCS of 4 or 5; Obese group (n = 16), dogs with a BCS of 8 
or 9. Plasma MPO and FRAP assays, neutrophil count, lipid profile (cholesterol 
and triglycerides), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were evaluated in both 
groups. The duration of obesity was defined based on history. The obese group 
showed higher values for body weight, BCS, SBP, neutrophil count, triglycerides, 
and MPO than the Control group. A positive correlation was observed between MPO 
concentrations and BCS and body weight. FRAP concentrations showed a positive 
correlation with the duration of obesity. The results suggested that an 
inflammatory state caused by obesity may promote increased neutrophil count and 
MPO concentrations, besides the positive correlation between MPO with BCS and 
body weight. The obesity in dogs promoted slight active MPO elevation, 
influenced by body weight, BCS, and neutrophil count. The FRAP assay did not 
show the expected reduction and, therefore, needs further investigation."
440,"Despite improvement of current treatment strategies and novel targeted drugs, 
relapse and treatment resistance largely determine the outcome for acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) patients. To identify the underlying molecular characteristics, 
numerous studies have been aimed to decipher the genomic- and transcriptomic 
landscape of AML. Nevertheless, further molecular changes allowing malignant 
cells to escape treatment remain to be elucidated. Mass spectrometry is a 
powerful tool enabling detailed insights into proteomic changes that could 
explain AML relapse and resistance. Here, we investigated AML samples from 47 
adult and 22 pediatric patients at serial time-points during disease progression 
using mass spectrometry-based in-depth proteomics. We show that the proteomic 
profile at relapse is enriched for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and subunits 
of the respiratory chain complex, indicative of reprogrammed energy metabolism 
from diagnosis to relapse. Further, higher levels of granzymes and lower levels 
of the anti-inflammatory protein CR1/CD35 suggest an inflammatory signature 
promoting disease progression. Finally, through a proteogenomic approach, we 
detected novel peptides, which present a promising repertoire in the search for 
biomarkers and tumor-specific druggable targets. Altogether, this study 
highlights the importance of proteomic studies in holistic approaches to improve 
treatment and survival of AML patients."
441,"Nuclear factor I-C (NFIC) belongs to a family of NFI transcription factors that 
binds to DNA through CAATT-boxes and are involved in cellular differentiation 
and stem cell maintenance. Here we show NFIC protein is significantly 
overexpressed in 69% of acute myeloid leukemia patients. Examination of the 
functional consequences of NFIC overexpression in HSPCs showed that this protein 
promoted monocytic differentiation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis further 
demonstrated that NFIC overexpressing monocytes had increased expression of 
growth and survival genes. In contrast, depletion of NFIC through shRNA 
decreased cell growth, increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML cell 
lines and AML patient blasts. Further, in AML cell lines (THP-1), bulk RNA 
sequencing of NFIC knockdown led to downregulation of genes involved in cell 
survival and oncogenic signaling pathways including mixed lineage leukemia-1 
(MLL-1). Lastly, we show that NFIC knockdown in an ex vivo mouse MLL::AF9 
pre-leukemic stem cell model, decreased their growth and colony formation and 
increased expression of myeloid differentiation markers Gr1 and Mac1. 
Collectively, our results suggest that NFIC is an important transcription factor 
in myeloid differentiation as well as AML cell survival and is a potential 
therapeutic target in AML."
442,"BACKGROUND: Recently, molecular tumour boards (MTBs) have been integrated into 
the clinical routine. Since their benefit remains debated, we assessed MTB 
outcomes in the Comprehensive Cancer Center Ostbayern (CCCO) from 2019 to 2021.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 251 patients were included. Targeted sequencing 
was performed with PCR MSI-evaluation and immunohistochemistry for PD-L1, Her2, 
and mismatch repair enzymes. 125 treatment recommendations were given (49.8%). 
High-recommendation rates were achieved for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
(20/30, 66.7%) and gastric adenocarcinoma (10/16, 62.5%) as opposed to 
colorectal cancer (9/36, 25.0%) and pancreatic cancer (3/18, 16.7%). MTB 
therapies were administered in 47 (18.7%) patients, while 53 (21.1%) received 
alternative treatment regimens. Thus 37.6% of recommended MTB therapies were 
implemented (47/125 recommendations). The clinical benefit rate 
(complete + partial + mixed response + stable disease) was 50.0% for MTB and 
63.8% for alternative treatments. PFS2/1 ratios were 34.6% and 16.1%, 
respectively. Significantly improved PFS could be achieved for 
m1A-tier-evidence-based MTB therapies (median 6.30 months) compared to 
alternative treatments (median 2.83 months; P = 0.0278).
CONCLUSION: The CCCO MTB yielded a considerable recommendation rate, 
particularly in cholangiocarcinoma patients. The discrepancy between the 
low-recommendation rates in colorectal and pancreatic cancer suggests the 
necessity of a weighted prioritisation of entities. High-tier recommendations 
should be implemented predominantly."
443,"BACKGROUND: Targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from FFPE specimens is used 
clinically in cancer for its ability to estimate gene expression and to detect 
fusions. Using a cohort of NSCLC patients, we sought to determine whether 
targeted RNA-seq could be used to measure tumour mutational burden (TMB) and the 
expression of immune-cell-restricted genes from FFPE specimens and whether these 
could predict response to immune checkpoint blockade.
METHODS: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas LUAD dataset, we developed a method for 
determining TMB from tumour-only RNA-seq and showed a correlation with DNA 
sequencing derived TMB calculated from tumour/normal sample pairs (Spearman 
correlation = 0.79, 95% CI [0.73, 0.83]. We applied this method to targeted 
sequencing data from our patient cohort and validated these results against TMB 
estimates obtained using an orthogonal assay (Spearman correlation = 0.49, 95% 
CI [0.24, 0.68]).
RESULTS: We observed that the RNA measure of TMB was significantly higher in 
responders to immune blockade treatment (P = 0.028) and that it was predictive 
of response (AUC = 0.640 with 95% CI [0.493, 0.786]). By contrast, the 
expression of immune-cell-restricted genes was uncorrelated with patient 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: TMB calculated from targeted RNA sequencing has a similar diagnostic 
ability to TMB generated from targeted DNA sequencing."
444,"Many roles of human platelets in health and disease are linked to their ability 
to transport and secrete a variety of small molecules and proteins carried in 
dense (δ-) and α-granules. Determination of granule number and content is 
important for diagnosis of platelet disorders and for studies of platelet 
structure, function, and development. We have optimized methods for detection 
and localization of platelet proteins via antibody and lectin staining, imaging 
via structured illumination laser fluorescence microscopy (SIM), and 
three-dimension (3D) image analysis. The methods were validated via comparison 
with published studies based on electron microscopy and high-resolution 
fluorescence microscopy. The α-granule cargo proteins thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), 
osteonectin (SPARC), fibrinogen (FGN), and Von Willebrand factor (VWF) were 
localized within the granule lumen, as was the proteoglycan serglycin (SRGN). 
Colocalization analysis indicates that staining with fluorescently labeled wheat 
germ agglutinin (WGA) allows detection of α-granules as effectively as 
immunostaining for cargo proteins, with the advantage of not requiring 
antibodies. RAB27B was observed to be concentrated at dense granules, allowing 
them to be counted via visual scoring and object analysis. We present a workflow 
for counting dense and α-granules via object analysis of 3D SIM images of 
platelets stained for RAB27B and with WGA.Abbreviation: SIM: structured 
illumination microscopy; WGA: wheat germ agglutinin; FGN: fibrinogen; TSP1:

445,"OBJECTIVES: One of the consequences of old age is cognitive and physical 
decline, which can cause a wide range of problems. These complications are more 
pronounced in those with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aim of this pilot study was 
to investigate the effect of combined exercise training on blood biomarkers, 
physical fitness and cognitive function in elderly women with T2D.
METHODS: Twenty-one elderly women with T2D were randomly allocated to training 
(n=12) and control (n=9) groups. The exercise training program was a combination 
of aerobic, resistance and balance exercises performed 3 times per week over 12 
weeks. In the same period, the control group received no training intervention. 
Blood markers, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), irisin, 
glycated hemoglobin (A1C), fasting blood sugar (FBS), cardiorespiratory fitness 
(CRF), lower and upper body strength and cognitive function, were measured in 
all participants at baseline and after 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Serum BDNF levels were not significantly different between the exercise 
and control groups at 12 weeks (p>0.05). FBS and A1C levels in the exercise 
group decreased significantly compared with the control group (p<0.05). CRF, 
dynamic balance and both upper and lower body strength in the exercise group 
improved significantly compared with the control group (p<0.05). Irisin levels 
decreased significantly in the control group, but levels did not change 
significantly in the exercise group. Greater improvements from exercise were 
observed on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment index compared with the control 
group (p=0.05), but no other group differences in cognitive function were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined exercise improved some physical fitness and 
diabetes-related surrogate factors as well as select cognitive functions, but 
had no significant effect on cognition-related biochemical factors (i.e. BDNF) 
in women with T2D."
446,"Organs and tissues are subjected to numerous alterations during aging, as a 
result of complex biochemical changes. Aging is certainly associated with the 
accumulation of ""antiaging"" and ""proaging"" factors in the systemic circulation. 
The effects of young blood on rejuvenation of regenerative capacity suggest the 
existence of multiple ""proyouthful"" factors, such as growth differentiation 
factor 11 (GDF11), in the young blood of animals. GDF11 is a member of the 
transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) superfamily of cytokines, and appears to 
be a critical rejuvenation factor in aging organs. In the context of aging, 
GDF11 promotes vascular and neural plasticity of the central nervous system. 
Parabiosis, the surgical linking of circulations between old and young mice, was 
employed to identify GDF11 as an antihypertrophic factor that appears to 
rejuvenate the aging murine heart. Current theories suggest that GDF11 in young 
blood has beneficial effects on cognitive and cardiovascular functions and wound 
healing. The cellular mechanisms of GDF11 in cardiovascular, neurological, skin 
and skeletal muscle diseases are not clearly defined, but evidence indicates 
that it may function as a proneurogenic and proangiogenic drug. GDF11 binds and 
activates specific receptor complexes, which transmit signals by two procedures: 
the TGFβ-Smad pathway and the bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-Smad pathway. GDF11 
is perhaps only the first in a series of circulating molecules that will be 
found to influence the aging of different tissues, and it may be a potential 
candidate for therapeutic intervention against angiogenesis-related disorders."
447,"BACKGROUND: The best management for acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) has 
increasingly been clarified by recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We 
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing endovascular 
therapy (EVT) vs best medical management (BMM).
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 
January 1, 2000, to November 20, 2022. We included RCTs comparing EVT vs BMM in 
BAO or bilateral vertebral artery occlusion (VAO). Primary outcome was 
ambulation (modified Rankin Scale score [mRS] 0-3) at 90 days. Secondary 
outcomes were independence (mRS 0-2) at 90 days, death by 90 days, and 
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI was used 
as a measure of the association of EVT vs BMM with outcomes.
RESULTS: Final analyses included 4 RCTs with 988 patients with BAO or VAO. 
Pooled results showed that EVT vs BMM was associated with an increased rate of 
90-day ambulation (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.16-2.05), independence (RR 1.83, 1.08-3.08) 
and a reduced risk of mortality (RR 0.76, 0.65-0.89), but an increased risk of 
sICH (RR 7.48, 2.27-24.62) and the benefits might be confined to patients with 
BAO but not patients with VAO. EVT effect was modified by occlusion location 
with the basilar artery, with greatest benefit for proximal, intermediate 
benefit for middle, and least benefit for distal occlusions.
CONCLUSION: EVT compared with BMM might be associated with an increased rate of 
ambulation, independence and survival but with an increased risk of sICH in 
patients with acute BAO."
448,"INTRODUCTION: Although the association between health insurance coverage and 
access to care is well documented, it is unclear whether the deleterious effects 
of being uninsured are strictly contemporaneous or whether previous disruptions 
in coverage have persistent effects. This study addresses this issue using 
nationally representative data covering 2011-2019 to estimate the extent to 
which disruptions in health insurance coverage continued to be associated with 
poor access even after coverage was regained.
METHODS: Analysis was conducted in 2022. Using a nationally representative 
cohort of insured adults aged 18-64 years (N=39,904) and multivariable logistic 
regression models, the authors estimated the association between past 
disruptions in coverage (occurring at least 1 year before) and the risks of 
lacking a usual source of care provider and having unmet medical need.
RESULTS: Among insured nonelderly adults, the risk of being without a usual 
source of care provider was between 18% (risk ratio=1.18; 95% CI=1.00, 1.38) and 
75% higher (risk ratio=1.75; 95% CI=1.56, 1.93) than for those with continuous 
coverage; the risk of having unmet medical needs was between 41% (risk 
ratio=1.41; 95% CI=1.00, 1.83) and 66% (risk ratio=1.66; 95% CI=1.26, 2.06) 
higher. Longer insurance disruptions were associated with a higher risk of 
lacking a usual source of care provider.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous disruptions in health insurance coverage continued to be 
negatively associated with access to care for more than a year after coverage 
was regained. Improving access to care in the U.S. may require investing in 
policies and programs that help to strengthen coverage continuity among 
individuals with insurance coverage rather than focusing exclusively on helping 
uninsured individuals to gain coverage."
449,"Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a highly aggressive pediatric malignancy with 
no effective therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a target for the 
development of novel molecule-targeting therapeutic agents. In this study, we 
report the importance of the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and 
RUNX1-Baculoviral IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) Repeat-Containing 5 
(BIRC5/survivin) axis in the proliferation of MRT cells, as it can be used as an 
ideal target for anti-tumor strategies. The mechanism of this reaction can be 
explained by the interaction of RUNX1 with the RUNX1-binding DNA sequence 
located in the survivin promoter and its positive regulation. Specific knockdown 
of RUNX1 led to decreased expression of survivin, which subsequently suppressed 
the proliferation of MRT cells in vitro and in vivo. We also found that our 
novel RUNX inhibitor, Chb-M, which switches off RUNX1 using alkylating 
agent-conjugated pyrrole-imidazole polyamides designed to specifically bind to 
consensus RUNX-binding sequences (5'-TGTGGT-3'), inhibited survivin expression 
in vivo. Taken together, we identified a novel interaction between RUNX1 and 
survivin in MRT. Therefore the negative regulation of RUNX1 activity may be a 
novel strategy for MRT treatment."
450,"Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is normally expressed by the difference 
between mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) but 
comparison of the separate contributions of MAP and ICP to human cerebral blood 
flow autoregulation has not been reported. In ABI patients, internal jugular 
vein compression (IJVC) was performed for 60 s. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation 
(dCA) was assessed in recordings of middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv, 
transcranial Doppler), and invasive measurements of MAP and ICP. Patients were 
separated according to injury severity as having whole/undamaged skull, large 
fractures or craniotomies, or following decompressive craniectomy. Glasgow coma 
score was not different for the three groups. IJVC induced changes in MCAv, MAP, 
ICP, and CPP in all three groups. The MCAv response to step changes in MAP and 
ICP expressed the dCA response to these two inputs, and was quantified with the 
autoregulation index (ARI). In 85 patients, ARI was lower for the ICP input as 
compared to the MAP input (2.25 ± 2.46 vs 3.39 ± 2.28; p<0.0001), and 
particularly depressed in the DC group (n=24, 0.35 ± 0.62 vs 2.21 ± 1.96; 
p<0.0005). In patients with ABI, the dCA response to changes in ICP is less 
efficient than corresponding responses to MAP changes. These results should be 
taken into consideration in studies aimed to optimize dCA by manipulation of CPP 
in neurocritical patients."
451,"Our current understanding of variation in mitochondrial performance is 
incomplete. The production of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation is dependent, in 
part, upon the structure of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Morphology of the 
inner membrane is crucial for the formation of the proton gradient across the 
inner membrane and, therefore, ATP synthesis. The inner mitochondrial membrane 
is dynamic, changing shape and surface area. These changes alter density (amount 
per volume) of the inner mitochondrial membrane within the confined space of the 
mitochondrion. Because the number of electron transport system proteins within 
the inner mitochondrial membrane changes with inner mitochondrial membrane area, 
a change in the amount of inner membrane alters the capacity for ATP production 
within the organelle. This review outlines the evidence that the association 
between ATP synthases, inner mitochondrial membrane density, and mitochondrial 
density (number of mitochondria per cell), impact ATP production by 
mitochondria. Further, we consider possible constraints on the capacity of 
mitochondria to produce ATP by increasing inner mitochondrial membrane density."

455,"BACKGROUND: Herein, for the first time, we present a case with mixed invasive 
micropapillary and neuroendocrine mammary neoplasm.
CASE: The patient, a 65-year-old postmenopausal woman, had become aware of a 
tumor in her right breast 11 months prior to presentation at our hospital. The 
cut surface of the mastectomy specimen contained a well-circumscribed, 
multinodular, red-brown tumor, measuring 15x15x15 cm. Histopathologically, this 
solid cystic lesion consisted of medullary growth of cancer cells accompanied by 
a well-developed vascular network as well as conspicuous hemorrhage. Cancer cell 
nests of various sizes displayed an ""inside-out"" structure surrounded by empty 
spaces. Most cancer cells were polygonal, though a few were short 
fusiform-shaped, and possessed finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm and 
ovoid, fine-granular nuclei. Eighteen mitotic figures were observed in 10 
high-power fields. Macrometastases, up to 13x8 mm in size, with the same 
morphological features as the original tumor site, were identified in 3 of 15 
dissected right axillary nodes. Immunohistochemically, primary and metastatic 
cancer cells were diffusely positive for chromogranin A and the estrogen 
receptor (Allred's total score: 8) and focally reactive for synaptophysin and 
the progesterone receptor (total score: 5). HER2 and cytokeratin 5/6 were 
negative, and the MIB-1 labelling index was 36.2%. MUC1 and EMA lined the 
stroma-facing surfaces of the cell membranes, indicating reversed polarity.
CONCLUSION: Our current patient, who had an invasive breast carcinoma with 
concomitant neuroendocrine and micropapillary features, developed multiple nodal 
metastases in association with a large-diameter tumor showing a luminal B-like 
immuno-profile. Accordingly, meticulous clinical follow-up remains essential for 
this uncommon case."
456,"Since the early 1970s, the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has 
undergone a major transformation. Initially based on only two drugs, an 
anthracycline and cytosine arabinoside, the aim of therapy was to achieve a 
haematological response allowing patients to recover and go home. Back in those 
early days, cure was not a realistic expectation. Treatment was analogous to a 
heart attack; upon recovery and a short respite, recurrence and death inevitably 
followed. Over the subsequent decades, slow but remarkable progress was made 
such that a subgroup of young adults could become long-term survivors. This 
astonishing feat was achieved initially without the use of new drugs. Supportive 
care played a major role with the widespread availability of platelet 
transfusions and improved antimicrobial therapy, particularly antifungal. No 
less important was the better use of existing drugs and the development of 
allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation. While initially the focus was on 
maximal tolerated therapy, an understanding of the immunologic role of 
allogeneic transplantation, better genetic characterization of the biology of 
the disease, advanced tools for detection of minimal disease as well as the 
recent development of new drugs changed the focus to a more refined approach 
targeting patients who are more likely to respond. Clearly, the historical 
paradigm where the term AML was generic and applicable to all patients requires 
a rethinking from the traditional therapeutic demarcations of therapy into 
phases of induction, consolidation and maintenance. These evolving new concepts 
and paradigm will be herein considered."
457,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the interactions between cervical length (CL) and placenta 
accreta spectrum (PAS) on severe postpartum hemorrhage (SPPH) in patients with 
placenta previa.
METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted at four medical 
centers in China, and 588 patients with placenta previa were included. The 
logistic regression analysis and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to 
evaluate the association between CL and SPPH. Furthermore, the joint effect of 
CL and PAS on SPPH was assessed, and the additive and multiplicative 
interactions were calculated.
RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, the negative linear 
dose-response relationship was confirmed by RCS, and the change of odds ratio 
(OR) was more significant when CL ≤2.5cm. The risk of SPPH was significantly 
higher when CL≤2.5cm co-existed with placenta increta/percreta than CL≤2.5cm or 
placenta increta/percreta existed alone [aORCL≤2.5cm&placenta accreta/non-PAS 
=3.40(95%CI, 1.37-8.45); aORplacenta increta/percreta&CL>2.5cm =4.75(95%CI, 
3.03-7.47); aORCL≤2.5cm&placenta increta/percreta =14.51(95%CI, 6.08-34.64)], 
and there might be additive interaction between CL and placenta increta/percreta 
on SPPH (attributable proportion due to interaction=50.7%, 95%CI, 6.1%-95.3%).
CONCLUSION: If CL was routinely performed during PAS evaluation, the increased 
OR of short CL and PAS can allow better patient preparation through counseling."
458,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the rates of complications in eyes that received a 
dexamethasone (DEX) implant (0.7 mg) or intravitreal triamcinolone (IVT) (2 mg) 
to treat post-vitrectomy macular edema (ME).
DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative, case series.
SUBJECTS: A total of 148 eyes (147 patients) were included. There were 75 eyes 
(75 patients) in the DEX group and 73 eyes (72 patients) in the IVT group.
METHODS: The medical records of patients who received an intravitreal DEX 0.7 mg 
(Ozurdex®) or triamcinolone (2 mg) (Triesence®) for post-vitrectomy ME between 
July 2014 and December 2021 with a minimum follow-up of three months were 
reviewed. Ocular hypotony and ocular hypertension were defined as intraocular 
pressure of < 6 mmHg and > 24 mm Hg, respectively.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The types and rates of complications.
RESULTS: The follow-up duration was 2.5 ± 1.6 years, with no significant 
difference between the groups (P = 0.398). The rate of transient ocular hypotony 
per eye and per injection was significantly higher in the DEX group (10 eyes 
[13%], 30/443 injections [7%]) compared with the IVT group (2 eyes [3%], 2/262 
injections [0.8%]) (P = 0.039 and <0.001, respectively). Mean visual acuity 
significantly decreased at the time of ocular hypotony (P = 0.031), but returned 
to pre-injection level following resolution of the hypotony after a median of 12 
days. The incidence of ocular hypertension was higher in the DEX group (23 eyes 
[31%]) than the IVT group (16 eyes [22%]), but this was not statistically 
significant (P = 0.307). Ocular hypertension was controlled with observation or 
topical medication. There were no between-group differences in the incidence of 
vitreous hemorrhage (DEX, 3 eyes [4%]; IVT, 1 eye [1%]; P = 0.632) or 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (DEX, 3 eyes [4%]; IVT, 0 eyes [0%]; P = 
0.253). Four eyes (5%) experienced migration of the DEX implant into the 
anterior chamber. No eye developed endophthalmitis.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of ocular hypotony, which causes transient visual 
impairment, was significantly higher in vitrectomized eyes treated with DEX, 
compared with eyes treated with IVT. Injections other than the inferotemporal 
quadrant or rotating injection sites may be recommended."
459,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal codominant hereditary 
illness marked by the heightened risk of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease and high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). FH 
patients can have homozygous or heterozygous variants. This condition has been 
linked to variations in the genes for the LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B, 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9), and LDLR adaptor protein 1. 
Drugs such as statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors are currently widely 
available, allowing for the theoretical normalization of plasma LDL-C levels 
mostly in patients with heterozygous FH. However, homozygous FH patients usually 
have a poor response to traditional lipid-lowering therapy and may have a poor 
prognosis at a young age. LDL apheresis and novel pharmacological therapies such 
as microsomal transfer protein inhibitors or anti-angiopoietin-like protein 3 
monoclonal antibodies are extremely expensive and unavailable in most regions of 
the world. Therefore, the unmet need persists for these patients. In this 
review, we discuss the numerous gene delivery, gene editing, and stem cell 
manipulation techniques used in this study to correct FH-causing LDLR gene 
variations in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Finally, we looked at a variety of 
studies that corrected genetic defects that caused FH using the ground-breaking 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing technology."
460,"BACKGROUND: Asthma and obesity are both complex conditions characterized by 
chronic inflammation, and obesity-related severe asthma has been associated with 
differences in the microbiome. However, whether the airway microbiome and 
microbiota-immune response relationships differ between obese persons with or 
without non-severe asthma is unestablished.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the airway microbiome and microbiota-immune mediator 
relationships between obese and non-obese subjects, with and without 
mild-moderate asthma.
METHODS: We performed cross-sectional analyses of the airway (induced sputum) 
microbiome and cytokine profiles from blood and sputum, employing 16S rRNA gene 
and ITS region sequencing to profile bacteria and fungi, and multiplex 
immunoassays. Analysis tools included QIIME2, linear discriminant analysis 
effect size (LEfSe), Piphillin, and SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for 
Ecological Association Inference (SPIEC-EASI).
RESULTS: Obesity, irrespective of asthma status, was associated with significant 
differences in sputum bacterial community structure and composition (unweighted 
Unifrac PERMANOVA, p=0.02), including a higher relative abundance of Prevotella, 
Gemella, and Streptococcus species. Among asthmatic subjects, additional 
differences in sputum bacterial composition and fungal richness were identified 
between obese and non-obese individuals. Correlation network analyses 
demonstrated differences between obese and non-obese asthma in relationships 
between cytokine mediators, and these together with specific airway bacteria, 
involving blood PAI-1, sputum IL1-β, GM-CSF, IL-8, TNF-α, and several Prevotella 
species.
CONCLUSION: Obesity itself is associated with an altered sputum microbiome, 
which further differs in those with mild-moderate asthma. The distinct 
differences in airway microbiota and immune marker relationships in obese asthma 
suggest potential involvement of airway microbes that may impact mechanisms or 
outcomes of obese asthma."
461,"BACKGROUND: Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) can enhance local tumor regression, 
but its survival benefits compared to intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT) 
followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) remain unclear.
METHODS: This is a secondary comparison between 607 patients treated with 
intensified 5-FU/Oxaliplatin neoadjuvant CRT and adjuvant CT within the 
experimental arm of the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 phase III trial, and 306 patients treated 
with TNT within the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 phase II trial. Comparison between 
clinical-pathological characteristics, surgical quality, and post-surgical 
complications were analyzed using the Pearson's Chi-squared or Mann-Whitney U 
test. Oncological outcome was examined with log-rank, Gray's test, and 
multivariate cox regression. In addition, further subgroup analyses and 
propensity score matching were performed to optimize the balance of baseline 
covariates. Findings Patients treated with CRT followed by consolidation CT had 
a significantly higher rate of pathological complete remission (pCR) compared to 
patients treated within the experimental arm of the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial (25.3% 
vs 17.3%, P=0.04). Post-surgical complications were less common in the 
CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial. After a median follow-up of 46 months, clinical outcome 
did not differ significantly in the overall cohort, in any subgroup or after 
propensity score matching. In multivariate analysis, disease-free survival (DFS) 
was similar between the experimental arm of the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial and 
treatments arms of the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial (vs arm A: HR 0.92 [95% CI 
0.62-1.37], P=0.69; vs arm B: HR 1.06 [95% CI 0.72-1.58], P=0.76). 
Interpretation Notwithstanding the limitations of intertrial comparison, TNT did 
not improve long term oncological outcome in our study compared to the 
intensified neoadjuvant CRT and adjuvant CT treatment in the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 
trial. Improved response rates after TNT offers an attractive option to explore 
organ preservation in selective patients with locally advanced rectal cancer."
462,"BACKGROUND: Comorbidities in severe asthma are common and contribute to disease 
burden. The severe asthma phenotype and treatment response can be impacted by 
comorbid conditions. Real-world data on the use of mepolizumab in severe 
eosinophilic asthma (SEA) in the presence of comorbidities is needed to inform 
clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of comorbid conditions on baseline 
phenotype in patients with SEA and assess the mepolizumab treatment effect by 
comorbidity status in SEA.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in the Australian Mepolizumab Registry (n=309) were 
classified into subgroups defined by the presence or absence of comorbidities, 
including nasal polyps, aspirin exacerbated airway disease, asthma-chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO), fungal sensitisation and 
obesity. Patient baseline characteristics were compared, and the impacts of 
comorbidity on phenotype, identified by differences in patient age and/or 
baseline biomarker levels and/or asthma severity, were assessed. The mepolizumab 
treatment effects on clinical and biological outcomes at 12 months were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Across comorbidity subgroups, mepolizumab reduced the rate of 
clinically significant exacerbations (range 47-77%), maintenance oral 
corticosteroid use (dose reduction 4.2-13.3 mg/day), and improved symptom 
control (Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 score 1.9-2.4 point reduction) and lung 
function (mean 3.4-9.3 post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory 
volume in 1s). Peripheral blood eosinophils were reduced (mean 480-780 
cells/μL). Comorbidities (nasal polyps, obesity, ACO and fungal sensitisation) 
modified the baseline phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Mepolizumab treatment is associated with comparable clinical 
improvements in in patients with SEA and comorbidities. Mepolizumab effectively 
minimizes the disease impact and corticosteroid burden in patients with SEA."
463,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder 
characterised by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the 
nigrostriatal tract. The identification of disease-modifying therapies is the 
Holy Grail of PD research, but to date no drug has been approved as such a 
therapy. A possible reason is the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity of PD 
patients, which can generate confusion in the interpretation of results or even 
mask the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention. This heterogeneity should be 
taken into account in clinical trials, stratifying patients by their expected 
response to drugs designed to engage selected molecular targets. In this 
setting, stratification methods (clinical and genetic) should be supported by 
biochemical phenotyping of PD patients, in line with the deep phenotyping 
concept. Collection, from single patients, of a range of biological samples 
would streamline the generation of these profiles. Several studies have proposed 
biochemical characterisations of patient cohorts based on analysis of blood, 
cerebrospinal fluid, urine, stool, saliva and skin biopsy samples, with 
extracellular vesicles attracting increasing interest as a source of biomarkers. 
In this review we report and critically discuss major studies that used a 
biochemical approach to stratify their PD cohorts. The analyte most studied is 
α-synuclein, while other studies have focused on neurofilament light chain, 
lysosomal proteins, inflammasome-related proteins, LRRK2 and the urinary 
proteome. At present, stratification of PD patients, while promising, is still a 
nascent approach. Deep phenotyping of patients will allow clinical researchers 
to identify homogeneous subgroups for the investigation of tailored 
disease-modifying therapies, enhancing the chances of therapeutic success."
464,"OBJECTIVES: Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy (DAT) for common 
infectious diseases may be an effective strategy to tackle antimicrobial 
resistance. Shorter DAT have been proven safe and effective for 
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), cellulitis, and cholangitis.
METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter quality-control study medical records of 
770 patients hospitalized with CAP, cellulitis and cholangitis at three tertiary 
care hospitals in Switzerland during 2017-2018 were randomly selected. 
Appropriateness of antibiotic treatment duration was assessed according to 
international and local guidelines.
RESULTS: Records of 271, 260 and 239 patients with CAP, cellulitis, and 
cholangitis were included, respectively. Median DAT was seven days (IQR 6-9), 
ten days (IQR 8-13) and nine days (IQR 6-13) in CAP, cellulitis and cholangitis, 
respectively. DAT longer than recommended by local and international guidelines 
was observed in in 32% and 37% of CAP patients, 23% and 70% of cellulitis 
patients, and 33% and 37% of cholangitis patients, respectively. Positive blood 
cultures [odds ratio (OR) 2.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-4.34)], 
infectious diseases consultation [OR 1.79 (95% CI 1.05-2.78)], impaired renal 
function [OR 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) per one ml/min/1.73m2 increase in estimated 
glomerular filtration rate] and a higher degree of inflammation on admission [OR 
1.0 (95% CI 1.001-1.005) per 10 mg/L increase in C-reactive protein] were 
independently associated with a DAT longer than recommended in international 
guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: DAT exceeded recommendations in a significant proportion of 
patients with mostly community-acquired infections."
465,"Although there are many prognostic models for patients in the terminal phase of 
solid tumours, a reliable prognostic scoring system in patients in the terminal 
phase of haematological malignancies (HM) has not been established. We 
retrospectively evaluated 180 patients in the terminal phase of HM who were 
receiving home medical care (HMC). Multivariate analyses revealed that 
clinician's estimate, consciousness, loss of appetite, dyspnoea, neutrophil 
count, lymphocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase were associated with overall 
survival (OS). Based on this result, we developed a novel prognostic scoring 
system, the Japan palliative haematological oncology prognostic estimates, in 
which four risk groups were shown to clearly differ in survival (p < 0.001): a 
low-risk group (n = 41, median OS of 434 days), an intermediate-low-risk group 
(n = 80, median OS of 112 days), an intermediate-high-risk group (n = 38, median 
OS of 31.5 days), and a high-risk group (n = 21, median OS of 10 days). This is 
the first investigation of prognostic factors that influence the OS of patients 
in the terminal phase of HM who are receiving HMC. Providing patients with 
reliable information about their prognosis is important for them to consider how 
to spend their remaining life."
466,"Blood-based biomarkers for amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau show good 
diagnostic accuracies and agreements with their corresponding CSF and 
neuroimaging biomarkers in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration [A/T/(N)] framework 
for Alzheimer's disease. However, the blood-based neurodegeneration marker 
neurofilament light is not specific to Alzheimer's disease while total-tau shows 
lack of correlation with CSF total-tau. Recent studies suggest that blood 
total-tau originates principally from peripheral, non-brain sources. We sought 
to address this challenge by generating an anti-tau antibody that selectively 
binds brain-derived tau and avoids the peripherally expressed 'big tau' isoform. 
We applied this antibody to develop an ultrasensitive blood-based assay for 
brain-derived tau, and validated it in five independent cohorts (n = 609) 
including a blood-to-autopsy cohort, CSF biomarker-classified cohorts and memory 
clinic cohorts. In paired samples, serum and CSF brain-derived tau were 
significantly correlated (rho = 0.85, P < 0.0001), while serum and CSF total-tau 
were not (rho = 0.23, P = 0.3364). Blood-based brain-derived tau showed 
equivalent diagnostic performance as CSF total-tau and CSF brain-derived tau to 
separate biomarker-positive Alzheimer's disease participants from 
biomarker-negative controls. Furthermore, plasma brain-derived tau accurately 
distinguished autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative 
diseases (area under the curve = 86.4%) while neurofilament light did not (area 
under the curve = 54.3%). These performances were independent of the presence of 
concomitant pathologies. Plasma brain-derived tau (rho = 0.52-0.67, P = 0.003), 
but not neurofilament light (rho = -0.14-0.17, P = 0.501), was associated with 
global and regional amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts. These 
results were further verified in two memory clinic cohorts where serum 
brain-derived tau differentiated Alzheimer's disease from a range of other 
neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and 
atypical parkinsonian disorders (area under the curve up to 99.6%). Notably, 
plasma/serum brain-derived tau correlated with neurofilament light only in 
Alzheimer's disease but not in the other neurodegenerative diseases. Across 
cohorts, plasma/serum brain-derived tau was associated with CSF and plasma AT(N) 
biomarkers and cognitive function. Brain-derived tau is a new blood-based 
biomarker that outperforms plasma total-tau and, unlike neurofilament light, 
shows specificity to Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration. Thus, 
brain-derived tau demonstrates potential to complete the AT(N) scheme in blood, 
and will be useful to evaluate Alzheimer's disease-dependent neurodegenerative 
processes for clinical and research purposes."
467,"PURPOSE: Dignity is a basic human right that is related to psychological 
distress factors in patients with cancer such as depression and demoralization. 
Hence, the dignity issue is of great importance to healthcare professionals. The 
present study aimed to advise healthcare professionals regarding the related 
distress factors of dignity in patients with cancer by investigating its 
relationship with patients' demographics, disease characteristics, and 
psychological distress.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study design. A convenience sample of 267 
patients with cancer from a medical center were recruited into this study. Each 
patient completed demographics and disease characteristics questionnaires, the 
Patient Dignity Inventory Mandarin Version (PDI-MV), the Demoralization Scale 
Mandarin Version (DS-MV), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data 
were analyzed with SPSS 22.0 software.
RESULTS: Dignity was significantly correlated with age, demoralization and 
depression. Cancer patients aged 65 or above were more likely to have a lower 
sense of dignity. In the present study, the sensitivity and specificity of the 
Patient Dignity Inventory Mandarin Version for demoralization (DS-MV≥30) were 
84.8% and 79.1% and for depression (PHQ-9≥10) were 73.8% and 70.9% in cancer 
patients with an aggregate score of 35 or above.
CONCLUSIONS: Dignity is significantly correlated with personal demographic 
characteristics and psychological distress in patients with cancer. The results 
provide reference data for healthcare professionals to understand and enable 
dignity in patients with cancer and aid in the development of methods that 
promote their dignity."
468,"INTRODUCTION: We hypothesized that supraceliac aortic cross clamping could 
induce lung injury mediated by an inflammatory ischemia-reperfusion trigger. We 
aimed to characterize glycocalyx, a component of endothelial membrane, 
participating to remote lung injury.
METHODS: Rats underwent supraceliac aortic cross clamping for 40 minutes and 
were sacrificed at 0, 3, 6 and 24 hours of reperfusion (n=10/group). Each group 
was compared to sham (n=6/group). Glycocalyx products (Syndecan-1, Heparan 
Sulfate), TNF-α and Interleukin-1β were measured in plasma (Enzyme-Linked 
ImmunoSorbent Assay). Lungs were harvested for measurements of TNF-α, 
Interleukin-1β (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and Syndecan-1 (Western Blotting). 
Histologic lung injury scoring and pulmonary gravimetry were blinded manner 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Plasmatic Syndecan-1, Heparan Sulfate, TNF-α and Interleukin-1β reached 
peak levels at 3 hours. Levels were significantly higher in clamping groups than 
sham at 6 hours for Syndecan-1, at 0 and 3 hours for heparan sulfate, at 3 and 6 
hours for TNF-α, and at 3 hours for Interleukin-1β. Lung TNF-α and 
Interleukin-1β reached peak levels at 6 hours. Levels were significantly higher 
than sham at 6 and 24 hours for TNF-α and at 6 hours for Interleukin-1β. Lung 
Syndecan-1 was lowest at 3 hours. Syndecan-1 was not significantly different 
compared to sham at the different reperfusion times. At 3 hours, it was 
0.27±0.03 vs 0.33±0.02 (sham) (p=0.09). Histopathologic scores at 6 and 24 hours 
were higher in clamping groups than sham. At 6 and 24 hours, it was higher for 
hemorrhage, polynuclear neutrophil infiltration and intravascular leukocytes. 
Pulmonary edema was higher by gravimetry at 0 and 6 hours.
CONCLUSION: Supra celiac aortic clamping causes early lung injury in relation 
with a systemic inflammatory response associated with altered glycocalyx 
structure."
469,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex niche enveloping a tumor formed by 
extracellular matrix, blood vessels, immune cells, and fibroblasts constantly 
interacting with cancer cells. Although TME is increasingly recognized as a 
major player in cancer initiation and progression in many tumor types, its 
involvement in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) pathogenesis is currently unknown. 
Here, we provide a molecular and functional characterization of 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major TME component, in MCC 
patient-derived xenografts. We show that subcutaneous co-injection of 
patient-derived CAFs and human MCC MKL-1 cells into SCID mice significantly 
promotes tumor growth and metastasis. These fast-growing xenografts are 
characterized by areas densely populated with human CAFs, mainly localized 
around blood vessels. We here provide evidence that the growth-promoting 
activity of MCC-derived CAFs is mediated by the APA/AngII-III/AT1R axis, with 
the expression of aminopeptidase A (APA) in CAFs being a triggering event. 
Altogether, our findings point to APA as a potential marker for MCC prognostic 
stratification and as a candidate for therapeutic intervention."

472,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an association exists between deceleration and 
acceleration areas on continuous fetal cardiotocography (CTG) and neonatal 
encephalopathy (NE).
METHODS: A single center, retrospective case-control study was conducted to 
compare CTG characteristics of low-risk pregnancies (35 weeks gestation or 
more), complicated by moderate to severe NE with two matched controls for every 
case. Controls were matched by gestational age and cord blood pH. We analyzed 
the intrapartum CTG recordings by calculation of the deceleration and 
acceleration areas and the ratio between the two.
RESULTS: During the period between 2013 and 2019, we identified 95 cases of 
low-risk pregnancies that were complicated by moderate to severe NE in our 
center. Thirty-three (34.7%) deliveries were excluded, mostly due to an 
insufficient duration of the CTG recordings. The remaining 62 cases were matched 
with 123 controls. We found that NE was significantly associated with an 
increased total deceleration area, a decreased total acceleration area and a 
lower acceleration-to-deceleration ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: NE was significantly associated with increased total deceleration 
area, decreased total acceleration area and a lower acceleration-to-deceleration 
ratio, independent of cord blood pH. Development of a computerized real-time 
analysis of fetal heart rate tracings may contribute to making these 
measurements a more valid clinical tool."

474,"In 2018, a disease characterized by splenic hemorrhage and necrosis killed ducks 
in a duck farm in Guangxi province, China. A duck reovirus strain was isolated 
from the tissues of the dead ducks by inoculating duck embryos and BHK-21 cells. 
Electron microscopy of the cultured the isolate showed that the viral particles 
were nearly round in shape and approximately 70 nm in diameter, and they were 
designated DRV-GL18. Sequence analysis showed that the GL18 strain viral genome 
was 23,419 nt in length and had 10 dsRNA segments. Phylogenetic analysis of cDNA 
amplicons of segments encoding the protein σC which are outer capsid proteins 
showed that the isolate belongs to the branch of the epidemic strains of duck 
reovirus. The Recombination Detection Program (RDP) and SimPlot program analyses 
suggested potential genetic recombination events in the M2 segments. 
Pathogenicity experiments revealed that GL18 produced severe hemorrhaging in 
livers and necrosis in the spleen of infected SPF ducklings. A death rate of 50% 
in the experimental ducklings was calculated during the first 7 d, and the rest 
of the ducklings were observed to undergo spleen necrosis. These data suggested 
that GL18 is a duck reovirus isolate with severer pathogenicity, and it could be 
a candidate for development of vaccine. This is the first reported isolation of 
duck reovirus from mature ducks."
475,"INTRODUCTION: Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients often present with 
anemia, in which preoperative transfusions are performed to mitigate 
anemia-associated risks. However, transfusions have also been noted to cause 
worse postoperative outcomes. This study examined how transfusion-associated 
outcomes vary at different levels of anemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical 
Quality Improvement Program database from 2005 to 2019 was used to identify 
patients who had undergone any of 12 major EGS procedures using Current 
Procedural Terminology codes. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on 
receipt of preoperative transfusion. Cohorts were subdivided into anemia 
severity levels and propensity score-matched within each using patient 
demographic and comorbidity variables. We analyzed 30-day postoperative 
outcomes, including morbidity, mortality, and return to odds ratio (OR), using 
univariate Chi-squared tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: 595,407 EGS cases were identified. Receiving preoperative transfusion 
were 44.45% (n = 3058) of severely anemic, 10.94% (n = 9076) of moderately 
anemic, 1.34% (n = 1370) of mildly anemic, and 0.174% (n = 704) of no anemia 
patients. Transfusion resulted in an increased overall morbidity in the severe 
(OR 1.54), moderate (OR 1.50), mild (OR 1.71), and no anemia (OR 1.85) groups. 
Mortality increased in the moderate (OR 1.27), mild (OR 1.61), and no anemia (OR 
1.76) subgroups. In severe anemia, transfusion status and mortality were not 
significantly associated.
CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates 
in those with higher hematocrit levels, even after controlling for pre-existing 
comorbidities. A restrictive transfusion strategy should be considered to avoid 
risks for those with a hematocrit level more than 24%."
476,"INTRODUCTION: Despite aggressive surgical care and systemic therapy, patients 
with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have a poor prognosis. Recent 
studies show that racial disparities in outcome also exist. We sought to 
investigate the association lymph node (LN) metastases had with survival between 
Black and White patients with PDAC after resection.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 226 PDAC patients who underwent resection at 
a single institution from 2010 to 2018 was performed with attention to LN 
metastasis and patient race. The number of patients who received chemotherapy 
was also evaluated.
RESULTS: One Hundred Seventy Five (77.4%) PDAC patients were White and 51 
(22.6%) were Black. 130 (59.3%) patients had LN metastasis (LN+). LN+ and LN- 
groups were similar in race (P = 0.93), sex (P = 0.10) and age at the time of 
diagnosis (P = 0.45). Patients with LN + disease were more likely to present 
with larger tumors (3.4 versus 2.8 cm, P = 0.02) and higher T status 
(P = 0.001). White and Black patients had similar rates of LN metastasis (59% 
versus 58.8%, P = 1.0). The median survival for LN- Black and White patients 
were similar (43.2 versus 30.2 mo, P = 0.82). LN + Black patients trended 
towards receiving more systemic therapy than White LN + patients (55% versus 
42%, P = 0.10). The median survival for LN + Black patients was significantly 
less than LN + White patients (17.5 versus 24.6 mo, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Black LN + PDAC patients have an inferior survival rate after 
resection when compared to their White counterparts. Our disparity in outcome 
cannot be solely explained by a difference in systemic treatment. Further 
investigation is warranted to determine racial differences in tumor biology or 
response to chemotherapy."
477,"We model the dielectrophoretic response of E. coli bacterial cells and red blood 
cells, upon exposure to an electric field. We model the separation, capture, and 
release mechanisms under flow conditions in a microfluidic channel and show 
under which conditions efficient separation of different cell types occur. The 
modelling work is aimed to guide the separation electrode architecture and 
design for experimental validation of the model. The dielectrophoretic force is 
affected both by the geometry of the electrodes (the gradient of the electric 
field), the Re{CM(ω)} factor, and the permittivity of the medium ϵm. Our 
modelling makes testable predictions and shows that designing the electrode 
structure to ensure structure periodicity with spacing between consecutive traps 
smaller than the length of the depletion zone ensures efficient capture and 
separation. Such electrode system has higher capture and separation efficiency 
than systems with the established circular electrode architecture. The 
simulated, modelled microfluidic design allows for the separated bacteria, 
concentrated by dedicated dielectrophoretic regions, to be subsequently detected 
using label-free functionalized nanowire sensors. The experimental validation of 
the modelling work presented here and the validation of the theoretical design

478,"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offer an alternative to 
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and warfarin for treating cancer-associated 
thrombosis (CAT).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost and effectiveness of DOACs versus LMWH.
DESIGN: Cohort-state transition decision analytic model.
DATA SOURCES: Network meta-analysis comparing DOACs versus LMWH.
TARGET POPULATION: Adult patients with cancer at the time they develop 
thrombosis.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Strategies of 1) enoxaparin, 2) apixaban, 3) edoxaban, and 4) 
rivaroxaban for treatment of CAT.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 2022 U.S. 
dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In the base-case scenario, using drug prices from 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule, apixaban 
dominated enoxaparin and edoxaban by being less costly and more effective. 
Rivaroxaban was slightly more effective than apixaban, with an ICER of $493 246. 
In a scenario analysis using ""real-world"" drug prices from GoodRx, rivaroxaban 
was cost-effective with an ICER of $50 053 per QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were highly sensitive to monthly drug 
costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50 000 per QALY, apixaban was preferred in 80% of simulations. 
However, sensitivity analyses also demonstrated that apixaban only remained 
cost-effective if monthly medication costs were below $530. Above this, 
rivaroxaban became cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: An assumption was made that patients would continue anticoagulation 
indefinitely unless they suffered a major bleed. Nonmedical costs such as 
patient and caregiver loss of productivity were not accounted for, and long-term 
thrombotic complications were not explicitly modeled.
CONCLUSION: The 3 DOACs are more effective and more cost-effective than LMWH. 
The most cost-effective DOAC depends on the relative cost of each of these 
agents. These are important considerations for treating physicians and health 
policymakers.

479,"The use of midline catheters has increased to reduce excessive use of central 
venous access devices, and additional data on midline catheter complications are 
needed. This study aimed to describe midline catheter complications among 
hospitalized patients. This retrospective study included a random sample of 300 
hospitalized patients with a midline catheter insertion in 2019. The primary 
outcome was a composite end point of 8 complications: occlusion, bleeding at 
insertion site, infiltration/extravasation, catheter-related thrombosis, 
accidental removal, phlebitis, hematoma, and catheter-related infection. Midline 
catheter failure was defined as removal prior to the end of therapy due to 
complications. Among 300 midline catheters, the incidence of the composite end 
point of 1 or more midline complications was 38% (95% confidence interval, 
33%-44%). Complications included occlusion (17.0%), bleeding at insertion site 
(12.0%), infiltration/extravasation (10.0%), catheter-related thrombosis (4.0%), 
accidental removal (3.0%), phlebitis (0.3%), hematoma (0.3%), and 
catheter-related infection (0.3%). Midline catheter failure occurred in 16% of 
midline catheters (n = 48) due to infiltration/extravasation (n = 27), 
accidental removal (n = 10), catheter-related thrombosis (n = 9), occlusion (n = 
4), and catheter-related infection (n = 1). Three catheters had 2 types of

in midline catheter failure. The most common causes of midline catheter failure 
were infiltration/extravasation, accidental removal, and catheter-related

480,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma-measured tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) is 
a potential non-invasive biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated 
whether plasma p-tau217 predicts subsequent cognition and positron emission 
tomography (PET) markers of pathology in autosomal dominant AD.
METHODS: We analyzed baseline levels of plasma p-tau217 and its associations 
with amyloid PET, tau PET, and word list delayed recall measured 7.61 years 
later in non-demented age- and education-matched presenilin-1 E280A carriers 
(n = 24) and non-carrier (n = 20) family members.
RESULTS: Carriers had higher plasma p-tau217 levels than non-carriers. Baseline 
plasma p-tau217 was associated with subsequent amyloid and tau PET pathology 
levels and cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that plasma p-tau217 predicts subsequent brain 
pathological burden and memory performance in presenilin-1 E280A carriers. These 
results provide support for plasma p-tau217 as a minimally invasive diagnostic 
and prognostic biomarker for AD, with potential utility in clinical practice and 
trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Non-demented presenilin-1 E280A carriers have higher plasma tau 
phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) than do age-matched non-carriers. 
Higher baseline p-tau217 is associated with greater future amyloid positron 
emission tomography (PET) pathology burden. Higher baseline p-tau217 is 
associated with greater future tau PET pathology burden. Higher baseline 
p-tau217 is associated with worse future memory performance."
481,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current understanding of histone post-translational 
modifications (histone modifications) across immune cell types in patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during remission and flare is limited. The 
study aimed to quantify histone modifications at a single-cell resolution in IBD 
patients during remission and flare and how they differ compared to healthy 
controls.
METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 94 subjects (83 IBD patients and 
11 healthy controls). IBD patients had either UC (n=38) or CD (n=45) in clinical 
remission or flare. We used epigenetic profiling by time-of-flight (EpiTOF) to 
investigate changes in histone modifications within peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells from IBD patients.
RESULTS: We discovered substantial heterogeneity in histone modifications across 
multiple immune cell types in IBD patients. They had a higher proportion of less 
differentiated CD34 + hematopoietic progenitors, and a subset of CD56 bright NK 
cells and γδ T cells characterized by distinct histone modifications associated 
with the gene transcription. The subset of CD56 bright NK cells had increased 
several histone acetylations. An epigenetically defined subset of NK was 
associated with higher levels of CRP in peripheral blood. CD14+ monocytes from 
IBD patients had significantly decreased cleaved H3T22, suggesting they were 
epigenetically primed for macrophage differentiation.
CONCLUSION: We describe the first systems-level quantification of histone 
modifications across immune cells from IBD patients at a single-cell resolution 
revealing the increased epigenetic heterogeneity that is not possible with 
traditional ChIP-seq profiling. Our data open new directions in investigating 
the association between histone modifications and IBD pathology using other 
epigenomic tools."
482,"INTRODUCTION: Inherited Factor VII (FVII) deficiency is commonest among the rare 
bleeding disorders. A small number of patients present in infancy with severe 
bleeding, and many may remain asymptomatic but detected before surgery/invasive 
procedures. Genetic testing may be helpful in predictive testing/prenatal 
diagnosis in severe cases.
AIM: Characterisation of clinical and genotypic spectrum of patients with 
inherited FVII deficiency.
METHODS: Retro-prospectively, 35 cases with prolonged prothrombin time and FVII 
activity (FVII:C) <50 IU/dl were subjected to targeted resequencing. After 
in-silico analysis, variant/s were validated by Sanger sequencing in index cases 
and family members. Haplotype analysis was done for F7 polymorphisms.
RESULTS: Severe FVII deficiency was found in 50% of patients (FVII:C ≤1 IU/dl), 
and 42.9% were asymptomatic. Clinical severity assessment revealed 17% severe, 
17% moderate and 22.9% patients with mild bleeds. FVII levels ranged from .3 to 
38 IU/dl. Molecular analysis revealed variants in 30/35 cases, of which 17 were 
homozygous, 10 were compound heterozygous and 3 were heterozygous. Twelve 
genetic variants were identified, one promoter variant c.-30A>C; seven missense 
(c.215C>G, c.244T>C, c.253G>C, c.904G>A, c.961C>T, c.1109G>T, c.1211G>A), two 
deletions (c.21delG, c.868_870delATC), and one each of nonsense c.634C>T and 
splice-site variant c.316+1G>A. Recurrent variants c.1109G>T and c.215C>G were 
found in 17 and 8 cases, 12 of the former cases were homozygous. They had the 
same haplotype, indicating the founder effect in North Indians.
CONCLUSION: This is the largest cohort of FVII genotyping from India, confirming 
heterogeneity in terms of clinical manifestations, FVII activity and zygosity of 
the variants with a limited genotypic phenotypic correlation."
483,"INTRODUCTION: Many older people with orthostatic hypotension (OH) may not report 
typical symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness or unsteadiness. However, the 
relationships between OH and falls in the absence of typical symptoms are not 
yet established.
METHODS: Continuous orthostatic blood pressure (BP) was measured during active 
stand using a Finometer at Wave 1 of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing in 
participants aged ≥ 70 years.OH, with and without dizziness, was defined as a 
sustained drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 and/or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg at 30, 60 and 
90 seconds post-standing.The association between symptoms of dizziness and 
orthostatic BP was assessed with multi-level mixed-effects linear regression; 
logistic regression models assessed the longitudinal relationship between OH and 
falls at 6-year follow-up (Waves 2-5).
RESULTS: Almost 11% (n = 934, mean age 75 years, 51% female) had OH, two-thirds 
of whom were asymptomatic.Dizziness was not associated with systolic BP drop at 
30 (β = 1.54 (-1.27, 4.36); p = 0.256), 60 (β = 2.64 (-0.19, 5.47); p = 0.476) 
or 90 seconds (β = 2.02 (-0.91, 4.95); p = 0.176) after standing in adjusted 
models.Asymptomatic OH was independently associated with unexplained falls (odds 
ratio 2.01 [1.11, 3.65]; p = 0.022) but not explained falls (OR 0.93 [0.53, 
1.62]; p = 0.797) during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of older people with OH did not report typical symptoms 
of light-headedness. Dizziness or unsteadiness after standing did not correlate 
with the degree of orthostatic BP drop or recovery. Participants with 
asymptomatic OH had a significantly higher risk of unexplained falls during 
follow-up, and this has important clinical implications for the assessment of 
older people with falls."
484,"BACKGROUND: An optimal antithrombotic strategy for patients aged 80 years or 
older with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: Using a systematic review with traditional and network meta-analysis, 
we investigated outcomes in AF patients ≥80 years treated with different 
antithrombotic strategies.
METHODS: We searched eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 
observational studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science 
databases from inception to 16 December 2021. Research comparing treatment 
outcomes of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), aspirin, vitamin K antagonists 
(VKAs) or no oral anticoagulant/placebo therapy in patients ≥80 years with AF 
were included. Outcomes were stroke or systemic embolism (SSE), major bleeding, 
all-cause mortality, intracranial bleeding (ICH) and gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Traditional and network meta-analyses were performed. Net clinical benefit 
integrating SSE and major bleeding was calculated.
RESULTS: Fifty-three studies were identified for analysis. In the meta-analysis 
of RCTs, risk of SSE (risk ratio [RR]: 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.73-0.99) and ICH (RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.28-0.52) was significantly reduced when 
NOACs were compared with VKAs. Network meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated that 
edoxaban (P-score: 0.8976) and apixaban (P-score: 0.8528) outperformed other 
antithrombotic therapies by showing a lower major bleeding risk and better net 
clinical benefit. Both traditional and network meta-analyses from RCTs combining 
with observational studies showed consistent results.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients aged 80 years or older with AF, NOACs have better 
outcomes than VKAs regarding efficacy and safety profiles. Edoxaban and apixaban 
may be preferred treatment options since they are safer than other 
antithrombotic strategies."
485,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Clinicians sought to ascertain what frequency of 
vital signs best detects blood transfusion reactions. This review discusses 
early and delayed blood product transfusion reaction detection through the lens 
of scientific literature.
METHODS: A comprehensive appraisal of published literature was conducted using 
Integrative Research Review methodology through June 2022 not limited to English 
or research in Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 
Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Medline and PubMed.
RESULTS: Full-text articles in the final sample included four articles 
discussing vital signs detecting blood transfusion reactions and four articles 
reporting the importance of adding physical assessments for early reaction 
detection. None of the studies provided evidence regarding how often vital signs 
should be monitored to detect transfusion reactions. No studies included 
identical screening components for detecting blood product transfusion 
reactions. Main themes emerged including variations in what was included in 
vital signs, importance of respiratory assessment, inclusion of physical 
assessment, nurse documentation and reporting compliance, and patient and family 
inclusion in transfusion reaction recognition.
CONCLUSION: Vital sign components varied across reviewed studies. Respiratory 
rate and pain were not always included in 'vital signs' to identify transfusion 
reactions. Only low-level data and no clinical trials loosely informing 
frequency of vital sign monitoring to transfusion reaction detection were found. 
Respiratory (to include oxygen saturation, lung sounds and respiratory rate) and 
pain assessment emerged as crucial to acute and delayed transfusion reaction 
recognition. The disconnect between 'vital signs' and the varied vital sign 
components reported to detect transfusion reactions in scientific literature 
requires further exploration."
486,"Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are functionally poised, tissue-resident 
lymphocytes that respond rapidly to damage and infection at mucosal barrier 
sites. ILC2 reside within complex microenvironments where they are subject to 
cues from both the diet and invading pathogens-including helminths. Emerging 
evidence suggests ILC2 are acutely sensitive not only to canonical activating 
signals but also perturbations in nutrient availability. In the context of 
helminth infection, we identify amino acid availability as a nutritional cue in 
regulating ILC2 responses. ILC2 are found to be uniquely preprimed to import 
amino acids via the large neutral amino acid transporters Slc7a5 and Slc7a8. 
Cell-intrinsic deletion of these transporters individually impaired ILC2 
expansion, while concurrent loss of both transporters markedly impaired the 
proliferative and cytokine-producing capacity of ILC2. Mechanistically, amino 
acid uptake determined the magnitude of ILC2 responses in part via tuning of 
mTOR. These findings implicate essential amino acids as a metabolic requisite 
for optimal ILC2 responses within mucosal barrier tissues."
487,"INTRODUCTION: B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) is a proliferation of 
hematopoietic precursor cells characterized by the expression of various B-cell 
antigens. Expression of T cell antigens has rarely been reported in B-ALL. We 
report the second case CD5+ (Cluster of differentiation 5) B-ALL associated with 
Philadelphia chromosome (Phi+).
OBSERVATION: A 38-year old male presented with anorexia and generalized weakness 
for the last ten days. Hemogram revealed bicytopenia and hyperleukocytosis made 
of 93% difficult to classify cells. A diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
was suspected. An immunophenotyping on peripheral blood was performed. The panel 
for B- cell lineage chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD) was used. The 
dim expression of CD45 and the lack of surface immunoglobuline helped to exclude 
a CD5 expressing mature B cell neoplasm. Then, the diagnosis of ALL was 
confirmed by ALL panels. Karyotype showed a Phi+. Thus, a diagnosis of B-ALL 
with aberrant expression of CD5 and Phi+ was established. The patient received 
chemotherapy according to the modified group for research on adult acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia philadelphia positive 2005 protocol (GRAAPH 2005). A 
complete remission at the end of induction was obtained. The patient received 
consolidation and then, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patient is 
in complete hematological remission till the date of submission of this report.
CONCLUSION: Aberrant expression of CD5 associated with Phi+ has rarely been 
reported in B cell lineage ALL and having a poor prognosis. Pathologists and 
clinicians should be aware of this entity to avoid confusion with other tumors."
488,"BACKGROUND: Acute Methanol Poisoning (MP) is rare but potentially serious.
OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical and biological characteristics of acute MP and 
its associated factors of mortality.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study including case series of MP which 
took place in Kairouan, Tunisia. Cases started consulting the emergency room on 
a festive day (1st day of Eid al- Fitr) corresponding to May 24, 2020.
RESULTS: We included 65 male victims of MP. The median [interquartile] age was 
28.0 [21.0 - 35.0] years with extremes ranging from 17 to 75 years. The median 
[interquartile] time between the ingestion of methanol and the medical 
consultation was 48.0 [24.0 - 50.0] hours. On admission, the majority of 
patients described neurological (98.4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (51.4%). 
Four patients remained visually impaired and 8 patients (12.3%) had died. The 
univariate analysis reported an association between mortality and age, amount of 
methanol ingested, co-ingestion of cannabis, delay to consultation, neurological 
distress, seizures, lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, metabolic 
acidosis, lower levels of potassium, higher levels of sodium, hematocrit, 
glycemia, creatinine, anion gap, and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health 
Evaluation II score.
CONCLUSION: Mortality rate following MP was high and was associated with several 
factors."
489,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of six weeks of high intensity interval 
training (HIIT) and L-Arginine supplementation on interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels 
and body composition in Iranian adult trained males.
METHODS: This experimental study was performed as an intervention with a 
pretest-posttest design in three experimental groups and one control group. 
Fortyeight young males from Qazvin province (Iran) were selected voluntarily 
based on convenience sampling. Participants were randomly divided into four 
groups (12 participants in each group): ""HIIT""; ""L-Arginine supplementation""; 
""HIIT + L-Arginine supplementation"", and ""HIIT + placebo"". At 7 a.m., when the 
level of inflammation was at its lowest, a blood sample was taken from the 
participants, and body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP), and lean 
body mass (LBM) were determined. IL-6 analysis was performed using STATE FAX 
device and ELISA method. Training sessions were conducted for six consecutive 
weeks, three sessions a week. Analysis of covariance and Bonferroni post hoc 
test were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: i) There were no significant differences between groups in BMI, BFP, or 
LBM. ii) There was a significant difference in IL-6 levels between the groups (p 
< 0.05), so that the inflammatory levels in the ""HIIT + L-Arginine 
supplementation"" and ""HIIT + placebo"" groups were lesser than the ""HIIT"" (0.002 
and <0.001, respectively) and ""L-Arginine supplementation"" (<0.001and <0.001, 
respectively) groups. HIIT ""seems"" to reduce the level of inflammation.
CONCLUSION: HIIT had no significant effect on body composition indices. Plasma 
IL-6 levels decreased after six weeks of HIIT and L-Arginine supplementation. 
The level of IL-6 in the ""HIIT + L-Arginine supplementation"" and ""HIIT + 
placebo"" groups were lower than the control group (i.e.; ""HIIT"") and supplement 
control group (i.e.; ""L-Arginine supplementation"")."

491,"Urinary system stones have a complex pathophysiology affected by environmental 
and genetic factors. To confirm whether ALPL gene polymorphisms are an effective 
universal risk factor for the development of urolithiasis, we aimed to 
investigate ALPL gene polymorphism in Turkish population. Our study was carried 
out with 187 patients with urolithiasis and 92 healthy volunteers (control 
group) who were not diagnosed with urolithiasis either in themselves or in their 
families, applied to Emergency Medicine Clinic of Health Sciences University 
Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey between 
November 2021 and February 2022, prospectively. In order to evaluate the 
relationship between ALP gene (rs1256328) polymorphism and urolithiasis, blood 
samples were analyzed by quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) method.  Male gender 
(OR:3.785; 95% CI:2.118-6.763; p<0.001), increased BUN level (OR:1.082; 95% 
CI:1.013-1.156; p=0.019), increased NLR level (OR:1.149; 95 %CI:1.033-1.277; 
p=0.011) and heterozygous genotype (OR:2.353; 95% CI:1.31-4.225; p=0.004) were 
determined as independent risk factors for the development of urolithiasis. The 
presence of heterozygous (CT) genotype in the ALPL rs1256328 gene region in the 
Turkish population is associated with an increased risk of urolithiasis. This 
suggests that ALPL rs1256328 gene polymorphism can be used as a genetic marker 
in the Turkish population."
492,"BACKGROUND: Obese individuals are often underrepresented in clinical trials, 
leading to a lack of dosing guidance.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate which physiological parameters and 
drug properties determine drug disposition changes in obese using our 
physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) framework, informed with obese 
population characteristics.
METHODS: Simulations were performed for ten drugs with clinical data in obese 
(i.e., midazolam, triazolam, caffeine, chlorzoxazone, acetaminophen, lorazepam, 
propranolol, amikacin, tobramycin, and glimepiride). PBPK drug models were 
developed and verified first against clinical data in non-obese (body mass index 
(BMI) ≤ 30 kg/m2) and subsequently in obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) without changing 
any drug parameters. Additionally, the PBPK model was used to study the effect 
of obesity on the pharmacokinetic parameters by simulating drug disposition 
across BMI, starting from 20 up to 60 kg/m2.
RESULTS: Predicted pharmacokinetic parameters were within 1.25-fold (71.5%), 
1.5-fold (21.5%) and twofold (7%) of clinical data. On average, clearance 
increased by 1.6% per BMI unit up to 64% for a BMI of 60 kg/m2, which was 
explained by the increased hepatic and renal blood flows. Volume of distribution 
increased for all drugs up to threefold for a BMI of 60 kg/m2; this change was 
driven by pKa for ionized drugs and logP for neutral and unionized drugs. Cmax 
decreased similarly across all drugs while tmax remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION: Both physiological changes and drug properties impact drug 
pharmacokinetics in obese subjects. Clearance increases due to enhanced hepatic 
and renal blood flows. Volume of distribution is higher for all drugs, with 
differences among drugs depending on their pKa/logP."
493,"In spine surgery, allogenic bone grafts are often required to ensure bone 
fusion, however, the main concern regarding their use is the infection risk: 
therefore, an intraoperative swab for culture test is performed. The 
cost-effectiveness of these swabs and their influence on the patients' 
postoperative course have often been questioned. This study aims at determining 
whether positive spine allograft culture results are predictive of an increased 
risk of surgical site infection and whether they influence the surgeon's choices 
in postoperative management. The records of 340 patients who received allogenic 
bone graft during spinal fusion surgery in our institution were reviewed, for a 
total of 677 allografts. Each graft was swabbed intraoperatively. All patients 
were followed clinically for postoperative complications. Infection was 
diagnosed based on clinical data, blood tests and radiographic images, all 
assessed by an infectious disease specialist. Only 4 of the 677 allografts used 
(0.6%) resulted positive at the intraoperative swab culture. Three cultures were 
positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis and one culture for S. warneri. No 
clinical infection occurred in any of these patients. Twenty-eight of the 340 
patients (8.2%) developed an infection, but none of them had a positive 
intraoperative swab culture. The most common microbiologic pathogen isolated 
from this cohort was S. aureus. According to our series, intraoperative swab 
culture results were not predictive for higher risk of infection and did not 
affect the clinical behavior of the surgeons in postoperative management."
494,"A proof-of-concept of colloidal surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 
substrate for rapid selective detection of overexpressed CA 15-3 biomarker in 
breast cancer serum (BCS) is suggested using PEGylated gold nanourchins (GNUs) 
conjugated with anti-CA 15-3 monoclonal antibody (mAb). UV-vis spectroscopy 
provided conformational information about mAb where the initial aromatic amino 
acid peak was red-shifted from 271 to 291 nm. The fluorescence peak of tyrosine 
in mAb was reduced by ≈ 77%, and red-shifted by ≈ 3 nm after incubation in BCS. 
Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy and SERS were used to study the 
composition and the molecular structure of the mAb and BCS. Some of the most 
dominant Raman shifts after GNU-PEG-mAb interaction with BCS are 498, 736, 818, 
1397, 1484, 2028, 2271, and 3227 cm-1 mainly corresponding to C-N-C in amines, 
vibrational modes of amino acids, C-H out-of-plane bend, C-O stretching 
carboxylic acid, the vibrational mode in phospholipids, NH3+ amine salt, C≡N 
stretching in nitriles, and O-H stretching. The intensity of SERS signals varied 
per trial due to the statistical behavior of GNU in BCS, agglomeration, laser 
power, and the heating effect. Despite very small amount of plasmonic heating, 
the result of the ANOVA test demonstrated that under our experimental 
conditions, the heating effect on signal variation is negligible and that the 
differences in the laser power are insignificant for all SERS observations 
(p > 0.6); thus, other parameters are responsible. The absorbance of 
mAb-conjugated GNU was decreased after five minutes of irradiation at 8 mW in 
the BCS."
495,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are commonly detected in the brains of patients with 
acute ischemic stroke (AIS). With the development of neuroimaging, clinicians 
are paying more attention to the presence of CMBs. CMBs were found to 
significantly increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhagic transformation and 
hemorrhage in patients with AIS, especially in patients with concurrent atrial 
fibrillation (AF). Additionally, the presence of CMBs is thought to be a symbol 
of a high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (IS). A few researchers have found 
that the presence of CMBs has no significant effect on the prognosis of patients 
with AIS. Therefore, the current views on the role of CMBs in the prognoses of 
patients with IS are controversial. The use of anticoagulants and other drugs 
has also become a dilemma due to the special influence of CMBs on the prognosis 
of these patients. Due to the large number of patients with AF and CMBs, many 
studies have been conducted on the effects of CMBs on these patients and 
subsequent pharmacological treatments. However, at present, there are no 
relevant guidelines to guide the secondary preventive treatment of patients with 
stroke, CMBs, and AF. In this paper, we summarized the role of CMBs in AIS 
combined with AF and relevant preventive measures against the recurrence of 
stroke and the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage to help clarify the 
specifics of drug therapies for this group of patients."
496,"Skeletal muscle has a robust endocrine function as a powerful organ and can 
secrete and release cytokines or polypeptides known as myokines. These myokines 
have significant regulatory effects on signal transduction in skeletal muscle 
and the metabolism of peripheral tissues and organs and exert biological effects 
via autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine forms. Obesity and aging cause myokine 
secretion dysregulation, and hastening sarcopenic obesity (SO) development. 
Exercise is currently an excellent intervention and prevention method for SO. 
Meanwhile, exercise impacts many organs and tissues. These organs and tissues 
will produce various myokines in response to movement and metabolism throughout 
the body to govern muscle differentiation, growth, and remodeling. According to 
accumulating data, exercise can increase the release of myokines from diverse 
tissues into the blood and postpone the SO onset and progression by influencing 
protein metabolism, inflammation, mitochondrial quality control, and other 
mechanisms."
497,"PURPOSE: Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is a rare but disabling 
disease. Although several cases have been reported in the literature, their 
treatment remains unclear, especially in patients with advanced age. We, 
therefore, aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of cervical SSEH in 
octogenarians with an acute onset of neurological illness undergoing 
laminectomy.
METHODS: Electronic medical records from a single institution between September 
2005 and December 2020 were retrieved. Data on patient demographics, 
neurological conditions, functional status, surgical characteristics, 
complications, hospital course, and 90-day mortality were also collected.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients aged ≥ 80 years with SSEH undergoing laminectomy 
were enrolled in this study. The mean Charlson comorbidity index was 9.1 ± 2.0, 
indicating a poor baseline reserve. Ten individuals (45.5%) were taking 
anticoagulant agents with a pathologic partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 
46.5 ± 3.4 s. Progressive neurological decline, as defined by the motor score 
(MS), was observed on admission (63.8 ± 14.0). The in-hospital and 90-day 
mortality were 4.5% and 9.1%, respectively. Notably, the MS (93.6 ± 8.3) 
improved significantly after surgery (p < 0.05). Revision surgery was necessary 
in 5 cases due to recurrent hematoma. Anticoagulant agents and pathological PTT 
are significant risk factors for its occurrence. Motor weakness and 
comorbidities were unique risk factors for loss of ambulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Laminectomy and evacuation of the hematoma in octogenarians with 
progressive neurological decline induce clinical benefits. Emergent surgery 
seems to be the ""state of the art"" treatment for SSEH. However, potential 
complications associated with adverse prognostic factors, such as the use of 
anticoagulants, should be considered."
498,"OBJECTIVES: A few previous studies have reported the role of embolization with 
curative intent in the treatment of the early phase of a spontaneous cerebral 
hemorrhage in pediatric patients, and its efficacy needs to be compared with 
surgery at the same time risk factors for hemorrhage following early 
embolization in such patients need to be evaluated.
METHODS: From a pool of 80 pediatric (< 18 years) who had undergone treatment 
for ruptured AVM with hemorrhage at our center between July 2018 and July 2022, 
we identified 36 patients with spontaneous bleeding due to AVM. Out of which, 20 
were treated solely by embolization (group 1), while the remaining patients were 
treated surgically (with and without adjuvant embolization) (group 2).
RESULT: Spetzler-Martin's grading of the lesion suggested seven lesions < 3 and 
13 lesions ≥ 3 in the embolization group. Similarly, seven lesions were < 3 and 
nine ≥ 3 Spetzler-Martin grade in the surgery group. Incomplete embolization was 
associated with hemorrhage in two patients treated with curative intent and four 
patients treated with embolization as adjuvant in the surgery group (p = 0.01). 
On follow-up, 18 patients in the embolization group and 12 in the surgery group 
had Glasgow outcome scores ≥ 4 (p = 0.273).
CONCLUSION: In the pediatric age group, incomplete embolization is the 
significant risk factor for hemorrhage in AVMs treated after a hemorrhagic 
stroke. Embolization with curative intent is as effective as surgery in treating 
such lesions as adjuvant embolization with careful patient selection."
499,"OBJECTIVE: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease mediated by 
antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The thymus plays a primary 
role in AChR-MG and is characterized by a type I interferon (IFN) signature 
linked to IFN-β. We investigated if AChR-MG was characterized by an IFN-I 
signature in the blood, and further investigated the chronic thymic IFN-I 
signature.
METHODS: Serum levels of IFN-β and IFN-α subtypes, and mRNA expression for IFN-I 
subtypes and IFN-stimulated genes in PBMCs were analyzed. The contribution of 
endogenous nucleic acids in thymic expression of IFN-I subtypes was investigated 
in human thymic epithelial cell cultures and the mouse thymus. By 
immunohistochemistry, thymic CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages were analyzed in 
AChR-MG. To investigate the impact of a decrease in thymic macrophages, mice 
were treated with an anti-CSF1R antibody.
RESULTS: No IFN-I signature was observed in the periphery emphasizing that the 
IFN-I signature is restricted to the MG thymus. Molecules mimicking endogenous 
dsDNA signalization (Poly(dA:dT) and 2'3'-cGAMP), or dexamethasone-induced 
necrotic thymocytes increased IFN-β and α-AChR expression by thymic epithelial 
cells, and in the mouse thymus. A significant decrease in thymic macrophages was 
demonstrated in AChR-MG. In mice, a decrease in thymic macrophages led to an 
increase of necrotic thymocytes associated with IFN-β and α-AChR expression.
INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the decrease of thymic macrophages in 
AChR-MG impairs the elimination of apoptotic thymocytes favoring the release of 
endogenous nucleic acids from necrotic thymocytes. In this inflammatory context, 
thymic epithelial cells may overexpress IFN-β, which specifically induces 
α-AChR, resulting in self-sensitization and thymic changes leading to AChR-MG.

500,"The advent of modern quantitative protein mass spectrometry techniques around 
the turn of the 21st century has contributed to a revolution in biology referred 
to as ""systems biology"". These methods allow identification and quantification 
of thousands of proteins in a biological specimen, as well as detection and 
quantification of post-translational protein modifications including 
phosphorylation. Here, we discuss these methodologies and show how they can be 
applied to understand the effects of the peptide hormone vasopressin to regulate 
the molecular water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2). The emerging picture provides a 
detailed framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in water 
balance disorders. Abstract figure legend Various quantitative protein mass 
spectrometry have been used to study the mechanisms of vasopressin induced AQP2 
protein expression. SILAC is a technology using isotopes (C-13 and N-15) to 
label arginine and lysine in cell culture that allows mass spectrometry to 
distinguish control and treatment samples. The quantification is done by 
measuring the relative intensity of the light and heavy peptides that 
corresponded to the relative abundance of the parent protein in the samples. 
Dynamic SILAC is designed to quantify protein half-lives and translation rates 
by switching normal media to heavy isotopes containing media and trace the 
changes of intensity in the light and heavy peptides. TMT is a set of isotopic 
tags with the same molecular weight that can label peptides directly. The 
advantages of the TMT technology is multiplexing and can be applied to any 
sample types without pre-incubation with heavy isotope culture media. 
Multiplexing of TMT quantification is essential for study time-responsive 
phosphoproteomics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
501,"OBJECTIVES: There are many water types available on the market. They are widely 
known in public with health claims. The questions are, are those claims are 
scientifically proven or those are just testimonies from the consumers or 
overclaimed by the producers. This study aims to systematically review evidences 
on the health effects of alkaline, oxygenated, and demineralized water in 
comparison with mineral water among healthy population.
CONTENTS: Data were obtained from databases PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, EBSCO, dan 
Science Direct since January 2000 until July 2022. There were 10 eligible 
articles, consisted of two articles on alkaline, four articles on oxygenated, 
and four articles on demineralized water, that furtherly being analyzed.
SUMMARY: Compared to consumption of mineral water, consumption of alkaline and 
oxygenated water did not show any significant difference on gut microbiota, 
urine pH, blood parameter, or fitness parameter. While, consumption of 
demineralized water in the long term resulted in lower quality of certain 
nutrient intake.
OUTLOOK: Recent evidences do not prove any additional health effects of 
alkaline, oxygenated, or demineralized water compared to mineral water. In 
contrast, demineralized water consumption in the long run was proven to lead to 
adverse effect."

(SFTSV) infection remains largely unknown. Here we report that SFTS patients had 
a cytokine storm accompanied by high levels of chemokines. CD8+ T cells in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of SFTS patients exhibited a more activated 
phenotype and enhanced the antiviral responses. They increased the expression of 
CD69 and CD25, secreted a higher level of IFN-γ and granzyme, and had a stronger 
proliferative ability than in healthy controls. In convalescent SFTS patients, 
the expression of CD69 and CD25 on CD8+ T cells was reduced. In addition, we 
found the ratio and cellularity of CD14+ CD16+ intermediate monocytes were 
increased in peripheral blood of SFTS patients. Both the expression of C-X-C 
motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) on CD14+ CD16+ intermediate monocytes and the 
expression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) on CD8+ T cells increased 
dramatically in SFTS patients. Our studies reveal a potential pathway that CD8+ 
T cells rapidly activate and are mostly recruited by intermediate monocytes 
through CXCL10 in SFTSV infection. Our results may be of clinical relevance for 
further treatment and discharge instructions in SFTSV infections."
503,"SUMMARY: In this study, we herein describe a 47-year-old Japanese woman who 
manifested inheritable non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and severe 
dyslipidemia. Interestingly, her NASH progression was ameliorated by treatment 
with a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. This inheritability 
prompted us to comprehensively decode her genomic information using whole-exome 
sequencing. We found the well-established I148M mutation in PNPLA3 as well as 
mutations in LGALS3 and PEMT for her NASH. Mutations in GCKR may contribute to 
both NASH and dyslipidemia. We further mined gene mutations potentially 
responsible for her manifestations that led to the identification of a novel 
M188fs mutation in MUL1 that may be causally associated with her mitochondrial 
dysfunction. Our case may provide some clues to better understand this spectrum 
of disease as well as the rationale for selecting medications.
LEARNING POINTS: While the PNPLA3 I148M mutation is well-established, 
accumulation of other mutations may accelerate susceptibility to non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH and dyslipidemia may be intertwined biochemically 
and genetically through several key genes. SGLT2 inhibitors emerge as promising 
treatment for NASH albeit with interindividual variation in efficacy. Genetic 
background may explain the mechanisms behind the variation. A novel 
dysfunctional mutation in MUL1 may lead to metabolic inflexibilities through 
impaired mitochondrial dynamics and function."
504,"PURPOSE: RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) are commonly mutated genes in cancer, 
and activating RAS variants are also found in disorders of somatic mosaicism 
(DoSM). A survey of the mutational spectrum of RAS variants in DoSM has not been 
performed.
METHODS: A total of 938 individuals with suspected DoSM underwent 
high-sensitivity clinical NGS-based testing. We investigated the mutational 
spectrum and genotype-phenotype associations of mosaic RAS variants.
RESULTS: Here we present a series of individuals with DoSM with RAS variants. 
Classic hotspots, including Gly12, Gly13, and Gln61 constituted the majority of 
RAS variants observed in DoSM. Further, we present 12 individuals with HRAS and 
KRAS in-frame duplications/insertions (dup/ins) variants in the switch II 
domain. Among the 18.3% of individuals with RAS in-frame dup/ins variants, 
clinical findings were mainly associated with vascular malformations. Hotspots 
were associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum, including vascular tumors, 
vascular malformations, nevoid proliferations, segmental overgrowth, digital 
anomalies, and combinations. The median age at testing for individuals with 
in-frame dup/ins variants was older, and the variant allele fraction was lower 
compared to those with mosaic RAS hotspots.
CONCLUSION: Our work provides insight into the allelic and clinical 
heterogeneity of mosaic RAS variants in non-malignant conditions."
505,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a prothrombotic autoimmune disease with 
heterogenous clinicopathological manifestations and is a well-established cause 
of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and transient ischaemic attack (TIA), 
particularly in younger patients. There is growing recognition of a wider 
spectrum of APS-associated cerebrovascular lesions, including white matter 
hyperintensities, cortical atrophy and infarcts, which may have clinically 
important neurocognitive sequalae. Diagnosis of APS-associated AIS / TIA 
requires expert review of clinical and laboratory information. Management also 
poses challenges, given the potential for substantial morbidity and recurrent 
thrombosis, additional risk conferred by conventional cardiovascular risk 
factors, and limitations in the evidence-base regarding optimal antithrombotic 
therapy for secondary prevention.In this review, we summarise key features of 
APS-associated cerebrovascular disorders, with focus on clinical and laboratory 
aspects of diagnostic evaluation, including practical guidance for 
antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) testing, and an overview of neuroimaging 
findings. The current status of prognostic markers is considered. We review the 
evidence base for antithrombotic treatment in APS-associated stroke and discuss 
ongoing uncertainties in this setting, including the optimal intensity of 
anticoagulation and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Clinical 
practice recommendations are provided, covering antithrombotic treatment, 
supportive management and options for anticoagulant-refractory cases, and we 
highlight the benefits of adopting a careful multidisciplinary team approach."
506,"Recently, there has been increased recognition of the importance of sex as a 
biological factor affecting disease and health. Many preclinical studies have 
suggested that males may experience a less favorable outcome in response to 
sepsis than females. The underlying mechanisms for these differences are still 
largely unknown but are thought to be related to the beneficial effects of 
estrogen. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive role of testosterone is also 
thought to contribute to the sex-dependent differences that are present in 
clinical sepsis. There are still significant knowledge gaps in this field. This 
mini-review will provide a brief overview of sex-dependent variables in relation 
to sepsis and the cardiovascular system. Preclinical animal models for sepsis 
research will also be discussed. The intent of this mini-review is to inspire 
interest for future considerations of sex related variables in sepsis that 
should be addressed to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
in sepsis-induced cardiovascular dysfunction for identification of therapeutic 
targets and improved sepsis management and treatment."
507,"BACKGROUND: Eltrombopag has an off-label indication for haematopoietic cell 
transplantation in patients experiencing delayed thrombocyte recovery and/or 
thrombocytopaenia.
AIMS: To present our centre's experience of using this agent not only for post- 
haematopoietic cell transplantation thrombocytopaenia but also for poor graft 
functioning in the post-haematopoietic cell transplantation setting.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Thirty-nine patients who had persistent cytopaenia following 
haematopoietic cell transplantation and treated with eltrombopag at our centre 
between October 2011 and December 2021 were retrospectively identified. During 
this period, 9 (23.1%) and 30 (76.9%) patients who underwent allogeneic 
transplantations, respectively, received eltrombopag.
RESULTS: The female-to-male ratio was 12:27, and the median transplant age was 
49 (18-70) years. Eight (20.5%) patients had isolated thrombocytopaenia, 19 
(49.4%) had bi-lineage cytopaenia and 12 (30.1%) had pancytopaenia. Patients 
received a median of 50 mg/day (25-150 mg/day) of eltrombopagfor a median 
duration of 82 (24-386) days. Nine (23.1%) patients had autologous 
haematopoietic cell transplantation, and 30 (76.9%) had allogeneic 
haematopoietic cell transplantation (14 unrelated, 9 sibling and 7 
haploidentical). The median donor age was 32 (20-67) years. The median follow-up 
was 16.4 (1.8-84.3) months. The median pre-treatment platelet count was 11x109/l 
(1-23), which increased to 41x109/l (6-150). The median platelet count increment 
was 29.5x109/l (p = 0.001). The pre-treatment median neutrophil count was 
1.19x109/l (0.39-5.1), which increased to 2.35 x109/l (0.1-5.33) (p = 0.05), and 
the pre-treatment median haemoglobin was 8.3 (6.2-14) g/dl, which increased to 
10 (6.2-14) g/dl (p = 0.001) with eltrombopag. No eltrombopag-related 
hepatotoxicity occurred; however, 1 (2.6%) patient failed to continue treatment 
because of two consecutive episodes of deep venous thrombosis. Six (15.4%) 
patients were unresponsive to eltrombopag and dependent on blood product 
transfusions. After a median time of 82 days, 61.5% of the patients discontinued 
eltrombopag successfully.
CONCLUSION: The results confirmed that eltrombopag could provide a rapid, 
sustained response in patients with poor graft functioning after haematopoietic 
cell transplantation. This finding is essential given the high rate of 
non-relapse mortality caused by poor graft functioning after haematopoietic cell 
transplantation."
508,"Sepsis is a severe life-threatening and rapidly developing disease that causes 
millions of deaths annually worldwide. Researchers have made tremendous efforts 
to elucidate the pathophysiology of sepsis using various animal models; the 
mouse model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) is widely 
used in laboratories. The three technical aspects that affect the severity and 
replicability of the CLP model are the percentage of cecum ligated, the size of 
the needle used for cecal puncture, and the volume of feces squeezed into the 
abdominal cavity. The rapid and specific diagnosis of sepsis is a crucial factor 
that affects the outcome. The gold standard for sepsis diagnosis is microbial 
culture; however, this process is time-consuming and sometimes inaccurate. The 
detection of sepsis-specific biomarkers is fast, but the existing biomarkers are 
unsatisfactory due to a short half-life, non-specificity, and insufficient 
sensitivity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a reliable biomarker of 
sepsis in the early stages. Previous publications suggest that excessive 
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) occur in sepsis. Citrullinated histone H3 
(CitH3), as a NET component, is elevated both in septic animals and patients, 
and the presence of CitH3 is a reliable diagnostic biomarker of sepsis. The 
present study aimed to describe a standardized mouse model of CLP-induced sepsis 
and establish a reliable blood biomarker of sepsis. Our work may contribute to 
the early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis in the future."
509,"Nitric oxide can activate neutrophils and macrophages, facilitate the synthesis 
of collagen, which allows significantly accelerating the regeneration of 
traumatized tissues. We studied the effects of nitric oxide-containing gas flow 
generated by plasma-chemical device ""Plason"" in a rat model of full-thickness 
wounds. Histological and morphometric analyses revealed that Plason treated 
wounds expressed significantly fewer signs of inflammation and contained a more 
mature granulation tissue on day 4 after the operation. Considering the results 
of the experimental study, we applied the Plason device in sports medicine for 
the treatment of lower limb bruises of 34 professional soccer players. Athletes 
were asked to assess the intensity of pain with the Visual Analogue Scale. 
Girths of their lower limbs were measured over the course of rehabilitation. 
Nitric oxide therapy of full-thickness wounds inhibited inflammation and 
accelerated the regeneration of skin and muscle tissues. Compared with the 
control, we observed a significant reduction in pain syndrome on days 2-7 after 
injuries, edema, and hematoma, and shortened treatment duration. This pilot 
study indicates that the use of nitric oxide is a promising treatment method for 
sports injuries."
510,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the therapeutic opportunities for 
patients with psychological disorders when they may decline to take medication. 
We sought to systematically compare the anesthetic efficacy of ketamine, 
propofol, and dexmedetomidine for electroconvulsive therapy in 
treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients. This double-blind trial 
enrolled treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients (n = 85) who had 
been hospitalized for ECT in the Amir Kabir Hospital's psychiatric ward (Arak, 
Iran). The ketamine, propofol, and dexmedetomidine groups received a dose of 0.2 
μg/kg ketamine, 1.5 mg/kg propofol, and 0.8 mg/kg dexmedetomidine, respectively. 
In all intervention groups, 10 mL of interventional drugs was injected 
intravenously for 10 minutes, and in the placebo group, 10 mL of normal saline 
was given over the same period. The dexmedetomidine group's blood pressure was 
revealed comparatively lower at all times. Dexmedetomidine-treated patients 
showed their marked satisfaction, while those treated with propofol had shorter 
recovery time, shorter seizure duration, and shorter time to achieve an Aldrete 
score of 9-10 and increased relaxation, and next dexmedetomidine produced deeper 
relaxation. Propofol could shorten recovery time and seizure duration, and 
enhance relaxation, while dexmedetomidine was associated with higher patient 
satisfaction. Considering that any anesthetic which does not shorten seizure 
duration may serve efficiently for ECT and that ketamine-treated patients had 
more prolonged seizure duration, the preferred drug can hence be considered from 
various angles, thereby offering anesthetic agents with highly favorable 
efficacy in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients needing ECT. 
The drug choice thus depends on physical conditions, underlying diseases, and 
psychiatrist consultation."
511,"Neurotrophic factors, particularly nerve growth factor, enhance neuronal 
regeneration. However, the in vivo applications of nerve growth factor are 
largely limited by its intrinsic disadvantages, such as its short biological 
half-life, its contribution to pain response, and its inability to cross the 
blood-brain barrier. Considering that let-7 (human miRNA) targets and regulates 
nerve growth factor, and that let-7 is a core regulator in peripheral nerve 
regeneration, we evaluated the possibilities of let-7 application in nerve 
repair. In this study, anti-let-7a was identified as the most suitable let-7 
family molecule by analyses of endogenous expression and regulatory 
relationship, and functional screening. Let-7a antagomir demonstrated biosafety 
based on the results of in vivo safety assessments and it entered into the main 
cell types of the sciatic nerve, including Schwann cells, fibroblasts and 
macrophages. Use of hydrogel effectively achieved controlled, localized, and 
sustained delivery of let-7a antagomir. Finally, let-7a antagomir was integrated 
into chitosan conduit to construct a chitosan-hydrogel scaffold 
tissue-engineered nerve graft, which promoted nerve regeneration and functional 
recovery in a rat model of sciatic nerve transection. Our study provides an 
experimental basis for potential in vivo application of let-7a."
512,"Studies have found that the phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 expression can 
be related to stroke, but it remains unclear whether changes in phosphatase 
actin regulatory factor 1 expression also play a role in traumatic brain injury. 
In this study we found that, in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury induced 
by controlled cortical impact, phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 expression 
is increased in endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. When we 
overexpressed phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 by injection an 
adeno-associated virus vector into the contused area in the traumatic brain 
injury mice, the water content of the brain tissue increased. However, when 
phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 was knocked down, the water content 
decreased. We also found that inhibiting phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 
expression regulated the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway, decreased 
blood-brain barrier permeability, reduced aquaporin 4 and intercellular adhesion 
molecule 1 expression, inhibited neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis, 
thereby improving neurological function. The findings from this study indicate 
that phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 may be a potential therapeutic target 
for traumatic brain injury."
513,"Treatment with metformin can lead to the recovery of pleiotropic biological 
activities after spinal cord injury. However, its effect on spinal cord injury 
in aged mice remains unclear. Considering the essential role of angiogenesis 
during the regeneration process, we hypothesized that metformin activates the 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/endothelial nitric oxide 
synthase pathway in endothelial cells, thereby promoting microvascular 
regeneration in aged mice after spinal cord injury. In this study, we 
established young and aged mouse models of contusive spinal cord injury using a 
modified Allen method. We found that aging hindered the recovery of neurological 
function and the formation of blood vessels in the spinal cord. Treatment with 
metformin promoted spinal cord microvascular endothelial cell migration and 
blood vessel formation in vitro. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of 
metformin in an in vivo model promoted endothelial cell proliferation and 
increased the density of new blood vessels in the spinal cord, thereby improving 
neurological function. The role of metformin was reversed by compound C, an 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase inhibitor, both in vivo and in 
vitro, suggesting that the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein 
kinase/endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway likely regulates 
metformin-mediated angiogenesis after spinal cord injury. These findings suggest 
that metformin promotes vascular regeneration in the injured spinal cord by 
activating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/endothelial 
nitric oxide synthase pathway, thereby improving the neurological function of 
aged mice after spinal cord injury."
514,"Background In 2012, the number of people infected with HTLV-1 was estimated to 
be 10 million worldwide. Prevalence varies according to geographic location, 
ethnic factors, sex, age, populations exposed to risk factors, income, and 
education, reaching countries with the worst socioeconomic scenarios. There is a 
need to determine the current global prevalence of HTLV-1 and examine its 
association with countries' human development index (HDI) to provide data for 
global health policy. Methods Systematic review with meta-analysis according to 
PRISMA 2020 recommendations. It was registered at PROSPERO, CRD42021223146. 
Prevalence or cross-sectional studies of HTLV-1 infection with at least 100 
participants, screening, and confirmatory serologic testing were included. 
Studies with incomplete or unavailable results or with duplicate information 
were excluded. Data were selected by two independent investigators and analyzed 
using R software, a metapackage that generated the forest plots (95% CI). 
Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic, and funnel plot asymmetry was 
assessed using Egger's test. Countries were compared using an HDI cutoff ≥ 0.8. 
Methodological quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. 
Results The overall prevalence of HTLV-1 infection was 0.91% (95%CI: 0.80-1.02, 
p < 0.0001) and was higher in low HDI countries [1.18% (95%CI: 1.03-1.34)] than 
in high HDI countries [0.41% (95%CI: 0.27-0.57)]. Prevalence varied according to 
the populations studied: it was higher in the general population [1.65% (95%CI: 
1.08-2.34)] compared to pregnant women [0.34% (95%CI: 0.17-0.57)] and blood 
donors [0.04% (95%CI: 0.01-0.08)]. Consistently, prevalence for each population 
group was higher in low HDI countries than in high HDI countries. Conclusion The 
worldwide prevalence of HTLV-1 infection is highly heterogeneous, with a global 
prevalence of 0.91%. In high HDI countries, the observed prevalence is 
approximately three times lower than in low HDI countries. In the general 
population, the observed prevalence is about five times higher than in pregnant 
women and forty-one times higher than in blood donors."
515,"Immunophenotyping using high dimensional flow cytometry is a central component 
of human immune system multi-omic studies. We present four high parameter flow 
cytometry panels for deep immunophenotyping of human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC). This set of four 25+ color panels include 64 cell 
surface markers to resolve broad immune compartment populations, as well as 
activation and memory of specific T, B, natural killer (NK), and myeloid 
lineages. Common lineage bridging markers are integrated into each panel to 
allow for inter-panel quality control through major lineage frequency 
verification. These panels were developed using a five laser BD Symphony A5 
conventional cytometer and successfully transferred to a five laser Cytek Aurora 
spectral cytometer capable of acquiring the panels. Nine representative PBMC 
samples were stained with the four phenotyping panels and acquired on both 
instruments to evaluate population frequency and visual staining patterns for 
gating between the systems. Both instruments produced comparable high quality 
flow cytometry data and supported our decision to acquire samples on the 
spectral cytometer moving forward. This modular set of panels and instrument 
performance metrics provide guidelines for designing flow cytometry experiments 
suitable for longitudinal or cross-sectional immune profiling. This article is

516,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a ""late-onset"" primary 
immunodeficiency characterized by variable manifestations and genetic 
heterogeneity. A monogenic cause of CVID has been reported in 10% of patients. 
In this study, we identified two novel pathogenic variants implicated in 
monogenic CVID by whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis: a heterozygous nuclear 
factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) p.G686fs mutation and a homozygous inducible T-cell 
co-stimulator (ICOS) p.L96Sfs mutation. The predicted crystal models indicated 
premature truncation of the two mutated proteins. Both variants were 
demonstrated as loss-of-function mutations and were associated with overlapped 
manifestations of respiratory fungal infection and splenomegaly. We further 
performed a detailed assessment of immunologic phenotypes and impaired 
lymphocyte functions in patients. Moreover, we discovered an association between 
monoclonal T-large granular lymphocyte proliferation and ICOS-deficient CVID for 
the first time. These observations lead to a new perspective on the underlying 
genetic heterogeneity of CVID."
517,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin B12 is involved in biochemical metabolic pathways. B12 
deficiency is common in childhood when the need for the vitamin increases and 
growth and development occur. Various hematological, neurological, psychiatric, 
and gastrointestinal disorders are observed in its deficiency. In addition, B12 
deficiency is associated with oxidative stress and DNA damage.
AIM: Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate oxidative stress, 
thiol/disulfide homeostasis, and DNA damage pre and post-treatment in children 
diagnosed with B12 deficiency.
METHODS: A total of 40 children with B12 deficiency were included in the study 
after the consent form was approved. Blood was drawn from children pre and 
post-treatment. Hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and red blood cells (RBC) 
were measured by autoanalyzer; total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant 
status (TOS), total thiol (TT), and native thiol (NT) were measured by the 
photometric method, and DNA damage was analyzed by the comet assay method. 
Oxidative stress index (OSI) and disulfide (DIS) values were calculated.
RESULTS: As a result of the experiments, HGB, HCT, and RBC increased with 
treatment. While TAS, TT, and NT as antioxidant parameters increased; TOS, OSI, 
and DIS decreased with treatment compared to pretreatment. DNA damage was also 
found to decrease with treatment. Additionally, these data were statistically 
significant (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: It was found that oxidative stress and DNA damage decreased with 
oral B12 treatment in children with B12 deficiency, and clinical parameters were 
also improved."
518,"BACKGROUND: Protamine administration post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can 
potentially cause hemodynamic instability. Histamine released from mast cells is 
believed to be responsible for hypotension after protamine administration. The 
aim of this study was to examine the effects of pretreatment with H1 and H2 
antihistamines on changes in systemic arterial pressure following protamine 
administration.
METHODS: This study was a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 
conducted at a university hospital. Forty adult patients undergoing elective 
coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) or single valve surgery were included. The 
patients were randomly allocated (20 patients in each group) to receive a single 
dose of combined chlorpheniramine 10 mg and ranitidine 50 mg or normal saline 
intravenously immediately after separation from CPB prior to protamine 
administration. Trajectory changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean 
arterial pressure (MAP), and vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) from baseline 
until 35 minutes following protamine administration (24-time points) were 
compared between the two groups. Serial serum tryptase levels were also obtained 
at baseline, 30 and 60 minutes after protamine was given.
RESULTS: Forty patients were included in the analysis. Demographic and baseline 
blood pressure were similar between the two groups. At 30 minutes after 
protamine administration, there were no significant differences in both crude 
SBP [mean difference: -7.1 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.1 to 15.3 
mmHg, P=0.09] and SBP after adjustment for the European System for Cardiac 
Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE II), CPB time, and VIS (mean difference: 
-3.9 mmHg, 95% CI, -11.9 to 4.0 mmHg, P=0.33). There were also no significant 
differences in crude MAP (mean difference: -2.1 mmHg, 95% CI, -6.9 to 2.7 mmHg, 
P=0.39) and adjusted MAP (mean difference: -0.7 mmHg, -5.9 to 4.4 mmHg, P=0.78) 
between the two groups. None of the patients in both groups had a significant 
increase in serum tryptase from baseline. No differences in median serum 
tryptase levels at baseline, 30 and 60 minutes were demonstrated between the two 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with H1 and H2 antihistamines does not attenuate blood 
pressure responses to protamine administration in patients after CPB. Mechanisms 
other than histamine release from mast cells might be responsible for 
protamine-induced cardiovascular changes.

519,"BACKGROUND: Data is lacking as to the clinical presentation of erosive 
esophagitis (EE) in neurologically impaired children compared to 
non-neurologically impaired children (non-NIC). To determinate the clinical 
presentation, associations, management, and outcomes of EE in neurologically 
impaired children compared to children without neurologic impairment.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all esophagogastroduodenoscopies 
performed in pediatric patients at the University of Mississippi Medical Center 
from 1998 to 2020 with the diagnosis of EE. Fisher's exact test was used to 
compare results from neurologically impaired children group and non-NIC. A 
probability <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were diagnosed with EE and met study criteria. 
Twenty-six patients were neurologically impaired children, and 21 were non- 
neurologically impaired children. No significant difference was seen between age 
at diagnosis, sex, or hematologic markers of anemia. The most common indication 
for esophagogastroduodenoscopies in neurologically impaired children was 
hematemesis (65.4%), whereas abdominal pain (33.3%) was the most common in 
non-NIC. Neurologically impaired children were more likely to be treated with 
acid-blockade. Nine neurologically impaired children had gastrostomy tubes prior 
to diagnosis as opposed to 0 non-neurologically impaired children. After 
diagnosis, 8 neurologically impaired children underwent gastrostomy tube 
placement compared to 0 non-neurologically impaired children, and fundoplication 
was performed in 11 neurologically impaired children as compared to 1 non-NIC. 
The sensitivity of fecal occult blood test for detecting EE was higher for 
neurologically impaired children (91.7%) than for non-NIC (33.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: EE in neurologically impaired children presents differently than in 
non-neurologically impaired children with blood loss being the most common 
presentation in neurologically impaired children. Neurologically impaired 
children are more likely to be treated with acid-blockade prior to diagnosis, 
likely due to heightened risk for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
Additionally, they are more likely to undergo surgical management of EE than 
non- neurologically impaired children."
520,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence of portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) after 
splenectomy in patients with Wilson disease (WD) can lead to serious 
complications. The early identification of high-risk patients can help improve 
patient prognosis. This study aimed to establish and validate a personalized 
nomogram for assessing the risk of PVST after splenectomy in patients with WD 
and hypersplenism.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data from 81 patients with WD and 
hypersplenism who underwent splenectomy. Based on whether PVST occurred within a 
month after the operation, they were divided into the PVST group and the 
non-PVST group. The clinical data of the 2 groups were compared, and univariate 
analysis was used to select the statistically significant features and 
incorporated into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression model for optimization. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
used to determine the independent risk factors for PVST after splenectomy, which 
were then applied to establish a personalized nomogram. We calculated the 
concordance (C)-index and drew the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve, the model calibration curve, and the clinical decision analysis (DCA) 
curve to evaluate the accuracy, calibration, and clinical applicability of the 
model, respectively. We used bootstrapping for internal validation of the model.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the differences in preoperative portal 
vein diameter and velocity of portal blood flow, postoperative mean platelet 
volume (MPV), mean platelet distribution width (PDW), D-dimer, prothrombin time 
(PT), and the increase of platelet count (PLT) were of statistical significance 
(P<0.05). According to the results of the LASSO and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses, a model including preoperative portal vein diameter, 
preoperative portal blood flow velocity, postoperative D-dimer, and the increase 
of PLT was established to predict the risk of PVST after splenectomy. The model 
showed good accuracy with a C-index of 0.838 (95% CI: 0.750-0.926) and had a 
well-fitted calibration curve. Furthermore, internal validation showed it 
achieved a moderate C-index of 0.805. The DCA curve indicated that the model has 
clinical applicability when patients are treated at thresholds of 2-100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a predictive model for the risk of PVST in patients 
with WD and hypersplenism after splenectomy can help clinicians identify 
patients at high risk of PVST who require intervention measures."
521,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a common 
etiology of acute vertebrobasilar artery occlusion (VBAO) in Asia, which 
complicated endovascular treatment (EVT). We aimed to investigate the incidence, 
impacts, and predictors of ICAD in VBAO.
METHODS: Subjects were selected from the ANGEL-ACT registry and divided into two 
groups based on whether underlying ICAD existed. Underlying ICAD was determined 
when the following situations arise in the occlusion site during EVT: 1) fixed 
stenosis degree >70% or 2) stenosis >50% with distal blood flow impairment or 
evidence of repeated reocclusion. Multivariable regression models were used to 
investigate the effect of underlying ICAD on outcomes measured by modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days, and to identify baseline characteristics 
associated with underlying ICAD.
RESULTS: Among the 315 patients enrolled, 171 (54.3%) had underlying ICAD. 
Favorable functional outcomes (mRS 0-3) occurred in 79 of 163 patients (48.5%) 
with ICAD and 69 of 137 patients (50.4%) without ICAD (P=0.743). Outcomes were 
similar between the two groups and remained similar after adjusting for the 
confounders. History of hypertension and elevated admission neutrophil to 
lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were strong predictors of underlying ICAD, whereas 
history of atrial fibrillation and distal basilar artery occlusion were negative 
predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, underlying ICAD was recognized in approximately half 
of the VBAO patients, leading to comparable outcomes after more complex EVT 
strategies. Some baseline characteristics were identified to be predictors for 
underlying ICAD, which were helpful to guide the EVT strategies before the 
procedure.Data access statement: The data that support the findings of this 
study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."
522,"A 15-year-old pony was presented for acute neurological signs. Neurological 
examination suggested a brainstem lesion, blood laboratory tests detected an 
active inflammatory process, and upper respiratory endoscopy identified a 
suppurative lesion at the dorsal aspect of the right guttural pouch. Computed 
tomography was performed and findings were consistent with pituitary abscess, 
meningitis, and atlanto-occipital joint septic arthritis. Imaging findings were 
confirmed based on cerebrospinal and synovial fluid cultures and necropsy. 
Computed tomography provided important information for identifying the cause of 
the patient's neurological signs and helped the owner make a final decision for 
euthanasia."
523,"BACKGROUND: Louse-borne trench fever caused by Bartonella quintana is a 
neglected public health concern, known to be transmitted from body louse faeces 
via scratching. No viable B. quintana have ever been isolated from head lice 
before; therefore, their role as a vector is still poorly understood.
METHODS: In Senegal, the implementation of a permanent local surveillance system 
in a Point-of-Care laboratory (POC) allows the monitoring of emerging diseases. 
Here, we used culture as well as molecular and genomic approaches to document an 
outbreak of trench fever associated with head lice in the village of Ndiop. Head 
lice and blood samples were collected from febrile patients between November 
2010 and April 2015. Genomes of two isolated strains of B. quintana were 
sequenced and analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 2,289 blood samples were collected in the 2010-2015 period. 
From 2010-2013, B. quintana DNA was detected by PCR in 0.25% (4/1,580). In 2014, 
228 blood samples were collected, along with 161 head lice from five 
individuals. B. quintana DNA was detected in 4·4% (10/228) of blood samples, and 
in lice specimens collected from febrile patients (61·7%, 50/81) and non-febrile 
patients (61·4%, 43/70). Two B. quintana strains were isolated from blood and 
head lice from two different patients. Genomic sequence analysis showed 99·98% 
overall similarity between both strains.
CONCLUSION: The presence of live B. quintana in head lice, and the genetic 
identity of strains from patients' blood and head lice during a localised 
outbreak in Senegal, supports the evidence of head lice vectorial capacity."
524,"Today, cancer is one of the main health-related challenges, and in the meantime, 
breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women, with an 
alarming number of incidences and deaths every year. For this reason, the 
discovery of novel and more effective approaches for the diagnosis, treatment, 
and monitoring of the disease are very important. In this regard, scientists are 
looking for diagnostic molecules to achieve the above-mentioned goals with 
higher accuracy and specificity. RNA interference (RNAi) is a posttranslational 
regulatory process mediated by microRNA intervention and small interfering RNAs. 
After transcription and edition, these two noncoding RNAs are integrated and 
activated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and AGO2 to connect the 
target mRNA by their complementary sequence and suppress their translation, thus 
reducing the expression of their target genes. These two RNAi categories show 
different patterns in different BC types and stages compared to healthy cells, 
and hence, these molecules have high diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic 
potentials. This article aims to review the RNAi pathway and diagnostic and 
therapeutic potentials with a special focus on BC."
525,"Migrating birds face a myriad of hazards, including higher exposure to parasites 
and numerous competing energy demands. It follows that migration may act as a 
selective filter and limit population growth. Understanding how individual-level 
physiological condition and disease status scale up to population dynamics 
through differential survival of individuals is necessary to identify threats 
and management interventions for migratory populations, many of which face 
increasing conservation challenges. However, linking individual physiological 
condition, parasite infection status and survival can be difficult. We examined 
the relationship among two measures of physiological condition [scaled-mass 
index and heterophil/leukocyte (H/L) ratio], hematozoa (i.e. hemoparasites) 
presence and abundance, and constitutive immunity in 353 autumn migrating 
red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis calurus) from 2004 to 2018. Hematazoa (i.e. 
Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) were in the blood smears from 139 red-tailed 
hawks (39.4%). H/L ratio decreased with scaled-mass index. Adults had a 
significantly higher H/L ratio than juveniles. Our two measures of immune 
defences, hemolytic-complement activity and bacteria-killing ability, were 
highly positively correlated. Our most notable finding was a negative 
relationship between Haemoproteus parasitemia and survival (i.e. documented 
individual mortality), indicating that haemosporidian parasites influence 
survival during a challenging life stage. The effect of haemosporidian parasites 
on individuals is often debated, and we provide evidence that parasitemia can 
affect individual survival. In contrast, we did not find evidence of trade-offs 
between survival and immune defences."
526,"The definition of autoimmune neutropenias (AIN) has been based on the 
demonstration of autoantibodies directed to various epitopes on blood 
neutrophils. However, this definition is probably too limited and excludes 
neutropenias (NPs) with a negative autoantibody test but with other phenomena 
that indicate an underlying autoimmune process. Examples of such AINs may be 
complete or incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases 
where NP is common but patients may not fulfill formal diagnostic criteria for a 
rheumatic disease. Recently, various inherited immune-dysregulation syndromes, 
such as those related to variants in, for example, TACI, BAFFR, ACKR1/DARC, 
LRBA, CTLA 4 genes, with dysregulated B- and T-lymphocyte functions, have been 
associated with concomitant AINs. Cellular immune mechanisms may also play a 
prominent role in the development of NP, in the presence or not of 
autoantibodies, in cases of large granular lymphocyte syndromes of T- and 
NK-cell types or in chronic idiopathic NP, particularly in adults with T-cell 
clonal populations. The course of AIN may differ according to age, being 
transient and rather uncomplicated in children, and chronic with treatment 
requirement in adolescents and adults. This review discusses current knowledge 
of AINs, including diagnostic procedures, treatments, and prognosis."
527,"Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous 
disease with poor clinical outcome. Our previous work had demonstrated that 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analyses were feasible in ENKTL, and dynamic 
tracing of ctDNA could be used to monitor the disease status. However, the 
prognostic value of ctDNA in ENKTL has not been fully investigated. Patients 
with newly diagnosed ENKTL from February 2017 to December 2021 (n = 70) were 
enrolled. The pretreatment ctDNA concentration (hGE/mL) was measured. The 
prognostic value of ctDNA, international prognostic index (IPI), Korean 
prognostic index (KPI), PINK-E, and the combination of PINK-E and ctDNA 
(PINK-EC) were investigated in our cohort. The IPI and PINK-E risk categories 
had a significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) between the low-risk and intermediate-risk groups. The KPI risk 
category had a difference in PFS and OS between the intermediate-risk and 
high-risk groups. Furthermore, integrating ctDNA into the PINK-E model could 
overcome the shortcomings of other prognostic models, which could significantly 
distinguish the different-risk groups. Overall, our results demonstrated that 
PINK-EC showed a superior prognostic prediction value and stability compared 
with IPI, KPI, and PINK-E. The integration of molecular features of the tumor 
into classic risk categories might better characterize a high-risk group where 
novel treatment approaches are most needed."
528,"AIM: Coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia differs from ordinary pneumonia in that 
it is associated with lesions that reduce pulmonary perfusion. Dual-energy 
computed tomography is well suited to elucidate the etiology of coronavirus 
disease 2019 pneumonia, because it highlights changes in organ blood flow. In 
this study, we investigated whether dual-energy computed tomography could be 
used to determine the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia.
METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, 
admitted to our hospital, and underwent dual-energy computed tomography were 
included in this study. Dual-energy computed tomography findings, plane computed 
tomography findings, disease severity, laboratory data, and clinical features 
were compared between two groups: a critical group (18 patients) and a 
non-critical group (30 patients).
RESULTS: The dual-energy computed tomography results indicated that the 
percentage of flow loss was significantly higher in the critical group compared 
with the non-critical group (P < 0.001). Additionally, our data demonstrated 
that thrombotic risk was associated with differences in clinical characteristics 
(P = 0.018). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the 
percentage of flow loss, evaluated using dual-energy computed tomography, could 
predict severity in the critical group with 100% sensitivity and 77% 
specificity. However, there were no significant differences in the receiver 
operating characteristic values for dual-energy computed tomography and plane 
computed tomography.
CONCLUSION: Dual-energy computed tomography can be used to associate the 
severity of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia with high accuracy. Further 
studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions."
529,"Uncontrolled bleeding is linked to higher treatment costs, risk of post-surgical 
infection and increased disease and death. Hemostatic agents are used to treat 
excessive bleeding. A good hemostatic agent controls bleeding effectively, 
reduces the need for blood transfusion, removes the need for systemic drugs to 
control bleeding, results in shorter surgery time, and reduces the cost and 
length of hospital stay of the patient. Gelatin-based hemostatic agents have 
been widely used in medical and dental procedures, owing to their 
biodegradability and biocompatibility, as well as availability and low cost of 
raw materials. In this narrative literature review, we discuss the background 
and different types of gelatin-based hemostatic agents in medical and dental 
procedures, the comparison of gelatin-based and non-gelatin-based hemostatic 
agents, and the usage and development of enhanced or novel gelatin-based 
hemostatic agents. Gelatin-based hemostatic agents are effective and important 
part of bleeding control, as evidenced by its wide application in medicine and 
dentistry. The development of novel combination gelatin-based hemostatic agents 
has much potential for effective control of excessive bleeding."

531,"BACKGROUND: While people with cardiac disease are known to be at increased 
lifetime risk of depression, little is known about postpartum depression rates 
in this population. Describing rates of positive postpartum depression screens 
and identifying risk factors that are unique to cardiac patients may help inform 
risk reduction strategies.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included pregnant patients with 
congenital and/or acquired cardiac disease who delivered at a single institution 
between 2014 and 2020. The primary outcome was a positive postpartum depression 
screen, defined as Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Score (EPDS) ≥10. Potential 
exposures were selected a priori and compared between patients with and without 
a positive postpartum depression screen using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher's 
exact tests. Secondary outcomes were responses to a longitudinal follow-up 
survey sent to English-speaking patients evaluating cardiac status, mental 
health, and infant development.
RESULTS: Of 126 eligible cardiac patients, 23 (18.3%) had a positive postpartum 
depression screen. Patients with a positive postpartum depression screen were 
more likely to have had antepartum anticoagulation with heparin or enoxaparin 
(56.5% versus 26.2%, p=0.007), blood transfusion during delivery (8.7% versus 
0%, p=0.032), and maternal-infant separation postpartum (52.2% versus 28.2%, 
p=0.047) compared to patients with a negative screen. Among 29 patients with a 
positive screen who responded to the follow up survey, 50% reported being 
formally diagnosed with anxiety or depression and 33.3% reported child 
development problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of screening for postpartum 
depression in patients with cardiac disease, especially those requiring 
antepartum anticoagulation or maternal-infant separation postpartum."
532,"Hookworm infection is caused by the blood-feeding hookworm gastrointestinal 
nematodes. Its harmful effects include anemia and retarded growth and are common 
in the tropics. A current control method involves the mass drug administration 
of synthetic drugs, mainly albendazole and mebendazole. There are however 
concerns of low efficacy and drug resistance due to their repeated and excessive 
use. Although, Necator americanus glutathione S-transferase 3 (Na-GST-3) is a 
notable target, using natural product libraries for computational elucidation of 
promising leads is underexploited. This study sought to use pharmacoinformatics 
techniques to identify compounds of natural origins with the potential to be 
further optimized as promising inhibitors. A compendium of 3182 African natural 
products together with five known helminth GST inhibitors including Cibacron 
blue was screened against the active sites of the Na-GST-3 structure (PDB ID: 
3W8S). The hit compounds were profiled to ascertain the mechanisms of binding, 
anthelmintic bioactivity, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. The 
AutoDock Vina docking protocol was validated by obtaining 0.731 as the area 
under the curve calculated via the receiver operating characteristics curve. 
Four compounds comprising ZINC85999636, ZINC35418176, ZINC14825190, and 
Dammarane Triterpene13 were identified as potential lead compounds with binding 
energies less than -9.0 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the selected compounds formed key 
intermolecular interactions with critical residues Tyr95, Gly13 and Ala14. 
Notably, ZINC85999636, ZINC14825190, and dammarane triterpene13 were predicted 
as anthelmintics, whilst all the four molecules shared structural similarities 
with known inhibitors. Molecular modelling showed that the compounds had 
reasonably good binding free energies. More so, they had high binding affinities 
when screened against other variants of the Na-GST, namely Na-GST-1 and 
Na-GST-2. Ligand quality assessment using ligand efficiency dependent 
lipophilicity, ligand efficiency, ligand efficiency scale and fit quality scale 
showed the molecules are worthy candidates for further optimization. The 
inhibitory potentials of the molecules warrant in vitro studies to evaluate 
their effect on the heme regulation mechanisms."
533,"Recent advances in remote-photoplethysmography (rPPG) have enabled the 
measurement of heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and blood pressure 
(BP) in a fully contactless manner. These techniques are increasingly applied 
clinically given a desire to minimize exposure to individuals with infectious 
symptoms. However, accurate rPPG estimation often leads to heavy loading in 
computation that either limits its real-time capacity or results in a costly 
setup. Additionally, acquiring rPPG while maintaining protective distance would 
require high resolution cameras to ensure adequate pixels coverage for the 
region of interest, increasing computational burden. Here, we propose a 
cost-effective platform capable of the real-time, continuous, multi-subject 
monitoring while maintaining social distancing. The platform is composed of a 
centralized computing unit and multiple low-cost wireless cameras. We 
demonstrate that the central computing unit is able to simultaneously handle 
continuous rPPG monitoring of five subjects with social distancing without 
compromising the frame rate and rPPG accuracy."

537,"Cortical cholinergic deficits contribute to cognitive decline and other deficits 
in Parkinson's disease. Cross-sectional imaging studies suggest a stereotyped 
pattern of posterior-to-anterior cortical cholinergic denervation accompanying 
disease progression in Parkinson's disease. We used serial acetylcholinesterase 
PET ligand imaging to characterize the trajectory of regional cholinergic 
synapse deficits in Parkinson's disease, testing the hypothesis of 
posterior-to-anterior progression of cortical cholinergic deficits. The 16 
Parkinson's disease subjects (4 females/12 males; mean age: 64.4 ± 6.7 years; 
disease duration: 5.5 ± 4.2 years; Hoehn & Yahr stage: 2.3 ± 0.6 at entry) 
completed serial 11C-methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate acetylcholinesterase PET 
scans over a 4-8 year period (median 5 years). Three-dimensional stereotactic 
cortical surface projections and volume-of-interest analyses were performed. 
Cholinergic synapse integrity was assessed by the magnitude, k 3, of 
acetylcholinesterase hydrolysis of 11C-methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate. Based on 
normative data, we generated Z-score maps for both the k 3 and the k 1 
parameters, the latter as a proxy for regional cerebral blood flow. Compared 
with control subjects, baseline scans showed predominantly posterior cortical k 
3 deficits in Parkinson's disease subjects. Interval change analyses showed 
evidence of posterior-to-anterior progression of cholinergic cortical deficits 
in the posterior cortices. In frontal cortices, an opposite gradient of 
anterior-to-posterior progression of cholinergic deficits was found. The 
topography of k 3 changes exhibited regionally specific disconnection from k 1 
changes. Interval-change analysis based on k 3/k 1 ratio images (k 3 adjustment 
for regional cerebral blood flow changes) showed interval reductions (up to 20%) 
in ventral frontal, anterior cingulate and Brodmann area 6 cortices. In 
contrast, interval k 3 reductions in the posterior cortices, especially Brodmann 
areas 17-19, were largely proportional to k 1 changes. Our results partially 
support the hypothesis of progressive posterior-to-cortical cholinergic 
denervation in Parkinson's disease. This pattern appears characteristic of 
posterior cortices. In frontal cortices, an opposite pattern of 
anterior-to-posterior progression of cholinergic deficits was found. The 
progressive decline of posterior cortical acetylcholinesterase activity was 
largely proportional to declining regional cerebral blood flow, suggesting that 
posterior cortical cholinergic synapse deficits are part of a generalized loss 
of synapses. The disproportionate decline in regional frontal cortical 
acetylcholinesterase activity relative to regional cerebral blood flow suggests 
preferential loss or dysregulation of cholinergic synapses in these regions. Our 
observations suggest that cortical cholinergic synapse vulnerability in 
Parkinson's disease is mediated by both diffuse processes affecting cortical 
synapses and processes specific to subpopulations of cortical cholinergic 
afferents."
538,"Self-organized microvascular networks (MVNs) have become key to the development 
of many microphysiological models. However, the self-organizing nature of this 
process combined with variations between types or batches of endothelial cells 
(ECs) often lead to inconsistency or failure to form functional MVNs. Since 
interstitial flow (IF) has been reported to play a beneficial role in 
angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and 3D capillary morphogenesis, we systematically 
investigated the role IF plays during neovessel formation in a customized single 
channel microfluidic chip for which IF has been fully characterized. Compared to 
static conditions, MVNs formed under IF have higher vessel density and diameters 
and greater network perfusability. Through a series of inhibitory experiments, 
we demonstrated that IF treatment improves vasculogenesis by ECs through 
upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). We then successfully 
implemented a novel strategy involving the interplay between IF and MMP-2 
inhibitor to regulate morphological parameters of the self-organized MVNs, with 
vascular permeability and perfusability well maintained. The revealed mechanism 
and proposed methodology were further validated with a brain MVN model. Our 
findings and methods have the potential to be widely utilized to boost the 
development of various organotypic MVNs and could be incorporated into related 
bioengineering applications where perfusable vasculature is desired."
539,"OBJECTIVE: Acute tissue ischaemia may arise due to arterial emergencies or 
during more complex vascular procedures and may be mitigated by temporary 
shunting techniques. Endovascular shunting (ES) techniques enable percutaneous 
access and shunting from the donor artery without the need to completely 
interrupt the arterial flow in the donor artery. An endoshunt system may also 
cover longer distances than most conventional shunts. The aim was to investigate 
and optimise the flow rates in different endovascular shunt systems.
METHODS: Step 1: The flow capacity of different ES configurations was compared 
with the flow capacity of a 9 Fr Pruitt-Inahara shunt (PIS). An intravenous bag 
with 0.9% NaCl, pressurised to 90 mmHg, was connected simultaneously to a PIS 
and to one of the tested ES configurations. The two shunt systems were then 
opened at the same time. The delivered fluid volumes from the shunt systems were 
collected and measured. The volume flow rate was subsequently calculated. Steps 
2 and 3: Within a heart lung machine circuit, pressure-flow charts were 
constructed for the individual ES components and for the fully connected 
optimised endoshunt systems. The flow rate was increased in steps of 40-50 
mL/min while monitoring the driving pressure, enabling the creation and 
comparison of the pressure-flow charts for the individually tested components. 
In total, seven individual inflow and outflow potential ES components were 
investigated with inflow and outflow diameters ranging from 6 to 15 Fr.
RESULTS: ES systems based on standard donor introducers led to substantially 
lower volume flow than the corresponding PIS volume flow, whereas ES systems 
based on dedicated 6 or 8 Fr dialysis access introducers (Prelude Short Sheet, 
Merit Medical) matched PIS flow rates. The introduction of 30 cm long ¼'' 
perfusion tubing within the ES system did not affect volume flow for any of the 
tested ES configurations.
CONCLUSION: Endoshunting techniques can match PIS volume flow rates over short 
and long distances. The achieved ES flow rate is highly dependent on the 
components used within the ES system."
540,"BACKGROUND: About 5 to 10 percent of the population in developed countries are 
affected by autoimmune diseases. One of the most important autoimmune disease 
with high prevalence rate is Multiple sclerosis in which there is currently no 
definitive cure for it, and most medications such as interferons are used only 
to limit the disease. The present study aims to investigate the effect of using 
Asparagus Officinalis fractions in an immune system mediated model of multiple 
sclerosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fractionation was performed by maceration using n-hexane, 
chloroform, chloroform-methanol (9: 1), n-Butanol and methanol solvents from 
aerial parts of Asparagus Officinalis. Thin layer chromatography, NMR and 
phenolic component measurement were done and two fractions were selected for 
checking in MS induced in vivo model.
RESULTS: It was observed that chloroform-methanolic and N-Butanol fractions had 
higher content of saponin in comparison of other extracts. Also, it was showed 
that the methanolic and n-Butanol extracts contains the highestportion of 
glycosylic steroid saponins in comparison to other fractions. Regarding 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) score, Butanolic and methanolic 
fractions with doses higher that 100mg/kg showed a potent supportive effects as 
long as locomotor activity protection even in lower dose in comparison to 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) group.
CONCLUSION: Considering the proved different effects of saponin compounds on the 
immune system we observed that those fractions altered the circulatory 
peripheral blood cells and also remit the clinical signs after EAE induction 
along with enhanced myelin sheath content in the median region of corpus 
callusom. It could be inferred that this fractions are promising candidates for 
further investigation as dose-dependent immune system regulating compounds in 
multiple sclerosis patients."
541,"Filamentous fungus biomass is a protein-rich food, which can serve as an 
alternative to animal, plant, and legume protein sources. Neurospora crassa is a 
filamentous fungus that typically grows in tropical and sub-tropical regions. 
Traditionally, N. crassa has served as a model eukaryotic organism due to its 
ease of growth and propagation and suitability for genetic manipulation. 
However, filamentous fungi, such as Neurospora, have also been consumed or used 
to produce fermented foods for centuries and have been developed into 
protein-rich biomass ingredients to be used in conventional foods and meat 
substitutes. A panel of toxicological tests including genotoxic, acute, and 
subchronic studies were conducted on dried N. crassa biomass to support its safe 
use in food. The dried N. crassa biomass was found to be not genotoxic in a 
bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, an in vitro chromosomal aberration 
test, and an in vivo micronucleus test. In the acute and subchronic toxicity 
studies, rats were orally gavaged with N. crassa biomass at concentrations of 0, 
1,000, 2,500, and 5,000 mg/kg body weight/day for 14 and 90 days, respectively. 
At the conclusion of the studies, there were no test article-related toxicity 
results observed in clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmology, hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, thyroid hormone, 
urinalysis, and macroscopic and microscopic findings. The

542,"Fipronil (FPN) is phenylpyrazole insecticide extensively used to control a wide 
variety of pests. Betanin (BET) is a natural colorant with promising antioxidant 
and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to investigate the potential

rats. Forty rats were assigned into 4 equal groups; Group I (Control); Group II 
(BET) received 20 mg/kg b.wt/day; Group III (FPN) received 4.8 mg/kg b.wt/day; 
and Group IV (BET/FPN). All treatments were given orally for 90 days. At the end 
of experiment, blood samples were collected for analysis of serum urea and 
creatinine. Kidneys were harvested for determination of kidney injury 
molecule-1(KIM-1) level; gene expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 
factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 
(NQO-1); oxidative stress biomarkers including malondialdehyde (MDA), protein 
carbonyl content (PCC), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), 
and reduced glutathione (GSH). Histopathological examination and 
immunohistochemical investigation of Nrf2, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and 
caspase-3 were also undertaken. The results revealed kidney dysfunction, 
downregulation of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1 genes, redox imbalance, structural 
damage, decreased Nrf2 and increased NF-κB immune-expression, in addition to 
strong caspase-3 immunoreactivity in FPN-treated group. In the combined group, 
BET co-administration resulted in functional and structural amelioration, 
up-regulation of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1 genes, mitigation of redox imbalance, and 
strong anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. In conclusion, BET via 
activation of Nrf2-HO-1/NQO-1 pathway, exhibits beneficial antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects against FPN-induced nephrotoxicity."
543,"Background: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the 
treatment protocols are continuously updated, based on the evidence gathered all 
around the world and reported to the World Health Organization. Like many other 
emerging infectious diseases, using convalescent plasma from those recovered 
from the disease was a preliminary treatment approach that showed partial 
effectiveness for severe COVID-19 patients. Besides, blood filtration 
strategies, such as hemoperfusion and plasmapheresis, are employed to lessen the 
load of inflammatory molecules. However, few studies compared their effects to 
conclude which treatment might be more efficacious for COVID-19 patients. We 
compared the effects of plasmapheresis or plasma exchange, convalescent plasma 
therapy, and hemoperfusion on O2 saturation and inflammatory factors in COVID-19 
patients. Methods: In this retrospective study, 50 COVID-19 patients received 
standard treatments based the international guidelines. Patients were divided 
into 4 groups: hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, plasma therapy, and control. The 
control group received only the standard treatments. The mortality rate, O2 
saturation, and laboratory factors were compared between the 4 groups. Results: 
We found a significant decrease in the C-reactive protein level following 
hemoperfusion (32.75 ± 23.76 vs 13 ± 7.54 mg/dL; p = 0.032) but not 
plasmapheresis and plasma therapy. Besides, serum levels of lactate 
dehydrogenase (p = 0.327, 0.136, 0.550, for hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and 
plasma therapy, respectively) and other inflammatory molecules did not 
significantly change following treatments. There is also no significant 
difference in the mortality rate between the treatment groups (p = 0.353). 
Conclusion: It seems that hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and plasma therapy did 
not have considerable effects on decreasing the inflammation and mortality rate 
compared with standard treatment."
544,"Objective: Worldwide, preeclampsia (PE) is a multifactorial disorder reported in 
2-5% of pregnancies, which increases mortality during pregnancy. In general, 
10-15% of maternal deaths are directly related to PE and eclampsia. One of the 
susceptibility genes for PE is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expressed by most 
immune cells. TNF-α is a protein involved in various biological processes, 
including proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the expression of inflammatory 
genes. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of TNF-α single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -308G/A (rs1800629) and their relationship with 
TNF-α in PE patients. Materials and methods: The SNP was genotyped in 90 cases 
and 90 controls. Whole blood was collected from women with PE and normal 
pregnancy in EDTA containing tubes, and DNA extraction was performed from their 
blood lymphocytes according to a standard phenol-chloroform procedure. Then, DNA 
was genotyped by real-time PCR and the polymorphism was detected by TaqMan 
assay. Serum levels of TNF-α protein were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent (ELISA) assay. Results: TNF-α levels in women with PE were 
significantly higher than in healthy ones (p<0.001). We did not observe any 
correlation between allelic outbreak (p=0.3) and TNF-α-308G/A polymorphism 
(p=0.7) with the incidence of PE. Conclusion: Although TNF-α-308G/A gene 
polymorphism does not appear to affect susceptibility to PE, an increased level 
of serum TNF-α can be used as a predictor for PE during pregnancy. We recommend 
that more research be conducted on possible factors related to the incidence of 
PE."
545,"Objective: Umbilical cord hematoma and uterine torsion are extremely rare 
complications in pregnancy. However, these should not be neglected in clinical 
practice in condition of abnormal fetal heart monitoring without others 
suspects. We hereby report rare case of umbilical cord hematoma and uterine 
torsion as well as review the literature. Through this report, we aim to mention 
on an available tool to investigate spontaneous umbilical cord hematoma on fetal 
well-being in such a case. Case report : A women aged 35 years old (G1P0) 
admitted to our hospital for term gestation with uncomplicated pregnancy, except 
large uterine fibroid accompanied with cervical pessary. Then, an uncommon 
complication of umbilical cord hematoma was revealed accidentally upon cesarean 
section. Particularly, this dramatic event was happened along with an 
asymptomatic uterine torsion noticed at the same time. Preoperative diagnosis of 
two rare complications was missed, hence, we extracted timely baby based on 
another modality of management, computerized cardiotocography. Conclusion: 
Umbilical cord hematoma along with uterine torsion is difficult to diagnosis due 
to its rarity. Moreover, no available tool could investigate umbilical cord 
hematoma prior to delivery. Surveillance on fetal heart rate monitoring may be 
helpful in this situation."
546,"A reverse medial plantar flap is a major option for reconstructing the plantar 
forefoot. However, reconstruction of the distal forefoot stretches the vessels, 
causing tightness, and the skin graft to the donor site adds pressure to the 
vessel, precipitating venous congestion. We used a reverse medial plantar flap 
to reconstruct the lateral distal forefoot with a flow-through of the 
anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap for donor site coverage to maintain physiological 
and stable blood flow. A 74-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 
20-year history of left forefoot skin tumor. The tumor was resected, and 
histological examination revealed porocarcinoma in the cystic poroid 
hidradenoma. Additional excision was performed, and the defect area was covered 
with a biodegradable artificial dermis. The skin defect of the lateral distal 
plantar area was reconstructed with a reverse medial plantar flap with a reverse 
flow Y-V pedicle extension method, and the donor site was reconstructed with an 
ALT flap interposing the lateral circumflex femoral artery with the transected 
posterior tibial artery. The flap was completely engrafted without any 
complications, including arterial ischemia or venous congestion, during or after 
surgery. A distally based reverse medial plantar flap with a reverse flow Y-V 
pedicle extension method and flow-through of the ALT flap should be considered 
for the reconstruction of the lateral distal forefoot with a large defect. This 
method can maximize flap extension and maintain stable arterial inflow and 
venous drainage without the major complications of venous congestion."
547,"Split-thickness skin grafts (STSG) are an effective modality for lower extremity 
wound coverage. Many patients in the highly comorbid chronic wound population 
present with cardiovascular disease requiring chronic antiplatelet or 
anticoagulant therapy, theoretically increasing risk for bleeding complications, 
donor site morbidity, and poor graft take. Some surgeons advocate temporary 
cessation of antithrombotic therapy, which may increase cardiovascular risk. The 
objective of this study was to examine the effects of anticoagulation use on 
STSG outcomes.
METHODS: All patients receiving STSGs for lower extremity wounds from 2014 to 
2016 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Successful grafts 
were defined as greater than 99.5% wound coverage. Patients were divided into 
two groups: anticoagulation/antiplatelet or no anticoagulation/antiplatelet. 
Continuous variables were described by means and SDs and analyzed using 
student's t-test. Categorical variables were described by frequencies and 
percentages and analyzed using Chi-square or Fisher exact tests as appropriate.
RESULTS: In total, 231 wounds were identified among 189 patients; 124 patients 
were receiving at least one antiplatelet/anticoagulant at time of grafting. 
Three hematomas were reported during 30 days of follow-up; there was no 
significant difference between groups (P > 0.05). Anticoagulation/antiplatelet 
therapy in the perioperative period had no significant impact on STSG take and 
overall healing.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study demonstrate that administration of 
anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents in the perioperative period does not increase 
the risk of skin graft failure. Based on these findings, STSG can be performed 
without cessation of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy."
548,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the method, efficacy, 
and safety of endovascular treatment (EVT) of delayed splenic artery branch 
(SAB) hemorrhage after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
METHODS: From March 2019 to January 2022, all patients underwent EVT of SAB for 
delayed post-pancreaticoduodenectomy hemorrhage were included. Demographic, 
laboratory, angiographic, and clinical follow-up data were collected and 
analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of eight patients were enrolled. In two patients, celiac axis 
angiography alone failed, but selective splenic artery (SA) angiography 
demonstrated the SAB bleeding; SAB erosions in four patients with recurrent 
bleeding were successfully detected by a second angiography; four patients 
underwent balloon catheter placement at the SA for temporary hemostasis and to 
further confirm the SAB bleeding before the subsequent EVT. Superselective 
embolization was performed in only one patient (12.5%; 1/8); covered stent 
implantation at the SA was performed in two patients (25%; 2/8); Embolization of 
the SA was performed in the remaining five patients (62.5%; 5/8). The technical 
success rate, clinical success rate, and in-hospital mortality were 100.0%, 
87.5%, and 25%, respectively. No severe complications related to EVT occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: EVT of SAB for delayed post-pancreaticoduodenectomy hemorrhage is 
effective and safe. An awareness of the SAB as a potential bleeding source, 
together with appropriate endovascular procedures including selective SA 
angiography, repeat angiography, balloon catheter placement at the SA, and 
applicable hemostasis protocol, could achieve a high success rate of managing 
SAB hemorrhage."
549,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ovarian volume (OV) alone is an independent 
marker for metabolic dysfunction in women with suspected androgen excess.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary academic reproductive endocrinology clinic.
PATIENTS: Women aged ≥21 years recruited/referred for symptoms related to 
androgen excess.
INTERVENTIONS: Transvaginal ovarian ultrasound, physical and medical evaluation, 
2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), and blood sampling.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of hyperandrogenism and metabolic dysfunction.
RESULTS: This study included 666 women, of whom 412 (61.9%) and 254 had OVs of 
>10 and ≤10 mL, respectively. An OV of >10 mL was associated with a higher 
prevalence of hirsutism (65.1% vs. 51.5%) than an OV of ≤10 mL. Polycystic ovary 
syndrome by the National Institutes of Health 1990 criteria was found in 67.3% 
and 51.4% of women with OVs of >10 and ≤10 mL, respectively. Metabolic 
parameters, including body mass index, waist circumference, and 1-hour insulin 
levels during the oGTT (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.31), 
were significantly higher in women with an OV of >10 mL than in those with an OV 
of ≤10 mL. An OV of ≤10 mL had a 76.3% negative predictive value for 
hyperinsulinemia at 1 hour.
CONCLUSIONS: In women with suspected androgen excess, an OV of >10 mL in at 
least 1 ovary is not associated with metabolic syndrome but is associated with 
younger age; an increased body mass index and waist circumference; a higher 
prevalence of hirsutism, oligoovulation, and polycystic ovary syndrome; and a 
higher 60-minute insulin level during the oGTT. Overall, an increased OV appears 
to be a good marker for hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism in women suspected 
of having an androgen excess disorder."
550,"Cattle temperament significantly impacts production traits such as reproduction. 
The objective of this study was to assess the effects of temperament on 
pregnancy rates to fixed-timed artificial insemination (TAI) in Bos taurus beef 
heifers. A total of 297 Angus influenced heifers from 3 different locations were 
evaluated for temperament based on chute score and exit velocity on the first 
day of the estrus synchronization protocol (d-9) and classified by temperament 
type based on temperament score (calm ≤ 3 < excitable). Pregnancy status was 
determined by transrectal ultrasonography approximately 40 d after TAI. Hair 
from the tail switch was collected at d-9 and at d0 (TAI) for cumulative 
cortisol evaluation. A subset of 43 heifers from location 3 had blood samples 
collected at all handling events and evaluated for cortisol concentrations. 
Overall, 71% of heifers were classified as calm whereas 29% as excitable. 
Pregnancy rates to TAI were reduced (P = 0.042) in excitable heifers compared to 
calm heifers (36% vs. 55%, respectively). Mean concentration of cortisol in the 
hair was reduced over time (P < 0.001) from d-9 (3.5 ± 0.3 pg/mg) to d0 (1.74 ± 
0.3 pg/mg) in all heifers, regardless of temperament. In addition, excitable 
heifers had increased circulating concentrations of cortisol when compared to 
calm heifers in all handling events (P = 0.015). More interestingly, despite of 
temperament, concentrations of circulating cortisol were reduced as the protocol 
events progressed, with greater cortisol concentrations on d-9, intermediate on 
d-3, and lesser on d0 (P = 0.031). Therefore, the present study demonstrates 
that heifer temperament has negative effects in pregnancy rates to TAI programs. 
However, according to blood cortisol concentrations, no chronic stress response 
was detected due to cattle handling for the TAI protocol. In fact, blood 
cortisol concentration was reduced between the initiation and completion of the 
protocol, indicating that heifers were acclimated to handing. These results 
support the adoption of acclimation protocols and proper cattle handling as a 
strategy to increase fertility of heifers that are exposed to TAI."
551,"Nocardial brain abscess is usually associated with immunodeficiency, but can 
sometimes emerge in healthy individuals. This infection can be acquired through 
inhalation or direct inoculation of the bacteria, followed by dissemination to 
various organs, including the brain, through blood circulation. Mortality rate 
due to nocardial cerebral abscess is three times higher than that associated 
with cerebral abscess caused by other types of bacteria. Moreover, patients with 
Nocardia asteroides-associated brain abscess show poorer prognosis compared to 
patients with brain abscess caused by other Nocardia species, which is probably 
due to the high tendency of N. asteroides to become resistant to numerous 
antibiotics. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to diagnose and treat N. 
asteroides cerebral abscess in patients as soon as possible. The current paper 
is a rare report of a brain abscess caused by N. asteroides in a diabetic 
patient who failed to respond to multiple antibiotics 
(trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and amikacin), but improved by receiving imipenem 
and linezolid, and was finally successfully treated by surgical operation and 
long-term antibiotic therapy (imipenem and linezolid)."
552,"OBJECTIVE: To probe the factors associated with the outcomes of traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) patients admitted to emergency department (ED).
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that data gathering was performed via 
census methods, retrospectively. During one year, all head injury's patients who 
admitted to the ED of a tertiary center in Tehran, Iran were included. Age, 
gender, mechanism of injury, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and injury severity score 
(ISS) on admission, presence of extra-cranial injuries, findings of brain 
computed tomography (CT), duration of hospitalization, and in hospital outcomes 
were recorded. Outcome's assessment for survivors was performed within a 6 
months-period after discharge based on Glasgow outcome scale (GOS). The 
variables and outcomes' association were assessed.
RESULTS: Totally, 506 patients were evaluated with the mean age of 36.77±21.1 
years that 411 (81.2%) were men. Follow up at 6-months post injury was feasible 
in 487 (96.2%) patients; 59 (11.7%) out of 506 eligible patients died. Logistic 
regression analysis showed the association between assessed variables and 
patients' outcome as follows: age>65 years (OR: 12.21; p<0.001), GCS on 
admission <8 (OR: 62.99; p<0.001), presence of traumatic Intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) in brain CT scan (OR: 20.11; p=0.010), duration of 
hospitalization ≥ 5 days (OR: 0.28; p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: The findings of the current study distinguished some variables that 
were associated with the poor outcome of the patients with TBI. Therefore, TBI 
patients with any of these risk factors may need close continues monitoring, 
early ICU admission, and some other special extra care in ED."
553,"Blunt traumatic aortic injury is a deadly phenomenon in traumatic injuries. 
Damage control is essential in the management of traumatic patients. We reported 
a 20-years-old man brought to the trauma center from a car turnover crash scene. 
Blunt traumatic aortic injury grade III was revealed by contrast-enhanced 
computed tomography requiring urgent intervention. After an uneventful open 
repair of the aorta with Dacron graft, diffuse blood oozing occurred from the 
mediastinum and left pleural cavity. We packed the thoracic bleeding sites and 
removed the packings after four days. The patient developed no signs of 
cardiopulmonary compromise until the removal of the packings. Later, the patient 
was discharged with no complications. Through the follow-ups, he had no 
complaint regarding the surgery. The patient has a normal chest x-ray one year 
later. Thoracic gauze packing is limitedly practiced due to concerns for 
cardiopulmonary compromises. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
time that this technique has been performed in the open repair of blunt 
traumatic thoracic aortic injury as damage control."
554,"Aorta dissection (AD) is a rare, life-threatening disorder resulting from a tear 
in the aortic wall and can blocking the circulation below the tear. The paired 
internal pudendal arteries, which are branches of the internal iliac arteries 
from the aortic branches, supply the penis with blood. Ischemia of the penis is 
uncommon due to its superior collateral arteries. In this case, we discuss a 
rare case of 30-year-old male with acute limb ischemia, necrosis of the penis, 
and scrotum gangrene that associated with ischemic related to aortic dissection."
555,"BACKGROUND: Oral administration of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid®) 
has shown promise in the treatment of COVID-19. Paxlovid's active antiviral 
component nirmatrelvir is co-formulated with ritonavir, a strong cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 3A4 inhibitor. Many oral targeted therapies indicated for lung cancer are 
known substrates of CYP 3A4 and concurrent use with Paxlovid may lead to 
potential drug-drug interactions (DDI). The purpose of this review is to 
evaluate the potential DDI between targeted therapies and supportive care for 
lung cancer and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir.
METHODS: A PubMed and FDA drug database search was conducted to identify 
pharmacokinetic data on oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) used in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both FDA approved and those in development. Metabolism 
pathways for various TKI are extracted, as well as the impact of TKI area under 
the curves and maximum concentration by strong CYP 3A4 inducers and inhibitors 
are summarized. The most common toxicities and supportive care medications for 
the TKI were identified.
RESULTS: Among EGFR inhibitors and exon-20 insertion inhibitors, afatinib is 
least likely to be affected by CYP 3A4, followed by dacomitinib and osimertinib. 
Among ALK inhibitors, alectinib is the least susceptible to CYP 3A4. ROS1 
inhibitors are affected by CYP 3A4 inhibition with the exception of criztonib. 
Among MET inhibitors, capmatinib is substantially affected by CYP 3A4 
inhibition. Drug exposure of RET inhibitors is expected to increase with CYP 3A4 
inhibition, with selpercatinib being the least affected. Certain supportive care 
medications for lung cancer TKI may have significant DDI.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical impact of the DDI between lung cancer TKI and 
ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir vary largely based on the susceptibility of CYP 
3A4 inhibition caused by the antiviral. Close monitoring and medication 
adjustments (i.e., dose changes or alternative COVD-19 therapy) can be employed 
to overcome DDI to ensure patient safety."
556,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been a scientific, medical and social 
challenge. Since clinical course of this disease is largely unpredictable and 
can develop rapidly causing severe complications, it is important to identify 
laboratory biomarkers, which may help to classify patient's severity during 
initial stage. Previous studies have suggested C-reactive protein (inflammatory) 
and D-dimer (biochemical) as an effective biomarker. The differential severity 
in patients across the world and our limited understanding in the progression of 
the disease calls for a multi-country analysis for biomarkers. Therefore, we 
have analyzed these biomarkers among 228 Bangladeshi COVID-19 patients. We 
observed significant association of COVID-19 severity with these two biomarkers. 
Thus, we suggest to use these biomarkers for Bangladeshi COVID-19 patients for 
better disease monitoring. Such validated preventive measures may decrease the 
case fatality ratio substantially."

558,"Background: In cardiac surgery, supraphysiological oxygen levels are frequently 
applied perioperatively. In this study, we examined the postoperative effect of 
perioperative hyperoxemia in cardiac surgery. Methods: All patients who 
underwent mitral valve replacement via the standard sternotomy method between 
2010 and 2021 were analyzed by scanning the hospital data system. The patients 
were divided into 2 groups: the hyperoxemic group (partial pressure of 
oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2] > 500 mmHg) (Group I) and the 
normoxemic group (300 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 < 500 mmHg) (Group II) according to the 
mean of 3 PaO2/FiO2 values calculated by using 3 PaO2 and 3 FiO2 levels. 
Postoperative complications, the mechanical ventilation time, the need for 
noninvasive mechanical ventilator support, the length of intensive care unit 
(ICU) stay, the hospitalization period, and the mortality rate of the groups 
were compared. Results: A total of 78 patients were included in the study, and 
53 of the patients (67.9%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 
58.89±12.60 years. The total mechanical ventilation time was significantly 
higher in the hyperoxemic group than in Group II (P<0.001) (18.18±12.90 h and 
11.45±7.85 h, respectively). The amount of postoperative bleeding was 
significantly higher in Group I (P=0.003) (539.47±201.74 mL and 417.50±186.93 
mL, respectively). The total amount of blood products administered during 
surgery and ICU stay was higher in Group I (P=0.041) (3.55±1.59 units and 
2.87±1.89 units, respectively). Conclusion: We observed that the group with 
hyperoxemia during cardiopulmonary bypass had a higher amount of postoperative 
bleeding and the need for transfusion, as well as a longer duration of 
mechanical ventilation and intensive care."
559,"High-frequency data streams of vital signs may be used to generate 
individualized hemodynamic targets for critically ill patients. Central to this 
precision medicine approach to resuscitation is our ability to screen these data 
streams for errors and artifacts. However, there is no consensus on the best 
method for data cleaning. Our goal was to determine whether an error-checking 
algorithm developed for intraoperative use could be applied to high volumes of 
arterial line data in an ICU population.
DESIGN: Multicenter observational study.
SETTING: ICUs across Ontario, Canada.
PATIENTS: Nested cohort of ICU patients with shock and/or respiratory failure 
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
INTERVENTIONS: High-frequency blood pressure data was analyzed. Systolic, 
diastolic, and mean arterial pressure minute averages were calculated. For 
manual analysis, a trained researcher retrospectively reviewed mean arterial 
pressure data, removing values that were deemed nonphysiological. The algorithm 
was implemented and identified artifactual data.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Arterial line data was extracted from 15 
patients. A trained researcher manually reviewed 40,798 minute-by-minute data 
points, then subsequently analyzed them with the algorithm. Manual review 
resulted in the identification of 119 artifacts (0.29%). The optimized algorithm 
identified 116 (97%) of these artifacts. Five hundred thirty-seven data points 
were erroneously removed or modified. Compared with manual review, the modified 
algorithm incorporating absolute thresholds of greater than 30 and less than 
200 mm Hg had 97.5% sensitivity, 98.7% specificity, and a Matthew correlation 
coefficient of 0.41.
CONCLUSIONS: The error-checking algorithm had high sensitivity and specificity 
in detecting arterial line blood pressure artifacts compared with manual data 
cleaning. Given the growing use of large datasets and machine learning in 
critical care research, methods to validate the quality of high-frequency data 
is important to optimize algorithm performance and prevent spurious associations 
based on artifactual data."
560,"BACKGROUND: (1)People may be infected with an insect-borne disease (malaria) 
through the blood input of malaria-infected people or the bite of Anopheles 
mosquitoes. Doctors need a lot of time and energy to diagnose malaria, and 
sometimes the results are not ideal. Many researchers use CNN to classify 
malaria images. However, we believe that the classification performance of 
malaria parasites can be improved.
METHODS: (2)In this paper, we propose a novel method (ROENet) to automatically 
classify malaria parasite on the blood smear. The backbone of ROENet is the 
pretrained ResNet-18. We use randomized neural networks (RNNs) as the classifier 
in our proposed model. Three RNNs are used in ROENet, which are random vector 
functional link (RVFL), Schmidt neural network (SNN), and extreme learning 
machine (ELM). To improve the performance of ROENet, the results of ROENet are 
the ensemble outputs from three RNNs.
RESULTS: (3)We evaluate the proposed ROENet by five-fold cross-validation. The 
specificity, F1 score, sensitivity, and accuracy are 96.68 ± 3.81%, 95.69 ± 
2.65%, 94.79 ± 3.71%, and 95.73 ± 2.63%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: (4)The proposed ROENet is compared with other state-of-the-art 
methods and provides the best results of these methods."
561,"INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of rare forms of α-thalassemia requires laborious 
genetic analyses. Accurate sample selection for such evaluation is therefore 
essential. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the predictive 
power of red blood cell parameters to detect rare forms of α-thalassemia 
(substudy 1), and to explore the frequency of rare versus common forms of 
α-thalassemia in our sample population (substudy 2).
METHODS: In substudy 1, we reviewed all blood samples selected for extended 
α-hemoglobinopathy evaluation at our laboratory during 2011-2020 (n = 1217), 
which included DNA sequencing and/or copy number variation analysis. We assessed 
α-thalassemia positive samples at different levels of mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin (MCH) alone and in combination with results for red blood cell count 
(RBC) or red cell distribution width (RDW). In substudy 2, we examined the 
distribution of α-thalassemia genotypes for all samples submitted to a 
first-tier hemoglobinopathy evaluation at our laboratory during 2014-2020 
(n = 6495).
RESULTS: In substudy 1, both RBC and RDW added predictive value in detecting 
rare forms of α-thalassemia in samples from adults and children. In adult 
samples with MCH ≤ 23 pg, the presence of erythrocytosis increased the detection 
rate from 27% to 74% as compared to non-erythrocytosis, while normal RDW 
increased the detection rate from 36% to 86% as compared to elevated RDW. In 
substudy 2, rare forms of α-thalassemia were detected in 12% of α-thalassemia 
positive samples.
CONCLUSION: Initial assessment of MCH, RBC, and RDW provided valuable predictive 
information about the presence of rare forms of α-thalassemia during 
hemoglobinopathy evaluation."
562,"AIM: Our aim was to evaluate cardiovascular risk profile in 42 children with 
kidney transplants (KT) at the Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg 
Sweden.
METHODS: Forty-two children (7.1-18 years) with KT, time from transplantation 
3.5 (0.9-13) years, were examined at inclusion and annually for three 
consecutive years. Eighteen matched controls were examined once. Cardiovascular 
phenotyping included ultra-high frequency ultrasound (UHFUS), pulse wave 
velocity (PWV) and endothelial function.
RESULTS: Children with KT had higher body mass index (BMI) z-score and blood 
pressure (BP) z-score than healthy controls (BMI z-score: 0.4 ±1.0 and -0.2 
± 0.9, respectively, p=0.02; SBP z-score: 0.5 ± 0.9 and -0.8 ± 0.7; DBP z-score: 
0.7 ± 0.7 and -0.3 ± 0.5, respectively, p<0.001). BP z-score decreased 
significantly over three years, other vascular markers remained unchanged. PWV 
and Carotid intima thickness (IT) was higher in children with KT compared to 
healthy controls. Children with preemptive KT had lower radial IT and dorsal 
pedal media thickness (MT) compared to children with preceding dialysis.
CONCLUSION: Children with KT show increased cardiovascular risk parameters, not 
increasing over time. Children on dialysis before KT have more pronounced 
vascular changes than those with preemptive KT, suggesting preemptive 
transplantation more beneficial for cardiovascular health."
563,"BACKGROUND: Horses with non-strangulating intestinal infarction (NSII) are often 
misdiagnosed with idiopathic peritonitis or acute colitis. Early diagnosis is 
essential to ensure early surgical intervention and improve survival.
METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from horses admitted to the University of 
Copenhagen Large Animal Teaching Hospital with NSII, idiopathic peritonitis or 
acute colitis between 2009 and 2018 were used for univariate comparisons and a 
multivariable logistic regression model for prediction of NSII.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-one horses were included. A multivariable model 
for the prediction of NSII included gastric reflux (more than 5 L) (odds ratio 
[OR] 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-36.2), abnormal findings palpated per 
rectum (intestinal dilatations/impactions [OR 4.43; 95% CI 1.43-13.38], colon 
displacements [OR 23.16; 95% CI 5.26-101.97] or intestinal mass [OR 179.7; 95% 
CI 23.5-1375.5]), white blood cell count (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.1-1.4), packed cell 
volume (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-0.9), age (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.0) and heart rate (OR 
1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.1). The model had a low false positive rate (5%), but a high 
false negative rate (50%).
LIMITATIONS: Due to the retrospective nature of the study, sample collection was 
inconsistent, resulting in missing values.
CONCLUSION: The model had some capability in predicting NSII. However, the high 
risk of false negatives means that exploratory laparotomy should be considered 
in horses with peritonitis of unknown aetiology in areas where Strongylus 
vulgaris is prevalent and occurrence of idiopathic peritonitis is low."
564,"Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitors have been clinically 
developed to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but their application is 
limited by the possibility of drug resistance, which is reportedly associated 
with the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Meanwhile, homoharringtonine 
(HHT), a classic antileukemia drug, possibly inhibits the WNT/β-catenin pathway. 
In this study, we attempted to combine a novel BRD4 inhibitor (ACC010) and HHT 
to explore their synergistic lethal effects in treating AML. Here, we found that 
co-treatment with ACC010 and HHT synergistically inhibited cell proliferation, 
induced apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 
3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-positive AML cells in vitro, and 
significantly inhibiting AML progression in vivo. Mechanistically, ACC010 and 
HHT cooperatively downregulated MYC and inhibited FLT3 activation. Further, when 
HHT was added, ACC010-resistant cells demonstrated a good synergy. We also 
extended our study to the mouse BaF3 cell line with FLT3-inhibitor-resistant 
FLT3-ITD/tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations and AML cells without FLT3-ITD. 
Collectively, our results suggested that the combination treatment of ACC010 and 
HHT might be a promising strategy for AML patients, especially those carrying 
FLT3-ITD."
565,"BACKGROUND: In Cardiovascular Rehabilitation (CR), patient adherence to the 
maintenance phase is a major challenge. Virtual reality-based therapy (VRBT) 
promotes acute hemodynamic and autonomic repercussions similar to traditional 
rehabilitation and can increase patient adherence to the program. However, it is 
unknown whether the combination of VRBT to a traditional CR manages to maintain 
or even improve clinical and autonomic variables in long term.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether VRBT combination in a traditional CR can maintain 
or improve clinical and autonomic variables in cardiac patients in the 
maintenance phase of these programs.
METHODS: Twenty-six volunteers (62.04 ± 12.22 years) were evaluated, who 
underwent an initial assessment and two other assessments (in the sixth and 12th 
week) of the following outcomes: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
respiratory rate, pulse saturation of oxygen, heart rate, perceived exertion, 
and cardiac autonomic modulation, using linear and non-linear heart rate 
variability methods.
RESULTS: Except for the apparent lack of clinical significance observed in 
Shannon Entropy, LF (nu), and HF (nu), the combination of VRBT as routine in a 
traditional program did not cause significant changes in the analyzed variables.
CONCLUSION: combination of VRBT was able to maintain the chronic hemodynamic and 
autonomic repercussions caused by traditional CR."
566,"Hematological malignancies encompass a wide variety of severe diseases that pose 
a serious threat to human health. Given the fact that hematological malignancies 
are difficult to treat due to their unpredictable and rapid deterioration and 
high rates of recurrence, growing attention has been paid to their early 
screening and diagnosis. However, developing a rapid and effective diagnostic 
tool featuring a noninvasive sampling technique is still extremely challenging. 
In recent years, novel nanomaterials-based electrochemical biosensors have 
attracted great interest because of such advantages as simple operation, low 
cost, fast response, etc. As a kind of rising nanomaterials, two-dimensional 
materials have excellent electronic and chemical properties, which have been 
proven to improve the performance of electrochemical biosensors. This review 
summarizes the applications of different types of electrochemical biosensors 
(nucleic acid sensors, immunosensors, aptamer biosensors, and cytosensors) based 
on two-dimensional materials in the detection of biological molecules related to 
hematological malignancies. Two-dimensional materials-based electrochemical 
biosensors designed for the diagnosis of leukemia could rapidly detect the 
target biomolecules at a trace level and show great merits such as wide linear 
range, low detection limit, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and 
cost-effectiveness. In addition, these biosensors have also achieved 
satisfactory results in the diagnosis of lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Thus, 
two-dimensional materials-based electrochemical biosensors are attractive for 
the early diagnosis of hematological malignancies in clinical practice. 
Nevertheless, more efforts are still required to further improve the performance 
of electrochemical biosensors. In this review, we propose the possible main 
concerns in the design of future two-dimensional materials-based electrochemical 
biosensors, involving the development of sensors for synchronous detection of 
diverse target biomolecules, the exploration of other superior two-dimensional 
materials, the simplification of the sensors fabrication process, the 
construction of new hybrid structures and how to avoid possible environmental 
issues."

588,"OBJECTIVE: To screen transcription factor genes related to the prognosis of 
adult patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with sepsis and ten healthy individuals admitted 
for RNA-seq. Differential factors were enriched by four transcription factor 
databases, and survival analysis was adopted for core factors. Then, target 
genes were submitted to STRING to constitute the PPI network. Single-cell 
technology was used to localize cell lines. Finally, a transcription-target gene 
regulation network was constituted.
RESULTS: A total of 4,224 DEGs were obtained between sepsis and NC groups. PPI 
results showed that FOXO3, NFKB1, SPI1, STAT5A, and PPARA were located in the 
center of the network. Target genes were related to cytokine-mediated signaling 
pathway and transcription regulator activity, etc. SPI1 was mainly located in 
monocyte cell lines, while FOXO3, PPARA, SP1, STAT3, and USF1 were expressed in 
monocyte cell lines, NK-T cell lines, and B cell lines. Compared with those in 
the control group, FOXO3, SP1, SPI1, STAT3, and USF1 were highly expressed in 
the sepsis group, while PPARA had low expression.
CONCLUSION: Transcription factors such as FOXO3, PPARA, SP1, SPI1, STAT3, and 
USF1 are correlated with the prognosis of sepsis patients and thus may have a 
potential research value.Clinical Trial Registration: The clinical trial 
registration number is ChiCTR1900021261."
589,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors 
affecting mortality after major lower extremity amputations in patients with 
diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease.
METHODS: For this retrospective study, 484 patients (345 male, 139 female) who 
were previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease 
and underwent first-time nontraumatic major lower extremity amputations between 
January 2008 and January 2021 were included. The mean age of the patients was 
64.2 ± 13.8 (20-114). In 32.4% of patients, peripheral vascular disease was the 
underlying cause, whereas diabetes mellitus was responsible for the etiology in 
67.6% of patients. About 68.8% of patients had below-knee amputations, whereas 
2.9% had bilateral below-knee amputations, 27.1% had above-knee amputations, and 
1.2% had hip disarticulation performed. Gender, age, amputation level, 
amputation etiologies, Charlson comorbidity index, need for blood transfusion, 
and laboratory findings such as hemoglobin, platelet, albumin, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, sodium, potassium, and neutrophil to 
lymphocyte ratio levels were recorded preoperatively and at the time of 
discharge. Patients were grouped as died ≤1 month, ≤3 months, ≤6 months, and ≤12 
months or alive.
RESULTS: Advanced age, female gender, high Charlson comorbidity index, blood 
transfusion requirement, proximal amputation level, preoperative low platelet, 
preoperative low albumin, and parameters such as low hemoglobin, low erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, high sodium, low platelet, low albumin, high C-reactive 
protein, and high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio at time of discharge were seen 
to have a statistically significant effect on mortality at 1 month, 3 months, 6 
months, and 12 months postoperatively. Preoperative high C-reactive protein had 
a statistically significant effect on mortality at 1 and 3 months 
postoperatively, whereas low C-reactive protein had a statisti cally significant 
effect on mortality at 6 months postoperatively. High potassium at the time of 
discharge was associated with mortality at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: This study has shown us that mortality rates are affected by 
modifiable parameters at the time of discharge such as hemoglo bin, sodium, 
potassium, platelet, and albumin, and normalization of these parameters before 
discharge could reduce the rates of mortality in the postoperative period.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, Prognostic Study."
590,"Vaccination and natural infection both elicit potent humoral responses that 
provide protection from subsequent infections. The immune-history of an 
individual following such exposures is in part encoded by antibodies. While 
there are multiple immunoassays for measuring antibody responses, the majority 
of these methods measure responses to a single antigen. A commonly used method 
for measuring antibody responses is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) - a semi-quantitative assay that is simple to perform in research and 
clinical settings. Here, we present FLU-LISA (fluorescence-linked immunosorbent 
assay) - a novel antigen microarray based assay for rapid high-throughput 
antibody profiling. The assay can be used for profiling IgG, IgA and IgM 
responses to multiple antigens simultaneously, requiring minimal amounts of 
sample and antigens. Using several influenza and SARS-CoV-2 antigen microarrays, 
we demonstrated the specificity and sensitivity of our novel assay and compared 
it to the traditional ELISA, using samples from mice, chickens and humans. We 
also showed that our assay can be readily used with dried blood spots, which can 
be collected from humans and wild birds. The FLU-LISA can be readily used to 
profile hundreds of samples against dozens of antigens in a single day, and 
therefore offers an attractive alternative to the traditional ELISA."
591,"BACKGROUND: During home treatment with antibiotics, patients' laboratory results 
of total white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophil counts and C-reactive 
protein (CRP) are drawn and monitored at the hospital. The aim of the study was 
to examine the feasibility and analytical accuracy of hospitalized patients 
18 years or older self-testing using two point-of-care tests (POCT).
METHODS: The pilot study included 41 hospitalized patients. A subjective 
judgment of the patients' ability to conduct the self-testing was made along 
with a comparison of the POCT measurements of WBC, neutrophil counts and CRP 
with standard laboratory measurements. Correlation between the POCTs and 
laboratorial values was assessed by coefficient of determination and the level 
of agreement between the means was assessed by Bland Altman test.
RESULTS: Of the 38 patients conducting self-testing, 78% were men and the mean 
age was 61.8 years. 28 patients (73.7%) successfully performed self-testing on 
the first try while, 10 (26.3%) 'HemoCue WBC DIFF' measurements showed an error 
code. All the patients successfully performed the 'QuickRead go CRP' self-test. 
Comparison of the 'HemoCue WBC DIFF' results with the laboratory results of WBC 
and neutrophil counts showed good agreement. On the other hand, 'QuickRead go 
CRP' results showed a small but significant systematic disagreement compared to 
the laboratory results.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the POCTs can be used by some patients and 
factors influencing the patient participation included psychological and 
physical limitations. Both POCTs appeared to have an acceptable clinical level 
of accuracy."
592,"BACKGROUND: Telomere dysfunction has been reported to be directly involved in 
carcinogenesis owing to chromosomal instability and immortalization; however, 
the clinicopathological significance of telomeres remains controversial. We have 
shown that telomere shortening occurs in normal-appeared duct cells at the 
initiation and then progresses during the progression of pancreatic cancer. In 
this study, we determined the clinicopathological and prognostic value of 
telomere length (TL) in cancer progression.
METHODS: TL in both cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was 
analyzed by high throughput quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) using a previously reported cohort comprising 1,434 cases of 
adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenosquamous carcinoma 
(ASC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which are 
known cancers with a significantly low incidence of alternative lengthening of 
telomeres. Cases were divided into two groups as follows: longer and shorter 
telomeres, according to the median TL of cancer cells and CAFs. The statistical 
significance of TL in cancer cells and CAFs on clinicopathological 
characteristics and prognosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: There was a close association between TL in cancer cells and CAFs. 
Longer telomeres in cancer cells and CAFs were associated with aggressive 
features such as advanced stage, high mitosis score and nuclear score, poorly 
differentiated cancer, and desmoplastic stroma in ADC. Furthermore, a longer TL 
was an independent prognostic factor for ADC, SCC and RCC.
CONCLUSION: Longer telomeres are associated with worse prognosis in ADC, SCC and 
RCC. Thus, TL is a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of aggressive cancers with 
poor prognoses."
593,"BACKGROUND: This multi-center study was aimed at retrospectively evaluating the 
feasibility, safety, clinical outcomes, and surgical learning curve of an 
optimized procedure for right upper lobectomy (RUL), which is challenging 
because of the anatomical structures and features of this lobe.
METHODS: This study included 45 RUL cases of robot-assisted thoracoscopy (RATS) 
in a pilot cohort and 187 RUL cases of video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) in 
three cohorts. A total of 121 and 111 patients underwent traditional and 
optimized RUL, respectively. The optimized surgical procedure was performed to 
consecutively transect the superior arterial trunk and bronchus, and finally 
disconnect the pulmonary vein and posterior ascending artery with interlobar 
fissures. Clinical and radiological data were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Optimized RUL can be performed successfully by RATS or VATS. The 
optimized procedure yielded better clinical outcomes than the traditional 
procedure, including shorter operation times, less blood loss, fewer 
complications, shorter hospital times, lower costs, and a lower likelihood of 
postoperative intermedius bronchial kinking. Additionally, for calcified 
interlobar lymph nodes, the optimized VATS group was less likely to be converted 
to thoracotomy than the traditional group. The skills required to perform 
optimized VATS RUL can be gained by surgeons after 12 to 15 cases. The two RUL 
procedures in the pilot cohort showed similar disease-free survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimized RUL was safe, economical, and feasible, with a short 
learning curve and satisfactory disease-free survival."
594,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection that can present with 
neurological manifestations. Although uncommon, it may affect the peripheral 
nervous system in the form of polyradiculoneuropathy.
METHODS: We report the case of a 30-year-old male who developed flaccid 
tetraparesis and multiple cranial neuropathies on the fourteenth day of 
admission to the intensive care unit for fever and multi-organ failure. We also 
review the existing literature about peripheral nerve damage in leptospirosis 
and present our hypothesis on the possible pathogenic mechanisms.
RESULTS: Electrophysiological findings were consistent with acute demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy and extensive blood tests were positive for leptospiral 
IgM and IgG antibodies. Treatment with plasmapheresis was begun, followed by 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and the patient improved slowly.
DISCUSSION: Our work adds to the evidence of leptospirosis infection as a cause 
of acute demyelinating polyneuropathy. The possibility that 
leptospirosis-polyradiculoneuropathy may be caused by an immune pathogenesis 
emphasizes the importance of identifying this entity because immunomodulatory 
therapy could play a vital role in the recovery process. This article is

595,"Five-FU is a potent chemotherapeutic agent for suppressing endothelial cell 
growth. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of local 
peritumor injection of 5-FU for patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) for 
the prevention of anemia. Between January 2020 and January 2022, patients aged 
18 years or older with AGC and moderate anemia were included. A total of 200 mg 
of 5-FU was injected per session at ten points of the lesion (20 mg at each 
point) every 7 days for 4 to 12 weeks. Patients received a blood test for 
toxicity at every cycle. From one of these patients, endoscopic biopsy specimens 
were taken from gastric cancer before and after injecting 5-FU for 
immunostaining. A total of five AGC patients participated in this study. For 
most patients, hemoglobin levels were maintained without transfusions during 
5-FU injection, and expression levels of thrombospondin-1 was increased after 
injection compared to those before injection. Blood test results during 5-FU 
injection showed no significant change in serum glutamic oxalacetic 
transaminase/glutamic pyruvic transaminase, total bilirubin, or creatinine 
level. The results of this study showed the possibility of local peritumor 5-FU 
injection as a treatment for relieving anemia of patients with gastric cancer."
596,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with Sheehan Syndrome (SS) are predisposed to coronary 
artery disease (CAD) due to risk factors like abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, 
and chronic inflammation. In addition to estimate CAD risk enhancers like high 
sensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP), apolipoprotein B (Apo B) and lipoprotein A 
[Lp(a)], this study applies Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and Coronary Artery 
Calcium (CAC) Score to compute a 10-year probability of cardiovascular (CV) 
events in SS patients.
PATIENTS AND DESIGN: Case-control study.Sixty-three SS patients, on a stable 
hormonal replacement treatment except for growth hormone (GH) and sixty-five 
age, body mass index and parity matched controls.
MEASUREMENTS: Measurement of serum hsCRP, Apo B and Lp(a) and estimation of CAC 
with 16-row multislice computed tomography scanner.
RESULTS: The concentrations of hsCRP, apo B, and Lp(a) were significantly higher 
in SS patients than in controls (p<0.001). After calculating FRS, 95.2% of SS 
patients were classified as low risk, 4.8% as intermediate risk and all controls 
were classified as low risk for probable CV events. CAC was detected in 50.7% SS 
patients and 7.6% controls (p=0.006). According to the CAC score, 26.9% SS 
patients were classified as at risk (CAC>10) for incident CV events as against 
1.6% controls. The mean Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) score was 
significantly higher in patients with SS than controls. CAC corelated 
significantly withfasting blood glucose (r=0.316), apoB(r=0.549), LP(a) 
(r=0.310) and FRS(r=0.294).
CONCLUSION: Significantnumber of asymptomatic SS patients have high coronary 
artery calcium score and are classified at risk for CAD. This article is

597,"PURPOSE: Photo methods such as photo-elicitation and photovoice have 
traditionally been implemented as knowledge-generation techniques; however, they 
have also been conceptualized as tools for community impact and as interventions 
in and of themselves. We performed a scoping review to document how photo 
methods have been used in studies of cancer, to describe participant 
populations, and to identify opportunities for future directions for the use of 
photo methods in cancer.
METHODS: An a priori search strategy was implemented across health-related 
databases with the following inclusion criteria: (1) study participants were 
diagnosed with cancer and/or were caregivers of those with cancer; (2) study 
participants were asked to take and/or respond to photographs as part of the 
study protocol; (3) articles were published in peer-reviewed journals; (4) 
articles were written in English.
RESULTS: Eighty non-duplicative articles were identified; of these, 30 articles 
describing 24 individual studies were included for review. All but one (95.8%) 
of the studies utilized photovoice solely as a knowledge-generation technique 
without participant outcome measurement or analysis. Across all included 
studies, participants were largely women with breast cancer; other demographic 
and cancer-related variables (e.g., race and cancer stage) were not consistently 
reported. Caregivers were included in 37.5% of studies.
CONCLUSION: Photo methods are most frequently used in order to capture 
qualitative data in cancer populations; however, there are missed opportunities 
in their lack of use for intervention and systemic change. In addition, 
inconsistent reporting of demographics and cancer characteristics limits our 
ability to synthesize these data across studies."
598,"Human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) is a neglected disease that occurs in 98 
countries on five continents, and it is endemic in tropical and subtropical 
regions. In South America, the etiological agent of HVL is Leishmania infantum 
(syn. Leishmania chagasi), mainly transmitted through the bite of an infected 
sandfly female from the genus Lutzomyia. In American HVL endemic areas, the 
occurrence of asymptomatic infection is common, which contributes to the 
possibility of L. infantum transmission during a blood transfusion. To know the 
prevalence of L. infantum asymptomatic infection in blood donors from the 
microregion of Adamantina, we investigated 324 peripheral blood samples from 
donors through immunofluorescence (IFAT) and PCR-RFLP techniques. Seven blood 
samples (2.16%) tested positive for Leishmania by IFAT, and from those, six 
presented positive results by PCR (85.71%), which were later identified as L. 
infantum by RFLP. The presence of L. infantum in the peripheral blood of blood 
donors supported the hypothesis of transmission by blood transfusion and points 
to the need to include tests for visceral leishmaniasis in blood bank screening 
tests and pre-storage measures, especially in endemic areas to prevent the 
exponential increase of HVL by blood transfusion."
599,"The lack of objective diagnostic methods for mental disorders challenges the 
reliability of diagnosis. The study aimed to develop an easily accessible and 
useable objective method for diagnosing major depressive disorder (MDD), 
schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), and panic disorder (PD) using serum 
multi-protein. Serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), VGF 
(non-acronymic), bicaudal C homolog 1 (BICC1), C-reactive protein (CRP), and 
cortisol, which are generally recognized to be involved in different 
pathogenesis of various mental disorders, were measured in patients with MDD 
(n = 50), SZ (n = 50), BPD (n = 55), and PD along with 50 healthy controls (HC). 
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was employed to construct a 
multi-classification model to classify these mental disorders. Both 
leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and fivefold cross-validation were 
applied to validate the accuracy and stability of the LDA model. All five serum 
proteins were included in the LDA model, and it was found to display a high 
overall accuracy of 96.9% when classifying MDD, SZ, BPD, PD, and HC groups. 
Multi-classification accuracy of the LDA model for LOOCV and fivefold 
cross-validation (within-study replication) reached 96.9 and 96.5%, 
respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of the blood-based multi-protein LDA 
model for classifying common mental disorders in a mixed cohort. The results 
suggest that combining multiple proteins associated with different pathogeneses 
of mental disorders using LDA may be a novel and relatively objective method for 
classifying mental disorders. Clinicians should consider combining multiple 
serum proteins to diagnose mental disorders objectively."
600,"PURPOSE: Aim of the present study is to describe our robot-assisted simple 
prostatectomy technique and to report 6-month surgical and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Eighty men were consecutively submitted to robot-assisted simple 
prostatectomy in our institution from October 2019 to October 2020. All 
procedures were performed by the same surgical team. Diagnostic preoperative 
assessment was based on history, symptoms evaluation by International Prostate 
Symptom Score, digital rectal examination, flowmetry with post-void residual 
volume measurement by abdominal ultrasound, prostatic volume estimation by MRI, 
PSA dosage. Under combined general and subarachnoid anesthesia, surgery was 
performed via a transperitoneal approach using a Da Vinci Si system in the 
four-arm configuration. Operative time, blood loss, hospital stay, 
catheterization time, intraoperative and postoperative complications were 
assessed. Clinical postoperative 6 months of evaluation was based on physical 
examination, flowmetry with post-void residual volume measurement, PSA dosage, 
and International Prostate Symptom Score.
RESULTS: Mean operative time was 105.29 min, mean hospital staying 5.4 days. 
Blood loss was low in all cases and only 2 patients received transfusion. 
Catheterization time was 7 days. According to the Clavien-Dindo classification, 
only minor (grade I and grade II) intraoperative and postoperative complications 
were observed. At 6-month postoperative assessment, a statistically significant 
increase of urinary flow indexes and bladder capacity was recorded, as a 
significant reduction of urinary residual volume. No patient experienced stress 
urinary incontinence and the mean postoperative IPSS score was significantly 
reduced to 4.3. Two patients were diagnosed with incidental prostatic cancer at 
the histopathological examination.
CONCLUSIONS: Data collected in our experience on a large cohort confirm efficacy 
and safety of Robot-Assisted Simple Prostatectomy. This procedure allows both 
short operative time and hospital staying, with low incidence of perioperative 
complications. This surgical technique can therefore be considered a valid 
alternative to other procedures for the surgical treatment of large volume 
prostates. Randomized prospective and comparative studies are warranted in the 
future to assess if different RASP techniques provide similar surgical and 
functional outcomes."

behavior among advance stage and optimal response CML patients using imatinib 
therapy. Blood samples were collected from 30 CML patients (optimal response to 
TKI), 30 CML patients (failure response to TKI), and 30 age- and gender-matched 
controls. Analysis involved measuring percentages of Tregs 
(CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 +) by flow cytometer and demethylation levels of FOXP3 
Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) by PCR. The data revealed that Tregs 
and the FOXP3-TSDR demethylation percentages significantly increased in failure 
response group in comparison to the optimal response and control groups, while 
no significant difference between optimal response and control groups. Tregs and 
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation percentages showed high sensitivity and specificity, 
suggesting powerful discriminatory biomarkers between failure and optimal 
groups. An assessment of the Tregs and demethylation percentage among different 
BCR-ABL levels of CML patients on TKI revealed no significant differences in 
parameter percentage in the optimal response to TKI patients with different 
molecular responses (log 3 reduction or other deeper log 4.5 and 5 reduction 
levels). Our findings demonstrate an effective role of functional Tregs among 
different CML stages. Also, the study suggests that the major molecular response 
to therapy at level 0.1% of BCR-ABL transcript could be enough to induce immune 
system restoration in patients."
602,"Polymeric micelles have opened up new horizons for improving drug delivery to 
brain particularly due to their small size, long circulation time, good 
stability and targetability. They are used to treat a variety of brain 
conditions, including glioblastoma, migraine, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
other conditions linked to the brain. Micelles are currently underutilised in 
brain targeting despite having several benefits and spanning a wide variety of 
brain illnesses. Since most medications are unable to cross the blood brain 
barrier, scientists are continuously working to discover efficient solutions to 
the problems. The most pressing issue was thought to be the viability and 
difficulties of translating micelles into the therapeutic setting. This review 
describes the role of micellar delivery system in brain diseases treatment along 
with their route of administration and outcomes. The review also discusses the 
current state of patents and clinical trials in the relevant fields and their 
potential future applications."
603,"Cardiovascular disease and renal complications raise the risk of death and 
morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a novel class of glucose-lowering drug that increases 
urine glucose excretion while decreasing blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes 
patients by inhibiting glucose reabsorption. In the present article, we review 
the discovery and development of SGLT2i as a new T2D treatment approach for T2D; 
thereafter, we consider different cell-based methods for the evaluation of 
SGLT2i. Finally, we provide evidence from both clinical and experimental studies 
which bring up the cardio-renal protective effects of SGLT2i. We performed a 
literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science to identify 
publications on preclinical and clinical studies of cardiorenal protective 
action of SGLT2i and their suggested mechanisms. SGLT2i have shown good effects 
in the improvement of cardiovascular and renal complications independent of 
glucose lowering effects. Besides controlling blood glucose levels, SGLT2i were 
found to exhibit therapeutic benefits on the kidney and cardiovascular system by 
lowering diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration, blood pressure (BP), body weight, 
uric acid concentrations, lipid peroxidation, inflammation, etc. As a result of 
their distinct mode of action, SGLT2i have emerged as a promising treatment 
option for T2D and maybe T1D due to their increased urine excretion of glucose. 
It has been demonstrated that SGLT2i have considerable protective effects on 
diabetic nephropathy (DN) and cardiomyopathy in well-designed experimental and 
clinical investigations."
604,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic syndrome of excess glucose levels in the blood. 
It may be due to glucose intolerance by the tissues and inadequate insulin 
production from pancreatic β-cells. However, diabetic complication includes 
cardiovascular and kidney diseases, eye, skin, and foot complications, and 
neuropathy. The intention behind writing this article was to gather recent 
information regarding the use of ancient traditional medicinal plants having 
recent importance in treating diabetes. Several therapies are available for 
curing the condition based on severity and type of diabetes. Although 
pharmacological treatments are effective and economical, drugs are associated 
with unwanted side effects and physiological complications on long-term use. 
Interestingly, herbs and herbal plants have been used since ancient times 
against diabetes worldwide. Its importance still exists due to medicinal plants' 
effectiveness and safety profile in treating various diseases. In this article, 
we searched online databases, including PUBMED, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and traditional 
resources, for collecting information regarding the use of plants against 
diabetes. We described the pathophysiology of the disease and incorporated plant 
sources and their chemical constituents responsible for antidiabetic activity 
with their mechanism in reducing blood glucose levels. The present article may 
be very helpful for researchers and professionals whose work is inclined towards 
diabetes and in search of lead compounds for the development of a suitable drug."
605,"Aims-The present study aimed to compare the pregnancy outcomes, efficacy, and 
safety of faster aspart with insulin aspart among Indian women with gestational 
diabetes. Background - In several countries, fast-acting insulin aspart (faster 
aspart) has been approved for use in pregnancy. There is a lack of data related 
to maternal glycemic control and fetal and perinatal outcomes with faster aspart 
in gestational diabetes among the Indian population. Objective - To compare and 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of faster aspart and insulin aspart in the 
management of gestational diabetes. Methods-This retrospective study evaluated 
the medical records of 60 pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes and 
managed with faster aspart or insulin aspart at a tertiary care center, between 
March 2019 and September 2020. Self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) levels 
recorded at 4 timepoints (fasting, and 1 hour post breakfast, lunch, and dinner) 
during 6 consecutive days any time before delivery were analyzed. Pregnancy and 
neonatal outcomes across both groups were compared. Results- The mean 
postprandial glucose (PPG) value following dinner was significantly lesser in 
the faster aspart group compared to the insulin aspart group (123.61 ± 2.52 
mg/dL vs. 125.87 ± 2.98 mg/dL, respectively; p=0.0024). Women in the faster 
aspart group had significantly lower glycemic variability (fluctuations). Lesser 
number of hypoglycemic events were noted in the faster aspart group (10 vs 20; 
p=0.0595). Conclusion-Faster aspart was associated with better glycemic control 
compared to insulin aspart among women with gestational diabetes. Further 
large-scale studies are needed to validate the outcomes."
606,"OBJECTIVE: HIV patients are prone to infection and difficult to treat, which 
mainly manifests itself in decreased CD4+ T cells in the body.. Therefore, the 
predictive value of lymphocyte count and hemoglobin for CD4+ levels in HIV 
patients was discussed in the prospective study.
METHODS: 125 HIV patients (aged >18 or < 80 years) were recruited. Pearson 
chi-square test was used to explore the correlation between CD4+ content and 
blood-related parameters in HIV patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were used to calculate ORs for each variable. In addition, 
receiver ROC curves were constructed to assess each factor's accuracy and 
sensitivity in diagnosing CD4+.
RESULTS: Lymphocyte count and hemoglobin were significantly correlated with 
CD4+. In terms of multivariate logistic regression level, there was a 
significant correlation between lymphocyte count (OR = 3.170, 95% CI: 
1.442-6.969, P = 0.004), hemoglobin (OR = 2.545, 95% CI: 1.148- 5.646, P = 
0.022) and CD4+ content in HIV patients. Based on the neural network model, the 
level of lymphocyte and hemoglobin might be the predictive indexes of CD4+ 
level. We find the high-risk warning indicator of CD4+ level: 3 < lymphocyte 
(109/L) < 3.6, and 150 < hemoglobin (g/L) < 200.
CONCLUSION: Better predictive value of lymphocyte count and hemoglobin for CD4+ 
level of HIV patients."
607,"Recurrent ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the leading causes of disability and 
death worldwide. Patients with recurrent IS, in comparison with survivors of the 
initial non-cardiogenic IS, have more serious neurological deficit and longer 
average hospital stay as well as heavier family and socio-economic burden. 
Therefore, recurrent IS is a major challenge that we urgently need to address. 
The recurrence rate of non-cardiogenic IS is not zero, and even shows an 
increasing trend over a long period of time, despite receiving evidence-based 
management in accordance with guideline, indicating that patients suffering from 
non-cardiogenic IS and who are receiving the optimal management remain at 
considerable residual risks (RRs) responsible for the recurrence of 
cerebrovascular events. In addition to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) and platelets, some new non-traditional parameters such as high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], 
peripheral circulating platelet-derived microvesicles, white blood 
cells-platelet complexes, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, 
monomeric C-reactive protein, neutrophils and their products (neutrophil 
extracellular traps, NETs), may also be potential sources of RRs for recurrent 
IS. On the basis of the three pillars of secondary stroke prevention, namely, 
blood pressure reduction, lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapy, the reduction 
in RRs may provide additional protection against recurrent IS. With this 
background, the identification and quantification of RRs associated with disease 
heterogeneity and individualized treatment strategies based on risk 
stratification are favorable in the mitigation of huge stroke burden people 
unceasingly face."
608,"OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate cerebral arterial flow volume changes during the 
hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyperthyroid phases and comparing ( between 
laboratory findings and cerebral arterial flow changes with carotid-vertebral 
duplex Doppler ultrasound (CVA-DUSG) in subclinical Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) 
patients.
METHODS: According to the TSH level, 3 groups were constructed between patient 
cases. Group 1 (n=29) was the subclinical hyperthyroid group. In this group, the 
TSH level was between 0.0005 and 0.3 IU/ml. Group 2 (n=175) was the euthyroid 
group. TSH level in this group was between 0.3 and 4.2 IU/ml. Group 3 (n=76) was 
the subclinical hypothyroid group. In this group, the TSH level was above 4.2 
IU/ml. The control-group (group 4) (n=71) included healthy people. In this 
group, the TSH level was between 0.3 and 4.2 IU/ml. After obtaining at least 
three consecutive waves from the bilateral internal cerebral artery and 
bilateral vertebral artery, volume flows were calculated using CVA-DUSG. Volume 
flows were calculated as peak systolic velocity + end diastolic velocity/2 × 
mean arterial diameter. The mean ICA(Internal Carotid Artery) and VA(Vertebral 
Artery) diameter was measured per ICA and VA. Total cerebral artery flow volume 
was defined as right ICA + right VA flow volume and left ICA + left VA flow 
volume. We also demonstrated topographic cerebral artery blood flow changes. 
Total ICA flow volume was used to assess the anterior part of the brain, total 
VA flow volume was used to evaluate the posterior part of the brain, right ICA + 
right VA flow volume was used to assess the right part of the brain, and left 
ICA + left VA flow volume was used to verify the left part of the brain.
RESULTS: There were significant differences between RVA(Right Vertebral Artery) 
flow volume, LICA (Left Internal Carotid Artery) flow volume, total flow volume, 
TSH, and T3 and T4 levels in all groups according to the Dunn's multiple 
comparison test.(p<0.001) Mean TSH level was 0.03 (0.005-0.06) IU/ml in group 1, 
2.8 (1.8-3.97) IU/ml in group 2, 7.32 (6.14-9.93) IU/ml in group 3, and 1.76 
(1.17-2.49) IU/ml in the control group. The mean T3 level was 4.18 (3.55-5.38) 
in group 1, 2.88 (2.63-3.16) in group 2, 2.82 (2.49-3.15) in group 3, 3.14 
(2.92-3.15) in the control group. The mean T4 level was 1.92 (1.29-2.5) in group 
1, 1.16(1.03-1.31) in group 2, 1.01 (0.91-1.16) in group 3, 1.12 (0.97-1.30) in 
the control group (group 4). Mean total flow volume was 793 (745-898) ml/min in 
group 1, 742 (684.25-822.5) ml/min in group 2, 747 (692-824) ml/min in group 3, 
and 700 (673-675) ml/min in the control group. We also demonstrated topographic 
cerebral arterial volume flow changes with CVA-DUSG. There was a significant 
difference among all groups in the right and anterior parts of the brain (p < 
0.001), and there was a significant difference between groups 1 and 4 in the 
left part of the brain (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that total cerebral arterial volume flow 
increased in the hyperthyroid phase of subclinical HT cases without any internal 
carotid and vertebral artery diameter changes compared with the euthyroid and 
hypothyroid phases of subclinical HT and healthy cases. We also verified 
topographic cerebral arterial blood flow changes in subclinical HT cases with a 
real-time, easily applicable modality (CVA-DUSG) that does not include X-ray or 
contrast agents. There was a significant difference between all groups in the 
right and anterior parts of the brain and there was a significant difference 
between groups 1 and 4 in the left part of the brain."
609,"The prevalence of supine and nocturnal hypertension (S-N-HT) is high among 
patients with orthostatic hypotension (OH), especially in those who have a 
neurogenic aetiology. The evidence suggests that S-N-HT exacerbates OH, although 
it is unclear whether pharmacologic treatment of S-N-HT will improve OH. S-N-HT 
has also been associated with target organ damage. Therefore, assessment and 
management of S-N-HT should be an integral part of managing OH, but it is often 
overlooked in clinical practice. The present review seeks to provide 
comprehensive information on S-N-HT, with a particular focus on pathophysiology, 
diagnostic evaluation, and management. The aim is to provide a practical guide 
for managing S-N-HT."
610,"BACKGROUND: Brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage is extremely 
complicated, and the exact mechanism remains puzzling. Piezo1, a novel mammalian 
mechanosensitive ion channel, has been identified to play important roles in 
several pathologic and physiologic procedures that involve cellular 
mechanotransduction. However, the role of Piezo1 in hematoma compression after 
intracerebral hemorrhage is still unclear.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we established a balloon-inflated 
brain model based on an adult male rat mimicking the pure mechanical compression 
of a hematoma. Then the behavioral assessment (Garcia Scale) was taken to 
observe the syndrome after ""hematoma"". Western blotting and immunofluorescence 
were applied to detect Piezo1 expression around lesions in rat brains. ELISA was 
used for quantitative analysis of inflammation factors. A statistical 
significance was confirmed as P value<0.05.
RESULTS: Balloon compression lesions were detected in the basal ganglia region 
of the brain, resulting in abnormal behaviors and a significant increase in the 
expression of Piezo1 and proinflammatory cytokines. GsMTx4, an antagonist of 
Piezo1, reversed these effects. Additionally, the balloon deflation time 
affected behavioral function and the levels of Piezo1 and proinflammatory 
cytokines.
CONCLUSION: These results establish the first in vivo evidence for the role of 
Piezo1 in blood-brain neuroinflammation after hematoma compression. Piezo1 
showed ""bidirectional mechanosensitivity"" and therefore is a potential 
therapeutic target for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage."

612,"Uncontrolled hemorrhage is a major cause of potentially preventable death in 
civilian trauma nowadays. Considerable concern has been given to the development 
of efficient hemostats with high blood absorption, self-propelled property, and 
Ca2+ release ability, for irregularly shaped and noncompressible hemorrhage. 
Herein, Janus self-propelled chitosan-based hydrogel with CaCO3 (J-CMH@CaCO3 ) 
is developed by partial ionic crosslinking of carboxylated chitosan (CCS) and 
Ca2+ , gravity settlement, and photopolymerization, followed by removing the 
shell of CCS. The obtained J-CMH@CaCO3 is further used as a hemostat powered by 
the internal CaCO3 and coordinated protonated tranexamic acid (J-CMH@CaCO3 /T). 
Bubbles are generated and detached to provide the driving force, accompanied by 
the release of Ca2+ . The two aspects work in synergy to accelerate clot 
formation, endowing the J-CMH@CaCO3 /T with excellent hemostatic efficiency. The 
J-CMH@CaCO3 /T presents high blood absorption, favorable blood-clotting ability, 
desired erythrocyte and platelet aggregation, and acceptable hemocompatibility 
and cytocompatibility. In rodent and rabbit bleeding models, the J-CMH@CaCO3 /T 
exhibits the most effective hemostasis to the best knowledge of the authors, 
wherein the hemorrhage is rapidly halted within 39 s. It is believed that the 
J-CMH@CaCO3 /T with self-propelled property opens up a new avenue to design 
high-performance hemostats for clinical application."

614,"Most nutrition models and some nutritionists view ration formulation as 
accounting transactions to match nutrient supplies with nutrient requirements. 
However, diet and stage of lactation interact to alter the partitioning of 
nutrients toward milk and body reserves, which, in turn, alters requirements. 
Fermentation and digestion of diet components determine feeding behavior and the 
temporal pattern and profile of absorbed nutrients. The pattern and profile, in 
turn, alter hormonal signals, tissue responsiveness to hormones, and mammary 
metabolism to affect milk synthesis and energy partitioning differently 
depending on the physiological state of the cow. In the fresh period (first 2 to 
3 wk postpartum), plasma insulin concentration and insulin sensitivity of 
tissues are low, so absorbed nutrients and body reserves are partitioned toward 
milk synthesis. As lactation progresses, insulin secretion and sensitivity 
increase, favoring deposition instead of mobilization of body reserves. 
High-starch diets increase ruminal propionate production, the flow of 
gluconeogenic precursors to the liver, and blood insulin concentrations. During 
early lactation, the glucose produced will preferentially be used by the mammary 
gland for milk production. As lactation progresses and milk yield decreases, 
glucose will increasingly stimulate repletion of body reserves. Diets with less 
starch and more digestible fiber increase ruminal production of acetate relative 
to propionate and, because acetate is less insulinogenic than propionate, these 
diets can minimize body weight gain. High dietary starch concentration and 
fermentability can also induce milk fat depression by increasing the production 
of biohydrogenation intermediates that inhibit milk fat synthesis and thus favor 
energy partitioning away from the mammary gland. Supplemental fatty acids also 
impact energy partitioning by affecting insulin concentration and insulin 
sensitivity of tissues. Depending on profile, physiological state, and 
interactions with other nutrients, supplemental fatty acids might increase milk 
yield at the expense of body reserves or partition energy to body reserves at 
the expense of milk yield. Supplemental protein or AA also can increase milk 
production but there is little evidence that dietary protein directly alters 
whole-body partitioning. Understanding the biology of these interactions can 
help nutritionists better formulate diets for cows at various stages of 
lactation."
615,"BACKGROUND: Early death is a major factor of treatment failure in acute 
promyelocytic leukemia (APL), however, the recent trends in the incidence of 
early death based on the population-level are not clear. Hence, this study is 
aimed at describing the incidence, recent trends, causes and characteristics of 
early death in APL based on the real world.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: APL patients diagnosed from 1986 to 2015 in the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) dataset were enrolled, and 
categorized based on gender, age, year of diagnosis, race, marital status, 
resident county and socioeconomic status (SES). The risk factors for all-cause 
and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) specific early death were determined by 
univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and stratified 
analysis was conducted by age.
RESULTS: Overall, 3212 APL patients were included in analysis between 1986 and 
2015, of which a total of 683 (21.3%) patients were noted for early death. 
Significant differences were recognized for patient distribution by age, year of 
diagnosis, marital status, and SES. The early death rate of APL patients 
diagnosed during 2006-2015 was significantly lower than that of the early stage, 
but this trend was not evident in juvenile patients. At the same time, older 
age, and lower SES score were independent risk factors for early death in the 
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: We established that the early death trend in APL has decreased over 
the past few years, but the early death rate remains high, especially in older 
patients and those with lower SES."
616,"INTRODUCTION: Interim response evaluation by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography/computed tomography (iPET) in diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) could be important to rule out disease progression and has been 
suggested to be predictive of survival. However, treatment guidance by iPET is 
not yet recommended for DLBCL in clinical practice. We aimed to compare the 
predictive value of iPET when utilizing the visual Deauville 5-point scale (DS) 
and the semiquantitative variation of maximum standardized uptake value 
(ΔSUVmax).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 85 patients diagnosed with DLBCL and 
uniformly treated with standard protocols. iPET with DS of 1-3 and/or ΔSUVmax 
≥66% was defined as negative. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression 
analyses were performed to determine the independent factors affecting 
progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) and to estimate PFS and 
OS.
RESULTS: iPET positivity, measured by DS or ΔSUVmax, showed predictive value of 
disease refractoriness, improved by combining DS and ΔSUVmax. After a median 
follow-up of 50.1 months, iPET was an independent predictor for both PFS and OS 
when interpreted by DS, but only for PFS by ΔSUVmax. Combined visual and 
semiquantitative analysis (D4-5 & ΔSUVmax<66%) was an independent predictor of 
PFS and OS, and allowed to identify an ultra-high-risk subgroup of patients with 
very dismal outcome, increasing the discriminating capacity for iPET.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that combined DS and ΔSUVmax in iPET assessment 
predicts refractory disease and distinguishes ultra-high-risk DLBCL patients 
with a very dismal prognosis, who may benefit from PET-guided therapy 
adjustment."
617,"BACKGROUND: Adults with triple-class refractory (TCR) multiple myeloma (MM) have 
limited treatment options and poor prognosis, but the burden of TCR MM has not 
been well characterized. This study evaluated treatment patterns, overall 
survival (OS), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and healthcare resource 
use (HCRU) among patients with TCR MM in US clinical practice.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with TCR MM in the Connect MM Registry 
(NCT01081028; a large, US, multicenter, prospective observational cohort study 
of patients with newly diagnosed MM) were included. Patient characteristics, 
treatment patterns, HRQoL, and HCRU were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 
OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology for the overall cohort and for 
patients with/without ≥1 post-TCR line of therapy (LOT).
RESULTS: A total of 232 patients with TCR MM were included; 155 (67%) had ≥1 
post-TCR LOT (post-TCR-Treated subgroup; median 9.9 months of follow-up). Most 
common post-TCR treatments were carfilzomib (47%), pomalidomide (40%), and 
daratumumab (26%); median treatment duration was 3.3 months. Median OS was 9.9 
months in the overall population, 10.8 months in post-TCR-Treated patients, and 
2.6 months for those with no new post-TCR LOT. HRQoL deteriorated and pain 
increased over 1 year of follow-up, with clinically meaningfully changes in 
EQ-5D (mean, -0.06 points) and FACT-G (mean, -9.9 points). 124 (53%) patients 
had ≥1 all-cause hospitalization and 58 (25%) had ≥1 MM-related hospitalization; 
median annualized length of stay was 35.3 and 42.9 days, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The burden of TCR MM is substantial, emphasizing the need for more 
effective treatment options in the TCR setting."
618,"BACKGROUND: Although novel therapies improved prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) 
patients, clinical outcomes in the multi-refractory population are still poor.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from the Czech Registry of Monoclonal 
Gammopathies, identified and characterized triple-class exposed (3CE) 
relapsed/refractory MM patients, treatment patterns after 3CE, assessed overall 
survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to next treatment (TTNT), 
explored cohorts with and without triple- and penta-refractoriness.
RESULTS: In 83 3CE patients who started subsequent therapies, the median OS was 
14.2 months (95% CI, 8.5-19.9), PFS 6.2 months (95% CI, 3.9-8.5), and TTNT 7.2 
months (95% CI, 4.6-9.8). Triple- and penta-class refractory patients had a 
significantly worse prognosis in all outcomes. Their life expectancy was 
shorter, the disease progression started earlier, and the TTNT was shorter, 
which increased likelihood of becoming refractory to more therapies. 
Time-to-event results from the first index date and all index dates analyses 
were very similar.
CONCLUSION: Similar to previous studies from the US and Europe, our results show 
a high disease burden. Introduction of novel therapies, such as CAR-T cells, new 
bispecific and trispecific monoclonal antibodies, and other drugs, is expected 
to bring significant benefits to these patients."
619,"BACKGROUND: The evidence supporting intensive blood glucose control to prevent 
surgical site infections (SSIs) among liver transplant recipients is 
insufficient. We aimed to assess the effects of postoperative intensive blood 
glucose control (IBGC) against standard blood glucose control (SBGC) on the 
incidence of SSIs among adult liver transplant recipients.
METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier NCT03474666). The IBGC target was 80 to 130 mg/dL, and the SBGC 
target was below 180 mg/dL. Analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis.
RESULTS: Of the 41 recipients enrolled onto the trial, 20 were randomly 
allocated to the IBGC group and 21 to the SBGC group. There were no significant 
differences in SSIs among recipients allocated to either group (relative risk 
[RR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-2.88; P = .69). Mean (SD) blood 
glucose levels were significantly lower in the IBGC group in the 24-hour period 
after surgery (145.0 [20.7] mg/dL and 230.2 [51.6] mg/dL; P = .001). While there 
were fewer episodes of hypoglycemia in the IBGC group, this was not 
statistically significant. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia in 
either group. Hyperglycemia and severe hyperglycemia were significantly more 
frequent in the SBGC group (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52-0.93; P = .001 and RR, 0.07; 
95% CI, 0.01-0.48; P = .001, respectively). Length of hospital stay was 
significantly shorter for recipients in the IBGC group (13.1 [5.5] days vs 19.3 
[12.1] days; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Although this small trial did not find intensive control reduced 
SSI, it was associated with lower blood glucose levels, fewer episodes of 
hyperglycemia and severe hyperglycemia, and shorter length of hospital stay."

RESULTS: There were 55 and 52 participants in the online and conventional 
groups, respectively. The decreases in fasting blood glucose (-4.26 vs. 
-2.99 mmol/L), 2-h postprandial blood glucose (-4.48 vs. -2.68 mmol/L) and 
glycated haemoglobin (-22.11 vs. -6.21 mmol/mol) were more pronounced in the 
online compared to conventional group (all P < 0.05). After the intervention, 
self-management ability parameters, including diet control, foot care and total 
score, were improved in the online group compared with the conventional group, 
as well as all indexes of quality of life (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The online multidisciplinary weight loss management programme 
improved blood glucose in obese or overweight patients living with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Self-management ability parameters (including diet control, 
foot care and total score) and quality of life were improved in the online group 
compared with the conventional group."
621,"PurposeTo establish a prospective hospital-based cohort, featured by detailed 
multidimensional data of trauma patients with active follow-ups, which can be a 
reliable data source for all studies focusing on the effects or underlying 
mechanistic pathways of environmental and biological factors on multiple 
interested trauma-related outcomes, particularly the incidence and trajectory of 
trauma-related psychopathology, in Chinese population.MethodsThe China Severe 
Trauma Cohort (CSTC) enrolled all traumatized individuals aged 12 to 80 years 
admitted to the Trauma Center of West China Hospital between 1st March 2020 and 
8th July 2022. The bio-sample and detailed questionnaire data were collected at 
recruitment, and phone/internet follow-ups were scheduled at 1-, 3-, 6-, 
12-months after the baseline. Long-term health outcomes are planned to be 
obtained from administrative databases through data linkage.ResultsA total of 
2,500 trauma patients were enrolled (response rate=87.1%) with an average age of 
46.01 years, and most of the participants were males(62.6%). The proportions of 
participants with blood and fecal sample collected at baseline were 93.8% and 
66.3%, respectively. Upon 31st August 2022, the follow-up rate was 90.0%, 77.0%, 
76.5%, and 89.0% for 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-months follow-up, respectively. 
Fall/wrench (47.6%) and traffic accident (26.2%) were the top causes of current 
trauma. The most common psychopathology at recruitment was sleep 
disturbance(39.4%), followed by depression(22.6%), anxiety(18.2%), and acute 
stress reaction(7.8%), all of which showed recovering trajectories during the 
follow-up period, particularly the first 3 months after baseline.ConclusionsCSTC 
provides a platform with multidimensional data to study both short-term and 
long-term trauma-related health consequences, prompting early identification and 
intervention for individuals with high risk of health decline after trauma 
exposures."
622,"In mice and humans, Nik-related protein kinase (Nrk) is an X-linked gene that 
encodes a serine/threonine kinase belonging to GCK group 4. Nrk knockout (Nrk 
KO) mice exhibit delayed delivery, possibly due to defective communication 
between the Nrk KO conceptus and its mother. However, the mechanism of delayed 
labor remains largely unknown. Here, we found that in pregnant mothers with the 
Nrk KO conceptus, the serum progesterone (P4) and placental lactogen (PL-2) 
concentrations in late pregnancy were higher than those in the wild type. 
Moreover, we demonstrated that Nrk is expressed in trophoblast giant cells 
(TGCs) and syncytiotrophoblast-2 (SynT-2) in the labyrinth layer of the mouse 
placenta. In the human placenta, NRK is also expressed in Syn-T of villi. Both 
human Syn-T and mouse TGCs of the labyrinth layer are present within fetal 
tissues that are in direct contact with the maternal blood. The labyrinth layer 
of the Nrk KO conceptus was gigantic, with enlarged cytoplasm and Golgi bodies 
in the TGCs. To investigate the function of Nrk in the labyrinth layer, a 
differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed. The DEG analysis 
revealed that labor-promoting factors, such as prostaglandins, were decreased, 
and pregnancy-maintaining factors, such as the prolactin family and P4 receptor, 
were increased. These findings suggest that the Nrk KO mice exhibit delayed 
delivery owing to high P4 concentrations caused by the hypersecretion of 
pregnancy-maintaining factors, such as PL-2, from the placenta."
623,"AIMS: Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are known to have higher 
exposure to coronary risk than those without FH with similar low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level. Lipid-lowering medications (LLMs) are the 
mainstay treatments to lower the risk of premature coronary artery disease in 
patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, the LLM prescription pattern and 
its effectiveness among Malaysian patients with FH are not yet reported. The aim 
of this study was to report the LLM prescribing pattern and its effectiveness in 
lowering LDL-C level among Malaysian patients with FH treated in specialist 
hospitals.
METHODS: Subjects were recruited from lipid and cardiac specialist hospitals. FH 
was clinically diagnosed using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria. 
Patients' medical history was recorded using a standardized questionnaire. LLM 
prescription history and baseline LDL-C were acquired from the hospitals' 
database. Blood samples were acquired for the latest lipid profile assay.
RESULTS: A total of 206 patients with FH were recruited. Almost all of them were 
on LLMs (97.6%). Only 2.9% and 7.8% of the patients achieved the target LDL-C of 
＜1.4 and ＜1.8 mmol/L, respectively. The majority of patients who achieved the 
target LDL-C were prescribed with statin-ezetimibe combination medications and 
high-intensity or moderate-intensity statins. All patients who were prescribed 
with ezetimibe monotherapy did not achieve the target LDL-C.
CONCLUSION: The majority of Malaysian patients with FH received LLMs, but only a 
small fraction achieved the therapeutic target LDL-C level. Further 
investigation has to be conducted to identify the cause of the suboptimal 
treatment target attainment, be it the factors of patients or the prescription 
practice."

postpartum women, including, but not restricted to, nurses, midwives, family 
physicians, obstetricians, and anesthesiologists."
626,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is considered very important because of the increased 
risk for cardiovascular diseases. Identifying modifiable factors may help 
prevent MetS. We aimed to investigate the relationship between iodine intake as 
a dietary factor and MetS in euthyroid adult in an iodine-replete area. A total 
of 4,277 adult aged ≥19 years from the Korea National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey VI (2013-2015) with urinary iodine concentration (UIC) 
results and normal thyroid function were included. Participants were grouped 
according to their iodine nutrition status based on the WHO recommendations and 
modifications: insufficient (<100 μg/L), adequate (100-299 μg/L), and excessive 
(≥300 μg/L) iodine intake. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) for MetS according 
to the UIC groups using logistic regression models. Of the study participants, 
27.2% men and 23.9% women had MetS. Men with excessive iodine intake had a 
significantly lower risk of elevated triglycerides [OR 0.733, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.603-0.890, p = 0.010], as compared to those with adequate iodine 
intake. Women with insufficient iodine intake had a significantly greater risk 
of elevated blood glucose (OR 1.519, 95% CI 1.011-2.282, p = 0.044), as compared 
to those with adequate iodine intake. In women, insufficient iodine intake was a 
significant risk factor for MetS compared to adequate iodine intake, even after 
adjusting for confounding variables including age, smoking, alcohol consumption, 
walking activity, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and 
anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (OR 1.544, 95% CI 1.031-2.311, p = 0.035). 
There was no association between iodine intake and risk of MetS in men. In 
conclusion, insufficient iodine intake was associated with an increased risk of 
MetS only in euthyroid adult women. Our data support that sex differences may 
influence the relationship between iodine intake as a dietary pattern and MetS."
627,"The function of the dopamine transporter (DAT) is regulated by membrane 
cholesterol content. A direct, acute removal of membrane cholesterol by 
methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) has been shown to reduce dopamine (DA) uptake and 
release mediated by the DAT. This is of particular interest because a few widely 
prescribed statins that lower peripheral cholesterol levels are blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) penetrants, and therefore could alter DAT function through brain 
cholesterol modulation. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of 
prolonged atorvastatin treatment (24 h) on DAT function in neuroblastoma 2A 
cells stably expressing DAT. We found that atorvastatin treatment effectively 
lowered membrane cholesterol content in a concentration-dependent manner. 
Moreover, atorvastatin treatment markedly reduced DA uptake and abolished 
cocaine inhibition of DA uptake, independent of surface DAT levels. These 
deficits induced by atorvastatin treatment were reversed by cholesterol 
replenishment. However, atorvastatin treatment did not change amphetamine 
(AMPH)-induced DA efflux. This is in contrast to a small but significant 
reduction in DA efflux induced by acute depletion of membrane cholesterol using 
MβCD. This discrepancy may involve differential changes in membrane lipid 
composition resulting from chronic and acute cholesterol depletion. Our data 
suggest that the outward-facing conformation of DAT, which favors the binding of 
DAT blockers such as cocaine, is more sensitive to atorvastatin-induced 
cholesterol depletion than the inward-facing conformation, which favors the 
binding of DAT substrates such as AMPH. Our study on statin-DAT interactions may 
have clinical implications in our understanding of neurological side effects 
associated with chronic use of BBB penetrant statins."
628,"BACKGROUND: Alterations in cerebral vasculature are instrumental in affecting 
cognition. Current studies mainly focus on proximal large arteries and small 
vessels, while disregarding morphology and blood flow of the arteries between 
them (medium-to-large arteries).
METHODS: In this prospective study, two types of non-contrast enhanced magnetic 
resonance angiography (NCE-MRA) techniques, simultaneous non-contrast 
angiography and intraplaque hemorrhage (SNAP) and 3D Time-of-flight (TOF), were 
used to measure vascular morphologic features in medium-to-large intracranial 
arteries. Grey matter (GM) tissue level perfusion was assessed with arterial 
spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Twenty-seven subjects at high cardiovascular risk 
underwent baseline and 12-month follow-up MRI to compare the relationship 
between morphological features measured by NCE MRA, GM CBF by ASL MRI, and 
cognitive function measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
RESULTS: Changes in both global medium-to-large arteries and posterior cerebral 
(PCA) distal artery length and branch numbers, measured on SNAP MRA, were 
significantly associated with alterations in MoCA scores (P < 0.01), after 
adjusting for clinical confounding factors, total brain volume, and total white 
matter lesion (WML) volume. There were no associations between MoCA scores and 
vascular features on TOF MRA or ASL GM CBF.
CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in vascular features of distal medium-to-large arteries 
may be more sensitive for detecting potential changes in cognition than cerebral 
blood flow alterations at the parenchymal level captured by perfusion ASL. 
Hemodynamic information from distal medium-to-large arteries provides an 
additional tool to advance understanding of the vascular contributions to 
cognitive function."
629,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine the prognostic value of a 
pre-treatment peripheral blood signature and the peripheral blood 
signature-based nomogram for patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma (NPC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected 21 peripheral blood 
indicators from patients with NPC between 2004 and 2015. Data were randomly 
divided into a training and a validation set (ratio: 6:4). The peripheral blood 
signature was constructed based on candidate biomarkers using the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression model. Multivariable logistic 
regression was applied to identify the independent risk factors of overall 
survival to build the nomogram. The predictive value of the peripheral blood 
nomogram was evaluated using time-dependent area under the curve, decision curve 
analysis, and calibration curve.
RESULTS: In total, 6668 patients were enrolled with 4000 and 2668 in the 
training and validation cohorts, respectively. Four peripheral blood indicators, 
(white blood cell count, lymphocyte percentage, haemoglobin, and mean platelet 
volume), were included to construct the peripheral blood signature. Patients 
were divided into low- and high-risk groups using an optimal cut-off value of 
-1.71142. Patients in the high-risk group had significantly lower overall, 
distant metastasis-free, and progression-free survival than patients in the 
low-risk group in both cohorts (P < 0.05). We constructed and validated a 
peripheral blood signature-based nomogram in combination with five vital 
clinical characteristics, (age, sex, tumour stage, nodal stage, and 
pre-treatment Epstein-Barr virus DNA), which showed favourable performance.
CONCLUSION: Patients with NPC with different outcomes could be distinguished 
based on their peripheral blood signature score; the proposed peripheral blood 
signature-based nomogram offers individualised risk estimation."
630,"OBJECTIVE: Hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and 
hyperglycemia require frequent glucose monitoring, usually done with 
glucometers. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are common in the outpatient 
setting, but not yet approved for hospital use. We evaluated CGM accuracy, 
safety for insulin dosing, and CGM clinical reliability in 20 adult patients 
hospitalized with COVID-19 and having hyperglycemia.
METHODS: Study patients were fitted with a remotely monitored CGM. CGM values 
were evaluated against glucometer readings. The CGM sensor calibration was done 
if necessary. CGM values were used to dose insulin, without glucometer 
confirmation.
RESULTS: CGM accuracy against glucometer, expressed as mean absolute relative 
difference (MARD), was calculated using 812 paired glucometer-CGM values. The 
aggregate MARD was 10.4%. For time in range, grade 1, and grade 2 hyperglycemia, 
MARD was 11.4%, 9.4% and 9.1%, respectively, with small variation between 
medical floors and Intensive Care Units. There was no MARD correlation with 
patients' mean arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, daily hemoglobin, and 
glomerular filtration rates. CGM clinical reliability was high, with 99.7% of 
the CGM values falling within the ""safe"" zones of Clarke error grid.Post CGM 
placement, the frequency of glucometer measurements decreased from 5 to 3 and 
then 2 per day, reducing nurses' presence in patient rooms and limiting viral 
exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: With twice daily, on demand calibration, the inpatient CGM use was 
safe for insulin dosing, decreasing the frequency of glucometer fingersticks. 
For glucose levels >70 mg/dl, CGMs had adequate accuracy, without interference 
from vitals and laboratory values."
631,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac myxomatous aneurysms (CMA) are intracranial aneurysms caused 
by cardiac myxoma (CM). The exact mechanism underlying their development has not 
yet been elucidated. And an optimal treatment method has not yet been 
established because of rarity of the disease. In addition, most existing reports 
have had a short follow-up period or lack of follow-up imaging test results. The 
aim of this study was to provide better insights into the course and treatment 
options of CMAs.
METHODS: We describe four CMA patients treated in our hospital. And literature 
search was performed using PubMed and Embase. Keywords used were as follows: 
""cerebral myxomatous aneurysm"", ""myxomatous aneurysm"", ""cardiac myxoma"", and 
""intracranial aneurysm"". Only publications in English and related to this 
disorder with adequate follow-up periods and aneurysmal wall biopsy results were 
included. Clinical, radiological, pathological, and treatment characteristics 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 134 CMA cases were managed conservatively that included 5 
enlargements, 6 regressions, and 120 stable aneurysms were identified for a 
total of 453.33 aneurysm-years (1.76% per aneurysm-year, 1.32% per 
aneurysm-year, and 26.47% per aneurysm-year, respectively). Poor outcome rate 
was high in cases with hemorrhage (either parenchymal or SAH) due to rupture of 
the CMA (46.67%, 7 out of 15). Thirteen cases had aneurysm biopsy results of 
which 11 showed tumor invasion on the aneurysm wall.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though the natural course of unruptured, benign-looking CMAs 
appears to be favorable, the presence or absence of viable tumor cells in the 
aneurysm may promote an unfavorable disease course. In the case of large, 
symptomatic, and enlarging CMAs, surgical, endovascular, or combined treatment 
should be considered as the mortality and morbidity due to rupture might be 
high."
632,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a type of hemorrhagic stroke, is a neurological 
emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. After SAH, early 
brain injury (EBI) is the leading cause of poor prognosis in SAH patients. 
Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are a family of sulphhydryl-dependent peroxidases. 
Peroxiredoxin-3 (PRDX3) is mainly located in the mitochondria of neurons, which 
can remove hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); however, the effect of PRDX3 on EBI after 
SAH remains unclear. In this study, an endovascular perforation model was used 
to mimic SAH in Sprague Dawley rats in vivo. The results revealed that after 
SAH, PRDX3 levels decreased in the neurons. PRDX3 overexpression by 
neuron-specific adeno-associated viruses upregulated PRDX3 levels. Furthermore, 
PRDX3 overexpression improved long- and short-term behavioral outcomes and 
alleviated neuronal impairment in rats. Nissl staining revealed that the 
upregulation of PRDX3 promoted cortical neuron survival. PRDX3 overexpression 
decreased the H2O2 content and downregulated caspase-9 expression. In 
conclusion, PRDX3 participates in neuronal protection by inhibiting the neuronal 
mitochondria-mediated death pathway; PRDX3 may be an important target for EBI 
intervention after SAH."
633,"Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is a diagnosis which denotes the 
coexistence of pigmentary and vascular birthmarks of specific types, accompanied 
by variable multisystem involvement including central nervous system disease, 
asymmetrical growth and a predisposition to malignancy. Using a tightly 
phenotyped group and high depth next generation sequencing of affected tissues 
we discover here clonal mosaic variants in gene PTPN11 encoding SHP2 phosphatase 
as a cause of PPV type III or spilorosea. Within an individual the same variant 
is found in distinct pigmentary and vascular birthmarks and is undetectable in 
blood. We go on to demonstrate that the same variants can cause either the 
specific pigmentary or vascular phenotypes alone, as well as driving melanoma 
development within the pigmentary lesion. Protein conformational modelling 
highlights that while variants lead to loss of function at the level of the 
phosphatase domain, resultant conformational changes promote longer ligand 
binding. In vitro modelling of the missense variants confirms downstream MAPK 
pathway overactivation, and widespread disruption of human endothelial cell 
angiogenesis. Importantly, PTPN11-mosaic patients theoretically risk passing on 
the variant to their children as the germline RASopathy Noonan syndrome with 
lentigines. These findings improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and 
biology of naevus spilus and capillary malformation syndromes, paving the way 
for better clinical management."
634,"Zika virus became a public health concern when it re-emerged in 2015, due to its 
ability to cause congenital deformities in foetus and neurological complications 
in adults. Despite extensive data on protection, the interplay of protective and 
pathogenic adaptive immune responses towards ZIKV infection remains poorly 
understood. In this study, using a T-cell deficient mouse model that retains 
persistent ZIKV viral titres in the blood and organs, we show that adoptive 
transfer of CD8+ T-cells led to a significant reduction in viral load. This 
animal model reveals that ZIKV can induce grossly visible auricular dermatitis 
and blepharitis, mediated by ZIKV-specific CD8+ T-cells. Single cell RNA 
sequencing of these causative CD8+ T-cells from the ears show an overactivated 
and elevated cytotoxic signature in mice with severe symptoms. Our results 
strongly suggest a role for CD8+ T-cell associated pathologies post-ZIKV 
infection in CD4+ T-cell immunodeficient patients."
635,"Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5) plays an important biological 
function in immune defense and is highly expressed in activated macrophages, 
osteoclasts and dendritic cells. In teleost, the functionality of ACP5 remains 
to be revealed. In this study, we cloned and identified SoACP5 from red drum 
(Sciaenops ocellatus) and analyzed its function in vivo and in vitro. The open 
reading frame of SoACP5 is 1002 bp in length, encoding 333 amino acids. SoACP5 
shares high sequence identities (96.70%-49.25%) with ACP5 of other species. The 
SoACP5 mRNA was widely distributed in collected tissues of healthy red drum, and 
with the maximum in gills. The expression of SoACP5 increased significantly in 
vivo following challenge with Edwardsiella tarda. Moreover, the recombinant 
SoACP5 protein (rSoACP5) was purified with his-tag band resin columns, and 
confirmed to have phosphatase activity which was optimal at pH 5 and 55 °C. 
Various metal ions (K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+ and Fe3+) have 
different effects on phosphatase activity. rSoACP5 induced the cellular 
proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes. The over-expression and knockdown 
of SoACP5 in vivo had a significant effect on bacterial proliferation. 
Furthermore, both of the antibacterial activity and phosphatase activity were 
decreased when the reducedSoACP5 was oxidized by H2O2. In summary, the present 
study indicated that SoACP5 is likely involved in host defense against bacterial 
infection in S. ocellatus."
636,"INTRODUCTION: Moyamoya has been extensively described in East Asian populations, 
and despite its accepted clinical presentation and course, it is fundamental to 
describe major cerebrovascular complications in other ethnically diverse 
samples. Hence, we sought to determine if distinct ethnic groups are at higher 
risk of developing stroke using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.
METHODS: We included all moyamoya patients admitted from January 2013 until 
December 2018 in the NIS database. Multivariate regression analysis was used to 
determine the risk of developing stroke and poor outcomes in different races 
compared to white patients.
RESULTS: Out of the 6093 admissions with diagnosis of moyamoya disease that were 
captured, 2,520 were white (41.6%), 2,078 were African American (AA) (34.1%), 
721 were Hispanic (11.8%), and 496 were Asian (8.14%). For arterial ischemic 
stroke (AIS), we found that AA race had a significantly reduced risk of AIS 
compared to white patients (odds ratio = 0.8, 95% confidence interval: 0.7-0.9, 
p = 0.031). While being Hispanic or Asian significantly increased 1.5 and 2-fold 
the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the unique features and phenotypes of moyamoya 
cases among different ethnicities. While possibly AA are protected from 
developing AIS due to underlying causes of moyamoya such as sickle cell disease, 
Asians seems to be more susceptible to hemorrhagic stroke."
637,"In order to form follicles and ovulate normally, there must be abundant blood 
vessels. Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (AS), as a traditional Chinese 
medicinal herb, has the effects of tonifying the blood and activating the blood 
circulation. However, the effect of AS on angiogenesis in hen-follicles remains 
to be discovered. In this study, we identified vascular richness, granulosa 
layer thickness, expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 
(CD31) and the content of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in 
granulosa layers to elucidate the effect of AS extract on angiogenesis in 
preovulatory follicles (F1-F3) of late-phase laying hens (75 wk). Based on 
network pharmacology, we predicted beta-sitosterol, ferulic acid, and caffeic 
acid as the main active components of AS, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α 
(HIF1α), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) as hub targets 
of AS in angiogenesis. The intersection targets were enriched by Gene Ontology 
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and the hub 
targets were verified by immunofluorescence and western blot. Molecular docking 
of active components with hub targets was performed and verified in vitro. The 
results showed that AS extract promoted angiogenesis in preovulatory follicles 
and increased granulosa cell layer thickness, CD31 expression and content of 
VEGFA. Experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that AS extract promoted 
the expression of HIF1α and VEGFA, up-regulated the phosphorylation levels of 
VEGFR2. These results further demonstrated the reliability of molecular docking 
and network pharmacology findings. In summary, AS extract can promote 
angiogenesis in the preovulatory follicles in late-phase laying hens."
638,"Herein, we conducted a comparative study on the embryotoxicity of ochratoxin A 
(OTA) and its diastereomer 2'R-ochratoxin A (2'R-OTA) under in ovo conditions, 
as well as assess the in vitro embryotoxicity of these substances together with 
ochratoxin B and α-ochratoxin, using chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) embryo 
cell lines. In ovo tests involved egg incubation of 8 different groups (i.e., 
control ""0""-no puncture or injection (standard incubation); ""00""-punctured eggs 
without injection; ""OTA 0.25,"" ""OTA 0.50,"" ""OTA 0.75,"" ""2'R-OTA 0.25,"" ""2'R-OTA 
0.50,"" ""2'R-OTA 0.75""-eggs containing OTA or 2'R-OTA at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 
µg/egg concentration, respectively). The results confirmed OTA's impact on early 
and late embryo mortality, where chick hatchability decreased with increasing 
toxin dosage. Both OTA and 2'R-OTA demonstrated embryotoxicity, however, in the 
case of the highest OTA diastereomer dose, nearly 11% higher chick hatchability 
was observed compared with the group that received OTA. 2'R-OTA dosage did not 
reduce parameters chick quality compared to chicks hatched from control group 
eggs. OTA concentrations were higher than 2'R-OTA detected in chicken organs 
such as liver and kidney, whereas 2'R-OTA concentrations were higher in blood 
serum and heart. The presented studies highlighted the differences in the 
ability to accumulate toxins in certain organs, which, to a certain extent, may 
affect the potential toxicity on individual organs. Additionally, during in 
vitro tests, when assessing the cytotoxic effects of OTA and its analogues 
toward the chicken embryonic cell line in an MTT assay, the cell metabolic 
activity was inhibited to a comparable extent at 27-times higher concentration 
of 2'R-OTA than OTA (0.24 µM). Also, comparably lower toxicity was attributed to 
the remaining OTA derivatives."
639,"This experiment investigated the effects of different dietary starch sources on 
the growth and glucose metabolism of geese. A total of 240 healthy 35-day-old 
male geese were selected and randomly divided into 4 groups, with 6 replicates 
per group and 10 geese per replicate. Four types of diets were prepared, with 
glutinous rice (rapidly-digestible starch), corn, indica rice and high amylose 
as their starch sources, and fed for 28 d. Results showed that after consuming 
different feeds, the blood glucose of geese first increased and then decreased, 
reaching its maximum value 0.5 h after feeding, and there were significant 
differences between the groups (P < 0.05). The body weight of the corn and 
indica rice group geese at 63 d was higher than that of the high amylose group 
(P < 0.05). The serum total cholesterol (TCHO) content in the glutinous rice and 
corn groups was higher than in the high amylose group (P < 0.05). The serum 
insulin content in the glutinous rice group was lower than in the corn and high 
amylose groups (P < 0.05), while the glucagon content was higher (P < 0.05). The 
α-amylase activities of the pancreas, jejunal chyme, and jejunal mucosa in the 
glutinous rice group were higher than in the indica rice and high amylose groups 
(P < 0.05). The liver glycogen content in the glutinous rice group was higher 
than the other groups (P < 0.05). The liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(G-6-PD) content in the glutinous rice group was higher than the high amylose 
group's (P < 0.05), but the glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK-3β) content was 
lower (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the corn and indica rice diets had a positive 
effect on the growth performance of the geese, while the high amylose diet had a 
negative effect. The glutinous rice diet leads to rapid release of glucose, 
strengthening glucose metabolism pathways such as glycogen synthesis and the 
pentose phosphate pathway, and further influencing lipid metabolism."
640,"BACKGROUND: Several wearable, medical-grade consumer ECG devices are now 
available and integrated into consumer electronics like multi sensor fitness 
watches and scales. Specific consumer ECGs can also come in the form of patches 
or thin sensor plates in credit card or other shapes. Watches with ECG 
capabilities are often multi vital sign sensor devices. The majority of these 
devices are usually connected to a mobile smartphone. However, there are pros 
and cons to their use.
METHODS: We review here an exemplary selection of modern consumer ECG devices 
based on device type, recording method and the number of standard ECG channels 
derived.
RESULTS: Single-channel consumer ECG devices such as Smart Watches can be useful 
for detecting and monitoring atrial fibrillation and flutter and other 
arrhythmias, as well as ectopic complexes. However, they are currently limited 
with respect to recording duration and information content (a single-channel or 
limb‑lead ECG having less diagnostic information than a 12‑lead ECG). While some 
non watch-based consumer ECG devices can now record all 6 limb leads to yield 
increased information, no consumer ECG devices can currently reliably detect 
ST-segment deviations, potentially indicating myocardial infarction or ischemic 
episodes. Moreover, barriers to use still exist for at-risk elderly people. 
Finally, there currently is no universal data exchange format.
CONCLUSION: Consumer ECG devices, whether in fitness or fashionable design, 
allow for reliable detection of atrial fibrillation. Timely detection of atrial 
fibrillation and subsequent treatment might protect against stroke, especially 
in high-risk groups, yet prospective evidence is still lacking. Six-channel 
consumer ECG and longer data collection capabilities extend potential 
functionality, including for the monitoring of ST-segments and QT intervals. 
However, no currently available devices are sufficiently suitable for the 
detection of myocardial infarction or ischemia, which is why portable 12-channel 
technologies are desirable. For the reliable detection of a myocardial 
infarction, the determination of specific myocardial infarction blood markers 
and evaluation of patient medical history still is indispensable in addition to 
the 12 lead ECG."
641,"Vitamin C is an essential vitamin that acts as a co-factor for many enzymes 
involved in epigenetic regulation in humans. Low vitamin C levels in 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) promote self-renewal and vitamin C 
supplementation retards leukaemogenesis in vitamin C-deficient mouse models. 
Studies on vitamin C levels in patients with myeloid malignancies are limited. 
We thus conducted a retrospective analysis on a prospective cohort of patients 
with myeloid malignancies on whom plasma vitamin C levels were measured serially 
at diagnosis and during treatment. Baseline characteristics including 
hematological indices, cytogenetics, and molecular mutations are described in 
this cohort. Among 64 patients included in our study, 11 patients (17%) had low 
vitamin C levels. We noted a younger age at diagnosis for patients with myeloid 
malignancies who had low plasma vitamin C levels. Patients with low plasma 
vitamin C levels were more likely to have acute myeloid leukemia compared to 
other myeloid malignancies. Low vitamin C levels were associated with ASXL1 
mutations. Our study calls for further multi-institutional studies to understand 
the relevance of low plasma vitamin C level in myeloid neoplasms, the role of 
vitamin C deficiency in leukemogenesis, and the potential benefit of vitamin C 
supplementation."
642,"Several diseases are caused by the lack of functional proteins, including 
lysosomal storage diseases or haemophilia A and B. Patients suffering from one 
of these diseases are treated via enzyme replacement therapies to restore the 
missing protein. Although this treatment strategy prevents some disease 
symptoms, enzyme replacement therapies are very expensive and require very 
frequent infusions, which can cause infusion adverse reactions and massively 
impair the quality of life of the patients. This review proposes a technology to 
sustainably produce proteins within the patient to potentially make frequent 
protein-infusions redundant. This technology is based on blood circulating 
immune cells as producers of the needed therapeutic protein. To ensure a stable 
protein concentration over time the cells are equipped with a system, which 
induces cell proliferation when low therapeutic protein levels are detected and 
a system inhibiting cell proliferation when high therapeutic protein levels are 
detected."
643,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare clinical outcomes in 
patients who experienced intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) while taking apixaban or 
rivaroxaban and were reversed with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates 
(4F-PCC) or andexanet alfa (AA). This retrospective cohort included adult 
patients that received 4F-PCC or AA for the initial management of an apixaban- 
or rivaroxaban-associated ICH. A primary outcome of excellent or good hemostatic 
efficacy at 12 h post-reversal was assessed. Secondary outcomes evaluated were 
change in hematoma volume size at 12 h, functional status at discharge, need for 
surgical intervention or additional hemostatic agents post-reversal, new 
thrombotic event within 28 days, 28-day all-cause mortality, discharge 
disposition, and hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay. A total of 70 
patients were included (4F-PCC, n = 47; AA, n = 23). For the primary outcome 
analysis, 21 patients were included in the 4F-PCC group and 12 in the AA group. 
The rate of effective hemostasis was similar between the 4F-PCC and AA groups 
(66.7% vs 75%, p = 0.62). There were no statistically significant differences 
between the groups for secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality (40.4% vs 
39.1%, p = 0.92) and thrombotic complications within 28 days of reversal (17.0% 
vs 21.7%, p = 0.63). In patients who experienced an ICH while taking apixaban or 
rivaroxaban, 4F-PCC and AA were found to have similar rates of excellent or good 
hemostatic efficacy."
644,"BACKGROUND: Antarctic krill oil (KO) is a natural source of n-3 polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), and is rich in phospholipids, Eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA), Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), astaxanthin, flavonoids, vitamins, trace 
elements, and other bioactive substances. KO has been confirmed to have 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. n-3 PUFAs also have been 
purported to improve the recovery of muscular performance. Moreover, the 
phospholipids present in KO can enhance n-3 PUFA bioavailability because of its 
higher absorption rate in plasma compared to fish oil. Astaxanthin, found in 
Antarctic KO, is a red carotenoid and powerful antioxidant that inhibits 
oxidative stress after intense exercise. Hence, we examined the effect of KO 
supplementation on the recovery of exercise by measuring muscular performance, 
oxidant/antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, and the markers of muscle 
damage following a rigorous bout of resistance exercise.
METHODS: 30 college-aged resistance-trained males (20.4 ± 0.92 years, 
74.09 ± 7.23 kg, 180.13 ± 4.72 cm) were randomly supplemented with 3 g/d KO or 
placebo (PL) for 3 days and continued to consume after resistance exercise for 
3 days until the experiment finished. Before supplementation, pre-exercise 
performance assessments of knee isokinetic strength, 20 m sprint, hexagon test, 
and blood serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and 
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were completed. Then after 3 days of 
supplementation, participants completed a bout of muscle-damaging exercise, and 
subsequently, they performed and repeated the exercise performance assessments 
and blood-related indicators tests immediately (0 h), as well as at 6, 24, 48, 
and 72 h post-muscle-damaging exercise.
RESULTS: Compared to the PL group, the serum CK of KO group was significantly 
lower at 24 h and 48 h post-exercise; the hexagon test time of the KO group was 
significantly lower than that of the PL group at 6 h and 24 h post-exercise; the 
KO group's isokinetic muscle strength showed different degrees of recovery than 
that of the PL group at 24 h and 48 h, and even over-recovery at 72 h 
post-exercise; the SOD level of the KO group was significantly higher than that 
of the PL group at 0, 6, and 24 h after exercise; the T-AOC level of the KO 
group was significantly higher than that of the PL group at 0, 6, and 72 h after 
exercise; the MDA level of the KO group was significantly lower than that of the 
PL group at 6 h; and there was no significant difference in serum IL-2, IL-6, 
and TNF-α between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that 3 g/d KO supplementation and continued 
supplementation after exercise can alleviate exercise-induced muscle damage 
(EIMD) and promote post-exercise recovery."
645,"Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA CN) is heritable and easily obtained from 
low-pass sequencing (LPS). This study investigated the genetic correlation of 
mtDNA CN with growth and carcass traits in a multi-breed and crossbred beef 
cattle population. Blood, leucocyte, and semen samples were obtained from 2,371 
animals and subjected to LPS that resulted in nuclear DNA (nuDNA) and mtDNA 
sequence reads. Mitochondrial DNA CN was estimated as the ratio of mtDNA to 
nuDNA coverages. Variant calling was performed from mtDNA, and 11 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were identified in the population. Samples were 
classified in taurine haplogroups. Haplogroup and mtDNA type were further 
classified based on the 11 segregating SNP. Growth and carcass traits were 
available for between 7,249 and 60,989 individuals. Associations of mtDNA CN, 
mtDNA haplogroups, mtDNA types, and mtDNA SNP with growth and carcass traits 
were estimated with univariate animal models, and genetic correlations were 
estimated with a bivariate animal model based on pedigree. Mitochondrial DNA CN 
tended (P-value ≤ 0.08) to be associated with birth weight and weaning weight. 
There was no association (P-value > 0.10) between mtDNA SNP, haplogroups, or 
types with growth and carcass traits. Genetic correlation estimates of mtDNA CN 
were -0.30±0.16 with birth weight, -0.31±0.16 with weaning weight, -0.15±0.14 
with post-weaning gain, -0.11±0.19 with average daily dry-matter intake, 
-0.04±0.22 with average daily gain, -0.29±0.13 with mature cow weight, 
-0.11±0.13 with slaughter weight, -0.14±0.13 with carcass weight, -0.07±0.14 
with carcass backfat, 0.14±0.14 with carcass marbling, and -0.06±0.14 with 
ribeye area. In conclusion, mtDNA CN was negatively correlated with most traits 
investigated, and the genetic correlation was stronger with growth traits than 
with carcass traits."
646,"The objective of this study was to determine the dose of folate and vitamin B12 
in beef heifers fed rumen protected methionine and choline required to maintain 
increased B12 levels and intermediates of the methionine-folate cycle in 
circulation. Angus heifers (n = 30; BW = 392.6 ± 12.6 kg) were individually fed 
and assigned to one of five treatments: 0XNEG: Total mixed ration (TMR) and 
saline injections at d 0 and 7 of the estrous cycle, 0XPOS: TMR, rumen protected 
methionine (MET) fed at 0.08% of the diet DM, rumen protected choline (CHOL) fed 
at 60 g/d, and saline injections at d 0 and 7, 0.5X: TMR, MET, CHOL, 5 mg B12, 
and 80 mg folate at d 0 and 7, 1X: TMR, MET CHOL, 10 mg vitamin B12, and 160 mg 
folate at d 0 and 7, and 2X: TMR, MET, CHOL, 20 mg B12, and 320 mg folate at d 0 
and 7. All heifers were estrus synchronized but not bred, and blood was 
collected on d 0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 14 of a synchronized estrous cycle. 
Heifers were slaughtered on d 14 of the estrous cycle for liver collection. 
Serum B12 concentrations were greater in the 0.5X, 1X, and 2X, compared with 
0XNEG and 0XPOS on all days after treatment initiation (P < 0.0001). Serum 
folate concentrations were greater for the 2X treatment at d 5, 7, and 9 of the 
cycle compared with all other treatments (P ≤ 0.05). There were no differences 
(P ≥ 0.19) in hepatic methionine-cycle or choline analyte concentrations by 
treatment. Concentrations of hepatic folate cycle intermediates were always 
greater (P ≤ 0.04) in the 2X treatment compared with the 0XNEG and 0XPOS 
heifers. Serum methionine was greater (P = 0.04) in the 0.5X and 2X heifers 
compared with 0XNEG, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) tended (P = 0.06) to be 
greater in the 0.5X heifers and the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM):SAH ratio was 
decreased (P = 0.05) in the 0.5X treatment compared with the 0XNEG, 0XPOS, and 
2X heifers. The hepatic transcript abundance of MAT2A and MAT2B were decreased 
(P ≤ 0.02) in the 0.5X heifers compared with the 0XNEG, 0XPOS, and 2X heifers. 
These data support that beef heifers fed rumen protected methionine and choline 
require 20 mg B12 and 320 mg folate once weekly to maintain increased 
concentrations of B12 and folate in serum. Furthermore, these data demonstrate 
that not all supplementation levels are equal in providing positive responses, 
and that some levels, such as the 0.5X, may result in a stoichiometric imbalance 
in the one-carbon metabolism pathway that results in a decreased SAM:SAH ratio."
647,"Peripheral blood eosinophilia is associated with a variety of benign and 
neoplastic conditions. Rarely, marked eosinophilia can mask an underlying Acute 
Leukaemia, delaying the correct diagnosis and treatment. Here, we report a case 
of 14-year-old boy, who presented with marked eosinophilia and space occupying 
lesion in the brain. Bone marrow biopsy and biopsy of brain lesion were 
performed to assess the underlying disorder, revealing the unexpected diagnosis 
of Precursor B- Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in this patient. Cytogenetic 
studies revealed a normal male karyotype. This case highlights the significance 
of considering the rare possibility of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia among the 
differential diagnosis of persistent eosinophilia in order to facilitate prompt 
and appropriate treatment."
648,"BACKGROUND: Variceal bleeding is a key and most fatal complication observed in 
chronic liver disease patients with portal hypertension and is a major 
contributor to the high morbidity and mortality seen in these patients. 
Exploring the predictors of rebleeding in chronic liver disease patients is of 
paramount importance to alter disease course and impact on morbidity and 
mortality.
METHODS: About 50 patients with chronic liver disease who previously had 
evidence of varices on upper GI endoscopy and had at least one episode of 
rebleeding after EVBL were included in this study. Patients were assessed for 
the possible contributors to rebleeding through complete history, clinical 
examination, coagulation profile and platelet count, ultrasound features 
(splenic size and portal pressure), and upper GI endoscopic findings (site and 
grade of varices, red sign). Sample selection was done using non-probability 
purposive sampling technique and sample size calculated using the standard WHO 
formula. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20.
RESULTS: In this study, mean age of the patients was 51.34±6.34 years with male 
predominance (64%). Rebleeding was significantly associated with grade of 
varices, presence of red sign on upper GI endoscopy, site of varices, splenic 
size and coagulopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Rebleeding in chronic liver disease patients following EVBL is 
predicted by grade, extent and site of varices, red sign on upper GI endoscopy, 
splenic size and coagulation disturbances."
649,"BACKGROUND: Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) characterized by t (15;17) 
leading to formation of fusion protein PML-RARA is an acute leukaemia with 
highest mortality. A remarkable improvement in the outcomes has been witnessed 
due to evolution of highly effective targeted therapies replacing the 
traditional chemotherapy is most patients. However limited data is available 
regarding treatment outcomes of APL using various novel regimens from developing 
countries like Pakistan.
METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive study which included APL patients 
treated at AFBMTC Rawalpindi from 2005 to 2020. It included a total of 51 
eligible patients with a diagnosis of de novo APL confirmed by the presence of 
PML-RARA transcript or presence of t (15;17) by cytogenetics or FISH analysis. 
The protocols used for treatment included the UKAML MRC 12, the LPA-99/LPA-2005 
PETHEMA, the APML4 and non-chemotherapy based ATO-ATRA protocol.
RESULTS: The study included 51 patients in which 31 (60.78%) were male and 20 
(39.2%) were female. The median age at diagnosis was 30 years (range 5-70). The 
commonest symptom was fever seen in 43 (84.3%) patients and bruising was the 
commonest physical finding present in 44 (86.3%) patients. High-risk patients 
were 23 (46.1%), 18 (35.3%) were intermediate risk and 10 (19.6%) were low risk. 
The LPA99/LPA2005 was most frequently employed protocol being used in 36 (72%) 
patients. There were 2 deaths during induction and 44 (86.3%) achieved CR post 
induction. The median follow up time was 32 months (range 1 to 190 months) with 
an overall survival (OS) of 76.5% and a relapse free survival (RFS) of 66.7.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows APL is a highly curable malignancy and outcomes 
have improved with newer non chemotherapy based therapies. It can also be 
concluded that outcomes of APL gradually improved over the past 2 decades due to 
improvement in supportive care, provision of blood products and use of newer 
protocols. The prognosis remains less favourable in high risk patients."
650,"BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder of patchy non scarring 
hair loss. Steroids, either Intralesional, e.g, triamcinolone or potent topical, 
e.g, clobetasol are the first line treatment. Platelet rich plasma is an 
autologous concentrated plasma with growth factors which enhances regeneration 
of hair follicles. It is simple and effective treatment with no major side 
effects. Objective was to compare the efficacy of intralesional injection of 
platelet rich plasma and triamcinolone in patients of alopecia areata. It was a 
randomized controlled trial (open-labelled), conducted at the Dermatology 
Department, Combined Military Hospital Abbottabad from 1st May to 31st December 
2021.
METHODS: Sixty clinically diagnosed patients of alopecia areata of the scalp 
were enrolled in the study. They were divided into two groups, A and B. Random 
numbers table was used to allocate 30 patients into each group. Group A patients 
were given an intralesional injection of triamcinolone while intralesional 
platelet rich plasma was given to Group B. Both treatments were repeated at 
one-month intervals for four months. In the study, Chi-square tests were used to 
compare effectiveness. It was considered significant when the p-value turned out 
to be <0.05..
RESULTS: There was significant difference in complete response rate between 
intralesional injection of steroid and intralesional injection of platelet rich 
plasma. Platelet rich plasma was less effective (p =0.05). Local corticosteroid 
injection was significantly more effective than platelet rich plasma (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Intralesional injection of steroid is an effective and considerable 
treatment for alopecia areata. This study also proposes intralesional injection 
of platelet rich plasma as an alternative therapy for alopecia areata as it is 
not associated with serious local side effects."
651,"BACKGROUND: To explore the clinical application of robotic-assisted surgery in 
pediatric solid tumors and to explore its feasibility.
METHODS: From 2015 to 2022, 53 children with solid tumors underwent 
robotic-assisted surgery in our center were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean weight of the patients was 27.7 kg, and the mean age was 6.7 
years. The average tumor volume was 5.5*4.6*3.7 cm. Two procedures (3.8%) were 
converted. The mean total operative time was 198.5 min. The mean estimated blood 
loss was 27.1 ml, and no intraoperative complications occurred. Two (3.8%) 
patients had postoperative complications. At a median follow-up of 21.2 months, 
one (1.9%) patient with malignant tumors stopped treatment, and two (3.8%) 
patients developed tumor recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted tumor resection is feasible in highly selected 
cases of young age, light weight, huge tumor or malignant tumor. This article is

652,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and induced 
expression of skin biomarkers of AK111 injection after multiple administrations 
in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
METHODS: This study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-parallel-controlled 
study using a dose escalation mode of multiple doses. A total of 48 subjects 
were sequentially randomized to receive each AK111 dose regimen (75 mg, 150 mg, 
300 mg, 450 mg) or the corresponding placebo. All subjects were treated with the 
study drug at weeks 0, 1, 4, and 8 and were unblinded at week 12, with the 
placebo group ending and the AK111 group being followed up to 20 weeks.
RESULTS: At week 12, compared with placebo, the percentage of subjects achieving 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) and static Physician Global 
Assessment (sPGA) 0/1 in the AK111 75 mg-450 mg dose groups was significantly 
increased, and higher PASI90 was achieved in the 150 mg, 300 mg, and 450 mg dose 
groups than in the 75 mg group. All efficacy indicators were maintained at week 
20. The incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) was 0% 
(0/48). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were not detected in any subject. The 
proportion of subjects who reported any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
was 75.0% in the AK111 group, similar to the 66.7% in the placebo group. The 
most commonly reported adverse events were hyperglycemia, elevated blood 
pressure, and hypokalemia. The AK111 pharmacokinetics showed approximate dose 
proportionality with regard to the maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and 
area under the curve from 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration 
(AUC0-t) following subcutaneous injection doses of 150-450 mg.
CONCLUSIONS: After moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis subjects received 
multiple subcutaneous AK111 injections of 150-450 mg, AK111 exposure increased 
in a roughly dose-proportional relationship. AK111 was safe and tolerable. In 
subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, AK111 demonstrated 
encouraging preliminary efficacy, which was sustained for a relatively long time 
after the last dose administration.

654,"Recent evidence suggests that the prognostic impact of gene mutations in 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may differ depending on the 
immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene somatic hypermutation (SHM) status. In 
this study, we assessed the impact of nine recurrently mutated genes (BIRC3, 
EGR2, MYD88, NFKBIE, NOTCH1, POT1, SF3B1, TP53, and XPO1) in pre-treatment 
samples from 4580 patients with CLL, using time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) as the 
primary end-point in relation to IGHV gene SHM status. Mutations were detected 
in 1588 (34.7%) patients at frequencies ranging from 2.3-9.8% with mutations in 
NOTCH1 being the most frequent. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, 
mutations in all genes except MYD88 were associated with a significantly shorter 
TTFT. In multivariate analysis of Binet stage A patients, performed separately 
for IGHV-mutated (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL), a different spectrum of gene 
alterations independently predicted short TTFT within the two subgroups. While 
SF3B1 and XPO1 mutations were independent prognostic variables in both U-CLL and 
M-CLL, TP53, BIRC3 and EGR2 aberrations were significant predictors only in 
U-CLL, and NOTCH1 and NFKBIE only in M-CLL. Our findings underscore the need for 
a compartmentalized approach to identify high-risk patients, particularly among 
M-CLL patients, with potential implications for stratified management."
655,"BACKGROUND: Successful anastomotic healing is critical to preventing 
complications after intestinal surgery. We aimed to compare the early healing of 
end-to-end small bowel anastomosis by self-forming magnets with surgical 
stapling in a porcine model.
METHOD: Six Yorkshire pigs underwent 2 simultaneous small bowel anastomoses 
using a circular stapler and self-forming magnet technique. The primary outcome 
was healing quality, measured by 4 histologic features: inflammatory cell 
infiltration, collagen formation, grade of inflammation, and bacterial 
infiltration at the anastomosis. The samples were evaluated at days 1, 3, and 7. 
Gross evaluation of anastomotic integrity was a secondary outcome.
RESULTS: The self-forming magnet group displayed significant differences at each 
time point. On day 1, the stapled group displayed dense inflammatory cell 
infiltration and extensively ulcerated intestinal layers with significant edema. 
The self-forming magnet group showed less inflammatory infiltrate, and all 
intestinal layers remained compressed in direct apposition. By day 3, the 
self-forming magnet group already exhibited neovascularization with scant 
bacterial colonies. By contrast, stapled anastomoses had large areas of 
inflammation separating collagen fibers with prevalent bacterial infiltrations. 
On day 7, self-forming magnet anastomoses were characterized by robust 
neovascularization, maturing granulation tissue, and mucosal re-epithelization 
without significant inflammation. Meanwhile, stapled samples had persisting 
dense inflammation, tissue cavities with hemorrhage, and immature fibrous 
tissue. Grossly, the self-forming magnet created a patent lumen without defect, 
whereas stapled anastomoses demonstrated focal areas of serosal separation.
CONCLUSION: Bowel anastomosis by self-forming magnets is associated with 
superior early histologic healing metrics, including early seal generation 
through mechanical compression, decreased inflammation, early 
neovascularization, lower bacterial infiltration, and faster re-epithelization."
656,"Aging of the vascular system is the main cause of many cardiovascular diseases. 
The structure and function of the blood vessel wall change with aging. To 
prevent age-related cardiovascular diseases, it is essential to understand the 
cellular heterogeneity of vascular wall and changes of cellular communication 
among cell subpopulations during aging. Here, using published single-cell RNA 
sequencing datasets of young and old monkey aortas, we analyzed the 
heterogeneity of vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in detail 
and identified a distinct endothelial cell subpopulation that involved in 
vascular remodeling and calcification. Moreover, cellular communication that 
changed with aging was analyzed and we identified a number of signaling pathways 
that associated with vascular aging. We found that EGF signaling pathway play an 
essential role in vascular remodeling and calcification of aged aortas. This 
work provided a better understanding of vascular aging and laid the foundation 
for prevention of age-related vascular pathologies."
657,"Perimenopause is a natural transition to menopause, when hormone disturbance can 
result in both short-term mental disorders, such as anxiety, and long-term 
neuroinflammation due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, which may lead to 
more serious neurological disorders later on, such as dementia. Effective 
treatments may prevent both short-term and long-term neurological sequela, which 
formed the aim of this study. In aged female C57BL/6 mice (16-18 months of age), 
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentiated from human-induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs), were administered via tail vein injection. Mice showed 
increased blood estrogen levels, alleviated anxiety and neuroinflammation, and 
improved BBB integrity. Interestingly, transplanted MSCs were located close to 
ovarian sympathetic nerves and decreased ovarian norepinephrine levels, which in 
turn increased ovarian estrogen secretion. Moreover, the administration of 
anastrozole, an inhibitor of estrogen synthesis, diminished the therapeutic 
effects of MSCs in vivo, suggesting the effect to be estrogen-dependent. In 
vitro study confirmed the impact of MSCs on sympathetic nerves via mitochondria 
exchange. In conclusion, iPSC-derived MSCs may provide a novel option to manage 
perimenopause-related hormonal dysregulation and neurological disorders during 
the female aging process."
658,"AIM: To evaluate associations between calcium administration and outcomes among 
children with in-hospital cardiac arrest and among specific subgroups in which 
calcium use is hypothesized to provide clinical benefit.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of observational data collected 
prospectively as part of the ICU-RESUScitation project. Children 37 weeks 
post-conceptual age to 18 years who received chest compressions in one of 18 
intensive care units from October 2016-March 2021 were eligible. Data included 
child and event characteristics, pre-arrest laboratory values, pre- and 
intra-arrest haemodynamics, and outcomes. Outcomes included sustained return of 
spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital discharge, and survival to 
hospital discharge with favourable neurologic outcome. A propensity score 
weighted cohort was used to evaluate associations between calcium use and 
outcomes. Subgroups included neonates, and children with hyperkalaemia, sepsis, 
renal insufficiency, cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, and 
calcium-avid cardiac diagnoses.
RESULTS: Of 1,100 in-hospital cardiac arrests, median age was 0.63 years (IQR 
0.19, 3.81); 450 (41%) received calcium. Among the weighted cohort, calcium use 
was not associated with sustained ROSC (aOR, 0.87; CI95 0.61-1.24; p=0.445), but 
was associated with lower rates of both survival to hospital discharge (aOR, 
0.68; CI95 0.52-0.89; p=0.005) and survival with favourable neurologic outcome 
at hospital discharge (aOR, 0.75; CI95 0.57-0.98; p=0.038). Among subgroups, 
calcium use was associated with lower rates of survival to hospital discharge in 
children with sepsis and renal insufficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcium use was common during paediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest 
and associated with worse outcomes at hospital discharge."
659,"BACKGROUND: Avocados are a rich source of unsaturated fats and bioactives, 
however, their role in altering cardiometabolic risk factors is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To review the effects of consuming diets containing avocado compared 
to control diets containing no or low amounts of avocado on cardiometabolic risk 
factors in adults who were healthy, had clinical CVD or were at increased risk 
of CVD.
METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched (PubMed, Web of Science, 
Scopus, ProQuest and a Clinical Trials Registry) along with Google Scholar to 
identify studies published between January 1990 and November 10, 2021. 
Randomised controlled trials (RCT) ≥ 3 weeks and prospective cohort studies were 
included. Ten studies, nine RCTs (n=503 participants) and one prospective 
observational study (n=55,407), met the inclusion criteria. Outcomes assessed by 
meta-analysis were: LDL-C (primary), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C and 
triglycerides. Outcomes assessed by narrative review were: TC to HDL-C ratio, 
non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B, blood pressure, body weight, BMI, waist 
circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, body composition, blood glucose and insulin 
concentrations. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 
tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and quality of evidence examined using the 
GRADE method. Random-effects models meta-analyses were performed where there was 
≥ 3 studies of the same design (i.e. RCT) and reporting the same outcome. 
Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by calculating Chi2 and I2 statistics, 
and publication bias by funnel plots.
RESULTS: Overall there was a small, significant reduction in TC (-5.08 mg/dL 
(-9.29, -0.87 mg/dL), p = 0.02) in avocado vs. control groups and no significant 
difference in LDL-C, HDL-C or triglycerides. Subgroup analysis demonstrated 
significant reductions in LDL-C (-9.4 mg/dl (-10.84, -7.95 mg/dL) p <0.00001) 
and TC (-7.54 mg/dL (-9.40, -5.68 mg/dL), p < 0.00001) in avocado vs. control 
groups in hypercholesterolaemic populations while no differences were seen in 
normocholesterolaemic populations. However, the certainty in the findings was 
graded as low to very low. Body weight and composition were not negatively 
affected by avocado consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: Avocado consumption may reduce TC and LDL-C in people with 
hypercholesterolaemia. Avocado consumption does not negatively impact body 
weight. Larger, well-conducted studies are needed to have greater confidence in 
the role of avocado consumption on CVD risk factors."
660,"BACKGROUND: The Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been proven to 
improve survival in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD), however it is 
associated with a high rate of complications. We aimed to quantify the incidence 
of early (≤3 months) and late (>3 months) complications (EC, LC) in ACHD 
patients implanted with an ICD and identify their clinical predictors.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 207 patients who had ICD follow-up at 
Toronto General Hospital between 1996 and 2019.
RESULTS: Most common diagnoses were Tetralogy of Fallot (32.4%), 
dextro-transposition of the great arteries (17.9%), congenital corrected 
transposition of the great arteries (13%). No intraprocedural complications were 
observed. Median follow up was 3.4 years (0.1-23). 24 patients (12%) developed 
EC (4 hematomas, 20 lead dislodgments). A total of 56 LC occurred (46% lead 
failure, 21% infection, 11% prophylactic lead extraction, 9% neurologic pain, 9% 
erosion, 4% other) with an incidence rate of LC of 18% per 5 person-years. 
Anatomic complexity (odds ratio 2.9,p=0.02) and CRTD implant(OR 2.5,p=0.04) were 
associated with EC. Survival free from LC was 92%, 86%, 65% respectively after 
1,5 and 10 years. Presence of legacy leads (hazard ratio 2.9,p=0.006) and 
subpulmonary ejection fraction (5% increase, HR 1.35,p=0.031) were associated 
with LC.
CONCLUSION: ACHD patients at risk of SCD continue to benefit from newer device 
technology. However, these patients-particularly those with greater anatomic and 
device complexity-remain at increased risk of developing complications over 
their lifetime. Given the life expectancy of this population, careful 
consideration needs to be given when a device for primary prevention is being 
contemplated."
661,"INTRODUCTION: V-Healthy® is a grass roots vascular health education and 
awareness campaign that educates high school students about the importance of 
the vascular disease risks they face today and its impact decades later, and 
empowers healthcare professionals and schoolteachers to lead vascular health 
education in their communities. This study evaluates the impact of the 
V-Healthy® initiative in empowering and educating adolescents about the 
implications of vascular disease risk factors and in creating a blueprint for a 
community outreach program that focuses on vascular health and disease education 
and awareness.
METHODS: The V-Healthy® program is an initiative that connects community 
vascular healthcare professionals and educators with high school students, for a 
day of vascular health education. The V-Healthy® program curriculum is provided 
in two distinct stages. Stage I consists of didactic vascular health education 
and takes place in the classroom for the duration of one class period (40-50 
minutes). The class period is divided into 4 sessions including a PowerPoint 
presentation to teach the impact of vascular disease risk factors (hypertension, 
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking-vaping, and genetics) on the development of 
peripheral arterial disease, venous disease, aortic disease, and stroke, and 3 
hands-on sessions that introduce students to vascular innovation & technology, 
vascular patients, and the diagnosis of a vascular disease risk factor like 
hypertension. Stage I concludes with a student questionnaire aimed to gauge 
students' retention of the material and attitude toward the program. Stage II 
offers students (with parental consent) the opportunity to participate in the 
'Diagnosing Hypertension' study. Students were provided automated blood pressure 
monitors and taught to measure blood pressure in their parents daily for one 
week. Findings are recorded in designated blood pressure logs, which are then 
categorized using the 2018 American Heart Association blood pressure 
categorization system: normal (<120/<80), elevated (120-129/<80), stage I 
(130-139/80-89), or stage II (≥140/≥90). No identifiable student or guardian 
information is collected.
RESULTS: Over 3-years, more than 12,000 students participated in the V-Healthy® 
Program and 5120 students completed student surveys which indicated that 97% 
improved their understanding of vascular health, >93% could identify vascular 
disease risk factors, 84% wanted to educate their families, and 76% wanted more 
vascular health education. A total of 1064 students participated in the 
'Diagnosing Hypertension' study and diagnosed hypertension in 73% of their 
parents: 34% for stage I hypertension and 39% for stage II hypertension. Over a 
3-year period of this study, the number of schools participating increased 
20-fold (from 1 to 20), the number of volunteer vascular health professionals 
and schoolteachers increased 13-fold (from 16 to 210), and our ability to 
connect with and impact high school students grew 15-fold (from 800 to over 
12,000).
CONCLUSION: V-Healthy® is the first program to connect over 12,000 students to 
vascular health professionals in their communities to empower them to diagnose 
and understand vascular disease risk factors and their implications on the 
development of vascular disease. Furthermore, the V-Healthy® program has 
displayed substantial growth over a 3-year period in impacting high school 
students and vascular health care professionals, and has the potential to be 
used as a blueprint for community based vascular health education and awareness 
initiatives."
662,"Plasma lipid transport and metabolism is essential to ensure correct cellular 
function throughout the body. Dynamically regulated in time and space, the well 
characterized mechanisms underpinning plasma lipid transport and metabolism 
offer an enticing, but as yet underexplored, rationale to design synthetic lipid 
nanoparticles with inherent cell/tissue selectivity. Herein, we describe a 
systemically administered liposome formulation, composed of just two lipids, 
that is capable of hijacking a triglyceride lipase-mediated lipid transport 
pathway resulting in liposome recognition and uptake within specific endothelial 
cell subsets. In the absence of targeting ligands, liposome-lipase interactions 
are mediated by a unique, phase-separated (""parachute"") liposome morphology. 
Within the embryonic zebrafish, selective liposome accumulation is observed at 
the developing blood-brain-barrier. In mice, extensive liposome accumulation 
within the liver and spleen - which is reduced but not eliminated following 
small molecule lipase inhibition - supports a role for endothelial lipase but 
highlights these liposomes are also subject to significant ""off-target"" by 
reticuloendothelial system organs. Overall, these compositionally simplistic 
liposomes offer new insights into the discovery and design of lipid-based 
nanoparticles that can exploit endogenous lipid transport and metabolism 
pathways to achieve cell selective targeting in vivo. This article is protected

663,"In the present study, we investigated a possible relationship between the immune 
response and the oxidative stress (OS) state trend in a group of 12 chickens 
after intraocular administration of an attenuated Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) 
vaccine. Blood samples were collected at the vaccination time (T0), after 14 
(T1) and 21 d (T2). White blood cell count (WBC), differential leucocyte count, 
and anti-MG antibodies titer (S/P) were studied as immune response indexes. As 
plasmatic OS biomarkers levels, we considered malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric 
oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen metabolites derived 
compounds (d-ROMs), the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and superoxide 
anion (O2-). After antigenic stimulation, it was observed a significant decrease 
in monocythemia and a significant increase in thrombocythemia, S/P, MDA, and 
SOD. Furthermore, subjects with high d-ROMs levels at T0 tended to develop 
higher cellular mobilization with increases in WBC and lymphocytes accompanied 
by lower antibody release. It was also observed that the antioxidant components 
FRAP and SOD were moderately positively correlated to the entity of antibody 
response."
664,"The present study was performed to investigate the effect of oral administration 
of β-glucan (G70), a product obtained from the cell wall of yeast, on Newcastle 
disease virus (NDV)-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers, lymphocyte 
proliferation, and the role of T lymphocyte subpopulations in chickens treated 
with live NDV vaccine. In addition, the influence of β-glucan on splenic gene 
expression was investigated by transcriptome sequencing. The results revealed 
that the supplementation of β-glucan boosted the titer of serum NDV HI increased 
the NDV stimulation index of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and intestinal 
tract, and promoted the differentiation of T lymphocytes into CD4+ T cells. The 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis demonstrated that G70 upregulated the mRNA 
expressions related to G-protein coupled receptor and MHC class I polypeptide, 
and downregulated the mRNA expressions related to cathelicidin and 
beta-defensin. The immunomodulatory effect of G70 might function through 
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. To sum up, G70 could boost 
the immunological efficacy of live NDV vaccine in chickens and could be applied 
as a potential adjuvant candidate in the poultry industry."
665,"BACKGROUND: Non-invasive quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) 
and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) provides incremental benefit to relative 
myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to diagnose and manage heart disease. MBF can 
be measured with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) but the 
uncertainty in the measured values is high. Standardization and optimization of 
protocols for SPECT MBF measurements will improve the consistency of this 
technique. One element of the processing protocol is the choice of kinetic model 
used to analyze the dynamic image series.
PURPOSE: This study evaluates if a net tracer retention model (RET) will provide 
a better fit to the acquired data and greater test-retest precision than a 
one-compartment model (1CM) for SPECT MBF, with (+MC) and without (-MC) manual 
motion correction.
METHODS: Data from previously acquired rest-stress MBF studies (31 SPECT-PET and 
30 SPECT-SPECT) were reprocessed ±MC. Rate constants (K1) were extracted using 
1CM and RET, +/-MC, and compared pairwise with standard PET MBF measurements 
using cross-validation to obtain calibration parameters for converting SPECT 
rate constants to MBF and to assess the goodness-of-fit of the calibration 
curves. Precision (coefficient of variation of test re-test relative 
differences, COV) of flow measurements was computed for 1CM and RET ±MC using 
data from the repeated SPECT MBF studies.
RESULTS: Both the RET model and MC improved the goodness-of-fit of the SPECT MBF 
calibration curves to PET. All models produced minimal bias compared with PET 
(mean bias < 0.6%). The SPECT-SPECT MBF COV significantly improved from 34% 
(1CM+MC) to 28% (RET+MC, p = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: The RET+MC model provides a better calibration of SPECT to PET and 
blood flow measurements with better precision than the 1CM, without loss of 
accuracy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
666,"Many disorders of iron homeostasis (e.g., iron overload) are associated with 
dynamic kinetic profiles of multiple non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) species, 
chronic exposure to which is associated with deleterious end-organ effects. Here 
we discuss the chemical nature of NTBI species, challenges with measuring NTBI 
in plasma and the clinical relevance of NTBI exposure based on source (iron 
overload disorder vs. intravenous iron-carbohydrate complex administration). 
NTBI is not a single entity but consists of multiple, often poorly characterized 
species, some of which are kinetically non-exchangeable while others are 
relatively exchangeable. Prolonged presence of plasma NTBI is associated with 
excessive tissue iron accumulation in susceptible tissues with consequences such 
as endocrinopathy and heart failure. By contrast, intravenous iron-carbohydrate 
nanomedicines administration leads only to transient NTBI appearance and lacks 
evidence for association with adverse clinical outcomes. Assays to measure 
plasma NTBI are typically technically complex and remain chiefly a research 
tool. There have been two general approaches to estimating NTBI: capture assays 
and redox-activity assays. Early assays could not avoid capturing some iron from 
transferrin thus overestimating NTBI. By contrast some later assays may have 
promoted the donation of NTBI species to transferrin during the assay procedure, 
potentially underestimating NTBI levels. The levels of transferrin saturation at 
which NTBI species have been detectable have varied between different 
methodologies and between patient populations studied. This article is protected

667,"Cerebral Amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a disease with several clinical 
manifestations. It is characterized by amyloid beta deposition in cerebral blood 
vessels, making them prone to bleeding. The incidence of CAA increases with age 
and may be associated or co-exist with intraparenchymal neurodegenerative 
proteinopathies, which makes it an increasingly relevant condition for adult 
physicians in all areas of medical practice. The vast majority of cases of CAA 
are sporadic with a small minority of familial cases. CAA is asymptomatic in 
many older adults but increases the risk of fatal intracerebral or subarachnoid 
haemorrhage. We reviewed the existing literature on CAA and summarized the key 
findings. We specifically explore clinical challenges relevant to CAA, 
particularly in diagnosis, management of intracranial haemorrhage and management 
of concurrent medical conditions. This article is protected by copyright. All

668,"OBJECTIVES: Hemodynamics abnormalities and brain development disorders were 
previously reported in fetuses and children with transposition of the great 
arteries (TGA) and intact ventricular septum (TGA&IVS). A ventricular septal 
defect (VSD) is thought to be an additional risk factor for brain development, 
but literature describing this population is sparse. The objectives of this 
report were to (1) assess fetal cardiac hemodynamics throughout pregnancy, (2) 
monitor cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism in neonates, and (3) compare 
these data between TGA&IVS, TGA&VSD and age-matched controls.
METHODS: Cardiac hemodynamics were assessed in TGA&IVS and TGA&VSD fetuses and 
compared with healthy controls matched for gestational age (GA) during three 
periods: ≤ 22.5 (GA1), 27 to 32.5 (GA2), and ≥34.5 (GA3) weeks GA. Left and 
right ventricular outputs (LVO and RVO, respectively), combined ventricular 
output (CVO), ductus arteriosus flow (DAF), diastolic DAF, transpulmonary flow 
(TPF), and foramen ovale (FO) diameter were measured. Aortic (AoF) and main 
pulmonary artery flows (MPAF) were derived in % of CVO. Middle cerebral artery 
and umbilical artery pulsatility index (UA-PI) were measured and a 
cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) was derived. Bedside optical brain monitoring was 
used to measure cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO2 ) and an index of 
microvascular cerebral blood flow (CBFi ) along with peripheral arterial oxygen 
saturation (SpO2 ) in TGA&IVS and TGA&VSD neonates. Using hemoglobin (HGB) 
concentration measurements, these parameters were used to derive cerebral oxygen 
delivery and extraction fraction (OEF) as well as an index of cerebral oxygen 
metabolism (CMRO2i ). These data were acquired in the early preoperative period 
(within 3 days of age and post balloon atrial septostomy) and compared with 
age-matched healthy controls, as well as before discharge when vital signs were 
stable.
RESULTS: Left ventricular output was increased in both TGA groups compared to 
controls throughout pregnancy. Transpulmonary flow was increased while diastolic 
DAF was decreased compared to controls throughout pregnancy in TGA&IVS and 
during GA1 and GA2 in TGA&VSD. Compared to controls, DAF was decreased in 
TGA&IVS throughout pregnancy and in GA2 and GA3 for TGA&VSD. At GA2, AoF was 
higher in TGA&IVS and TGA&VSD compared to controls when MPAF was lower. Compared 
to TGA&VSD at GA3, RVO and CVO were higher in TGA&IVS. In addition, UA-PI was 
lower at GA2 and CPR higher at GA3 in TGA&VSD compared to TGA&IVS. Within 3 days 
of age, SpO2 and SO2 were lower while HGB, cerebral OEF, and CMRO2i higher in 
both TGA groups compared to controls. Preoperative SpO2 was also lower in 
TGA&VSD compared to TGA&IVS. From preoperative to pre-discharge periods, SpO2 
and OEF increased in both TGA groups, but CBFi and CMRO2i increased only in 
TGA&VSD. At pre-discharge, SO2 was higher in TGA&IVS compared to TGA&VSD while 
CBFi lower.
CONCLUSIONS: Fetal cardiac and neonatal cerebral hemodynamic/metabolic 
alterations were observed in both TGA groups compared to controls. Compared to 
TGA&IVS, fetuses with TGA&VSD had lower RVO and CVO in late gestations. A higher 
level of preoperative hypoxemia was observed in TGA&VSD. Post-surgical cerebral 
adaptive mechanisms are likely different between TGA groups. Patients with 
TGA&VSD have a specific physiology that needs to be further studied to improve 
neonatal care and neurodevelopmental outcome. This article is protected by

669,"Opioid dosage for general anaesthesia and sedation relies on surrogate 
parameters such as heartrate and blood pressure. This implies the risk of both 
under- and overdosing. A promising tool to provide target-oriented opioid dosing 
is measuring the nociceptive flexion reflex threshold (NFRT). The aim of this 
study was to investigate the individual trajectories and to determine this 
methods' clinical practicability in the perioperative setting of cardiac 
surgery. NFRT was measured preoperatively (twice as baseline), immediately after 
surgery and later in the general ward (primary outcomes). No intraoperative 
measurements were performed since neuromuscular blockade hinders NFRT 
assessment. Administered analgesics and pain scores were also recorded 
(secondary outcomes). Data were collected from August 2019 to March 2020. 264 
patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were screened for eligibility. 55 
patients were included, 30 rendered datasets for analysis. Thresholds after 
conclusion of surgery [TICU: median (IQR), 31.1 mA (21.5-50.0 mA)] were 
significantly higher than preoperatively [Tpre: 9.2 mA (5.4-13.4 mA); 
P < 0.001]. In 11 patients (36.7%), no immediate postoperative reflex response 
was elicited. Later, all reflexes returned, but thresholds remained 
significantly higher than preoperatively [Tpost: 11.9 mA (9.2-16.6 mA); 
P = 0.043]. NFRT values after surgery were higher compared to baseline 
measurements. Subsequently they decreased but did not reach their baseline 
levels. There was no corresponding dose-dependency, suggesting multimodal 
effects on the nociceptive system. Unless measurements are not prevented by 
technical issues NFRT-assessment appears to be a future tool to target 
analgesics in patients not able to self-report pain. Trial registration Study

670,"Dosing requires consideration of diverse patient-specific factors affecting drug 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The available pharmacometric methods have 
limited capacity for modeling the inter-relationships and patterns of 
variability among physiological determinants of drug dosing (PDODD). To 
investigate whether generative adversarial networks (GANs) can learn a 
generative model from real-world data that recapitulates PDODD distributions. A 
GAN architecture was developed for modeling a PDODD panel comprised of: age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, body weight, body surface area, total body fat, lean body 
weight, albumin concentration, glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), urine flow 
rate, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, alanine aminotransferase to alkaline 
phosphatase R-value, total bilirubin, active hepatitis B infection status, 
active hepatitis C infection status, red blood cell, white blood cell, and 
platelet counts. The panel variables were derived from National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data sets. The dependence of GAN-generated 
PDODD on age, race, and active hepatitis infections was assessed. The continuous 
PDODD biomarkers had diverse non-normal univariate distributions and bivariate 
trend patterns. The univariate distributions of PDODD biomarkers from GAN 
simulations satisfactorily approximated those in test data. The joint 
distribution of the continuous variables was visualized using three 
2-dimensional projection methods; for all three methods, the points from the GAN 
simulation random variate vectors were well dispersed amongst the test data. The 
age dependence trend patterns in GAN data were similar to those in test data. 
The histograms for R-values and EGFR from GAN simulations overlapped extensively 
with test data histograms for the Hispanic, White, African American, and Other 
race/ethnicity groups. The GAN-simulated data also mirrored the R-values and 
EGFR changes in active hepatitis C and hepatitis B infection. GANs are a 
promising approach for simulating the age, race/ethnicity and disease state 
dependencies of PDODD."
671,"In this work, we investigated cases of birth of calves with congenital defects 
in a farm in Southern Brazil. Only calves born from heifers were affected, and 
the disease occurred in both crossbred and purebred calves. Three necropsies 
were performed, tissues were collected for histopathology, and samples of liver 
of calves, blood serum, and food provided for cows and heifers were collected to 
quantify the levels of the minerals: manganese, copper, and zinc. The calves 
were born weak, with disproportionate dwarfism, limb deformities, and enlarged 
joints. Heads were shortened and domed. Long bones had a shortened diaphysis and 
a normal-sized epiphysis, when compared to the control. In one of the cases, 
there were white-yellowish lines on the metaphyseal surface of the epiphyseal 
plate. Histopathology of growth plates revealed premature closure, 
disarrangement of chondrocyte columns, and collapse of primary spongiosa. These 
findings supported a diagnosis of chondrodysplasia. Liver manganese levels were 
under the reference values in the three calves. Food analysis revealed 
insufficient levels of manganese in the diet of heifers, especially in sorghum 
silage, which was provided as the main source of food for the category in some 
periods. Approximately 6 months after the diet was changed, the problem ceased 
and only normal calves continued to be born. Our findings allowed to conclude 
the diagnosis of chondrodysplasia of nutritional origin and reinforce the thesis 
that manganese is the mineral deficient in these cases."
672,"The study aimed to evaluate a quantification method of pulmonary perfusion with 
Dual-Energy CT Angiography (DE-CTA) normalized by lung density in the prediction 
of outcome in acute pulmonary embolism (PE). In this prospective study with CTA 
scans acquired with different breathing protocols, two perfusion parameters were 
calculated: %PBV (relative value of PBV, expressed per unit volume) and PBVm 
(PBV normalized by lung density, expressed per unit mass). DE-CTA parameters 
were correlated with simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) and 
with outcome groups, alone and in combinationwith tomographic right-to-left 
ventricular ratios (RV/LV). PBVm showed significant correlation with sPESI. PBVm 
presented higher accuracy than %PBV In the prediction of ICU admission or death 
in patients with PE, with the best performance when combined with RV/LV 
volumetric ratio."
673,"The conventional approach to investigating functional connectivity in the 
block-designed study usually concatenates task blocks or employs residuals of 
task activation. While providing many insights into brain functions, the block 
design adds more manipulation in functional network analysis that may reduce the 
purity of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal. Recent studies utilized 
one single long run for task trials of the same condition, the so-called 
continuous design, to investigate functional connectivity based on task 
functional magnetic resonance imaging. Continuous brain activities associated 
with the single-task condition can be directly utilized for task-related 
functional connectivity assessment, which has been examined for working memory, 
sensory, motor, and semantic task experiments in previous research. But it 
remains unclear how the block and continuous design influence the assessment of 
task-related functional connectivity networks. This study aimed to disentangle 
the separable effects of block/continuous design and working memory load on 
task-related functional connectivity networks, by using repeated-measures 
analysis of variance. Across 50 young healthy adults, behavioral results of 
accuracy and reaction time showed a significant main effect of design as well as 
interaction between design and load. Imaging results revealed that the 
cingulo-opercular, fronto-parietal, and default model networks were associated 
with not only task activation, but significant main effects of design and load 
as well as their interaction on intra- and inter-network functional connectivity 
and global network topology. Moreover, a significant behavior-brain association 
was identified for the continuous design. This work has extended the evidence 
that continuous design can be used to study task-related functional connectivity 
and subtle brain-behavioral relationships."
674,"PURPOSE: Mental health and sleep quality are associated with genetics and 
nutrient and energy intake. The present study examined the association between 
ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and genetic risk score (GRS) and their 
interactions on mental health and sleep quality in Iranian women.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 278 overweight and obese 
females aged between 18 and 56 years. According to the NOVA classification 
system, 37 food groups and beverages were collected using a 147-item 
semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The blood parameters of 
all participants were assessed. Mini-column kit (type G; Genall; Exgene) and the 
PCR-RFLP method were used to extract DNA and determine gene polymorphism, 
respectively. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including Caveolin_1 
(Cav_1), Melanocortin4 receptor (MC4R), and cryptochrome circadian regulator 1 
(CRY1), were used to calculate GRS. The individual risk allele (0, 1, 2) for 
each SNP was calculated using the incremental genetic model.
RESULTS: After controlling for confounders, a significant interaction was found 
for depression (β = 0.026, 95% CI 0.003, 0.049, P = 0.028) and depression 
anxiety stress scales (DASS) score (β = 0.059, 95% CI 0.001, 0.117, P = 0.046) 
on the NOVA classification system and GRS.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study showed a significant interaction between 
GRS and the NOVA classification system on mental disorders, including 
depression, DASS score and stress. There was also a significant relationship 
between the NOVA classification system and anxiety, DASS score, sleep quality 
and depression. Furthermore, a partially significant association was observed 
between GRS and stress.

675,"PURPOSE: Literature dedicated to growth patterns and growth rate influencing 
factors of radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs) is limited. To deliver new 
insights into the topic, a volumetric growth analysis of RIMs was performed.
METHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study included patients 
diagnosed with intracranial meningioma who received radiation treatment at 
least > 5 years before the RIM diagnosis. Volumetric analysis of individual RIMs 
was performed using 3D volumetry at the time of RIM diagnosis and during 
follow-up. RIM growth was determined by calculating absolute (AGR), and relative 
(RGR) growth rates. Prognostic factors associated with RIM growth were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 26 patients with 33 meningiomas were enrolled in the study 
and radiologically/clinically followed up during a median duration of 5.6 years 
(IQR 3.9-8.8 years). Median AGR was 0.19 cm3 per year and the median RGR was 
34.5% per year. Surgically managed RIMs were more likely fast-growing compared 
to observed ones based on the AGR (p < 0.002). The recurrence rate after total 
resection was 14.3%. Younger age at RIM diagnosis was associated with higher 
tumor growth (RGR ≥ 30%, p = 0.040). A significant correlation was found between 
the length of latency period and the RGR (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: To diagnose RIM as early as possible comprehensive MRI surveillance 
is required. Younger patients with shorter latency periods may profit from 
shortened MRI intervals, with further management being dependent on the growth 
rate and eventual symptomatology."
676,"OBJECTIVES: To summarize the pharmacokinetics of linezolid to optimize the 
dosing regimen in special populations.
METHODS: A literature search was performed in three largest medical databases, 
including Embase, Scopus, and PubMed. The main applied keywords were linezolid 
and pharmacokinetics. Of 3663 retrieved publications in the English language, 35 
original research articles, clinical studies, and case reports about linezolid 
pharmacokinetics in different populations such as pregnant women, pediatrics, 
elderly subjects, obese people, individuals with organ dysfunction, and 
critically ill patients were included. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Dose adjustment 
is not currently recommended for linezolid in patients with mild to moderate 
renal or hepatic impairment, older adults, and pregnant women. Although dose 
adjustment is not recommended in patients with severe renal or hepatic 
impairment, it should be considered that these patients are more vulnerable to 
linezolid adverse effects and drug interactions. In pediatrics, reducing the 
linezolid dosing interval to 8 h is suggested. Despite the lack of sufficient 
information in obese individuals, dosing based on body weight or use of higher 
dose seems to be justifiable to prevent sub-therapeutic concentrations. Although 
dose adjustment of linezolid is not recommended in critically ill patients, 
administration of linezolid as continuous intravenous infusion is suggested in 
this population. Blood level monitoring should be considered in populations that 
are vulnerable to linezolid underexposure (such as critically ill patients with 
augmented renal clearance, pediatrics, overweight, and obese patients) or 
overexposure (such as elderly, patients with hepatic and renal impairment). To 
assess the efficacy and safety of linezolid, the area under the 
concentration-time curve over 24 h to minimum inhibitory concentration 
(AUC0-24 h/MIC) equal to 80-120, percentage of time above the MIC ≥ 85%, and 
serum trough concentration between 2 and 7 mg/L are suggested."
677,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the performance of 
respiratory-gating imaging with reduced acquisition time using the total-body 
positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanner.
METHODS: Imaging data of 71 patients with suspect malignancies who underwent 
total-body 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT for 15 min with respiration 
recorded were analyzed. For each examination, four reconstructions were 
performed: Ungated-15, using all coincidences; Ungated-5, using data of the 
first 5 min; Gated-15 using all coincidences but with respiratory gating; and 
Gated-6 using data of the first 6 min with respiratory gating. Lesions were 
quantified and image quality was evaluated; both were compared between the four 
image sets.
RESULTS: A total of 390 lesions were found in the thorax and upper abdomen. 
Lesion detectability was significantly higher in gated-15 (97.2%) than in 
ungated-15 (93.6%, p = 0.001) and ungated-5 (92.3%, p = 0.001), but comparable 
to Gated-6 (95.9%, p = 0.993). A total of 131 lesions were selected for 
quantitative analyses. Lesions in Gated-15 presented significantly larger 
standardized uptake values, tumor-to-liver ratio, and tumor-to-blood ratio, but 
smaller metabolic tumor volume, compared to those in Ungated-15 and Ungated-5 
(all p < 0.001). These differences were more obvious in small lesions and in 
lesions from sites other than mediastinum/retroperitoneum. However, these 
indices were not significantly different between Gated-15 and Gated-6. Higher, 
but acceptable, image noise was identified in gated images than in ungated 
images.
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory-gating imaging with reduced scanning time using the 
total-body PET/CT scanner is superior to ungated imaging and can be used in the 
clinic.
KEY POINTS: • In PET imaging, respiratory gating can improve lesion presentation 
and detectability but requires longer imaging time. • This single-center study 
showed that the total-body PET scanner allows respiratory-gated imaging with 
reduced and clinically acceptable scanning time."
678,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of macular edema in uveitis is a key goal of treatment, 
because this complication remains a potential therapeutic problem for 
specialists.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Examination was carried out in 1-2 groups - 50 persons 
with uncomplicated recurrent anterior uveitis (AU) in the stage of relapse or 
remission - and 3-4 groups - 26 persons with recurrent AU complicated by uveitic 
macular edema (UME) in the stage of relapse or remission of AU. Control group - 
27 healthy volunteers. All patients underwent an ophthalmologic examination, 
using OCT (Spectralis HRA + OCT (Heidelberg Engineering)). The state of cellular 
and humoral immunity and the expression of activation markers on blood 
lymphocytes in all patients were assessed. An immunohistocytochemical analysis 
using monoclonal antibodies (the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method) was employed 
to assess the expression of lymphocyte activation markers. The monoclonal 
antibody panel (MCAP) for immunophenotyping included antibodies reacting with 
CD5, CD54 (ICAM-1), CD25, and CD95 (FAS) antigens. Immunophenotyping was 
performed using immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: In the patients with AU + UME, the parameters of the T-cell link of the 
immune response were increased and the parameters of humoral immunity (CD19, 
IgA, IgG) were decreased in comparison with the uncomplicated AU patients. The 
absolute and relative numbers of natural killer cells in the peripheral blood 
were higher, and the relative numbers of phagocytic neutrophils were lower in 
the group of anterior uveitis with UME than in uncomplicated AU. The absolute 
and relative expression levels of ICAM-1 (CD54) and the absolute expression 
level of CD5 on peripheral blood lymphocytes were increased in relapse at 
patients with AU + UME compared with uncomplicated AU. The expression levels of 
CD25 and CD95 were not different in these groups.
CONCLUSION: Activation of cellular immunity markers ICAM-1 and CD5 seems to play 
a role in uveitic macular edema. The expression levels of CD25 and CD95 were not 
significantly different in these groups."
679,"The distribution volume of uric acid is affected by the amount of extracellular 
water (ECW), while urea distribution volume can be considered as total body 
water (TBW). Thus, the ratio of distribution volumes of uric acid and urea can 
be paralleled to and be considered as the proxy of ECW/TBW. A total of 108 
patients at our facility was included. The uric acid and urea distribution 
volume ratio (UUVdR) calculated from the single-pool model, which was measured 
within 1 month of the time when the bioimpedance index was measured. ECW/TBW at 
the end of the HD session was measured by InBody S10. We investigated the 
association between the UUVdR and the ECW/TBW values and the factors affecting 
the residuals of the regression equation. We also evaluated the predictive 
ability of overhydration or dehydration in randomly selected two groups, i.e., 
the training group and the validation group. ECW/TBW correlated highly with 
UUVdR. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only creatinine and ECW/TBW were 
significantly associated with regression residuals. The cutoff values of UUVdR 
for overhydration and dehydration were 0.666 and 0.579, respectively, in the 
training group. Their AUC were 0.872 and 0.898, respectively. The sensitivity 
and specificity values in the validation group were 0.571 and 0.868 for 
overhydration, and 0.444 and 0.953 for dehydration, respectively. UUVdR might be 
a proxy of hydration status in hemodialysis patients. It may be possible to 
predict hydration status without dedicated devices in the epidemiological study."
680,"PURPOSE: A significant portion of patients with locally advanced head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) relapse despite multimodality treatment denoting 
the need for biomarkers. The pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) is a recently 
developed blood count-based prognostic biomarker. We evaluated the relationship 
between PIV and survival in locally advanced HNSCC patients treated with 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT).
METHODS: A total of 199 patients who underwent CRT at Hacettepe University 
Oncology Hospital were included. The relationship between clinical and 
laboratory parameters with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) 
was analyzed by multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The median age was 59 years and 90.5% of the patients were male. 66.8% 
of the patients had laryngeal primaries, and 78.9% had T3-T4 disease. 84.9% of 
the patients received CRT with cisplatin. The optimal PIV threshold value was 
calculated as 404 in ROC analyses. This PIV value had 75.8% sensitivity and 
70.4% specificity for OS prediction (AUC 0.781; 95% CI 0.715-0.846; p < 0.001). 
In multivariate analyses, high PIV levels (≤ 404 vs. > 404, HR 2.862; 95% CI 
1.553-5.276; p = 0.001), higher NLR (≤ 2.5 vs. > 2.5, HR 1.827; 95% CI 
1.017-3.281; p = 0.044) levels and ECOG performance score of 2 (HR 2.267; 95% CI 
1.385-3.711; p = 0.001) were associated with shorter OS. These factors were 
associated with shorter DFS also (HR for PIV 2.485, 95% CI 1.383-4.467, 
p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed shorter OS and DFS in locally advanced HNSCC patients 
with high PIV levels. If prospective studies support our findings, the PIV score 
could be a prognostic biomarker in HNSCC."
681,"We aimed to evaluate cutoff values of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)/IRT and 
determine relationship between IRT values and clinical characteristics of 
children with cystic fibrosis (CF). This study is cross-sectional study. Data of 
children with positive newborn screening (NBS) between 2015 and 2021 were 
evaluated in three pediatric pulmonology centers. Age at admission, sex, 
gestational age, presence of history of meconium ileus, parental consanguinity, 
sibling with CF, and doll-like face appearance, first and second IRT values, 
sweat chloride test, fecal elastase, fecal fat, biochemistry results, and age at 
CF diagnosis were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of IRT cutoff values 
were evaluated. Of 815 children with positive NBS, 58 (7.1%) children were 
diagnosed with CF. Median values of first and second IRT were 157.2 
(103.7-247.6) and 113.0 (84.0-201.5) μg/L. IRT values used in current protocol, 
sensitivity was determined as 96.6%, specificity as 17.2% for first IRT, and 
96.6% sensitivity, 20.5% specificity for second IRT. Positive predictive value 
(PPV) was determined as 7.1%. When cutoff value for first IRT was estimated as 
116.7 μg/L, sensitivity was 69.0% and specificity was 69.6%, and when cutoff 
value was set to 88.7 μg/L for second IRT, sensitivity was 69.0% and specificity 
was 69.0%. Area under curve was 0.757 for first and 0.763 for second IRT 
(p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). PPV was calculated as 4.3%.    Conclusion: 
Although sensitivity of CF NBS is high in our country, its PPV is significantly 
lower than expected from CF NBS programs. False-positive NBS results could have 
been overcome by revising NBS strategy. What is Known: • Although immunoreactive 
trypsinogen elevation is a sensitive test used in cystic fibrosis newborn 
screening, its specificity is low. • In countries although different algorithms 
are used, all strategies begin with the measurement of immunoreactive 
trypsinogen in dried blood spots. What is New: • In our study, it was shown that 
use of the IRT/IRT protocol for cystic fibrosis newborn screening is not 
sufficient for the cut-off values determined by the high number of patients. • 
Newborn screening strategy should be reviewed to reduce false positive newborn 
screening results."
682,"Ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase hinge protein (UQCRH) is required for the 
electron transfer between cytochrome c1 and c of the mitochondrial cytochrome 
bc1 Complex (CIII). A two-exon deletion in the human UQCRH gene has recently 
been identified as the cause for a rare familial mitochondrial disorder. 
Deletion of the corresponding gene in the mouse (Uqcrh-KO) resulted in striking 
biochemical and clinical similarities including impairment of CIII, failure to 
thrive, elevated blood glucose levels, and early death. Here, we set out to test 
how global ablation of the murine Uqcrh affects cardiac morphology and 
contractility, and bioenergetics. Hearts from Uqcrh-KO mutant mice appeared 
macroscopically considerably smaller compared to wildtype littermate controls 
despite similar geometries as confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). 
Relating TTE-assessed heart to body mass revealed the development of subtle 
cardiac enlargement, but histopathological analysis showed no excess collagen 
deposition. Nonetheless, Uqcrh-KO hearts developed pronounced contractile 
dysfunction. To assess mitochondrial functions, we used the high-resolution 
respirometer NextGen-O2k allowing measurement of mitochondrial respiratory 
capacity through the electron transfer system (ETS) simultaneously with the 
redox state of ETS-reactive coenzyme Q (Q), or production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). Compared to wildtype littermate controls, we found decreased 
mitochondrial respiratory capacity and more reduced Q in Uqcrh-KO, indicative 
for an impaired ETS. Yet, mitochondrial ROS production was not generally 
increased. Taken together, our data suggest that Uqcrh-KO leads to cardiac 
contractile dysfunction at 9 weeks of age, which is associated with impaired 
bioenergetics but not with mitochondrial ROS production. Global ablation of the 
Uqcrh gene results in functional impairment of CIII associated with metabolic 
dysfunction and postnatal developmental arrest immediately after weaning from 
the mother. Uqcrh-KO mice show dramatically elevated blood glucose levels and 
decreased ability of isolated cardiac mitochondria to consume oxygen (O2). 
Impaired development (failure to thrive) after weaning manifests as a deficiency 
in the gain of body mass and growth of internal organ including the heart. The 
relative heart mass seemingly increases when organ mass calculated from 
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is normalized to body mass. Notably, the 
heart shows no signs of collagen deposition, yet does develop a contractile 
dysfunction reflected by a decrease in ejection fraction and fractional 
shortening."
683,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Lenalidomide is considered a standard of care in 
multiple myeloma (MM) Some MM patients will develop delayed hypersensitivity to 
lenalidomide, which can lead to treatment discontinuation. Desensitization to 
lenalidomide can help these patients to complete treatment courses. Here, we 
aimed to review lenalidomide-treated MM patients who developed delayed 
hypersensitivity-induced rash and were treated with desensitization.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical files of MM patients, who were 
desensitized to lenalidomide due to delayed hypersensitivity rash. Patients were 
treated between 2018 and 2022 at Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.
RESULTS: Search of patients yielded 16 patients that underwent desensitization 
to lenalidomide within the study period. Desensitization protocol consisted of a 
slow, 3-week long protocol with lenalidomide's target doses of 10, 15 and 25 
mg/day. Of the 16 patients , 10 (62.5%) succeeded to complete the protocol , 
thus were able to complete lenalidomide treatment cycles. . One patient with 
unsuccessful desensitization was subsequently treated with the first generation 
IMiD thalidomide, with no rash appearing. None of the patients that were treated 
with desensitization had severe immune-mediated or non-dermatological adverse 
reactions.
CONCLUSIONS: Desensitization to lenalidomide is safe and effective. 
Discontinuation of lenalidomide in MM patients with delayed hypersensitivity and 
no contraindication to desensitization should be discouraged. Collaboration 
between hematologists and allergists is needed. This article is protected by

684,"PURPOSE/AIM: Rett (RTT) syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, results from 
loss-of-function mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. We studied 
activity-dependent plasticity induced by sensory deprivation via whisker 
trimming in early symptomatic male mutant mice to assess neural rewiring 
capability.
METHODS: One whisker was trimmed for 0-14 days and intrinsic optical imaging of 
the transient reduction of brain blood oxygenation resulting from neural 
activation by 1 second of wiggling of the whisker stump was compared to that of 
an untrimmed control whisker.
RESULTS: Cortical evoked responses to wiggling a non-trimmed whisker were 
constant for 14 days, reduced for a trimmed whisker by 49.0 ± 4.3% in wild type 
(n = 14) but by only 22.7 ± 4.6% in mutant (n = 18, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: As the reduction in neural activation following sensory deprivation 
in whisker barrel cortex is known to be dependent upon evoked and basal neural 
activity, impairment of cortical re-wiring following whisker trimming provides a 
paradigm suitable to explore mechanisms underlying deficiencies in the 
establishment and maintenance of synapses in RTT, which can be potentially 
targeted by therapeutics."
685,"OBJECTIVES: Iron overload in patients with thalassemia represents a serious 
complication by affecting numerous organ systems. This meta-analysis aims to 
establish an evidence regarding the effect of amlodipine on cardiac iron 
overload in thalassemia patients.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and 
EMBASE for all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary 
outcomes were cardiac T2* and myocardial iron concentration (MIC). Secondary 
outcomes were liver iron concentration (LIC), risk of G.I. upset and risk of 
lower limb edema. We used Hedges' g to pool continuous outcomes, while odds 
ratio was used for dichotomous outcomes.
RESULTS: Seven RCTs were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis, 
comprising of 233 patients included in the analysis. Amlodipine had a 
statistically significant lower MIC (Hedges' g = -0.82, 95% CI [-1.40, -0.24], p 
< 0.001) and higher cardiac T2* (Hedges' g = 0.36, 95% CI [0.10, 0.62], 
p = 0.03). Amlodipine was comparable to standard chelation therapy in terms of 
the risk of lower limb edema and GI upset.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis found that amlodipine significantly increases 
cardiac T2* and decreases MIC, hence decreasing the incidence of 
cardiomyopathy-related iron overload in thalassemia patients. This article is

687,"BACKGROUND: National advisory panels (NAPs) have been established for the care 
of children and young people (CYP) with cancer in the United Kingdom since 2011, 
with an increase in panel number in recent years. Their practice has not 
previously been reviewed; therefore, we sought to evaluate the role, practice 
and impact of six selected NAPs offering expertise in ependymoma, histiocytosis, 
leukaemia, neuroblastoma, renal tumours and sarcoma.
PROCEDURE: This service evaluation used mixed methodology, including review of 
NAP documentation, semi-structured interviews with the NAP chairs and an 
analysis of the cases referred for discussion.
RESULTS: Total 1110 referrals were analysed. Results demonstrated the 
significant scope and amount of work undertaken by the NAPs, largely testament 
to the commitment of the panel members. Specific roles fulfilled have been 
highlighted, and NAP recommendations have been shown to influence clinical 
decision-making and be implemented in the majority of cases. Despite widespread 
good practice, areas to address have been identified; these include clarity 
regarding NAP membership, consistency in recommendations, the consideration of 
holistic information to promote personalised management and the exploration of 
wider multidisciplinary team roles.
CONCLUSIONS: In the context of increasing demand and the escalating number of 
NAPs, it is timely to consider how service improvement can be facilitated. Best 
practice guidelines have been formulated as a product of this study, to promote 
a sustainable and effective model for NAPs. Review and benchmarking national 
panel performance against these guidelines will drive high standards of care 
going forward and they should be embedded as standard practice."
688,"Hematological toxicity (hematotoxicity) leading to peripheral cytopenias is a 
common long-term adverse effect following the use of CD19-chimeric antigen 
receptor (CD19-CAR) T-cell therapies. However, management remains unclear for 
patients whose cytopenias persist beyond 1 month after CAR T-cell infusion. We 
present the case of a 21-year old who received CD19-CAR T-cell therapy for 
relapse following a haploidentical transplant. He developed hematotoxicity and 
consequently multiple life-threatening infections. We administered a CD34+ 
hematopoietic stem cell boost (HSCB) from his transplant donor, which led to 
hematopoietic recovery and resolution of his infections without any effect on 
the activity of CD19-CAR T cells. CD34+ HSCB can be a safe and effective option 
to treat hematotoxicity following CD19-CAR T-cell therapy."
689,"Oral fibroepithelial polyps (FEPs) are common, benign, nonneoplastic lesions in 
humans that often develop slowly in sites of local irritation or trauma. This 
study analyzed 23 oral fibroepithelial polypoid lesions retrieved from 21 dogs 
(2014-2021). All lesions were pedunculated with usually an 
irregular/cauliflower-like or rarely smooth surface. FEPs most commonly arose 
under or lateral to the tongue; other sites included the labial and gingival 
mucosa, soft palate, and hard palate. All the lesions were characterized by a 
thick fibrovascular stalk consisting of bundles of fibrocytes and fibroblasts 
embedded in a collagenous matrix rich in blood vessels. The surface squamous 
epithelium, when evaluable, was hyperplastic (22/22; 100%) with frequent 
parakeratotic hyperkeratosis (12/22; 54.5%). Ulceration of variable extent was 
observed in 13/23 cases (56.5%). Inflammation was associated with 18/23 cases 
(78.3%), and was mostly lymphoplasmacytic. The connective tissue was 
consistently immunoreactive for vimentin and generally negative for smooth 
muscle actin and desmin. All FEPs in cases with available clinical outcome data 
did not recur after surgical excision. The presence of chronic inflammation and 
ulceration suggests a causative role of chronic irritation in the pathogenesis 
of canine oral FEPs. FEPs should be included among the differential diagnoses of 
proliferative lesions of the oral cavity in dogs."
690,"The NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull (NSG) mouse is a relevant model for toxicology and 
tumorigenicity studies evaluating human cell therapies. Data was compiled from 
toxicology study control NSG mice exposed to gamma irradiation (0 or 200 cGy) or 
busulfan. Retrospective data evaluation included mortality, clinical 
observations, body weights, hematology, and external and internal macroscopic 
observations. There was no mortality in any of the 129 toxicology control 
(irradiated and non-irradiated) mice up to the 20-week observation period. 
Mortalities occurred between Days 1 and 25 among animals given busulfan 
≥25 mg/kg/day at 1 or 2 doses via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. There were 
4/10, 6/10 and 4/10 deaths at 25, 30 and 35 mg/kg/day busulfan, respectively. 
Busulfan-treated mice presented with dose-dependent clinical signs including 
signs of anemia in some individuals. Hematology, including white blood cell 
(WBC) and neutrophil (NEUT) counts, from irradiated mice at Weeks 12 and 20 
revealed comparable values to non-irradiated animals. In contrast, irradiated 
mice treated with a positive control (HL-60) were euthanized prior to Week 12. 
There were no irradiation-related differences in macroscopic observations with 
lymphoid atrophy identified comparably in irradiated and non-irradiated groups. 
These results suggest that irradiation was suitable for conditioning to enable 
cell engraftment in NSG mice in the context of regulatory toxicology and 
tumorigenicity studies. Busulfan administered at 20 mg/kg/day for 2 days, i.p. 
was also well-tolerated, and it could be considered for toxicology studies of 
genetically modified human cells."
691,"This article compares the relative preferences from stated preference (SP) 
questions requiring ordered categorical versus discrete choice responses. The 
approaches were contrasted for blood donation service characteristics that offer 
opportunities to donate blood.The estimates of relative preferences for 
alternative blood donation service characteristics were similar between the 2 
forms of SP approach.This study illustrates how SP survey questions can be 
formulated to provide responses on an ordered categorical scale and to estimate 
marginal rates of substitution between different attributes, which can be 
compared with those derived from discrete choice experiment (DCE) choices.The 
article highlights the potential value of considering alternative choice 
framings rather than relying solely on DCEs."
692,"Oxidative stress appears to possess a central role in CIN pathophysiology. 
Resveratrol (Res) and lycopene (Lyc) are strong natural antioxidants evaluated 
in a limited number of CIN animal studies in vivo. The aim of the study was to 
evaluate the potential renoprotective effects of Res/Lyc in a CIN rabbit model. 
Twenty-four adult male New Zealand white rabbits were equally assigned into four 
groups: control (saline), CIN (intravenous iopromide; 7.5 g iodine/kg), Res + 
CIN (per os Res; 5 mg/kg), and Lyc + CIN (per os Lyc; 4 mg/kg). Serum Cr (sCr); 
symmetric/asymmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA/ADMA); oxidative stress biomarkers: 
malondialdehyde; total antioxidant capacity; catalase; glutathione) were 
evaluated in blood samples at three time points: right after (0 h); 24 h; 48 h 
after iopromide/saline administration. CD20+/CD3+ lymphocytes were determined 
(48 h). All animals were sacrificed at 48 h and both kidneys collected. 
Oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in renal tissue. sCr and SDMA/ADMA 
levels increased significantly in CIN compared to all groups. Oxidative stress 
secondary to CIN in blood/kidneys was suppressed by Res/Lyc. B and T lymphocytes 
decreased significantly in CIN compared to all groups. The present study 
provides emerging evidence that Res/Lyc ameliorate CIN by modulating 
oxidant/antioxidant balance in blood/renal tissue and by inhibiting 
vasoconstriction/blood cytotoxicity."
693,"Background Knowledge of real-world antihypertensive use is limited to prevalent 
hypertension, limiting our understanding of how treatment evolves and its 
contribution to persistently poor blood pressure control. We sought to 
characterize antihypertensive initiation among new users. Methods and Results 
Using Medicaid and Medicare data from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research 
Consortium, we identified new users of ≥1 first-line antihypertensives 
(angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin 
receptor blocker, thiazide diuretic, or β-blocker) between 2013 and 2021 among 
adults with diagnosed hypertension, and no antihypertensive fill during the 
prior 12 months. We evaluated initial antihypertensive regimens by class and 
drug overall and across study years and examined variation in antihypertensive 
initiation across demographics (sex, race, and ethnicity) and comorbidity 
(chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). 
We identified 143 054 patients initiating 188 995 antihypertensives (75% 
monotherapy; 25% combination therapy), with mean age 59 years and 57% of whom 
were women. The most commonly initiated antihypertensive class overall was 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (39%) followed by β-blockers (31%), 
calcium channel blockers (24%), thiazides (19%), and angiotensin receptor 
blockers (11%). With the exception of β-blockers, a single drug accounted for 
≥75% of use of each class. β-blocker use decreased (35%-26%), and calcium 
channel blocker use increased (24%-28%) over the study period, while initiation 
of most other classes remained relatively stable. We also observed significant 
differences in antihypertensive selection across demographic and comorbidity 
strata. Conclusions These findings indicate that substantial variation exists in 
initial antihypertensive prescribing, and there remain significant gaps between 
current guideline recommendations and real-world implementation in early 
hypertension care."
694,"Background Guidelines recommend that coronary slow flow phenomenon (CSFP), 
defined as corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count (CTFC) 
 > 27, can diagnose coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) in patients with 
angina and nonobstructed coronary arteries. CSFP has also historically been 
regarded as a sign of coronary endothelial dysfunction (CED). We sought to 
validate the utility of CTFC, as a binary classifier of CSFP and as a continuous 
variable, to diagnose CMD and CED. Methods and Results Patients with angina and 
nonobstructed coronary arteries had simultaneous coronary pressure and flow 
velocity measured using a dual sensor-tipped guidewire during rest, 
adenosine-mediated hyperemia, and intracoronary acetylcholine infusion. CMD was 
defined as the inability to augment coronary blood flow in response to adenosine 
(coronary flow reserve <2.5) and CED in response to acetylcholine (acetylcholine 
flow reserve ≤1.5); 152 patients underwent assessment using adenosine, of whom 
82 underwent further acetylcholine testing. Forty-six patients (30%) had CSFP, 
associated with lower flow velocity and higher microvascular resistance as 
compared with controls (16.5±6.9 versus 20.2±6.9 cm/s; P=0.001 and 6.26±1.83 
versus 5.36±1.83 mm Hg/cm/s; P=0.009, respectively). However, as a diagnostic 
test, CSFP had poor sensitivity and specificity for both CMD (26.7% and 65.2%) 
and CED (21.1% and 56.0%). Furthermore, on receiver operating characteristics 
analyses, CTFC could not predict CMD or CED (area under the curve, 0.41 [95% CI, 
0.32%-0.50%] and 0.36 [95% CI, 0.23%-0.49%], respectively). Conclusions In 
patients with angina and nonobstructed coronary arteries, CSFP and CTFC are not 
diagnostic of CMD or CED. Guidelines supporting the use of CTFC in the diagnosis 
of CMD should be revisited."
695,"Background Peripheral artery disease is endemic in our globally aging 
population, with >200 million affected worldwide. Graft/stent thrombosis after 
revascularization is common and frequently results in amputation, major adverse 
cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Optimizing medications to 
decrease thrombosis is of paramount importance; however, limited guidance exists 
on how to use and monitor antithrombotic therapy in this heterogeneous 
population. Thromboelastography with platelet mapping (TEG-PM) provides 
comprehensive coagulation metrics and may be integral to the next stage of 
patient-centered thrombophrophylaxis. This prospective study aimed to determine 
if TEG-PM could predict subacute graft/stent thrombosis following lower 
extremity revascularization, and if objective cut point values could be 
established to identify those high-risk patients. Methods and Results We 
conducted a single-center prospective observational study of patients undergoing 
lower extremity revascularization. Patients were followed up for the composite 
end point postoperative graft/stent thrombosis at 1 year. TEG-PM analysis of the 
time point before thrombosis in the event group was compared with the last 
postoperative visit in the nonevent group. Cox proportional hazards analysis 
examined the association of TEG-PM metrics to thrombosis. Cut point analysis 
explored the predictive capacity of TEG-PM metrics for those at high risk. A 
total of 162 patients were analyzed, of whom 30 (18.5%) experienced graft/stent 
thrombosis. Patients with thrombosis had significantly greater platelet 
aggregation (79.7±15.7 versus 58.5±26.4) and lower platelet inhibition 
(20.7±15.6% versus 41.1±26.6%) (all P<0.01). Cox proportional hazards analysis 
revealed that for every 1% increase in platelet aggregation, the hazard of 
experiencing an event during the study period increased by 5% (hazard ratio, 
1.05 [95% CI, 1.02-1.07]; P<0.01). An optimal cut point of >70.8% platelet 
aggregation and/or <29.2% platelet inhibition identifies those at high risk of 
thrombosis with 87% sensitivity and 70% to 71% specificity. Conclusions Among 
patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization, increased platelet 
reactivity was predictive of subacute postoperative graft/stent thrombosis. On 
the basis of the cut points of >70.8% platelet aggregation and <29.2% platelet 
inhibition, consideration of an alternative or augmented antithrombotic regimen 
for high-risk patients may decrease the risk of postoperative thrombotic events."
696,"BACKGROUND More than half of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occur in 
the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease and are often attributed to 
the rupture of high-risk coronary atherosclerotic plaque (HRP). Blood-based 
biomarkers that associate with imaging-defined HRP and predict MACE are lacking. 
METHODS AND RESULTS Nuclear magnetic resonance-based lipoprotein particle 
profiling was performed in the biomarker substudy of the PROMISE (Prospective 
Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial (N=4019) in 
participants who had stable symptoms suspicious for coronary artery disease. 
Principal components analysis was used to reduce the number of correlated 
lipoproteins into uncorrelated lipoprotein factors. The association of 
lipoprotein factors and individual lipoproteins of significantly associated 
factors with core laboratory determined coronary computed tomographic 
angiography features of HRP was determined using logistic regression models. The 
association of HRP-associated lipoproteins with MACE was assessed in the PROMISE 
trial and validated in an independent coronary angiography biorepository 
(CATHGEN [Catheterization Genetics]) using Cox proportional hazards models. 
Lipoprotein factors composed of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses were 
associated with HRP. In these factors, large HDL (odds ratio [OR], 0.70 [95% CI, 
0.56-0.85]; P<0.001) and medium HDL (OR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.72-0.98]; P=0.028) and 
HDL size (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69-0.96]; P=0.018) were associated with HRP in 
multivariable models. Medium HDL was associated with MACE in PROMISE (hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.63-0.92]; P=0.004), which was validated in the 
CATHGEN biorepository (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.94]; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Large 
and medium HDL subclasses and HDL size inversely associate with HRP features, 
and medium HDL subclasses inversely associate with MACE in PROMISE trial 
participants. These findings may aid in the risk stratification of individuals 
with chest pain and provide insight into the pathobiology of HRP. REGISTRATION

697,"BACKGROUND Little attention has been paid to how well the American Heart 
Association's cardiovascular health (CVH) score predicts early-onset diabetes in 
young adults. We investigated the association of CVH score with early- and 
later-onset diabetes and with subsequent complications of diabetes. METHODS AND 
RESULTS Our sample included 4547 Black and White adults in the CARDIA (Coronary 
Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study without diabetes at baseline 
(1985-1986; aged 18-30 years) with complete data on the CVH score at baseline, 
including smoking, body mass index, physical activity, diet quality, total 
cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose. Incident diabetes was 
determined based on fasting glucose, 2-hour postload glucose, hemoglobin A1c, or 
self-reported medication use throughout 8 visits for 30 years. Multinomial 
logistic regression was used to assess the association between CVH score and 
diabetes onset at age <40 years (early onset) versus age ≥40 years (later 
onset). Secondary analyses assessed the association between CVH score and risk 
of complications (coronary artery calcium, clinical cardiovascular disease, 
kidney function markers, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy) among a 
subsample with diabetes. We identified 116 early- and 502 later-onset incident 
diabetes cases. Each 1-point higher CVH score was associated with lower odds of 
developing early-onset (odds ratio [OR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.58-0.71]) and 
later-onset diabetes (OR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.74-0.83]). Lower estimates of diabetic 
complications were observed per 1-point higher CVH score: 19% for coronary 
artery calcification≥100, 18% for cardiovascular disease, and 14% for diabetic 
neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS Higher CVH score in young adulthood was associated with 
lower early- and later-onset diabetes as well as diabetic complications."
698,"Background Hypertension and diabetes frequently coexist. However, little is 
known about the interaction between high blood pressure (BP) and hyperglycemia 
in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods and Results We 
conducted an observational cohort study that included 3 336 363 patients (median 
age, 43 years old; men, 57.2%). People taking BP- or glucose-lowering 
medications or those with prior history of CVD were excluded. We defined stage 1 
hypertension as having systolic BP of 130 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic BP of 80 to 
89 mm Hg and stage 2 hypertension as having systolic BP of ≥140 mm Hg or 
diastolic BP of ≥90 mm Hg. We defined prediabetes as having fasting plasma 
glucose of 100 to 125 mg/dL and diabetes as having fasting plasma glucose of 
≥126 mg/dL. Over a mean follow-up period of 1185 ± 942 days, 5665 myocardial 
infarction, 52 475 angina pectoris, 25 436 stroke, 54 508 heart failure, and 
12 932 atrial fibrillation events occurred. The BP and fasting plasma glucose 
categories additively increased the risk of myocardial infarction, angina 
pectoris, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. However, the relative 
risk of stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension developing into CVD was attenuated with 
deteriorating glycemic status. Similarly, the relative risk of prediabetes and 
diabetes developing into CVD was attenuated with increasing BP. For example, the 
relative risk reduction of stage 2 hypertension for heart failure was 53.5% in 
individuals with normal fasting plasma glucose, 46.4% in those with prediabetes, 
and 37.2% in those with diabetes. The robustness of our findings was confirmed 
using a multitude of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Although hypertension and 
hyperglycemia additively increase the risk of developing CVD, the relative 
contribution of hypertension to the development of CVD decreased with 
deteriorating glycemic status and that of hyperglycemia was attenuated with 
increasing BP. Our results indicate a potential interaction between hypertension 
and hyperglycemia in the development of CVD."
699,"Background Salt restriction may lower blood pressure variability (BPV), but 
previous studies have shown inconsistent results. Therefore, we investigated in 
an observational study and intervention trial whether urinary sodium excretion 
and salt intake are associated with 24-hour BPV. Methods and Results We used 
data from the cross-sectional population-based Maastricht Study (n=2652; 
60±8 years; 52% men) and from a randomized crossover trial (n=40; 49±11 years; 
33% men). In the observational study, we measured 24-hour urinary sodium 
excretion and 24-hour BPV and performed linear regression adjusted for age, sex, 
mean blood pressure, lifestyle, and cardiovascular risk factors. In the 
intervention study, participants adhered to a 7-day low- and high-salt diet (50 
and 250 mmol NaCl/24 h) with a washout period of 14 days, 24-hour BPV was 
measured during each diet. We used linear mixed models adjusted for order of 
diet, mean blood pressure, and body mass index. In the observational study, 
24-hour urinary sodium excretion was not associated with 24-hour systolic or 
diastolic BPV (β, per 1 g/24 h urinary sodium excretion: 0.05 mm Hg [95% CI, 
-0.02 to 0.11] and 0.04 mm Hg [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.09], respectively). In the 
intervention trial, mean difference in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BPV 
between the low- and high-salt diet was not statistically significantly 
different (0.62 mm Hg [95% CI, -0.10 to 1.35] and 0.04 mm Hg [95% CI, -0.54 to 
0.63], respectively). Conclusions Urinary sodium excretion and salt intake are 
not independently associated with 24-hour BPV. These findings suggest that salt 
restriction is not an effective strategy to lower BPV in the White general 
population. Registration URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02068781."
700,"Background The natural history and optimal interventional timing in patients 
with isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) have not been well studied. 
This study aimed to investigate long-term clinical outcomes and risk factors 
associated with poor prognosis in patients with isolated severe TR. Methods and 
Results Consecutive transthoracic echocardiographic examinations in 2877 
patients with isolated severe TR were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with 
significant left-sided valve disease or repeated examinations were excluded. 
Primary outcome was defined as a composite of all-cause death and 
hospitalization for heart failure. Among the 613 enrolled patients (mean age, 
74±13 years; men, 38%), 141 died, and 62 were hospitalized for heart failure 
during the median follow-up period of 26.5 (interquartile range, 6.0-57.9) 
months. The 5-year event-free rate was 60.1%. TR pressure gradient (adjusted 
hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.04]), blood urea nitrogen (adjusted HR, 
1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.04]), left atrial volume index (adjusted HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 
1.002-1.02]), and serum albumin (adjusted HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.36-0.95]) were 
identified as independent predictors of adverse events. A risk model based on 
the 4 clinical factors that included pulmonary hypertension (TR pressure 
gradient >40 mm Hg), elevated blood urea nitrogen levels (>25 mg/dL), decreased 
albumin levels (<3.7 g/dL), and left atrial enlargement (left atrial volume 
index <34 mL/m2) revealed a graded increase in the risk of adverse events 
(P<0.001). Conclusions The prognosis of isolated severe TR is not always 
favorable. Careful attention should be paid to patients with concomitant risk 
factors, such as pulmonary hypertension, elevated blood urea nitrogen levels, 
decreased albumin levels, and left atrial enlargement."
701,"In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) leads to 
disease progression. Strategies to overcome the resistance are required in 
treatment for advanced lung cancer. In this study, we investigated the 
therapeutic effect of afatinib and HangAmDan-B1 (HAD-B1) co-administration in 
gefitinib-resistant NSCLC using HCC827-GR, NSCLC cell line with gefitinib 
resistance, and the HCC827-GR cell implanted mouse model. HAD-B1 consists of 4 
herbs, Panax notoginseng Radix, Cordyceps militaris, Panax ginseng C. A. Mey, 
and Boswellia carteri Birdwood, and has been reported to be effective in 
patients with advanced lung cancer in clinical practice. Our findings 
demonstrated that HAD-B1 combined with afatinib markedly inhibited cell 
proliferation and induced apoptosis compared to afatinib monotherapy and HAD-B1 
monotherapy. Inhibition of HCC827-GR cell proliferation by HAD-B1 occurred 
through MET amplification and reduced phosphorylation, and the synergistic 
effect of afatinib and HAD-B1 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in 
HCC827-GR cells via the downregulation of ERK and mTOR signaling pathways. In 
hematology and biochemistry tests, HAD-B1 alleviated the toxicity of tumor. In 
conclusion, HAD-B1 combined with afatinib would be a promising therapeutic 
strategy for NSCLC with EGFR-TKI resistance."
702,"BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in patients with cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri) have demonstrated inconsistent 
results.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between CSF amyloid-β protein (Aβ) 
and vascular pathological findings to elucidate the mechanisms of Aβ elimination 
from the brain in CAA-ri.
METHODS: We examined Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 levels in CSF samples in 15 patients with 
CAA-ri and 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy 
(AD-CAA) using ELISA as a cross-sectional study. Furthermore, we pathologically 
examined Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 depositions on the leptomeningeal blood vessels 
(arteries, arterioles, and veins) using brain biopsy samples from six patients 
with acute CAA-ri and brain tissues of two autopsied patients with CAA-ri.
RESULTS: The median Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the CSF showed no significant 
difference between pre-treatment CAA-ri (Aβ40, 6837 pg/ml; Aβ42, 324 pg/ml) and 
AD-CAA (Aβ40, 7669 pg/ml, p = 0.345; Aβ42, 355 pg/ml, p = 0.760). Aβ40 and Aβ42 
levels in patients with post-treatment CAA-ri (Aβ40, 1770 pg/ml, p = 0.056; 
Aβ42, 167 pg/ml, p = 0.006) were lower than those in patients with pre-treatment 
CAA-ri. Regarding Aβ40 and Aβ42 positive arteries, acute CAA-ri cases showed a 
higher frequency of partially Aβ-deposited blood vessels than postmortem CAA-ri 
cases (Aβ40, 20.8% versus 3.9%, p = 0.0714; Aβ42, 27.4% versus 2.0%, p = 0.0714, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Lower levels of CSF Aβ40 and Aβ42 could be biomarkers for the 
cessation of inflammation in CAA-ri reflecting the recovery of the intramural 
periarterial drainage pathway and vascular function."
703,"OBJECTIVE: assessment of the effect of a series of 20 whole-body cryotherapy 
sessions on the morphological and rheological indicators of blood in healthy 
people.
METHODS: The experimental group consisted of 15 women and 15 men who underwent a 
series of whole-body cryotherapy treatments. The control group consisted of 15 
women and 15 men - without intervention. For the analysis of blood biochemical 
parameters, venous blood was collected twice: Study 1: on the day of the 
commencement of whole body cryotherapy / from the control group; and Study 2: 
after a series of 20 cryotherapy sessions / from the control group (4 weeks).
RESULTS: After whole-body cryotherapy a statistically significant decrease in 
RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, EI 0.30 and an increase in MCHC and EI 2.19-60.30 were 
observed in women, as well as a decrease in MCV, MCH, AI and an increase in PLT, 
EI 0.30-60.30, AMP, T1/2 in men.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of whole-body cryotherapy causes changes in blood counts in 
various directions and has a positive effect on the rheological properties of 
blood in women and men - it increases the elongation index and reduces the 
aggregation index."
704,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasis (HHT) is an autosomal dominant hereditary 
disease, which can lead to abnormal angiogenesis. We performed contrast-enhanced 
ultrasound (CEUS) in a patient with HHT represented with hemothorax. After 
targeted embolization, the condition of hemothorax improved. In this case, we 
explore the use of CEUS to locate the responsible vessel of hemothorax, and 
found that CEUS could be used as a complementary preoperative method of 
localization with Computed tomography angiography (CTA)."
705,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Microfluidics is a useful tool for investigating blood 
microrheology. The study aimed to present the development of a microfluidic 
device for assessing the microrheological properties of blood cells' suspensions 
and its application in patients with T2DM.
METHODS: A new microfluidic device was elaborated, connected to a system, 
including a microscope with a digital camera, a pump with a manometer and a 
computer with specially developed software. Blood cells' suspensions were 
investigated in a microchamber between two parallel optical slides within a 
100μm distance. The motion of the blood cells in the microchamber was observed 
by the microscope and it was recorded and visualized by a digital camera. A 
method for evaluating the deformability of blood cells and a device for its 
implementation were used [1].
RESULTS: The pressure and flow rate ranges in the microfluidic device were 
specified by model suspensions of beta-ferroxy-hydroxide and red blood cells 
(RBC) suspensions. The pressure changes, realized by a pump (micropipette), 
connected to a manometer were established and the corresponding shear rates in 
the microfluidic device were determined. Data about the blood microrheological 
properties like RBC aggregation and deformability, leukocyte adhesion from a 
group of healthy volunteers and from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) were obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed device and experimental system is a promising tool 
for the study of blood microrheology."
706,"BACKGROUND: Resistance exercise induces thrombocytosis and increases platelet 
activation and function. These changes might be related to exercise variables 
including exercise intensity and type.
OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of traditional resistance exercise (TRE) and 
circuit resistance exercise (CRE) on cellular markers of platelet activation and 
function.
METHODS: In this crossover study ten healthy male (mean±SD: age, 25.6±2.4 years) 
subjects performed TRE encompassed 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 100% of 10-RM (10 
repetition maximum) for 6 exercises, and CRE protocols included 3 sets of 10 
repetitions at 100% of 10-RM for all 6 exercises consecutively, in two separate 
weeks. To measure platelet indices, PAC1, CD41a, CD42b and CD62P three blood 
samples were taken before, immediately after exercise, and after 30 min 
recovery.
RESULTS: Lactate concentration, blood pressure, platelet count (PLT), and mean 
platelet volume (MPV) were significantly (p <  0.05) increased following both 
resistance exercise trials. Significant increases in PAC1, and CD62P; and 
significant reductions for CD42b and CD41a were detected following both REs (p < 
 0.05). However, changes in PAC1 and CD62P were significantly different between 
the two protocols (p <  0.05), with higher increases detected following CRE.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute RE increases platelet indices and platelet activation; and 
that CRE results in higher platelet activation than TRE, probably due to 
exercise-induced increases in shear stress."
707,"BACKGROUND: For the treatment of single-level lumbar degenerative disc disease 
(DDD), oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF) has clinical advantages. Whether 
internal fixation needs to be combined for treatment has been the subject of 
debate.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the early clinical effects of standalone oblique lateral 
interbody fusion (S-OLIF) versus OLIF combined with lateral screw fixation of 
the vertebral body (F-OLIF) on single-level lumbar DDD.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the data of 34 patients for 
whom the OLIF technique was applied to treat single-level lumbar DDD from August 
2018 to May 2021. Patients were divided into the S-OLIF (n= 18) and F-OLIF 
groups (n= 16). Intraoperative blood loss, operative time, and length of 
hospital stay were recorded. The pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry 
disability index (ODI) before and after the operation were evaluated. The disc 
height (DH), foraminal height (FH), fused segment lordosis (FSL), lumbar 
lordosis (LL), cage subsidence, and fusion by CT examination were measured 
before and after the operation.
RESULTS: The S-OLIF group experienced a shorter operative time and less 
intraoperative blood loss than the F-OLIF group, and the differences were 
statistically significant (p< 0.05), but the difference in the length of 
hospital stay was not statistically significant. The postoperative VAS score and 
ODI of the two groups were significantly lower than those before the operation, 
but the postoperative differences between the two groups were not statistically 
significant. Differences were not statistically significant in postoperative FH, 
DH, FSL and LL of the two groups. Both groups were followed up for no less than 
12 months. In the two groups, fusion was achieved at the last follow-up visit.
CONCLUSION: According to short-term follow-up results, both S-OLIF and F-OLIF 
can achieve reliable and stable fusion and good clinical effect in the treatment 
of single-level lumbar DDD."
708,"BACKGROUND: Burnout among medical students has always been a major concern.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in the prevalence rates of burnout among Lebanese 
pre-final and final year medical students while taking into consideration the 
impact of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) on both the academical and clinical 
experiences.
METHODS: This is a multi-centered, survey-based, cross-sectional study conducted 
in October 2021. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory questionnaire was used on 120 
medical students from three different medical schools in Lebanon.
RESULTS: The overall burnout prevalence was 40.01%. When further dividing it 
into domains, 39.36% of students had personal burnout, 41.52% had work-related 
burnout, and 39.16% had pandemic-related burnout. Theoretical learning and 
clinical training were reported to be affected in respectively 66.70% and 
71.70%. However, only 10.00% of the students have regretted choosing medicine 
and 67.50% felt comfortable to get to the next academic level.
CONCLUSION: High levels of burnout were reported among pre-final and final year 
medical students with a subsequent negative impact on their academic life and 
clinical training. Medical schools should start adopting a conscious view of how 
to guide medical students in finding adequate coping mechanisms during these 
times of crisis."
709,"BACKGROUND: One of the most important steps for the successful designing, 
execution, and sustainability of a workplace wellness program is the evaluation 
stage.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to create a comprehensive wellness 
profile through selected and reliable testing protocols used for the evaluation 
of health, functional capacity, and physical fitness in office employees.
METHODS: One hundred office employees (32-55year-old) were evaluated to create a 
comprehensive wellness profile. Health indices (body composition, blood 
pressure, respiratory function, lipidemic profile), musculoskeletal pains, 
functional capacity, physical fitness (cervical, handgrip, back, leg strength, 
cardiorespiratory fitness), and lifestyle behaviors (physical activity levels, 
viewing habits, smoking, alcohol consumption) were measured.Thirty of the 
participants performed two assessment sessions to examine the reliability of 
functional capacity and physical fitness indices.
RESULTS: A significant proportion of employees were overweight (40.7%) and obese 
(18.5%). The largest percentage of employees (78%) presented musculoskeletal 
problems in various areas of the body (higher rates in lower back, neck, and/or 
hip). A large percentage of the employees (40-65%) showed low-moderate levels in 
selected indices of health, physical activity (<6000 steps/day), functional 
capacity and physical fitness, and high levels of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. 
The test-retest reliability for the assessment of functional capacity and 
physical fitness profile was high for all testing variables 
(ICC = 0.92-0.99;SEM%  = 2.5-4.5).
CONCLUSION: The testing protocols are reliable and can be used in conjunction 
with the reference values created to evaluate selected health and wellness 
indicators in office-employees."
710,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the clinical and histopathological factors 
associated with intestinal hemorrhage and its correlation with clinical outcomes 
in neonates with surgical necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).
METHODS: A retrospective study compared clinical and histopathology information 
in neonates following surgical NEC with severe hemorrhage and those with 
mild/moderate hemorrhagic lesions seen on resected intestine pathology.
RESULTS: The infants with severe hemorrhage (Grade 3-4, 81/148, 54.7%) had 
significantly lower exposure to antenatal steroids (52.5 % vs 76.9 % ; 
p = 0.004), had higher gestational age (28.5 weeks [7.14] vs. 26.58 [2.90]; 
p = 0.034), lost more bowel length (p = 0.045), had higher CRP levels at 2 weeks 
(p = 0.035), and had less intestinal failure ([30.3 % vs 52.5 %]; p = 0.014) 
than mild/moderate (Grade 0-2, 67/148, 45.2%) hemorrhage group. Those with 
severe hemorrhage had significantly higher mean inflammation score (2.67 [0.94] 
vs. 1.63 [0.92]; p = <0.001), higher necrosis scores (1.95 [1.28] vs. 1.49 
[1.35]; p = 0.037), higher neovascularization (p = 0.01), higher fibroblasts 
(p = 0.023) and higher lymphocyte percentages up to 48 hours (p <  0.05) 
following NEC than mild/ moderate hemorrhage group.On multivariable regression, 
less exposure to antenatal steroids (OR 0.18 [95% CI 0.05-0.58]; p = 0.005), 
higher inflammation (OR 3.7 [95% CI 2.09-7.32]; p = 0.001), and lymphocyte count 
on the day of onset/24 hours following NEC (OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.02-1.11]; 
p = 0.005) were independently associated with a higher odd of severe intestinal 
hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: The surgical NEC infants with intestinal hemorrhage were less likely 
to have antenatal steroid exposure but had higher inflammation grade and 
lymphocyte counts following NEC onset on multivariable regression modeling."
711,"SCOPE: The primary aim of the present study was to study the effect of acute 
ketosis on parameters of appetite regulation in prediabetes. The secondary aim 
was to investigate whether the effect is influenced by eating behaviours.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a randomised controlled trial. After an overnight 
fast, 18 adults with prediabetes (defined in line with the American Diabetes 
Association criteria) were assigned to consume either a ketone monoester 
(D-β-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol) drink (energy content 123 kcal) or a 
placebo drink (containing virtually no calories) in cross-over fashion. Blood 
samples were collected every 30 mins, from baseline to 150 minutes. Paired 
t-test was used to compare the total area under the curve (AUC) for the changes 
in parameters of appetite regulation (acylated ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), and 
hunger) following both drinks. Eating behaviours were determined with the use of 
the three-factor eating questionnaire. Significant elevation in blood 
β-hydroxybutyrate from 0.2 mmol/L to 3.5 mmol/L (p < 0.001) was achieved within 
30 minutes. Acute ketosis did not result in statistically significant 
differences in the AUCs for ghrelin, PYY, and hunger. No statistically 
significant difference in the AUCs was also observed when participants were 
stratified by their eating behaviours.
CONCLUSION: Acute ketosis consistently did not affect both objective and 
subjective parameters of appetite regulation in prediabetes. No subset of people 
with prediabetes according to eating behaviours had a significant effect of

712,"Methods to induce islet β-cells from induced pluripotent stem cells or embryonic 
stem cells have been established. However, islet β-cells are susceptible to 
apoptosis under hypoxic conditions, so the technique used to transplant β-cells 
must maintain the viability of the cells in vivo. The present study describes 
the development of a tricultured cell sheet, which was made by co-culturing 
islet β-cells, vascular endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells for 1 day. 
The islet β-cells in the tricultured cell sheet self-organized into islet-like 
structures surrounded by a dense vascular network in vitro. Triple-layered 
tricultured cell sheets engrafted well after transplantation in vivo and 
developed into insulin-secreting tissue with abundant blood vessels and a high 
density of islet β-cells. We anticipate that the tricultured cell sheet could be 
used as an in vitro pseudo-islet model for pharmaceutical testing and may have 
potential for development into transplantable grafts for use in regenerative 
medicine."

714,"INTRODUCTION: Patients lacking functional Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), 
a highly specific thyroid hormone (TH) transporter, present severe psychomotor 
disabilities. MCT8 deficiency leads to peripheral hyperthyroidism and brain 
hypothyroidism, the latter due to impaired transport of TH across brain 
barriers. Available treatments for patients are limited and aim to overcome the 
limited TH transport across brain barriers. The use of TH analogues such as 
3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) that do not require MCT8 to cross the 
cellular membranes is considered a potential therapy for MCT8 deficiency. 
Previous studies have shown that systemic administration of TRIAC at therapeutic 
doses does not increase TRIAC content in the brain, while 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of therapeutic doses of TRIAC 
increases TRIAC content in the brain but does not mediate thyromimetic effects. 
In view of this, we hypothesise that ICV administration of high doses of TRIAC 
can mediate thyromimetic effects in the brain without worsening the brain 
hypothyroidism or peripheral hyperthyroidism of patients.
METHODS: 400 ng/g of body weight per day of TRIAC were administered ICV to a 
mouse model of MCT8 deficiency: Mct8-/y and deiodinase 2 (Dio2)-/ - double 
knockout mice. The effects of this treatment on TH and TRIAC levels/content in 
blood and tissues were determined by radioimmunoassay and effects on 
TH-regulated genes were assessed by RT-qPCR in peripheral and central tissues.
RESULTS: ICV administration of high doses of TRIAC ameliorated the peripheral 
hyperthyroidism. In the brain, this treatment did not further aggravate brain 
hypothyroidism and increased TRIAC content in several brain regions; however, 
only moderate thyromimetic activity was observed in restricted brain areas.
CONCLUSION: Administration of high doses of TRIAC by ICV delivery at juvenile 
stages in a mouse model of MCT8 deficiency, is effective in normalising 
peripheral hyperthyroidism, but exerts minimal thyromimetic activity in the 
brain."
715,"This study presents a novel surgical model developed to provide hematological 
support for implanted cellularized devices augmenting or replacing liver tissue 
function. Advances in bioengineering provide tools and materials to create 
living tissue replacements designed to restore that lost to disease, trauma, or 
congenital deformity. Such substitutes are often assembled and matured in vitro 
and need an immediate blood supply upon implantation, necessitating the 
development of supporting protocols. Animal translational models are required 
for continued development of engineered structures prior to clinical 
implementation, with rodent models often playing an essential early role. Our 
long-term goal has been generation of living tissue to provide liver function, 
utilizing advances in additive manufacturing technology to create 3D structures 
with intrinsic micron to millimeter scale channels modeled on natural 
vasculature. The surgical protocol developed enables testing various design 
iterations in vivo by anastomosis to the host rat vasculature. Lobation of 
rodent liver facilitates partial hepatectomy and re-purposing the remaining 
vasculature to support implanted engineered tissue. Removal of the left lateral 
lobe exposes the underlying hepatic vasculature and can create space for a 
device. A shunt is created from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein by 
cannulating each with separate silicone tubing. The device is then integrated 
into the shunt by connecting its inflow and outflow ports to the tubing and 
re-establishing blood flow. Sustained anti-coagulation is maintained with an 
implanted osmotic pump. In our studies, animals were freely mobile after 
implantation; devices remained patent while maintaining blood flow through their 
millifluidic channels. This vascular anastomosis model has been greatly refined 
during the process of performing over 200 implantation procedures. We anticipate 
that the model described herein will find utility in developing preclinical 
translational protocols for evaluation of engineered liver tissue."
716,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are one of the commonest maladies, 
affecting 5-10% of pregnancies worldwide. The American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists (ACOG) identifies four categories of HDP, namely gestational 
hypertension(GH), Preeclampsia (PE), chronic hypertension(CH), and chronic 
hypertension with superimposed Preeclampsia. PE is a multisystem, heterogeneous 
disorder that encompasses 2% - 8% of all pregnancy-related complications, 
contributing to about 9% to 26% of maternal deaths in low-income countries and 
16% in high-income countries. These translate to  50,000 maternal deaths and 
over 500,000 fetal deaths worldwide, therefore demanding high priority in 
understanding clinical presentation, screening, diagnostic criteria, and 
effective management. PE is accompanied by uteroplacental insufficiency leading 
to vascular and metabolic changes, vasoconstriction, and end-organ ischemia. PE 
is diagnosed after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women who were previously 
normotensive or hypertensive. Besides shallow trophoblast invasion and 
inadequate remodeling of uterine arteries, dysregulation of the nonimmune system 
has been the focal point in PE. This results from aberrant immune system 
activation and imbalanced differentiation of T cells. Further, a failure of 
tolerance toward the semi-allogenic fetus results due to altered distribution of 
Tregs such as CD4+FoxP3+ or CD4+CD25+CD127(low) FoxP3+ cells, thereby creating a 
cytotoxic environment by suboptimal production of immunosuppressive cytokines 
like IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13. Also, intracellular production of complement 
protein C5a may result in decreased FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. With immune 
system dysfunction as a major driver in PE pathogenesis, it is logical that 
therapeutic targeting of components of the immune system with pharmacologic 
agents like anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating molecules are either being 
used or under clinical trial. Cholesterol synthesis inhibitors like Pravastatin 
may improve placental perfusion in PE, while Eculizumab (monoclonal antibody 
inhibiting C5) and small molecular inhibitor of C5a, Zilucoplan are under 
investigation. Monoclonal antibody against IL-17(Secukinumab) has been proposed 
to alter the Th imbalance in PE. Autologous Treg therapy and immune checkpoint 
inhibitors like anti-CTLA-4 are emerging as new candidates in immune horizons 
for PE management in the future. This article is protected by copyright. All

717,"OBJECTIVE: Determine whether the twice daily (BID) regimen is superior to the 
once daily (QD) regimen for managing glycemic variability by comparing the 
effects of anagliptin 100 mg BID versus sitagliptin 100 mg QD.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A double-blinded, randomized, multicenter study was 
performed in 89 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin alone (6.5% 
< HbA1c < 8.5%). Subjects were randomly assigned to anagliptin 100 mg BID or 
sitagliptin 100 mg QD in a 1:1 ratio for 12 weeks. Continuous glucose monitoring 
(CGM) was used to measure the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) and 
postprandial time in range (TIR) before and after DPP-4 inhibitor treatment to 
compare glycemic variability.
RESULTS: The decrease from baseline in MAGE at 12 weeks after DPP-4 inhibitor 
treatment was significantly greater in the anagliptin BID group than in the 
sitagliptin QD group (p<0.05); -30.4 ± 25.6 mg/dL (p<0.001) in the anagliptin 
group versus -9.5 ± 38.0 mg/dL (p=0.215) in the sitagliptin group. The TIR after 
dinner increased by 33.0 ± 22.0% (p<0.001) in the anagliptin group and by 14.6 
± 28.2% (p=0.014) in the sitagliptin group, with a statistically significant 
difference (p=0.009). No statistically significant differences were observed 
between the groups in the changes in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG).
CONCLUSIONS: The anagliptin BID regimen for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was 
superior in blood glucose control after dinner to improve glycemic variability, 
as indicated by MAGE and TIR but equivalent to the QD regimen in terms of HbA1c 
and FPG. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
718,"PURPOSE: Exfoliation glaucoma is a common and aggressive type of glaucoma with 
high prevalence in Scandinavia. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether 
the allele frequencies of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in 
LOXL1 were associated with the progression of exfoliation glaucoma in Swedish 
patients.
METHODS: In this non-randomised cohort study, we enrolled patients with 
exfoliation glaucoma, and they performed at least five reliable visual field 
tests. Blood samples were collected, and genotyping was performed using 
competitive allele-specific PCR genotyping. Glaucoma progression was evaluated 
using the guided glaucoma progression analysis (GPA), mean deviation (MD) 
difference and rate of progression (ROP). In addition, associations between 
allele frequencies and glaucoma progression were tested using logistic 
regression for GPA and linear regression for MD and ROP.
RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 130 patients in the study. The general genetic 
model showed statistical significance for LOXL1_rs2165241 (p = 8 × 10-7 , 
Fisher's exact test) and LOXL1_rs1048661 (p = 2 × 10-6 , Fisher's exact test). 
Regression analyses using an additive genetic model showed significant values 
for LOXL1_rs2165241SNP in relation to GPA, MD and ROP as outcomes 
(p = 1.8 × 10-4 , 4 × 10-2 , 6 × 10-4 ) and for LOXL1_rs1048661 SNP in relation 
to GPA, MD and ROP (p = 7 × 10-5 , 8 × 10-3 , 2 × 10-4 ).
CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to show an association of the SNPs 
LOXL1_rs2165241 and LOXL1_rs1048661 with the progression of exfoliation 
glaucoma. Further large-scale studies are required to verify these findings."
719,"BACKGROUND: There is a considerable need to incorporate biomarkers of resistance 
to new antiandrogen agents in the management of castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (CRPC).
METHODS: We conducted a phase II trial of enzalutamide in first-line chemo-naïve 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC and analyzed the prognostic value of 
TMPRSS2-ERG and other biomarkers, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), 
androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) in CTCs and plasma Androgen Receptor 
copy number gain (AR-gain). These biomarkers were correlated with treatment 
response and survival outcomes and developed a clinical-molecular prognostic 
model using penalized cox-proportional hazard model. This model was validated in 
an independent cohort.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were included. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene was 
detected in 32 patients with no differences observed in efficacy outcomes. CTC 
detection was associated with worse outcome and AR-V7 in CTCs was associated 
with increased rate of progression as best response. Plasma AR gain was strongly 
associated with an adverse outcome, with worse median prostate specific antigen 
(PSA)-PFS (4.2 vs. 14.7 m; p < 0.0001), rad-PFS (4.5 vs. 27.6 m; p < 0.0001), 
and OS (12.7 vs. 38.1 m; p < 0.0001). The clinical prognostic model developed in 
PREVAIL was validated (C-Index 0.70) and the addition of plasma AR (C-Index 
0.79; p < 0.001) increased its prognostic ability. We generated a parsimonious 
model including alkaline phosphatase (ALP); PSA and AR gain (C-index 0.78) that 
was validated in an independent cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: TMPRSS2-ERG detection did not correlate with differential activity 
of enzalutamide in first-line mCRPC. However, we observed that CTCs and plasma 
AR gain were the most relevant biomarkers."
720,"SCOPE: Adequate intake of whole grain foods is beneficial to type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM). Whether the preventive effects are related with metabolism of 
branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effects 
of germinated brown rice (GBR) intervention on BCAAs metabolism in T2DM 
patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized controlled trial, subjects with T2DM 
were instructed to consume 100 g/d GBR (GBR group, n = 42) or equal staple food 
(Control group, n = 25) for 3 months. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and 
serum samples were collected before and after the intervention. In the GBR 
group, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and serum BCAAs were 
decreased, and islet function was improved (P<0.05). Logistic regression 
analysis showed that FBG (Odds ratios (OR): 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.01∼1.84) and energy (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09∼1.30) were positively associated 
with serum total BCAAs level, while FINS was negatively associated (OR: 0.20, 
95% CI: 0.04∼0.88). Simultaneously, the key enzymes of BCAAs decomposition, 
which promoted glycolysis by activating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), were 
significantly increased.
CONCLUSION: GBR could improve the biochemical indicators of T2DM patients, and 
the underlying mechanism may be through improving insulin resistance and 
accelerating catabolism of BCAAs. This article is protected by copyright. All

721,"This study aimed to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose and evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical 
activity of JNJ-63709178, a CD123/CD3 dual-targeting antibody, in patients with 
relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous 
(SC) administration of JNJ-63709178 were evaluated. IV infusions were 
administered once every two weeks (Cohorts 1-5 [n = 17]) or twice weekly 
(Cohorts 6-11 [n = 36]). A twice-weekly subcutaneous (SC) dosing regimen with 
step-up dosing was also studied (SC Cohorts 1-2 [n = 9]). Treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAE) ≥ Grade 3 were observed in 11 (65%) patients in Cohorts 
1-5 and 33 (92%) patients in Cohorts 6-11. At the highest IV dose (4.8 μg/kg), 5 
(71%) patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. For SC administration (n=9), 
8 (89%) patients experienced TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 and injection site reactions (≤ 
Grade 3) emerged in all patients. At 4.8 μg/kg (IV and SC), the mean maximum 
serum concentrations were 30.3 ng/mL and 3.59 ng/mL, respectively. Increases in 
multiple cytokines were observed following IV and SC administrations, and 
step-up dosing strategies did not mitigate cytokine production or improve the 
safety profile and led to limited duration of treatment. Minimal clinical 
activity was observed across all cohorts. IV and SC dosing of JNJ-63709178 was 
associated with suboptimal drug exposure, unfavorable safety profiles, limited 
clinical activity, and inability to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose."
722,"Background: Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor use has increased over the last decade and 
though associated rates of major bleeding are lower compared to warfarin, 
outcomes from intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) are still significant. Targeted FXa 
inhibitor reversal agent became available in 2018, however use of 4-factor 
prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) for FXa inhibitor-associated ICH 
continues at many institutions. Objective: Evaluate the safety and hemostatic 
efficacy of 4F-PCC for FXa inhibitor-associated ICH. Methods: Single-center, 
retrospective study of patients who received 4F-PCC for FXa inhibitor-associated 
ICH. The primary efficacy endpoint was hemostasis and thrombosis was the main 
safety endpoint. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital mortality and 
discharge disposition. Results: 76 patients on apixaban or rivaroxaban were 
included. Good or excellent hemostasis was achieved in 80.3% of patients. Five 
patients experienced a thrombotic event. Favorable discharge disposition and 
lower in-hospital mortality was more likely in patients who achieved excellent 
hemostasis. Conclusion: 4F-PCC is safe and effective for FXa inhibitor 
associated ICH."
723,"SCOPE: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) provide a useful and minimally 
invasive source of biomarkers. Here we aimed to identify PBMC transcriptomic 
biomarkers predictive of metabolic impairment related to increased adiposity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the global PBMC transcriptome in metabolically 
healthy (normoglycemic) volunteers with overweight-obesity (OW-OB, n = 12), and 
in subjects with metabolically-obese normal-weight (MONW, n = 5) phenotype, in 
comparison to normal weight (NW, n = 12) controls. We identified 1,072 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OW-OB versus NW and 992 in MONW versus 
NW. Hierarchical clustering of the top 100 DEGs clearly distinguished OW-OB and 
MONW from NW. Remarkably, the OW-OB and MONW phenotypes shared 257 DEGs 
regulated in the same direction. The top up-regulated gene CXCL8, coding for 
interleukin 8, with a role in obesity-related pathologies, was of special 
interest as a potential marker for predicting increased metabolic risk. CXCL8 
expression was increased mainly in the MONW group and correlated directly with 
C-reactive protein levels.
CONCLUSIONS: PBMC gene expression analysis of CXCL8 or a pool of DEGs might be 
used to identify early metabolic risk in an apparently healthy population 
regardless of their BMI, i.e., subjects with OW-OB or MONW phenotype and to 
apply adequate and personalized nutritional preventive strategies. This article

724,"Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid that is widely distributed in the earth's 
crust. People are continuously exposed to this toxicant in their food and 
drinking water. Inorganic arsenic occurs in two oxidation states, arsenite 3+ 
(iAs3+) and arsenate 5+ (iAs5+). The most toxic form is its trivalent form which 
interferes with the electron transfer cycle and induces overproduction of 
reactive oxygen species, leading to depletion of the antioxidant defense system, 
as well as altering fatty acid levels and mitochondrial action. Since arsenic 
crosses the blood-brain barrier, it can damage cells in different regions of the 
brain, causing neurological disorders through the induction of oxidative stress, 
inflammation, DNA damage, and cell death. Hydroxytyrosol, taurine, alpha-lipoic 
acid, ellagic acid, and thymoquinone have been shown to effectively alleviate 
arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. The protective effects are the result of the 
anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of the phytochemicals and in 
particular their anti-apoptotic function via the Nrf2 and PI3/Akt/SIRT1 
signaling pathways."
725,"BACKGROUND: Although neurovascular conflict (NVC) is the most widely accepted 
cause of trigeminal neuralgia (TN), few articles have analyzed molecular and 
biochemical mechanisms underlying TN. In the present study, we dosed 
neuron-specific enolase (NSE) on serum and CSF samples of 20 patients submitted 
to microvascular decompression (MVD) and correlated these findings with the type 
of NVC.
METHODS: Blood samples were obtained preoperatively and 48 h after MVD. CSF from 
trigeminal cistern was intraoperatively obtained. NSE levels were measured using 
the Diasorin kit (LIAISON®NSE). NVC was classified as ""contact"" or ""trigeminal 
nerve distortion/indentation"" or ""trigeminal root atrophy"" based on MRI and 
intraoperative findings. Clinical outcome was measured by acute pain relief 
(APR) and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) scale at last available follow-up 
(FU; 6.40 ± 5.38 months).
RESULTS: APR was obtained in all patients. A statistically significant BNI 
reduction was obtained at latest FU (p < 0.0001). Serum NSE levels significantly 
decreased following MVD (from 12.15 ± 3.02 ng/mL to 8.95 ± 2.83 ng/mL, p = 
0.001). The mean CSF NSE value was 48.94 ng/mL, and the mean CSF/serum NSE rate 
was 4.18 with a strong correlation between these two variables (p = 0.0008). CSF 
NSE level in ""trigeminal root atrophy"" group was significantly higher compared 
to ""contact"" (p = 0.0045) and ""distortion/indentation"" (p = 0.010) groups.
CONCLUSION: NSE levels seem to be related to the etiopathology and severity of 
NVC. A significant reduction of serum NSE levels could be related to the 
resolution of the NVC and clinical TN improvement."
726,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the influence of preoperative symptom 
duration on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing lateral lumbar interbody 
fusion (LLIF) for degenerative conditions.
METHODS: Patients undergoing LLIF presenting with radiculopathy and/or 
neurogenic claudication were separated into two groups: preoperative symptom 
duration < 1-year (shorter duration) versus duration ≥ 1-year (longer duration). 
Patients undergoing surgery for trauma/malignancy/infection were excluded. 
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System-Physical Function (PROMIS-PF), 12-Item Short Form 
Physical/Mental Component Score (SF-12 PCS/MCS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9), visual analog scale (VAS) back/leg, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) 
were collected at preoperative and postoperative time points.
RESULTS: Eighty-two total patients, with 34 shorter-duration patients, were 
identified after propensity score matching for demographics. Longer-duration 
patients had higher estimated blood loss. All patients reported significant 
improvement in physical function, mental function, pain, and disability in at 
least one postoperative time point, except for SF-12 MCS in the shorter duration 
cohort. The longer duration cohort had higher MCID achievement in 12-week VAS 
back.
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing LLIF demonstrated significant postoperative 
improvement in physical function, mental function, pain, and disability outcomes 
independent of preoperative symptom duration. Both cohorts, when compared by 
preoperative symptom duration, demonstrated similar postoperative PROM scores. 
Patients with longer preoperative symptom duration had higher 12-week leg pain 
MCID achievement. These findings suggest that delayed time to surgery may not 
lead to inferior clinical outcomes in patients undergoing LLIF for degenerative 
conditions."
727,"Non-infectious pulmonary complications (NIPCs) after allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are associated with poor outcomes. It is 
important to maximize the effectiveness of primary treatment because secondary 
treatment has not been established. We analyzed data from 393 patients who 
underwent allogeneic HSCT during a 10-year period. Thirty-seven were diagnosed 
with NIPCs, which consisted of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, bronchiolitis 
obliterans, and interstitial lung disease including cryptogenic organizing 
pneumonia. Among these, 18 died (Dead group) while 19 remained alive (Alive 
group) during the study period. The median time between NIPC diagnosis and first 
administration of ≥ 1 mg/kg/day corticosteroids (prednisolone dose equivalent) 
was significantly longer in the Dead group than the Alive group, at 9 days 
versus 4 days (p = 0.01). We further divided these cases into those who received 
prednisolone within seven days and after 8 days. We found that the ≤ 7 days 
group were more likely to survive after their NIPC diagnosis compared to 
the ≥ 8 days group (p = 0.06). Our analysis showed that early initiation of 
corticosteroid therapy is associated with long-term survival in NIPCs."
728,"PURPOSE: Poisoning with elemental metals and metallic compounds was much more 
frequent in the past, and was related, among other things, to lifestyle and the 
lack of appropriate toxicological diagnostics. One example is mercury, which is 
being gradually eliminated but still has many different applications as a pure 
metal or in the form of various compounds. The paper presents a case of suicidal 
poisoning with mercury chloride (corrosive sublimate).
METHODS: Forensic and toxicological tests including inductively coupled plasma 
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were at the Department of Forensic Medicine, PMU in 
Szczecin.
RESULTS: The patient before death had a range of symptoms such as epigastric 
pain, vomiting of the stomach contents, central cyanosis with tachycardia, 
tremors, severe shortness of breath with wheezing, difficulty swallowing, 
slurred speech, rales in the lungs, and diarrhea. The concentration of mercury 
measured by ICP-MS was 191 mg/L for a blood sample collected antemortem, and 
147 mg/L for a blood sample collected at autopsy. Both concentrations of mercury 
are regarded as lethal. The post-mortem examination revealed signs of extensive 
thrombotic necrosis in some internal organs.
CONCLUSIONS: Mercuric chloride has an estimated human fatal dose of between 1 
and 4 g. It can produce a range of toxic effects, including corrosive injury, 
severe gastrointestinal disturbances, acute renal failure, circulatory collapse, 
and eventual death. The presented case of fatal poisoning with mercury chloride, 
due to the type of agent used, is now interesting in toxicological practice."
729,"Tolperisone hydrochloride is a centrally-acting muscle relaxant used for 
relieving spasticities of neurological origin and muscle spasms associated with 
painful locomotor diseases. It is metabolized to the inactive metabolite mainly 
by CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2C19 and CYP1A2. In our previous study, 
the pharmacokinetics of tolperisone was significantly affected by the genetic 
polymorphism of CYP2D6, but the wide interindividual variation of tolperisone 
pharmacokinetics was not explained by genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 alone. 
Thus, we studied the effects of CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism on tolperisone 
pharmacokinetics. Eighty-one subjects with different CYP2C19 genotypes received 
a single oral dose of 150 mg tolperisone with 240 mL of water, and blood samples 
were collected up to 12 h after dosing. The plasma concentration of tolperisone 
was measured by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system. The 
CYP2C19PM group had significantly higher Cmax and lower CL/F values than the 
CYP2C19EM and CYP2C19IM groups. The AUCinf of the CYP2C19PM group was 2.86-fold 
and 3.00-fold higher than the CYP2C19EM and CYP2C19IM groups, respectively. In 
conclusion, the genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 significantly affected 
tolperisone pharmacokinetics."
730,"Hypertension is the most critical risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Since the definition of hypertension varies across guidelines, identifying blood 
pressure (BP) categories that should be targeted to prevent CVD is needed. 
Herein, we investigated the association between BP per the 2019 Japanese Society 
of Hypertension (JSH) guidelines and the risk of CVD, stroke, and coronary heart 
disease (CHD) using data from 7,643 participants (30-84 years) registered in the 
Suita Study. Within 113,838 person-years (16.6 median years of follow-up), 690 
participants developed CVD (411 cases of stroke and 279 cases of CHD). Compared 
to normal BP (Systolic BP (SBP) < 120 and diastolic BP (DBP) < 80 mmHg), 
elevated BP (SBP 130-139 and/or DBP 80-89 mmHg) and hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 
and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg) were associated with a higher risk of CVD, stroke, and 
CHD. High-normal BP (SBP 120-129 and DBP < 80 mmHg) was associated with a higher 
risk of CVD and CHD. In conclusion, CVD preventive interventions should begin at 
lower BP levels than those applied in the 2019 JSH guidelines."
731,"BACKGROUND: While angioectasia is an important cause of acute hematochezia, 
relevant clinical features remain unclear. This study aims to reveal risk 
factors, clinical outcomes, and the effectiveness of therapeutic endoscopy for 
patients with acute hematochezia due to angioectasia.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 49 Japanese hospitals 
between January 2010 and December 2019, enrolling patients hospitalized for 
acute hematochezia (CODE BLUE-J study). Baseline factors and clinical outcomes 
for angioectasia were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 10,342 patients with acute hematochezia, 129 patients (1.2%) were 
diagnosed with angioectasia by colonoscopy. The following factors were 
significantly associated with angioectasia: chronic kidney disease, liver 
disease, female, body mass index < 25, and anticoagulant use. Patients with 
angioectasia were at a significant increased risk of blood transfusions compared 
to those without angioectasia (odds ratio [OR] 2.61; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.69-4.02). Among patients with angioectasia, 36 patients (28%) experienced 
rebleeding during 1-year follow-up. The 1-year cumulative rebleeding rates were 
37.0% in the endoscopic clipping group, 14.3% in the coagulation group, and 
32.8% in the conservative management group. Compared to conservative management, 
coagulation therapy significantly reduced rebleeding risk (P = 0.038), while 
clipping did not (P = 0.81). Multivariate analysis showed coagulation therapy 
was an independent factor for reducing rebleeding risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40; 
95% CI 0.16-0.96).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed patients with angioectasia had a greater 
comorbidity burden and needed more blood transfusions in comparison with those 
without angioectasia. To reduce rebleeding risk, coagulation therapy can be 
superior for controlling hematochezia secondary to angioectasia."

is an important factor in diabetes onset, and iron (Fe) may be an aggravating 
element. However, this relationship is still poorly established. Thus, this 
study evaluated whether Fe supplementation could aggravate obesity, impaired 
glucose tolerance, and sugar overload-induced genotoxicity in rats. A total of 
24 rats were treated with different diets: standard diet (SD, n = 8), invert 
sugar overload (320 g/L, HSD, n = 8), or Fe plus invert sugar overload 
(2.56 mg/L of Fe2+, Fe-HSD, n = 8) for four months. After treatment, the Fe-HSD 
group showed no excessive weight gain or impaired glucose tolerance. DNA damage 
in blood, as assessed by comet assay, gradually increased in HSD during 
treatment (p < 0.001), whereas Fe-HSD showed a nonlinear increase in DNA damage. 
Moreover, Fe-HSD presented 0.6-fold more DNA damage compared with SD 
(p = 0.0055) in the 1st month of treatment. At months 2 and 3, results show 
a ≥ 1.4-fold increase in HSD and Fe-HSD DNA damage, respectively, compared with 
SD (p < 0.01). At the end of the experiment, only HSD DNA damage differed from 
SD (1.5-fold more, p = 0.0196). Fe supplementation did not aggravate the invert 
sugar-induced DNA damage (p > 0.05). In the pancreas, results showed no 
differences in DNA damage. Mutagenicity, evaluated by micronucleus testing, was 
not observed regardless of treatment (p = 0.428). Fe supplementation, in the 
evaluated concentration, did not aggravate weight gain, impaired glucose 
tolerance, and sugar overload-induced genotoxicity in rats."
733,"PURPOSE: In oncology settings, music, especially music therapy (MT), is 
frequently used to improve patients' quality of life, pain situation, anxiety, 
depression, fatigue, and comfort. However, to date, there are no prospectively 
collected data correlating regular standardized MT sessions during radiotherapy 
(RT) to physical parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory 
rate, and oxygen saturation and corresponding quality of life measures using 
quantitative descriptive scales in oncological patients. Thus, the aim of this 
study was to investigate the effect of MT on the condition of radiooncology 
patients using these parameters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During this study, patients participated weekly MT 
sessions guided by a board-certified music therapist. Data such as pain, 
physical comfort, and respiratory comfort based on the visual analogue scale 
(VAS) were collected before and after MT sessions. Furthermore, vital signs 
including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation as 
well as RT side effects were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (age 61 ± 11 years) were enrolled in the study. 
Median VAS score was significantly different before and after MT for pain: VAS 1 
(interquartile range [IQR]: 0-3) vs. VAS 0 (IQR: 0-2; p < 0.001); physical 
comfort: VAS 7 (IQR: 6-7) vs. VAS 8 (IQR: 7-9; p < 0.001); and respiratory 
comfort only in the patients with pre-existing symptoms (VAS < 10 before 
therapy): VAS 8 (IQR: 6-8) vs. VAS 9 (IQR: 8-10; p = 0.002). Furthermore, vital 
signs were significantly reduced from pre-session to post-session (p > 0.001): 
heart rate 81 ± 14 min-1 to 76 ± 13 min-1 and respiratory rate from 12 ± 5 min-1 
to 10 ± 4 min-1. RT-related side effects did not interfere with participation in 
MT sessions.
CONCLUSION: In our study cohort of radiooncology patients, weekly MT sessions 
improved defined physical parameters as well as pain, physical comfort, and 
respiratory comfort. Establishing MT in the routine clinical setting should be 
more readily considered to further improve patient outcomes."
734,"In this perspective, the authors summarise some properties of the solid tumour 
micro-environment that have been explored during the last 55 years. It is well 
established that the concentrations of nutrients, including oxygen, decrease 
with increasing distance from tumour blood vessels, and that low extracellular 
pH is found in nutrient-poor regions. Cell proliferation is dependent on 
nutrient metabolites and decreases in regions distal from patent blood vessels. 
Proliferating cells cause migration of neighbouring cells further from blood 
vessels where they may die, and their breakdown products pass into regions of 
necrosis. Anticancer drugs reach solid tumours via the vascular system and 
establish concentration gradients such that drug concentration within tumours 
may be quite variable. Treatment with chemotherapy such as doxorubicin or 
docetaxel can kill well-nourished proliferating cells close to blood vessels, 
thereby interrupting migration toward necrotic regions and lead to 
re-oxygenation and renewed proliferation of distal cells, as can occur with 
radiotherapy. This effect leads to the paradox that cancer treatment can rescue 
cells that were destined to die in the untreated tumour. Renewed and sometimes 
accelerated repopulation of surviving tumour cells can counter the effects of 
cell killing from repeated treatments, leading to tumour shrinkage and regrowth 
without changes in the intrinsic sensitivity of cells to the administered 
treatment. Strategies to prevent these effects include the combined use of 
chemotherapy with agents that selectively kill hypoxic tumour cells, including 
inhibitors of autophagy, since this is a process that may allow recycling of 
cellular macromolecules from dying cells and improve their survival."
735,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for infection in patients with 
anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).
METHODS: Newly onset patients with AAV in China were included, and their 
laboratory tests and disease activity were analyzed. Based on infection, 
patients were divided into the infection group (A-I) and the non-infection group 
(A-NI). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to 
investigate variables that are independently associated with infection.
RESULTS: In total, 418 patients were enrolled. Significantly higher white blood 
cell count (WBC, p < 0.001), neutrophils (p < 0.001), NLR (p < 0.001), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (p < 0.001), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR, 
p < 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, p = 0.032), C-reactive protein 
(CRP, p < 0.001), procalcitonin (PCT, p < 0.001), and Birmingham vasculitis 
activity score (BVAS, p = 0.005) were observed in the A-I group than in the A-NI 
group. It was detected that NLR (ρ = 0.273, p < 0.001), MLR (ρ = 0.153, 
p = 0.011), ESR (ρ = 0.143, p = 0.020), and PCT (ρ = 0.391, p < 0.001) were 
positively correlated with BVAS. Furthermore, NLR was not only an independent 
predictor of infection (adjusted OR: 1.144, 95% CI: 1.059-1.236, p = 0.001), but 
with the largest area under ROC curve, of which value was 0.750. Notably, the 
optimal cut-off value of NLR for infection was 6.01, with sensitivity of 70.07% 
and specificity of 71.68%.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that in addition to WBC, CRP, ESR, and PCT, 
NLR should also be used as a beneficial inflammatory indicator to differentiate 
infection in newly diagnosed AAV. Key Points • NLR was a helpful inflammatory 
marker in differentiating infection in newly diagnosed AAV."
736,"PURPOSE: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms represent an interesting alternative 
to maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimators (MAP-BE) for tacrolimus AUC 
estimation, but it is not known if training an ML model using a lower number of 
full pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles (= ""true"" reference AUC) provides better 
performances than using a larger dataset of less accurate AUC estimates. The 
objectives of this study were: to develop and benchmark ML algorithms trained 
using full PK profiles to estimate MeltDose®-tacrolimus individual AUCs using 2 
or 3 blood concentrations; and to compare their performance to MAP-BE.
METHODS: Data from liver (n = 113) and kidney (n = 97) transplant recipients 
involved in MeltDose-tacrolimus PK studies were used for the training and 
evaluation of ML algorithms. ""True"" AUC0-24 h was calculated for each patient 
using the trapezoidal rule on the full PK profile. ML algorithms were trained to 
estimate tacrolimus true AUC using 2 or 3 blood concentrations. Performances 
were evaluated in 2 external sets of 16 (renal) and 48 (liver) transplant 
patients.
RESULTS: Best estimation performances were obtained with the MARS algorithm and 
the following limited sampling strategies (LSS): predose (0), 8, and 12 h 
post-dose (rMPE = - 1.28%, rRMSE = 7.57%), or 0 and 12 h (rMPE = - 1.9%, 
rRMSE = 10.06%). In the external dataset, the performances of the final ML 
algorithms based on two samples in kidney (rMPE = - 3.1%, rRMSE = 11.1%) or 
liver transplant recipients (rMPE = - 3.4%, rRMSE = 9.86%) were as good as or 
better than those of MAP-BEs based on three time points.
CONCLUSION: The MARS ML models developed using ""true"" MeltDose®-tacrolimus AUCs 
yielded accurate individual estimations using only two blood concentrations."
737,"Patients (pts) with polycythemia vera (PV) suffer from pruritus, night sweats, 
and other symptoms, as well as from thromboembolic complications and progression 
to post-PV myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib (RUX) is approved for second-line therapy 
in high-risk PV pts with hydroxyurea intolerance or resistance. The RuxoBEAT 
trial (NCT02577926, registered on October 1, 2015, at clinicaltrials.gov) is a 
multicenter, open-label, two-arm phase-IIb trial with a target population of 380 
pts with PV or ET, randomized to receive RUX or best available therapy. This 
pre-specified futility analysis assesses the early clinical benefit and 
tolerability of RUX in previously untreated PV pts (6-week cytoreduction was 
allowed). Twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive RUX. Compared 
to baseline, after 6 months of treatment, there was a significant reduction of 
median hematocrit (46 to 41%), the median number of phlebotomies per year (4.0 
to 0), and median patient-reported pruritus scores (2 to 1), and a trend for 
reduced night sweat scores (1.5 to 0). JAK2V617F allele burden, as part of the 
scientific research program, also significantly decreased. One hundred nine 
adverse events (AEs) occurred in 24/28 patients (all grade 1 to 3), and no pt 
permanently discontinued treatment because of AEs. Thus, treatment with 
ruxolitinib in untreated PV pts is feasible, well-tolerated, and efficient 
regarding the above-mentioned endpoints."
738,"PURPOSE: Mastocheck®, a proteomic-based blood assay, has been developed for 
early diagnosis of breast cancer. The purpose of this study is whether 
Mastocheck® is useful as a postoperative follow-up.
METHODS: A total of 255 patients were analyzed. The patients were classified 
into longitudinal monitoring and recurrence/nonrecurrence cohorts. The 
longitudinal monitoring cohort consisted of 111 patients. In this cohort, blood 
analyses were performed three times (before surgery, 8 weeks after surgery, and 
between 6 months and one year after surgery), and a comparative analysis of the 
values of Mastocheck® and individual proteins at each time point was performed. 
The recurrence/nonrecurrence cohort consisted of 144 patients who had been 
followed up for more than 1 year, and the blood marker values at the time of 
local recurrence were compared to those of nonrecurrence patients.
RESULTS: In the longitudinal monitoring cohort analysis, in 81 of 111 patients 
were diagnosed with breast cancer with Mastocheck® and the sensitivity was 
73.0%. Of 111 patients in the longitudinal monitoring cohort, 108 had two blood 
analyses (before and 8 weeks after surgery), and three serial blood analyses 
were performed on 53 patients. The Mastocheck® value that were in the cancer 
range of 73.0% (in 81 of 111 patients) of patients before surgery, was within 
the normal range of 68.5% (in 74 of 108 patients) at 8 weeks after surgery and 
88.7% (in 47 of 53 patients) from 6 months to 1 year after surgery. The value of 
Mastocheck® was significantly decreased after surgery compared to before surgery 
(p < 0.001). In the recurrence/nonrecurrence cohort analysis, the Mastocheck® 
values were in the cancer range in 38 out of 63 recurrence patients and within 
the normal range in 66 of 81 nonrecurrence patients (sensitivity of 60.3% and 
specificity of 80.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Mastocheck® is expected to be used as a blood marker tool to aid in 
the early detection of recurrence during follow-up after breast cancer surgery."
739,"OBJECTIVE: Arterial stiffness and pulsatile central hemodynamics have been shown 
to affect various aspects of physical function, such as exercise capacity, gait 
speed, and motor control. The aim of this study was to examine the potential 
association between arterial stiffness and balance function in healthy younger 
men and women.
METHODS: 112 participants (age = 21 ± 4 years, n = 78 women) underwent measures 
of arterial stiffness, pulsatile central hemodynamics, balance function and 
physical fitness in this cross-sectional study. Postural sway was measured in 
triplicate while participants stood on a foam surface with their eyes closed for 
20 s. The average total center of pressure path length from the three trials was 
used for analysis. Measures of vascular function were estimated using an 
oscillometric blood pressure device while at rest and included pulse wave 
velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx), and pulse pressure amplification. 
Measures of physical fitness used as covariates in statistical models included 
handgrip strength determined from a handgrip dynamometer, lower-body flexibility 
assessed using a sit-and-reach test, estimated maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) 
using heart rate and a step test, and body fat percentage measured from air 
displacement plethysmography.
RESULTS: The results from linear regression indicated that after considering 
sex, mean arterial pressure, body fat, estimated VO2max, handgrip strength, and 
sit-and-reach, PWV (β = 0.44, p < 0.05) and AIx (β = - 0.25, p < 0.01) were 
significant predictors of postural sway, explaining 10.2% of the variance.
CONCLUSION: Vascular function is associated with balance function in young 
adults independent of physical fitness. Increased arterial stiffness may 
negatively influence balance, while wave reflections may be protective for 
balance."
740,"Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is a highly conserved protein 
essential for DNA replication, repair and scaffold functions in the cytosol. 
Specific inhibition of PCNA in cancer cells is an attractive anti-cancer 
strategy. ATX-101 is a first-in-class drug targeting PCNA, primarily in cellular 
stress regulation. Multiple in vivo and in vitro investigations demonstrated 
anti-cancer activity of ATX-101 in many tumor types and a potentiating effect on 
the activity of anti-cancer therapies. Healthy cells were less affected. Based 
on preclinical data, a clinical phase 1 study was initiated. Twenty-five 
patients with progressive, late-stage solid tumors were treated with weekly 
ATX-101 infusions at four dose levels (20, 30, 45, 60 mg/m2). ATX-101 showed a 
favorable safety profile supporting that vital cellular functions are not 
compromised in healthy cells. Mild and moderate infusion-related reactions were 
observed in 64% of patients. ATX-101 was quickly cleared from blood with 
elimination half-lives of less than 30 min at all dose levels, probably due to 
both, a quick cell penetration and peptide digestion in serum, as demonstrated 
in vivo. No tumor responses were observed but stable disease was seen in 70% of 
the efficacy population (n = 20). Further studies have been initiated to provide 
evidence of efficacy. Trial registration numbers: ANZCTR 375262 and ANZCTR 
375319."
741,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension (HT) in obesity has been reported frequently in 
children in recent years. The role of copeptin and uric acid here are not well 
known. We aimed to investigate the relationship between HT and serum copeptin 
and uric acid levels in children with obesity.
METHODS: We included 80 children with obesity who were admitted to our hospital 
between April 2018 and September 2018. The patients were separated into two 
groups: hypertensive and non-hypertensive. Serum copeptin levels were measured 
using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Copeptin levels were significantly higher in patients with HT than in 
those without (p = 0.0001). In addition, serum uric acid levels in patients with 
HT were significantly higher, while the serum potassium levels were 
significantly lower (p = 0.01) than in those without HT (p = 0.001). In 
correlation analyses, a positive correlation was detected between blood sodium 
and copeptin levels (p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive children with obesity had higher serum copeptin and 
uric acid and lower blood potassium levels. Moreover, copeptin levels were 
positively correlated with blood sodium levels. Thus, in addition to copeptin, 
serum uric acid, potassium, and sodium levels may be important in the diagnosis 
and follow-up of children with HT."
742,"As an emerging therapeutic strategy, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) 
have been proven to be superior to traditional drugs in many aspects. However, 
due to their unique mechanism of action, the existing degradation evaluation 
methods still have many limitations, which seriously restrict the development of 
PROTACs. In this methodological study, by using direct stochastic optical 
reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) based single-cell protein quantitative 
analysis, we systematically investigated the dynamic degradation characteristics 
of FLT3 protein during PROTACs treatment. We found that the distribution of FLT3 
varies between FLT3-ITD mutation and FLT3-WT cells. PROTACs had an obvious 
time-course effect on protein degradation and present two distinct phases, which 
provided a basis for deciding when to evaluate protein degradation. Compared 
with long-time administration, high concentration PROTACs had a better 
effectiveness because it achieved a higher Dmax. Two-color dSTORM-based 
colocalization analysis efficiently detected the proportion of ternary 
complexes, making it very useful in screening PROTACs. Taken together, our 
findings verify that dSTORM method is an ideal tool for evaluating PROTACs and 
it will accelerate the development of new PROTACs."
743,"BACKGROUND: Salvage transplant has been historically considered effective 
therapy for myeloma patients relapsing after first transplant, if they achieved 
adequate remission duration. However, the efficacy of novel agent combinations 
has called this paradigm into question.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis in a homogeneously 
treated cohort of 106 patients undergoing ASCT2 at our institution, all of whom 
received novel agent-based chemotherapy (immunomodulatory agent [IMiD] and/or 
proteasome inhibitor [PI]) for both induction and relapse. As an exploratory 
objective we assessed whether predictive thresholds of progression free survival 
post first transplant (ASCT1) for benefit post ASCT2 vary with use of IMiD 
maintenance post ASCT1.
RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) was 98% post-ASCT2 and 
treatment-related mortality (TRM) was low at 1.8%. With a median follow-up of 26 
months (range 0.5-85) from ASCT2, median overall survival (OS) is estimated at 
80 months (95% CI: ≥ 49-months) and median progression-free survival after ASCT2 
(PFS2) at 24 months (95% CI 19-39). PFS post first transplant (PFS1) at >/= 50 
months was associated with improved OS. Predictors of PFS2 included PFS1 ≤42 
months and progression on IMiD-based maintenance post- ASCT1.
CONCLUSION: ASCT2 continues to offer acceptable outcomes for most patients 
treated within modern day treatment paradigms, with longer PFS after ASCT1 and 
IMiD non-refractory disease being associated with improved outcomes."
744,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are standard of care in advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all patients benefit, even 
among PD-L1 tumor proportional score (TPS) ≥50%, indicating an unmet need for 
additional biomarkers such as those assessing the tumor immune microenvironment 
(TIME). DetermaIO is a 27-gene assay that classifies TIME and has previously 
demonstrated association with ICI response.
METHODS: FFPE samples were selected from BC Cancer and West Clinic Cancer Center 
patients with performance status (PS) ≤2 who received at least 2 cycles of ICI 
monotherapy in the first (1L) or second line (2L). IO scores were generated and 
analyzed for association with PFS and OS.
RESULTS: In the entire cohort (N=147), IO score was significantly associated 
with OS (HR=0.68, 95%CI 0.47-0.99, P = .042) and PFS (HR=0.62, 95%CI 0.43-0.88, 
P = .0069). In 1L treated patients (PD-L1≥50%, N=78), IO score was significantly 
associated with PFS (HR=0.55, 95%CI 0.32-0.94, P = .028). In exploratory 
analyses, IO score was associated with benefit in 1L PS2 patients for OS 
(HR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.091-0.74, P = .012) and PFS (HR = 0.27, 95%CI 0.098-0.72, 
P = .0095) which was confirmed in PFS subgroup analysis in the independent West 
Cancer Center study (N=13 HR=0.14, 95%CI 0.027-0.76, P = .023).
CONCLUSION: These data confirm the association of DetermaIO with ICI clinical 
benefit in NSCLC, and expand on previous studies by demonstrating that first 
line treated PD-L1≥50% patients can further be stratified by IO score to 
identify efficacy. Exploratory analysis suggested that the IO score identifies 
benefit in patients with poor PS."
745,"BACKGROUND: We sought to provide a meta-analysis and credibility assessment of 
available randomized controlled trials and propensity score matched studies when 
assessing early and oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy 
compared with open distal pancreatectomy.
METHODS: The MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were 
searched for pertinent literature up to June 2022. Random-effect meta-analyses 
were applied. Trial sequential analysis was applied to verify whether results 
were true- or false-positive or -negative findings.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were identified (2 randomized controlled trials and 11 
propensity score matched studies). The early outcomes were assessed on 12 
studies, including 4,346 patients. In this population, laparoscopic distal 
pancreatectomy decreased postoperative stay (mean difference = 1.8 days; P = 
.001) and estimated blood loss (mean difference = 148 mL; P = .001), and trial 
sequential analysis confirmed these as true-positive findings. Laparoscopic 
distal pancreatectomy and open distal pancreatectomy had similar operating times 
(P = .165), and trial sequential analysis confirmed this as a true-negative 
finding. Major morbidity, mortality, and readmission were similar, but results 
were inconclusive by trial sequential analysis. Oncologic outcomes were assessed 
on 5 studies, including 2,430 patients. In this population, laparoscopic distal 
pancreatectomy showed higher R0 resection rate (OR = 1.46; P = .001) and shorter 
time to adjuvant therapy (mean difference 4.0 days P = .003). A survival benefit 
was observed at 1 year after laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (OR = 1.45; P = 
.001), which was not confirmed at 3 years (P = .650).
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is superior to open distal 
pancreatectomy for most of the early outcomes analyzed. The operating time was 
equalized as a result of the learning curve. Results from patients with 
pancreatic cancer suggest at least an oncologic noninferiority of laparoscopic 
distal pancreatectomy compared with open distal pancreatectomy."
746,"BACKGROUND: Increasing studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) have great 
diagnostic value in cancer. Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) is closely 
related to the prognosis of breast cancer. However, it remains unknown whether 
miRNAs in whole blood could be promising biomarkers in breast cancer ALNM.
METHODS: An miRNA microarray was used to screen potential differentially 
expressed miRNA candidates in whole blood of three breast cancer patients with 
ALNM and three without ALNM. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) was used to detect candidate differentially expressed miRNAs in the 
whole blood of 109 breast cancer patients. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis 
was carried to predict the potential targets and enriched pathway of miRNAs.
RESULTS: QRT-PCR validated the fact that miR-367-3p, miR-548aq-5p and miR-4710 
are downregulated in breast cancer with ALNM compared to it without ALNM. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that miR-367-3p, 
miR-548aq-5p and miR-4710 have good diagnostic values. Notably, the three-miRNA 
signature showed better predictive value, with an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 
0.7414. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the miRNAs could participate in a 
complex network and thus be involved in cancer-related pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the potential of miR-367-3p, miR-548aq-5p and 
miR-4710 and the three-miRNA signature as biomarkers for breast cancer with 
ALNM."

748,"OBJECTIVE: To present a simple and effective hemostatic technique using a 
tourniquet loop during laparoscopic myomectomy.
DESIGN: Pericervical tourniquet has been proven to be a safe and effective 
measure to reduce blood loss during open myomectomy. However, the use of a 
tourniquet in laparoscopic myomectomy has been rarely reported probably because 
the application is difficult and troublesome. In our technique, a prefabricated 
tourniquet loop, adapted from a Foley catheter, is applied around the lower 
segment of the uterus. It is easy to apply a tourniquet loop around the lower 
uterine segment during laparoscopic myomectomy. There is no need to make a 
window in the broad ligament to apply a pericervical tourniquet or triple 
tourniquets. Meanwhile, complete blockage of blood supply from the uterine 
artery and utero-ovarian anastomoses may ensure better hemostasis.
SETTING: A tertiary hospital.
PATIENT(S): The patient was a 34-year-old woman with uterine leiomyoma and a 
desire for future fertility. She had been suffering from urinary frequency and 
chronic bladder pressure for the past 6 months. Magnetic resonance imaging 
confirmed 2 intramural masses measuring 96 mm × 91 mm and 25 mm × 13 mm at the 
anterior uterine wall.
INTERVENTION(S): Institutional review board and ethics committee approval was 
obtained. Laparoscopic myomectomy was performed with the application of a 
tourniquet loop around the lower segment of the uterus (step-by-step video 
demonstration): homemade tourniquet loop formation using a 14-Fr latex Foley 
catheter; trocar placement with 2 umbilical ports (10 mm and 5 mm) and a 5-mm 
port at the lower-left quadrant of the abdomen; application of a tourniquet loop 
around the lower uterine segment; tumor enucleation and myometrial closure; 
removal of the tourniquet loop and a check for bleeding; contained specimen 
extraction via the merged umbilical incision; and inspection of the abdominal 
cavity and closure of the merged umbilical incision.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Feasibility of using a tourniquet loop as an effective 
hemostatic technique in laparoscopic myomectomy.
RESULT(S): The surgery lasted for approximately 90 minutes, and the tourniquet 
time was approximately half an hour. The estimated blood loss was only 20 mL. 
Her hemoglobin value on day 1 after the surgery was 131 g/L, the same as the 
preoperative level. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyoma. The patient 
was discharged 2 days after the surgery with no complications. During follow-up, 
the patient reported that there was no discomfort and that her menses were 
normal. Her fallopian tubes were patent in the hysterosalpingogram. Her ovarian 
function, which was assessed by serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration 
(5.34 mIU/mL) on day 3 of her menstrual cycle and antimüllerian hormone level 
(2.01ng/mL), was in the normal range. She was suggested to conceive 1 year after 
the procedure.
CONCLUSION(S): Application of a tourniquet loop around the lower uterine segment 
is a simple and effective hemostatic technique during laparoscopic myomectomy. 
Randomized prospective studies are needed to determine the hemostatic effect of 
the laparoscopic use of a tourniquet loop and its impact on fertility and 
ovarian function."
749,"INTRODUCTION: Resistant hypertension (RH) represents an important multi-organic 
impact and increases the morbi-mortality. We aimed to evaluate the evolution of 
hypertensive mediated organ damage in patients with RH after adding 
spironolactone.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 58 patients with RH who started 
spironolactone (12.5-25mg daily). Office blood pressure, 24-h ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring (24h-ABPM), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and 
echocardiographic parameters were analyzed prior to initiation of spironolactone 
and after 12 months of treatment.
RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of patients were women and mean age was 67.3±10.1 
years. We observed a decrease in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (median 
[RIQ25-75]) of 27.0 (7.5-255.4) to 11.3 (3.1-37.8)mg/g, p=0.009. This was more 
relevant in patients with albuminuria grade A2 and A3: 371.2 (139.5-797.4) to 
68.4 (26.5-186.5)mg/g, p=0.02. The echocardiographic changes were: posterior 
wall thickness: -1.0±0.4mm (p<0.001), interventricular septal thickness: 
-0.6±0.5mm (p=0.01), left ventricular (LV) mass index: -14.7±10.2g/m2 (p=0.006), 
LV remodeling index: -0.04±0.036 (p=0.03), without statistically significant 
changes in LV ejection fraction, LV end-diastolic diameter, LV end-systolic 
diameter, left atrial diameter, relationship between early ventricular filling 
wave and atrial contraction and LV filling pressure index. Systolic/diastolic 
office blood pressure decreased -12.5±4.9/-4.9±3.0mmHg, p<0.001. In 24h-ABPM, 
systolic and diastolic BP had a significant decrease in diurnal and nocturnal 
periods and 38.1% of patients presented a favorable change in the circadian 
pattern, p<0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding spironolactone to patients with RH contributes to improve 
hypertensive mediated organ damage by reducing albuminuria levels and 
echocardiographic parameters of hypertensive heart disease."
750,"INTRODUCTION: People with a reduced nighttime dip in blood pressure have an 
increased cardiovascular risk. Our objective was to describe the different 
patterns in blood pressure (BP) among pediatricians who work in long on-duty 
shifts in relation with sex, medical rank and sleeping time.
METHODS: Descriptive, cross-sectional, two-center study. On duty pediatric 
Resident physicians and pediatric Consultants were recruited between January 
2018 and December 2021.
RESULTS: Fifty-one physicians were included in the study (78.4% female, 66.7% 
Resident physicians). Resident physicians had a higher night/day ratio (0.91 vs 
0.85; p<0.001) and a shorter nighttime period (3.87 vs 5.41, p<0.001) than 
Consultants. Physicians sleeping less than 5h had a higher night/day ratio (0.91 
vs 0.87, p=0.014). Being a Resident showed a ∼4.5-fold increased risk of having 
a non-dipping BP pattern compared to Consultants.
CONCLUSION: We found a potential link between both being a Resident and, 
probably, having shorter sleeping time, and the non-dipping BP pattern in 
physicians during prolonged shifts."
751,"OBJECTIVES: Infectious lumbosacral radiculitis and myelitis, a clinical entity 
called Elsberg syndrome, is classically linked to HSV-2 and VZV. Here, we report 
a case of an Elsberg syndrome caused by primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 
in an immunocompetent patient.
METHODS: Here is a case report at an academic medical center. Cerebral and 
spinal cord MRI, electroneuromyography, and serum and CSF analysis were 
performed.
RESULTS: We investigated a 31-year-old healthy woman presenting with acute 
paresthesia of both feet ascending to the pelvic region, urinary retention, and 
constipation. Neurologic examination revealed symmetrical hyperesthesia of both 
inferior limbs up to the pelvic region, with patellar and Achilles hyporeflexia. 
Although MRI was normal, a dysfunction of the S1 left nerve root was observed on 
electroneurography. CSF analysis was inflammatory. Blood CMV PCR was positive, 
and anti-CMV IgG/IgM values indicated seroconversion. Taken together, these 
results strongly suggested an Elsberg syndrome caused by CMV primary infection. 
After a course of ganciclovir, a marked improvement of the symptoms was 
observed.
DISCUSSION: This case highlights that CMV primary infection can be a cause of 
Elsberg syndrome in immunocompetent patients. CMV testing should be discussed in 
these patients to initiate adequate antiviral therapy."
752,"Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that median preoptic (MnPO) 
neurons are necessary for the full hypertensive response to chronic angiotensin 
II (AngII) in rats consuming a high salt diet. The MnPO is implicated in many of 
the physiologic actions of AngII, primarily acting as a downstream nucleus to 
AngII binding at circumventricular organs such as the organum vasculosum of the 
lamina terminalis (OVLT). We have previously shown a prominent effect of lesion 
of the OVLT on the chronic hypertensive effects of AngII in rats consuming high 
salt. Additionally, we have shown that lesion of the MnPO attenuated the 
hypertensive response to chronic intravenous infusion of AngII in rats. However, 
whether MnPO neurons or fibers of passage contribute to this response is not 
clear. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either sham (SHAM; 
n = 8) or ibotenic acid lesion of the MnPO (MnPOx; n = 6). In the MnPOx group, 
200 nl of ibotenic acid in phosphate buffer saline (5 μg/μl) was injected into 
each of 3 predetermined coordinates targeted at the entire MnPO. After a week of 
recovery, rats were instrumented with radiotelemetric pressure transducers, 
provided 2.0% NaCl diet and distilled water ad libitum and given another week to 
recover. After 3 days of baseline measurements, osmotic minipumps were implanted 
subcutaneously in all rats for administration of AngII at a rate of 
150 ng/kg/min. Blood pressure measurements were made for 14 days after minipump 
implantation. By day 7 of AngII treatment, blood pressure responses appeared to 
plateau in both groups while the hypertensive response was markedly attenuated 
in MnPOx rats (MnPOx, 122 ± 6 mmHg; SHAM, 143 ± 8 mmHg). These results support 
the hypothesis that neurons of the MnPO are involved in the central pathway 
mediating the chronic hypertensive effects of AngII in rats consuming a high 
salt diet."
753,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regulatory effect and mechanism of 
methyltransferase-like protein 3 (METTL3)-mediated N6-methyladenosine 
methylation (m6A) on forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) levels and the proportion of 
regulatory T (Treg) cells in the peripheral blood of patients with asthma.
METHODS: Flow cytometry and ELISA were used to detect the differences in the 
proportions of Treg cells and serum interleukins (ILs) 4 and 7, respectively, in 
the peripheral blood between healthy individuals and patients with different 
asthma conditions. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western 
blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels, 
respectively, of METTL3 and Foxp3 in CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood 
samples of different groups. M6A blot and m6A coimmunoprecipitation-PCR were 
used to detect the global and Foxp3 mRNA m6A levels, respectively, in the 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells collected from the peripheral blood 
of patients with asthma were subjected to in vitro transfection to knockdown the 
METTL3 levels and observe changes in the Foxp3 mRNA, protein, m6A levels, and 
RNA stability. Flow cytometry and ELISA were used to detect the changes in the 
Treg cell proportion and IL-4 and IL-17 levels in the cell culture supernatant.
RESULTS: Compared with the healthy individuals, the ratio of Treg cells to 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells was significantly decreased and the Foxp3 mRNA and 
protein expression was downregulated in patients with asthma with disease 
progression. The Foxp3 mRNA and protein expression levels were positively 
correlated with the Treg cell proportion and negatively correlated with IL-17 
expression. The global and Foxp3 mRNA m6A levels were increased in the 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of patients with asthma. METTL3 expression was 
significantly higher in the peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of patients with 
asthma compared with healthy individuals. After METTL3 knockdown, the Foxp3 mRNA 
m6A level was reduced, and the stability of Foxp3 mRNA and protein expression 
was increased. YTHDF2 could bind to the m6A site in 3'UTR of Foxp3 mRNA. 
Knockdown of YTHDF2 regulated the level and stability of Foxp3 mRNA. METTL3 
knockdown reduced the ratio of Treg cells to CD4+ T cells and the IL-4 and IL-17 
secretion levels from CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with 
asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: High METTL3 expression in the peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of 
patients with asthma increased the m6A level and reduced the stability of Foxp3 
mRNA in a YTHDF2-dependent way, thereby reducing the expression of Foxp3 and the 
proportion of Treg cells."
754,"OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 
influenza viruses are contagious respiratory pathogens with similar symptoms but 
require different treatment and management strategies. This study investigated 
the differences in laboratory test result profiles between SARS-CoV-2 and 
influenza infected patients upon presentation to emergency department (ED).
METHODS: Laboratory test results and demographic information from 723 influenza 
positive (2018/1/1 to 2020/3/15) and 1,281 SARS-CoV-2 positive (2020/3/11 to 
2020/6/30) ED patients were retrospectively analyzed. The dataset was randomly 
divided into a training/validation set (2/3) and a test set (1/3) with the same 
SARS-CoV-2/influenza ratio. Four machine learning models in differentiating the 
laboratory profiles of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza positive 
patients were evaluated. The Shapley Additive Explanations technique was 
employed to visualize the impact of laboratory tests on the overall 
differentiation. Furthermore, the model performance was also evaluated in a new 
test dataset including 519 SARS-CoV-2 ED patients (2020/12/1 to 2021/2/28) and 
the previous influenza positive patients (2018/1/1 to 2020/3/15).
RESULTS: A laboratory test result profile consisting of 15 blood tests, together 
with patient age, gender, and race can discriminate the two types of viral 
infections using a random forest (RF) model. The RF model achieved an area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90 in the test set. Among 
the profile of 15 laboratory tests, the serum total calcium level exhibited the 
greatest contribution to the overall differentiation. Furthermore, the model 
achieved an AUC of 0.81 in a new test set.
CONCLUSION: We developed a laboratory tests-based RF model differentiating 
SARS-CoV-2 from influenza, which may be useful for the preparedness of 
overlapping COVID-19 resurgence and future seasonal influenza."
755,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative 
option for patients with hematological disorders and bone marrow failure 
syndromes. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity 
post-transplant. Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapies are efficacious in 
ameliorating GVHD but limited by variable suppressive capacities and the need 
for a high therapeutic dose. Here, we sought to expand Treg in vivo by 
expressing an orthogonal IL-2Rβ receptor (oIL2Rβ) that would selectively 
interact with orthogonal IL-2 (oIL2) cytokine and not wildtype IL2. To test 
whether the orthogonal system would preferentially drive donor Treg expansion, 
we used a murine MHC-disparate GVHD model of lethally irradiated BALB/c mice 
given T-cell depleted bone marrow from C57BL/6 (B6) mice alone, or together with 
B6Foxp3+GFP+ Treg or oIL2Rβ transduced Treg at low cell numbers that typically 
do not control GVHD with WT Treg. On day 2, B6 Tcons were injected to induce 
GVHD. Recipients were treated with PBS or oIL2 daily for 14 days, then 3 times 
weekly for an additional 14 days. Mice treated with oIL2Rβ Treg and oIL2 
compared to PBS had enhanced GVHD survival, in vivo selective expansion of 
Tregs, and greater suppression of Tcon expansion in secondary lymphoid organs, 
and intestines. Importantly, oIL2Rβ Treg maintained graft-versus-tumor (GVT) 
responses in two distinct tumor models (A20, MLL-AF9). These data demonstrate a 
novel approach to enhance the efficacy of Treg cell therapy in allo-HSCT using 
an oIL2/oIL2Rβ system that allows for selective in vivo expansion of Treg 
leading to GVHD protection and GVT maintenance."
756,"Children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) with relapsed/refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) without complete metabolic response (CMR) 
before autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) have poor 
survival outcomes. CheckMate 744, a phase 2 study for CAYA (aged 5-30 years) 
with relapsed/refractory cHL, evaluated a risk-stratified, response-adapted 
approach with nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin (BV) followed by BV plus 
bendamustine for patients with suboptimal response. Risk stratification was 
primarily based on time to relapse, prior treatment, and presence of B symptoms. 
We present the primary analysis of the standard-risk cohort. Data from the 
low-risk cohort are reported separately. Patients received 4 induction cycles 
with nivolumab plus BV; those without CMR (Deauville score >3, Lugano 2014) 
received BV plus bendamustine intensification. Patients with CMR after induction 
or intensification proceeded to consolidation (high-dose chemotherapy/auto-HCT 
per protocol). Primary endpoint was CMR any time before consolidation. 
Forty-four patients were treated. Median age was 16 years. At a minimum 
follow-up of 15.6 months, 43 patients received 4 induction cycles (1 
discontinued); 11 of whom received intensification, 32 proceeded to 
consolidation. CMR rate was 59% after induction with nivolumab plus BV, and 94% 
any time before consolidation (nivolumab plus BV ± BV plus bendamustine). 
One-year PFS rate was 91%. During induction, 18% of patients experienced grade 
3/4 treatment-related adverse events. This risk-stratified, response-adapted 
salvage strategy had high CMR rates with limited toxicities in CAYA with 
relapsed/refractory cHL. Most patients did not require additional chemotherapy 
(bendamustine intensification). Additional follow-up is needed to confirm 
durability of disease control. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02927769."
757,"Prediction of individual patient benefit from lenalidomide (Len) maintenance 
post autologous transplant (ASCT) remains challenging. We investigated here 
extended molecular profiling for outcome prediction in NCRI Myeloma XI (MyXI) 
trial patients. MyXI patients randomized to Len maintenance or observation 
post-ASCT were genetically profiled for t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(1p), 
gain(1q) and del(17p) and co-occurrence of risk markers computed. PFS, PFS2 and 
OS were calculated from maintenance randomization, and groups compared using Cox 
proportional hazards regression. 556 MyXI patients, 17% with double hit MM (≥2 
risk markers), 32% with single hit (1 risk marker) and 51% without risk marker, 
were analyzed. Single hit MM derived the highest PFS benefit from Len 
maintenance, specifically isolated del(1p), del(17p) and t(4;14), with 
approximately 40-fold (HR 0.02; 95% CI: 0.002-0.24; P=0.0012), 10-fold (HR 0.1; 
95% CI: 0.02-0.58; P=0.0095) and 7-fold (HR 0.14; 95% CI: 0.04-0.45; P=0.0009) 
reduced risk of progression or death (PFS) compared to observation, 
respectively. This benefit translated into improved PFS2 HR 0.27 (95% CI: 
0.13-0.54; P=0.0002) and OS HR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.18-0.93; P=0.03) for this group 
of patients over observation; median PFS was 10.9 vs. 57.3 months for 
observation vs. Len maintenance. Patients with isolated gain(1q) derived no 
benefit, and double hit MM limited benefit, regardless or risk lesions involved, 
from Len maintenance. Extended genetic profiling identifies patients deriving 
exceptional benefit from Len maintenance and should be considered for newly 
diagnosed patients to support management discussions along their treatment 
pathway."
758,"Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric protein, the size of which is 
regulated via ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis within the A2-domain. We aimed to 
isolate nanobodies distinguishing between proteolyzed and non-proteolyzed VWF, 
leading to the identification of a nanobody (designated KB-VWF-D3.1) targeting 
the A3-domain, the epitope of which overlaps the collagen-binding site. While 
KB-VWF-D3.1 binds with similar efficiency to dimeric and multimeric derivatives 
of VWF, binding to VWF was lost upon proteolysis by ADAMTS13, suggesting that 
proteolysis in the A2-domain modulates exposure of its epitope in the A3-domain. 
We therefore used KB-VWF-D3.1 to monitor VWF degradation in plasma samples. 
Spiking experiments showed that a loss of 10% intact-VWF could be detected using 
this nanobody. By comparing plasma from volunteers to that of congenital 
VWD-patients, intact-VWF levels were significantly reduced for all VWD-types, 
and most severely in VWD-type 2A-group 2 in which mutations promote 
ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis. Unexpectedly, we also observed increased 
proteolysis in some patients with VWD-type 1 and VWD-type 2M. A significant 
correlation (r=0.51, p<0.0001) between the relative amount of high molecular 
weight-multimers and levels of intact-VWF was observed. Reduced levels of 
intact-VWF were further found in plasmas from patients with severe aortic 
stenosis and patients receiving mechanical circulatory support. KB-VWF-D3.1 is 
thus a nanobody that detects changes in the exposure of its epitope within the 
collagen-binding site of the A3-domain. In view of its unique characteristics, 
it has the potential to be used as a diagnostic tool to investigate whether a 
loss of larger multimers is due to ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis."
759,"In response to tissue injury, within seconds the ultra large glycoprotein, von 
Willebrand factor (VWF) is released from endothelial storage organelles 
(Weibel-Palade bodies) into the lumen of the blood vasculature where it leads to 
the recruitment of platelets. The marked size of VWF multimers represents an 
unprecedented burden on the secretory machinery of endothelial cells (ECs). ECs 
have evolved mechanisms to overcome this, most notably an actomyosin ring, that 
forms, contracts and squeezes out its unwieldy cargo. Inhibiting the formation 
or function of these structures represents a novel therapeutic target for 
thrombotic pathologies though characterising proteins associated with such a 
dynamic process has been challenging. We have combined APEX-2 proximity 
labelling with an innovative dual loss of function screen to identify proteins 
associated with actomyosin ring function. We show p21 activated kinase 2 (PAK2) 
recruits septin hetero-oligomers, a molecular interaction that forms a ring 
around exocytic sites. This cascade of events control actomyosin ring function 
aiding efficient exocytic release. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PAK2 
or septins led to inefficient release of VWF and a failure to form 
platelet-catching strings. This new molecular mechanism offers additional 
therapeutic targets for the control of thrombotic disease and is highly relevant 
to other secretory systems that employ exocytic actomyosin machinery."
760,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the only 
curative treatment option for a number of hematological malignancies. Its 
therapeutic potential relies on the potency of donor T-cells to eliminate 
residual malignant cells, the so-called graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. 
Disease relapse remains the most frequent treatment failure and is associated 
with poor outcome. Therefore, it is inevitable to decipher mechanisms that 
weaken GvL. In recent years, studies in tumor biology have revealed that 
metabolic remodeling of the micromilieu can critically regulate immune 
responses. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to a metabolic 
condition known as oxidative stress, which can severely hamper T-cells. As of to 
date, only few studies from mainly preclinical models have demonstrated 
occurrence of oxidative stress after allo-SCT. Therefore, we sought out to 
investigate oxidative stress in a well-characterized group of allo-SCT patients 
and its impact on reconstituting T-cells. We identified high concentrations of 
serum 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) as an established biomarker for oxidative 
stress. 8-OHdG is one of the major products of DNA oxidation, which is normally 
rapidly removed. Following allo-SCT T-cells accumulated oxidative DNA damages. 
High cellular 8-ohdg content (8-ohdghi) was associated with signs of enhanced 
T-cell activation but also premature exhaustion. The 8-ohdghi T-cells' inability 
to efficiently target malignant cells or to produce cytotoxic Granzyme B and 
IFN-g was associated with a significantly increased relapse risk and a shorter 
overall survival. Taken together, our novel findings could give reason to focus 
on bolstering DNA repair in reconstituting T-cells as a mean to improve GvL 
efficacy."
761,"The large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by high glucose 
metabolism in diabetic patients not only induces inflammation but also damages 
blood vessels, finally resulting in low limb temperature, and the high glucose 
environment in diabetic patients also makes them susceptible to bacterial 
infection. Therefore, diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) usually presents as a nonhealing 
wound. To efficaciously prevent and treat DFU, we proposed a near-infrared (NIR) 
responsive microneedle (MN) patch hierarchical microparticle 
(HMP)-ZnO-MN-vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth 
factor (H-Z-MN-VEGF&bFGF), which could deliver drugs to the limbs painlessly, 
accurately, and controllably under NIR irradiation. Therein, the hair-derived 
HMPs exhibited the capacity of scavenging ROS, thereby preventing damage to the 
blood vessels. Meanwhile, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles endowed the MN patch 
with excellent antibacterial activity which could be further enhanced with the 
photothermal effect of HMPs under NIR irradiation. Moreover, vascular 
endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor could promote the 
angiogenesis. A series of experiments proved that the MN patch exhibited 
broad-spectrum antibacterial and anti-inflammatory capacities. In vivo, it 
obviously increased the temperature of fingertips in diabetic rats as well as 
promoted collagen deposition and angiogenesis during wound healing. In 
conclusion, this therapeutic platform provides a promising method for the 
prevention and treatment of DFU."
762,"OBJECTIVES: Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are risk 
factors of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, limited 
literature exists on the effect of COPD and smoking on COVID-19 outcomes. This 
study examined the impact of smoking exposure in pack-years (PY) and COPD on 
COVID-19 outcomes among smokers in Japan.
METHODS: The study included 1266 smokers enrolled by the Japan COVID-19 Task 
Force between February 2020 and December 2021. PY and COPD status were 
self-reported by patients. Patients were classified into the non-COPD (n=1151) 
and COPD (n=115) groups; the non-COPD group was further classified into <10 PY 
(n=293), 10-30 PY (n=497), and >30 PY (n=361). The study outcome was the need 
for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).
RESULTS: The incidence of IMV increased with increasing PY and was highest in 
the COPD group (<10 PY=7.8%, 10-30 PY=12.3%, >30 PY=15.2%, COPD=26.1%; p<0.001). 
Significant association was found for IMV requirement in the >30 PY and COPD 
groups through univariate (odds ratio [OR]: >30 PY=2.11, COPD=4.14) and 
multivariate (OR: >30 PY=2.38; COPD=7.94) analyses. Increasing PY number was 
also associated with increased IMV requirement in patients aged <65 y.
CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative smoking exposure was positively associated with COVID-19 
outcomes in smokers."
763,"Soricidae spp. (shrews) play an essential role in soil ecosystems and, due to 
their habitat and behavior, are exposed to soil pollutants, such as pesticides. 
Still, toxicity risk in Soricidae spp. has not been appropriately assessed. In 
this study, the musk shrew (Suncus murinus) was used as a model organism for 
toxicity assessment in Soricidae. Considering their carnivorous diet, it is 
reasonable to assume that the musk shrew has unique metabolic traits that are 
different from those of other common experimental models. This study describes 
the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent metabolism affected by acetamiprid (ACP), a 
neonicotinoid insecticide. Pharmacokinetics analysis, an in vitro metabolic 
assay, and genetic analysis of CYP were performed and compared with data from 
mice and rats. Through phylogenetic and syntenic analyses, three families of CYP 
were identified in the musk shrew. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the 
blood concentration of ACP decreased more quickly in musk shrews than in mice. 
Moreover, the in vitro metabolic assay suggested more efficient metabolic 
responses toward ACP in musk shrews than in mice or rats. One of the CYP2A 
isoforms in musk shrews might be linked to a better ACP metabolism. From the 
results above, we describe novel metabolic traits of the musk shrew. Future 
research on recombinant CYP enzymes is necessary to fully understand 
CYP-dependent metabolism of xenobiotics in musk shrews."
764,"PURPOSE: The optimal approach to incorporate radiotherapy (RT) in conjunction 
with CAR T-cell Therapy (CART) for relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (bNHL) remains unclear. This study documents the RT local control rate 
among patients who received bridging radiotherapy (BRT) prior to CART and 
compares it to those who received salvage radiotherapy (SRT) post CART. It 
further reports on a promising way to utilize SRT for post CART disease, and 
identifies predictors for RT in-field recurrence.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 83 patients with r/r bNHL who received CART 
and RT, either as BRT pre-CART infusion (n=35) or as SRT post-CART infusion 
(n=48), between 2018 and 2021. RT was defined as comprehensive (compRT) - 
treated all sites of active disease - or focal (focRT). Limited disease was 
defined as disease amenable to compRT, involving <5 active disease sites.
RESULTS: At time of RT, patients who received BRT prior to CART had bulkier 
disease sites (median diameter 8.7cm vs. 5.5cm; p=0.01) and were treated to 
significantly lower doses (median equivalent 2 Gy dose 23.3Gy vs. 34.5Gy, 
p=0.002), compared to SRT post CART. Among 124 total irradiated sites 
identified, 8/59 (13%) bridged-sites and 21/65 (32%) salvaged-sites experienced 
in-field recurrence translating to 1-year local control rate (LC) of 84% and 
62%, respectively (p=0.009). Patients with limited post-CART disease (n=37) who 
received compSRT (n=26) had better overall survival (51% vs. 12%; p=0.028), 
freedom from subsequent progression (31% vs. 0%; p<0.001) and freedom from 
subsequent event (19% vs. 0%; p=0.011) compared to patients with limited disease 
who received focSRT (n=11).
CONCLUSION: BRT followed by CART appears to be associated with improved LC 
compared to SRT in r/r bNHL. Nonetheless, SRT offers a promising salvage 
intervention for limited (<5 sites) relapsed post-CART disease if given 
comprehensively."
765,"FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is a promising radiation technique that uses 
ultra-high doses of radiation to increase the therapeutic window of the 
treatment. FLASH-RT has been observed to provide normal tissue sparing at high 
dose rates and similar tumor control than conventional radiotherapy, yet the 
biological processes governing these radiobiological effects are still unknown. 
In this study, we sought to investigate the potential immune response generated 
by FLASH-RT in a high dose of proton therapy in an orthotopic glioma rat model. 
Thus, we cranially irradiated rats with a single high dose (25 Gy) using FLASH 
dose rate proton irradiation (257 ± 2 Gy/s) or conventional dose rate proton 
irradiation (4 ± 0.02 Gy/s). We first assessed the protective FLASH effect that 
resulted in our setup through behavioral studies in naïve rats. This was 
followed by a comprehensive analysis of immune cells in blood, healthy tissue of 
the brain and tumor microenvironment by flow cytometry. Proton FLASH-RT spared 
memory impairment produced by conventional high-dose proton therapy and induced 
a similar tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) recruitment. Additionally, a 
general neuroinflammation that was similar in both dose rates was observed. 
Overall, this study demonstrated a FLASH proton therapy offers a 
neuro-protective effect even at high doses while is able of mounting an 
effective lymphoid immune response in the tumor."
766,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intravenous (IV) or oral iron suppletion is 
superior in improving physical fitness in anemic children with inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD).
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a clinical trial at 11 centers. Children aged 8 to 18 
with IBD and anemia (defined as hemoglobin (Hb) z-score < -2) were randomly 
assigned to a single IV dose of ferric carboxymaltose or 12 weeks of oral 
ferrous fumarate. Primary endpoint was the change in 6-minute walking distance 
(6MWD) from baseline, expressed as z-score. Secondary outcome was a change in Hb 
z-score from baseline.
RESULTS: We randomized 64 patients (33 IV iron; 31 oral iron) and followed them 
for 6 months. One month after the start of iron therapy, the 6MWD z-score of 
patients in the IV group had increased by 0.71 compared with -0.11 in the oral 
group (P=0.01). At 3- and 6-months follow-up, no significant differences in 6MWD 
z-scores were observed. Hb z-scores gradually increased in both groups and the 
rate of increase was not different between groups at 1, 3 and 6 months after 
initiation of iron therapy (overall P=0.97).
CONCLUSION: In this trial involving anemic children with IBD, a single dose of 
IV ferric carboxymaltose was superior to oral ferrous fumarate with respect to 
quick improvement of physical fitness. At 3 and 6 months after initiation of 
therapy, no differences were discovered between oral or IV therapy. The increase 
of Hb over time was comparable in both treatment groups.

767,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a randomized controlled trial of positive airway pressure 
(PAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy.
METHODS: Participants with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 underwent polysomnography (PSG) at 
14-20 weeks gestation (visit 1) and those with OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥5 but 
<50), were enrolled. In Phase 1, participants were randomized to 
autotitrating-PAP (APAP) verses sham-PAP; in Phase 2, the sham arm was replaced 
with a sleep hygiene control. Participants returned at 28-31 weeks (visit 2). 
Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index 
(UAD-PI), endoglin, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT-1), and placental 
growth factor (PLGF) was measured, as well as fasting glucose and insulin to 
calculate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The primary outcome was a composite of: 
UAD-PI, sFLT-1/PLGF ratio and HOMA-IR. For secondary analyses, each outcome 
variable was analyzed independently. Adherence to treatment was examined.
RESULTS: 241 participants completed visit 1, 89 (37%) had an AHI between 5 and 
50. Fifty-one participants were randomized in Phase 1, 38 in Phase 2. There was 
no significant difference in our primary outcome by treatment group. In 
secondary analyses, UAD-PI was lower in participants on APAP compared to sleep 
hygiene. Otherwise, there were no differences in MAP, angiogenic markers or 
metabolic markers in Phase 1, Phase 2 or across the entire study. Overall 
adherence to APAP therapy was low, but mean use was greater in Phase 2 (0.3 ± 
0.6 hours/night vs. 1.3 ± 2.3 hours/night, p=0.10). For those on active therapy, 
fasting glucose values decreased as adherence increased.
CONCLUSION: This RCT of APAP in pregnancy did not find any differences in a 
composite primary cardiometabolic risk profile by treatment group. Higher APAP 
adherence was associated with lower fasting glucose levels. The use of a 
sham-PAP control arm in Phase1 may have negatively impacted adherence to active 
treatment."
768,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term outcomes and complications of three 
different variants of laparoscopic sacropexy.
DESIGN: Single-center retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: A tertiary university hospital.
PATIENTS: A total of 483 patients with advanced uterine prolapse who underwent 
laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy (LSH), laparoscopic supra-cervical hysterectomy 
with concomitant laparoscopic sacrocervicopexy (LSCH+LSC), or total laparoscopic 
hysterectomy with concomitant laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (TLH + LSC).
INTERVENTIONS: Demographic data, POP-Q scores, questionnaire results, surgical 
conditions, postoperative outcomes and complications were all extracted from 
medical and follow-up records.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between April 2012 and December 2020, 277 women 
underwent LSH, 95 women underwent LSCH+LSC, and 111 women underwent TLH + LSC. 
LSH procedures was associated with statistically significantly least blood loss, 
least postoperative hospital days and catheterization days (all p<.001). During 
the median follow-up of 32 months (13-117 months), analysis of the data revealed 
notable anatomical correction in all groups regarding POP-Q measurements 
(p<.001), and the anatomic cure rate showed no significant difference among 
these three groups (p=.273). No statistically significant differences were 
detected for prolapse recurrence (p=.171) and functional improvements among 
these groups. Neither intraoperative injuries (p=.098) nor total postoperative 
complications (p=.218) differed considerably, whereas the rate of severe 
postoperative complications (p<.001) including mesh exposure (p=.004) was 
significantly higher in the TLH+LSC group than that in the other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: LSH is the appropriate choice for women with uterine prolapse 
without contraindications for uterine preservation. For patients with benign 
uterine lesions and a normal cervix, LSCH+LSC is a safer approach that provides 
similar anatomical results and improved quality of life scores that are similar 
to those of TLH+LSC. For patients with lesions in the uterus and cervix, 
TLH + LSC should be selected."
769,"BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is an important treatment 
that could offer a cure for lymphoma patients. However, advanced age is an 
important factor that determines eligibility and outcomes after ASCT. Over the 
past decade, attributed to improved supportive care, ASCT for older patients 
with increasing age has become more feasible.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we report the single center outcomes of older patients 
with lymphoma undergoing ASCT at Mayo Clinic Rochester to highlight its interval 
improvement over time and help to redefine the implication of ASCT in the CAR 
T-cell era.
STUDY DESIGN: A single center retrospective study describes characteristics and 
outcomes of older patients with lymphoma who underwent ASCT between 2000 and 
2021. The study reports various relevant transplant related outcomes including 
progression free survival, overall survival, relapse incidence and non-relapse 
mortality (NRM) in older patients with various lymphoma histologic subtypes. The 
main outcome is focusing on NRM which is defined as time from ASCT to 
non-lymphoma related death with relapse being a competing event.
RESULTS: of 492 patients aged ≥65 years old were analyzed. The median age at 
ASCT was 68.8 years. The most common indication for ASCT was diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma accounting for 59.3%. In multivariate analyses, patients 
undergoing ASCT in 2009-2021, performance status of zero and low Hematopoietic 
Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) (0-3) had a significantly lower NRM. 
Factors associated with OS included age, LDH, and HCT-CI.
CONCLUSION: The 1- year NRM in older patients was low at 6.0% in concordance 
with previous reports. Age should not be the only factor determining patients' 
ASCT eligibility. With the proper patient selection, ASCT remains a reasonable 
option for older patients with lymphoma."
770,"OBJECTIVE: The long-term decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
in primary aldosteronism (PA) patients after adrenalectomy may be influenced by 
multiple preoperative factors. The present study aimed to provide a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of these factors.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to determine eligible 
observational studies on the possible association between preoperative factors 
and postoperative long-term eGFR decrease in PA patients using PubMed, Web of 
Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases.
RESULTS: A total of 8 relevant studies with 1159 patients were included. Old age 
(OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.09, P = 0.001), high systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
(OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09, P = 0.01), baseline hypokalemia (OR = 0.08, 95% 
CI: 0.02-0.30, P < 0.001), and low eGFR (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.97, P = 
0.001) presented a strong association with long-term eGFR decrease after 
adrenalectomy.
CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that old age, high SBP, baseline hypokalemia, 
and low eGFR are associated with an increased risk of postoperative long-term 
eGFR decrease in PA patients postoperatively. More attention should be given to 
the above factors for the timely prevention and management of renal impairment."
771,"BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with poor 
prognosis, and new treatment options are urgently needed. About 34%-39% of 
primary TNBCs show a low expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2-low), which is a target for new anti-HER2 drugs. However, little is known 
about the frequency and the prognostic value of HER2-low in metastatic TNBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with TNBC from five 
European countries for this international, multicenter analysis. 
Triple-negativity had to be shown in a metastatic site or in the primary breast 
tumor diagnosed simultaneously or within 3 years before metastatic disease. 
HER2-low was defined as immunohistochemically (IHC) 1+ or 2+ without ERBB2 gene 
amplification. Survival probabilities were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier 
method, and multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox regression 
models.
RESULTS: In total, 691 patients, diagnosed between January 2006 and February 
2021, were assessable. The incidence of HER2-low was 32.0% [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 28.5% to 35.5%], with similar proportions in metastases (n = 265; 
29.8%) and primary tumors (n = 425; 33.4%; P = 0.324). The median overall 
survival (OS) in HER2-low and HER2-0 TNBC was 18.6 and 16.1 months, respectively 
(HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.83-1.19; P = 0.969). Similarly, in multivariable analysis, 
HER2-low had no significant impact on OS (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.79-1.13; P = 0.545). 
No difference in prognosis was observed between HER2 IHC 0/1+ and IHC 2+ tumors 
(HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.69-1.17; P = 0.414).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large international dataset of metastatic TNBC, the 
frequency of HER2-low was 32.0%. Neither in univariable nor in multivariable 
analysis HER2-low showed any influence on OS."
772,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In this study, we aimed to refer eligible (patients with 
stable blood sugar and without any history of cardiovascular events or 
proliferative retinopathy) and willing persons with diabetes (PwDs) to primary 
healthcare centers (PHCs) from tertiary care and to compare the care indicators.
METHODS: This before-after interventional study was conducted among PwDs aged 
≥18 years at a tertiary care hospital in South India. Care indicators 
(regularity to the clinic, waiting time, and blood sugar control status) were 
assessed before down referral and after three months of follow-ups at PHCs.
RESULTS: Of 204 PwDs referred to PHCs. Among them, 88% (n = 180) registered at 
PHCs for care and 46% (n = 94, 95% CI 39.1-53.2%) were lost to follow-ups at 
PHCs. The main reason for loss to follow-ups was the unavailability of medicines 
at PHCs(n = 41, 44%). Among those who were on regular follow-ups at PHCs, there 
was no significant difference in fasting blood glucose (FBG) control status 
compared to tertiary (52%-64.6%, p = 0.083). However, there was a significant 
improvement in the regularity of clinic visits (75% vs. 100%, p < 0.001), 
consultation waiting time (90 vs. 60 min, p = 0.028), and waiting time at 
pharmacy queues (120 vs. 30 min, p < 0.001) between tertiary care and PHCs. 
However, among those registered at PHCs, only 40.6% (n = 73, 95% CI 33.3-48.1) 
were willing to continue care at PHCs for their diabetes management.
CONCLUSION: Primary care was better than tertiary care in terms of PwD's 
regularity of clinic visits and waiting time for care."
773,"The apicoplast of Plasmodium falciparum is the only source of essential 
isoprenoid precursors and Coenzyme A (CoA) in the parasite. Isoprenoid precursor

Recent reports provide important insights into the roles of FeS cofactors and 
the use of isoprenoid precursors and CoA both inside and outside the apicoplast. 
Here, we review the recent insights into the roles of these metabolites in

774,"COVID-19 with myocardial injury, defined as troponin elevation, is associated 
with worse outcomes. The temporal changes in outcomes during various phases of 
the pandemic remain unclear. We evaluated outcomes during the Omicron phase 
compared with previous phases of the pandemic. We analyzed patients who were 
COVID-19-positive with evidence of myocardial injury who presented to the 
MedStar Health system (11 hospitals in Washington, District of Columbia, and 
Maryland) during phase 1 of the pandemic (March to June 2020), phase 2 (October 
2020 to January 2021), and phase 3 (Omicron; December 2021 to March 2022), 
comparing their characteristics and outcomes. The primary end point was 
in-hospital mortality. The cohort included 2,079 patients admitted who were 
COVID-19 positive and for whom troponin was elevated (phase 1: n = 150, phase 2: 
n = 854, phase 3: n = 1,075). Baseline characteristics were similar overall. 
Inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in phase 1 compared with phases 
2 and 3. The use of remdesivir and dexamethasone was highest in phase 2. In 
phase 3, 52.6% of patients were fully vaccinated. In-hospital mortality, though 
high, was lower in phase 3 than in phases 1 and 2 (59.3% vs 28.1% vs 23.3%; p 
<0.001). Patients who were vaccinated showed more favorable in-hospital outcomes 
than did those who were unvaccinated (18.3% vs 24.2%, p = 0.042). In conclusion, 
patients with COVID-19 with elevated troponin during phase 3 tended to have 
improved outcomes when compared with patients in earlier waves of the pandemic. 
This improvement could be attributed to the implementation of the COVID-19 
vaccines, advances in COVID-19 treatment options, provider experience, and less 
virulent variants."
775,"OBJECTIVES: Adipose tissue distribution and radiodensity are associated with 
prognosis in many types of cancer. However, the roles of adipose tissue 
distribution and radiodensity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic effect 
of adiposity and adipose tissue radiodensities in patients with mCRC.
METHODS: Patients with mCRC who received first-line palliative chemotherapy and 
had a computed tomography (CT) scan at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) level, 
admitted between January 2010 and December 2018, were sequentially enrolled. 
Body composition was assessed using CT-derived measurements. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to 
determine prognostic values.
RESULTS: The study included 237 patients. Cox analyses demonstrated that high 
subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) index was associated with a lower risk for 
death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.88; Ptrend 
< 0.025). There was no significant association between visceral adipose tissue 
(VAT) index tertiles and overall survival. However, high VAT and SAT 
radiodensities were significantly associated with increased mortality (HR, 1.80; 
95% CI, 1.12-2.89; Ptrend < 0.030 and HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.19-2.86; Ptrend < 
0.021, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher SAT index in patients with mCRC was associated with a 
favorable overall survival outcome, whereas higher SAT and VAT radiodensities 
were associated with an increased risk for death, supporting that early 
nutritional intervention may improve mCRC prognosis."
776,"OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D insufficiency (blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D <50 nmol/L) is a 
global health problem. Vitamin D food fortification might be a solution, but 
knowledge is sparse on which food matrices yield the highest bioavailability. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of different food 
matrices including complex formations with whey proteins on the human 
bioavailability of vitamin D.
METHODS: In this randomized, multiple crossover trial, we enrolled 30 
postmenopausal women 60 to 80 y of age with vitamin D insufficiency. We measured 
changes in serum concentrations of vitamin D3 (D3) postprandially for 24 h in 
response to the intake of 500 mL of different food matrices with 200 µg D3 added 
compared with a control (500 mL of water). Foods included apple juice with whey 
protein isolate (WPI), apple juice, semi-skim milk, and water (with D3). The 
food matrices were provided in a randomized order with ≥10-d washout period 
between them. On each intervention day, blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 
6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 h.
RESULTS: D3 with WPI in juice did not enhance area under the curve (AUC) of 
serum D3 compared with juice without WPI (370 nmol ×  24 h/L; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 321-419 versus 357 nmol ×  24 h/L; 95% CI, 308-406 nmol ×  24 
h/L; P = 0.65). However, compared with juice, the AUC was significantly higher 
in response to the intake of D3 in milk (452 nmol ×  24 h/L; 95% CI, 402-502 
nmol ×  24 h/L) and water with D3 (479 nmol ×  24 h/L; 95% CI, 430-527 
nmol ×  24 h/L; P < 0.05). No difference was observed between milk and water 
(P = 0.34).
CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability of D3 was superior in milk and water compared 
with juice, regardless of whether WPI was added."
777,"OBJECTIVES: Individuals with prior cancer diagnosis are more likely to have low 
muscle mass (LMM) than their cancer-free counterparts. Understanding the effects 
of LMM on the prognosis of cancer survivors can be clinically important. The aim 
of this study was to investigate whether risks for all-cause and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD)-specific mortality differ by status of LMM in cancer survivors and 
a matched cohort without cancer history.
METHODS: We used cohort data from the 1999-2006 and 2011-2014 National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants included 946 adults surviving for 
≥1 since cancer diagnosis and a matched cohort (by age, sex, and race) without 
cancer history (N = 1857). LMM was defined by appendicular lean mass and body 
height (men <7.26 kg/m2, women <5.45 kg/m2). Death was ascertained via the 
National Death Index and cause of death was assessed via International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of LMM.
RESULTS: The mean age of cancer survivors and matched cohort was 60.6 y (SD 15) 
and 60.2 y (SD 14.9), respectively. The median follow-up was 10.5 y for 
survivors and 10.9 y for matched cohort. Overall, 22.2% of cancer survivors and 
19.7% of the matched cohort had LMM, respectively. In all, 321 survivors (33.9%) 
and 495 participants (26.7%) in the matched cohort died during follow-up. 
CVD-specific deaths were identified in 58 survivors (6.1%) and 122 participants 
in the matched cohort (6.6%). The multivariable Cox model suggested that LMM was 
positively associated with all-cause (aHR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.31-2.29) and 
CVD-specific (aHR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14-4.00) mortality in cancer survivors. The 
associations between LMM and risk for all-cause (aHR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.98-1.56) 
and CVD-specific (aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.75-1.93) mortality were not statistically 
significant in the matched cohort.
CONCLUSION: Cancer survivors with LMM have an increased risk for all-cause and 
CVD-specific mortality. This increase appears to be larger than that in 
counterparts without cancer history."
778,"INTRODUCTION: The patient-administered bleeding assessment tool (self-BAT) is a 
screening tool developed to identify individuals in need of work-up for bleeding 
disorders. Nonetheless, large studies on self-BAT scores on healthy individuals 
according to gender and age are lacking.
AIM: Determine cut-offs for abnormal total score of self-BAT and investigate the 
prevalence of bleeding symptoms in blood donors and individuals representative 
of the general Danish population.
METHODS: Blood donors, 15,600 children (<18 years) and 18,200 adults from the 
general Danish population, were invited to complete a Danish version of the 
self-BAT. To determine cut-offs for abnormal total self-BAT score, findings from 
healthy young children (0-11 years old), healthy adolescents (12-17 years old), 
healthy adult women and healthy adult men were used.
RESULTS: Among healthy young children (244 girls, 260 boys), healthy adolescents 
(58 girls, 83 boys), healthy women (n = 437) and healthy men (n = 278) from the 
general population, along with healthy blood donors (116 women, 176 men), the 
95th percentile for total score was two for young girls, three for young boys, 
four for adolescent girls, three for adolescent boys, eight for women and four 
for men.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the abnormal total self-BAT score is ≥3 
for girls aged 0-11 years old, ≥4 for boys aged 0-11 years old, ≥5 for girls 
aged 12-17 years old, ≥4 for boys aged 12-17 years old, ≥9 for women and ≥5 for 
men. To establish the accuracy of these cut-offs for diagnosing bleeding 
disorders, further studies are needed."
779,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines for congenital coagulopathies recommend that patients 
record treatment administrations and bleeding episodes to help healthcare 
professionals monitor the disease.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied over two years which patient profiles 
(age, treatment regimen, treatment compliance) were most likely to accept the 
use of an app to collect this information. We validated the quality of 
patient-reported data by comparing it with data obtained from hospital 
electronic records, pharmacy dispensing records and patient interview, collected 
in an access database used as a reference. Patient and professional opinions 
were solicited through open-ended interviews.
RESULTS: The app was used by 52% of 333 patients studied. Younger patients were 
the most frequent users. Patients with better treatment compliance used the app 
more, although data collection was incomplete for most patients. The best rated 
by patients were the reminders of days of administration and the minimum stock 
alerts at home. Healthcare professionals rated the app positively.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals valued the app as useful for managing 
treatment of congenital coagulopathies. Patients need support and time to use 
the app and improve the quality of the data entered. Patients who used the app 
rated it positively. The treatment compliance improved."
780,"Blood coagulation function is an essential index in clinical examination, and it 
is of great significance to evaluate blood coagulation function comprehensively. 
Based on the blood viscoelasticity theory and hydrodynamics, we proposed a 
method to monitor the whole blood coagulation process based on the reciprocating 
motion of the magnetic bead (magnetic bead method for short). We have 
established a mathematical model between the moment acting on the magnetic bead 
and the viscoelasticity of blood in the process of blood coagulation. The change 
of blood viscoelasticity acks on the magnetic bead in the form of moment 
changes, which shows that the amplitude of the motion of the magnetic bead 
varies with the change of blood viscoelasticity. Designed and verified a blood 
coagulation monitoring device based on the reciprocating movement of the 
magnetic bead and discussed the device's parameters through the orthogonal 
experiment. Lastly, the TEG5000 was used as the control group to test the 
thromboelasticity of four groups of thromboelastography quality control products 
in the same batch and 10 groups of human whole blood. It verified that our 
device has good repeatability, and has good consistency with TEG5000, it has 
particular application potential as a new blood coagulation monitoring method."
781,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse is one of the most common and significant 
adverse events following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(allo-HCT). Downregulation of major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) surface 
expression on AML blasts may represent a mechanism of escape from the 
graft-versus-malignancy effect and facilitate relapse. We hypothesized that 
T-cell immunotherapies targeting AML antigens would upregulate MHC-II surface 
expression via localized release of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), a protein known to 
upregulate MHC-II expression via JAK-STAT signaling. We demonstrate that 
flotetuzumab (FLZ), a CD123xCD3 bispecific DART® molecule, and chimeric antigen 
receptor expressing T-cells (CAR-T) targeting CD123, CD33, or CD371 upregulate 
MHC-II surface expression in vitro on a THP-1 AML cell line with intermediate 
MHC-II expression and four primary AML samples from patients relapsing after HCT 
with low MHC-II expression. We additionally show that FLZ upregulates MHC-II 
expression in a patient-derived xenograft model and in relapsed/refractory AML 
patients treated with flotetuzumab in a clinical trial. Finally, we report that 
FLZ-induced MHC-II upregulation is mediated by IFN-γ. In conclusion, we provide 
evidence that T-cell immunotherapies targeting relapsed AML can kill AML via 
both MHC-independent mechanisms and by an MHC-dependent mechanism through local 
release of IFN-γ and subsequent upregulation of MHC-II expression."
782,"INTRODUCTION: Autophagy is a highly conservative self-degradative process. It 
aims at elimination-impaired proteins and cellular organelles. Previous research 
confirmed the autophagy role in cancer pathogenesis.
AREAS COVERED: This article discusses the role of autophagy in the development 
of AML. Autophagy seems to be a 'double-sword' mechanism, hence, either its 
suppression or induction could promote neoplasm growth. This mechanism could 
also be the aim of the 'molecular targeted therapy'. Chemo- and radiotherapy 
induce cellular stress in neoplasm cells with subsequent autophagy suppression. 
Simultaneously, it is claimed that the autophagy suppression increases 
chemosensitivity 'in neoplastic cells. Some agents, like bortezomib, in turn 
could promote autophagy process, e.g., in AML (acute myeloid leukemia). However, 
currently there are not many studies focusing on the role of autophagy in 
patients suffering for AML. In this review, we summarize the research done so 
far on the role of autophagy in the development of AML.
EXPERT OPINION: The analysis of autophagy genes expression profiling in AML 
could be a relevant factor in the diagnostic process and treatment 
'individualization'. Autophagy modulation seems to be a relevant target in the 
oncological therapy - it could limit disease progression and increase the 
effectiveness of treatment."
783,"TNF mediates a variety of biological processes including cellular proliferation, 
inflammatory responses, and cell death and is therefore associated with numerous 
pathologies including autoinflammatory diseases and septic shock. The 
inflammatory and cell death responses to TNF have been studied extensively 
downstream of TNF-R1 and are believed to rely on the formation of 
proinflammatory complex I and prodeath complex II, respectively. We recently 
identified a similar multimeric complex downstream of TLR4, termed the 
TRIFosome, that regulates inflammation and cell death in response to LPS or 
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. We present evidence of a role for the TRIFosome 
downstream of TNF-R1, independent of TLR3 or TLR4 engagement. Specifically, 
TNF-induced cell death and inflammation in murine macrophages were driven by the 
TLR4 adaptor TRIF and the LPS co-receptor CD14, highlighting an important role 
for these proteins beyond TLR-mediated immune responses. Via immunoprecipitation 
and visualization of TRIF-specific puncta, we demonstrated TRIF- and 
CD14-dependent formation of prodeath and proinflammatory complexes in response 
to TNF. Extending these findings, in a murine TNF-induced sepsis model, TRIF and 
CD14 deficiency decreased systemic inflammation, reduced organ pathology, and 
improved survival. The outcome of TRIF activation was cell specific, because 
TNF-induced lethality was mediated by neutrophils and macrophages responding to 
TNF in a TRIF-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that in addition to their 
crucial role in TNF production, myeloid cells are central to TNF toxicity and 
position TRIF and CD14 as universal components of receptor-mediated immune 
responses."
784,"Treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) requires lifelong daily therapy. 
However, suboptimal adherence to the existing daily therapy has led to the need 
for ultralong-acting antivirals. A lipophilic and hydrophobic ProTide was made 
by replacing the alanyl isopropyl ester present in tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 
with a docosyl phenyl alanyl ester, now referred to as M1TFV. NM1TFV and 
nanoformulated TAF (NTAF) nanocrystals were formulated by high-pressure 
homogenization. A single intramuscular injection of NM1TFV, but not NTAF, 
delivered at a dose of TFV equivalents (168 milligrams per kilogram) 
demonstrated monthslong antiviral activities in both HBV-transgenic and human 
hepatocyte transplanted TK-NOG mice. The suppression of HBV DNA in blood was 
maintained for 3 months. Laboratory experiments on HBV-transfected HepG2.2.15 
cells affirmed the animal results and the critical role of docosanol in the 
sustained NM1TFV antiviral responses. These results provide clear ""proof of 
concept"" toward an emerging therapeutic paradigm for the treatment and 
prevention of HBV infection."
785,"Translation control is essential in balancing hematopoietic precursors and 
differentiation; however, the mechanisms underlying this program are poorly 
understood. We found that the activity of the major cap-binding protein eIF4E is 
unexpectedly regulated in a dynamic manner throughout erythropoiesis that is 
uncoupled from global protein synthesis rates. Moreover, eIF4E activity directs 
erythroid maturation, and increased eIF4E expression maintains cells in an early 
erythroid state associated with a translation program driving the expression of 
PTPN6 and Igf2bp1. A cytosine-enriched motif in the 5' untranslated region is 
important for eIF4E-mediated translation specificity. Therefore, selective 
translation of key target genes necessary for the maintenance of early erythroid 
states by eIF4E highlights a unique mechanism used by hematopoietic precursors 
to rapidly elicit erythropoietic maturation upon need."
786,"This article is part of the Dendritic Cell Guidelines article series, which 
provides a collection of state-of-the-art protocols for the preparation, 
phenotype analysis by flow cytometry, generation, fluorescence microscopy, and 
functional characterization of mouse and human dendritic cells (DC) from 
lymphoid organs and various non-lymphoid tissues. Within this article, detailed 
protocols are presented that allow for the generation of single cell suspensions 
from human lymphohematopoietic tissues including blood, spleen, thymus, and 
tonsils with a focus on the subsequent analysis of DC via flow cytometry, as 
well as flow cytometric cell sorting of primary human DC. Further, prepared 
single cell suspensions as well as cell sorter-purified DC can be subjected to 
other applications including cellular enrichment procedures, RNA sequencing, 
functional assays, and many more. While all protocols were written by 
experienced scientists who routinely use them in their work, this article was 
also peer-reviewed by leading experts and approved by all co-authors, making it 
an essential resource for basic and clinical DC immunologists."
787,"OBJECTIVE: To assess exposure to and infection with 3 pathogens (Rickettsia 
rickettsii, Anaplasma platys, and Ehrlichia canis) vectored by brown dog ticks 
(Rhipicephalus sanguineus) in sheltered dogs at the western US-Mexico border.
ANIMALS: 239 dogs in shelters in San Diego and Imperial counties, US, and 
Mexicali and Tijuana, Mexico.
PROCEDURES: Each dog had blood drawn and basic demographic data collected. PCR 
was performed to determine active infection with Rickettsia spp, E canis, and A 
platys. Serology was performed to determine exposure to Rickettsia, Anaplasma, 
and Ehrlichia species.
RESULTS: 2 of 78 (2.6%) dogs sampled in Tijuana were actively infected with R 
rickettsii. A single brown dog tick collected from a dog in Tijuana was 
PCR-positive for R rickettsii. Infection with E canis and A platys ranged across 
shelters from 0% to 27% and 0% to 33%, respectively. Dogs in all 4 locations 
demonstrated exposure to all 3 pathogens, though Rickettsia and Ehrlichia 
seropositivity was highest in Mexicali (81% and 49%, respectively) and Anaplasma 
seropositivity was highest in Tijuana (45%).
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While infection and exposure were highest in sheltered dogs 
in the southern locations, dogs in all locations demonstrated exposure to all 
pathogens, demonstrating the potential for emergence and spread of zoonotic 
pathogens with significant public health consequences in southern California and 
northern Baja California. In addition, veterinarians and shelter staff should be 
aware that Ehrlichia or Anaplasma infection may co-occur with Rocky Mountain 
spotted fever, which is a human health risk."
788,"In peripheral blood, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) contains circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA), which indicates molecular abnormalities in metastatic breast tumor 
tissue. The sequencing of cfDNA of Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients 
allows assessment of therapy response and noninvasive treatment. In the proposed 
study, clinically significant alterations in PIK3CA and TP53 genes associated 
with MBC resulting in a missense substitution of His1047Arg and Arg282Trp from 
an next-generation sequencing-based multi-gene panel were reported in a cfDNA of 
a patient with MBC. To investigate the impact of the reported mutation, we used 
molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, network analysis, and pathway 
analysis. Molecular Docking analysis determined the distinct binding pattern 
revealing H1047R-ATP complex has a higher number of Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and 
binding affinity with a slight difference compared to the PIK3CA-ATP complex. 
Following, molecular dynamics simulation for 200 ns, of which H1047R-ATP complex 
resulted in the instability of PIK3CA. Similarly, for TP53 mutant R282W, the 
zinc-free state (apo) and zinc-bounded (holo) complexes were investigated for 
conformational change between apo and holo complexes, of which the holo complex 
mutant R282W was unstable. To validate the conformational change of PIK3CA and 
TP53, 80% mutation of H1047R in the kinase domain of p110α expressed 
ubiquitously in PIK3CA protein that alters PI3K pathway, while R282W mutation in 
DNA binding helix (H2) region of P53 protein inhibits the transcription factor 
in P53 pathway causing MBC. According to our findings, the extrinsic (hypoxia, 
oxidative stress, and acidosis); intrinsic factors (MYC amplification) in PIK3CA 
and TP53 mutations will provide potential insights for developing novel 
therapeutic methods for MBC therapy."
789,"The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the primary pacemaker of the heart. Normal SAN 
function is crucial in maintaining proper cardiac rhythm and contraction. Sinus 
node dysfunction (SND) is due to abnormalities within the SAN which can affect 
the heartbeat frequency, regularity, and the propagation of electrical pulses 
through the cardiac conduction system. As a result, SND often increases the risk 
of cardiac arrhythmias. SND is most commonly seen as a disease of the elderly 
given the role of degenerative fibrosis as well as other age-dependent changes 
in its pathogenesis. Despite the prevalence of SND, current treatment is limited 
to pacemaker implantation, which is associated with substantial medical costs 
and complications. Emerging evidence has identified various genetic 
abnormalities that can cause SND, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings 
of SND. Identification of these molecular mechanisms and pathways implicated in 
the pathogenesis of SND is hoped to identify novel therapeutic targets for the 
development of more effective therapies for this disease. In this review 
article, we examine the anatomy of the SAN and the pathophysiology and 
epidemiology of SND. We then discuss in detail the most common genetic mutations 
correlated with SND and provide our perspectives on future research and 
therapeutic opportunities in this field."
790,"The use of digital image analysis and count regression models contributes to the 
reproducibility and rigor of histological studies in cardiovascular research. 
The use of formalized computer-based quantification strategies of histological 
images essentially removes potential researcher bias, allows for higher analysis 
throughput, and enables easy sharing of formalized quantification tools, 
contributing to research transparency and data transferability. Moreover, the 
use of count regression models rather than ratios in statistical analysis of 
cell population data incorporates the extent of sampling into analysis and 
acknowledges the non-gaussian nature of count distributions. Using 
quantification of proliferating cardiomyocytes in embryonic murine hearts as an 
example, we describe how these improvements can be implemented using open-source 
artificial intelligence-based image analysis tools and novel count regression 
models to efficiently analyze real-life data."
791,"Diabetes increases the risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Greater 
hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after stroke is associated with vasoregression 
and cognitive decline in male diabetic rats. Iron chelator deferoxamine (DFX) 
prevents vasoregression and improves outcomes. While diabetic female rats 
develop greater HT, its impact on post-stroke cerebrovascularization and 
cognitive outcomes remained unknown. We hypothesized that diabetes mediates 
pathological neovascularization, and DFX attenuates post-stroke cerebrovascular 
remodeling and improves neurological outcomes in female diabetic rats. Female 
control and diabetic animals were treated with DFX or vehicle for 7 days after 
stroke. Vascular indices, microglial activation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
integrity were evaluated on Day 14. Results from diabetic female rats were 
partially compared to our previously published findings in male counterparts. 
Hemin-induced programmed cell death was studied in male and female brain 
microvascular endothelial cell lines (BMVEC). There was no vasoregression after 
stroke in either control or diabetic female animals. DFX prevented 
diabetes-mediated gliovascular remodeling and compromised BBB integrity while 
improving memory function in diabetes. Comparisons of female and male rats 
indicated sex differences in cognitive and vascular outcomes. Hemin mediated 
ferroptosis in both male and female BMVECs. DFX improved survival but had 
differential effects on ferroptosis signaling in female and male cells. These 
results suggest that stroke and associated HT do not affect 
cerebrovascularization in diabetic female rats, but iron chelation may provide a 
novel therapeutic strategy in the prevention of post-stroke memory impairment in 
females with diabetes via the preservation of gliovascular integrity and 
improvement of endothelial cell survival."
792,"Welding and cutting of metals produce large amounts of particulate matter (PM), 
which poses a significant health risk to exposed workers. Appropriate biological 
markers to estimate exposure are of great interest for occupational health and 
safety. Here, hair and nail samples from metal workers were analyzed, which 
appear to be more suitable than blood or urine samples for assessing long-term 
exposure. Four workshops working with steel components were included in the 
study. The hair and nail samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma 
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to measure the concentrations of 12 elements. At the 
workplaces, the concentrations of 15 elements in particulate matter were 
determined using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and particle-induced X-ray emission 
(PIXE) techniques. The hair and nail samples of the workers contained 
significantly higher metal concentrations than the analytical results of a 
nonexposed control group. The most significant difference between the groups was 
found for Ti, Mn, Fe, and Co."
793,"PURPOSE: The impact of mild subclinical hypothyroidism on pregnancy outcomes in 
TPOAb-negative women is poorly explored. The aim of the present study was the 
evaluation in a wide cohort of TPOAb-negative pregnant women the role of 
subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) on several pregnancy outcomes.
METHODS: The study included women aged ≥ 18 years with a singleton pregnancy 
without known thyroid disease with serum TSH concentration between 0.4 and 10 
mIU/L and TPOAb negative. Data about clinical and demographic features were 
collected. A blood sample was drown to test TSH, TPOAb, ANA and ENA 
concentration. The mean uterine artery pulsatility index was measured. Risk of 
adverse obstetric and fetal outcomes was collected.
RESULTS: The cohort included 2135 pregnant women. Pregnant women with TSH 4-10 
mUI/L had a significantly higher frequency of family history of thyroid 
diseases, and personal history of celiac disease diseases, type 1 diabetes 
mellitus, rheumatic disease, antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-extractable 
nuclear antigen (ENA) positive tests. The risk for pre-eclampsia and small for 
gestational age (SGA) was significantly higher in pregnant women with 
first-trimester TSH 4-10 mIU/L. A first-trimester TSH serum level greater than 4 
mIU/L was associated with a significant increase in the occurrence of abnormal 
uterine artery pulsatility index, with a more than threefold increase in the 
risk of developing pre-eclampsia and with the risk of SGA.
CONCLUSIONS: In TPOAb-negative pregnant women, a first-trimester serum TSH level 
ranging from 4 to 10 mIU/L is significantly and independently linked to an 
increased uterine artery pulsatility index as well as to negative pregnancy 
outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, SGA and gestational diabetes."
794,"We aimed to investigate the relationship of dietary zinc intake with new-onset 
hypertension among Chinese adults. A total of 12,177 participants who were free 
of hypertension at baseline from the China Health and Nutrition Survey were 
included. Dietary intake was assessed by three consecutive 24-h dietary recalls 
combined with a household food inventory. Participants with systolic blood 
pressure ≽ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≽ 90 mmHg or diagnosed by a 
physician or under antihypertensive treatment during the follow-up were defined 
as having new-onset hypertension. During a median follow-up duration of 6.1 
years, 4269 participants developed new-onset hypertension. Overall, the 
association between dietary zinc intake and new-onset hypertension followed a 
J-shape (P for non-linearity < 0.001). The risk of new-onset hypertension 
significantly decreased with the increment of dietary zinc intake (per mg/day: 
hazard ratio (HR) 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-0.98) in participants 
with zinc intake < 10.9 mg/day, and increased with the increment of zinc intake 
(per mg/day: HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.11-1.16) in participants with zinc intake ≽ 10.9 
mg/day. In conclusion, there was a J-shaped association between dietary zinc 
intake and new-onset hypertension in general Chinese adults, with an inflection 
point at about 10.9 mg/day."
795,"Infertility is experienced by 8%-12% of adults in their reproductive period 
globally and has become a prevalent concern. Besides routine therapeutic 
methods, stem cells are rapidly being examined as viable alternative therapies 
in regenerative medicine and translational investigation. Remarkable progress 
has been made in understanding the biology and purpose of stem cells. The 
affected pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are 
further studied for their possible use in reproductive medicine, particularly 
for infertility induced by premature ovarian insufficiency and azoospermia. 
Accordingly, this study discusses current developments in the use of some kinds 
of MSCs such as adipose-derived stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells, umbilical 
cord MSCs, and menstrual blood MSCs. These methods have been used to manage 
ovarian and uterine disorders, and each technique presents a novel method for 
the therapy of infertility."
796,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic 
myeloproliferative disorder that accounts for 20% of all leukemias of adults. 
The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (imatinib, bosutinib, 
dasatinib, nilotinib, ponatinib) has yielded significant benefits for patients 
with CML in terms of survival and quality of life. This real-world analysis 
evaluated the economic burden for managing patients with CML in 2nd or ≥ 3rd TKI 
lines in Italian settings of clinical practice.
METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis was performed exploiting the 
administrative databases of a sample of entities covering around 15 million 
inhabitants. From 2015 to 2018, the study included adult patients with at least 
one prescription for TKIs, (and for some TKI with at least one hospitalization 
discharge diagnosis for CML, or at least one prescription for BCR-ABL 
examination). The index date was the first TKI prescription. Healthcare resource 
consumption and costs for patients with CML in 2nd and ≥ 3rd line treatment with 
TKIs were analyzed for drug prescriptions, hospitalizations, specialist visits, 
and diagnostic services.
RESULTS: In total 635 patients were included, 491 in 2nd line and 144 in 3rd 
line with TKIs. Dasatinib was the most frequently prescribed drug in 2nd line 
(28.9%) and imatinib in later lines (26.4%). With progressing lines of 
treatment, healthcare consumption showed a trend towards increased non-TKI 
prescriptions per patient (8 for 2nd line and 9.7 for ≥ 3rd line). The 
management of patients with CML in later lines resulted in increased overall 
healthcare burden, with hospitalizations accounting for about half of total 
expenditure, whatever the treatment line and type of TKI.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis in Italian real-life clinical practice reported 
economic expenditure for patients with CML in 2nd or ≥ 3rd lines with TKIs, 
mostly burdened by hospitalizations. Such clinical complexity suggests that 
further efforts are needed to improve the therapeutic management of later lines 
of CML."
797,"BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammatory response could affect many systems. Cardiac 
dysfunction develops due to cardiovascular system damage and could be mortal. 
Selenium is a trace element that can be used as a dietary supplement and has 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. This study aims 
to evaluate the protective effects of selenium on cardiovascular damage via 
silenced information regulator 1 (SIRT1)/p53 and cytochrome C (Cyt-c)/ caspase-3 
(Cas-3) pathways.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into 4 groups as 
control, LPS (0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally(i.p.), 2-7 days) and LPS + Selenium 
(LPS-0.1 mg/kg, i.p., 2-7 days, selenium - 100 µg/kg, i.p., 1-7 days) and 
selenium (100 µg/kg, i.p., 1-7 days) group. On the 8th day of the experiment, 
rats were sacrificed. Blood samples and half of the left ventricles were 
collected for biochemical and genetic analysis. The remaining left ventricles 
and aorta were taken for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. In the 
LPS group myocardial hemorrhages, hyperemia, and endothelial cell loss were 
observed. Also, Cas-3 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expressions; 
creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α), ischemia modified albumin (IMA), total oxidant status 
(TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) levels; p53, Cyt-c, Cas-3 mRNA expressions 
increased while total antioxidant status (TAS) levels, glutathione peroxidase 
(GPx) activity, SIRT1 mRNA expression decreased. Selenium treatment reversed all 
these changes.
CONCLUSION: Selenium showed protective effects on cardiovascular injury via 
regulating SIRT1/p53 and Cyt-c/Cas-3 pathways. This study enlightened the 
possible usage of selenium on cardiotoxicity."
798,"BACKGROUND: TMS-007, an SMTP family member, modulates plasminogen conformation 
and enhances plasminogen-fibrin binding, leading to promotion of endogenous 
fibrinolysis. Its anti-inflammatory action, mediated by soluble epoxide 
hydrolase inhibition, may contribute to its efficacy. Evidence suggests that 
TMS-007 can effectively treat experimental thrombotic and embolic strokes with a 
wide time window, while reducing hemorrhagic transformation.
AIMS: To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of TMS-007 
in healthy volunteers.
METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, dose-escalation study, 
administered as a single intravenous infusion of TMS-007 in cohorts of healthy 
male Japanese subjects. Six cohorts were planned, but five were completed. In 
each cohort (n = 8), individuals were randomized to receive one of five doses of 
TMS-007 (3, 15, 60, 180, or 360 mg; n = 6) or placebo (n = 2).
RESULTS: TMS-007 was generally well tolerated, and no serious adverse events 
were attributed to the drug. A linear dose-dependency was observed for plasma 
TMS-007 levels. No symptoms of bleeding were observed on brain MRI analysis, and 
no bleeding-related responses were found on laboratory testing. The plasma 
levels of the coagulation factor fibrinogen and the anti-fibrinolysis factor α2 
-antiplasmin levels were unchanged after TMS-007 dosing. A slight increase in 
the plasma level of plasmin-α2 -antiplasmin complex, an index of plasmin 
formation, was observed in the TMS-007 group in cohort 2.
CONCLUSIONS: TMS-007 is generally well tolerated and exhibits favorable 
pharmacokinetic profiles that warrant further clinical development."
799,"PURPOSE: Lisdexamfetamine (LDX), which is used for the treatment of 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, is composed of L-lysine 
attached to dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine). In this article, we report a 
forensic autopsy case in which prescription drugs were unknown at autopsy. While 
amphetamine was detected, methamphetamine could not be detected by liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in any of samples collected. 
Thus, we aimed to quantify LDX concentrations in autopsy samples and to prove 
that the amphetamine detected in this case was due to metabolized LDX.
METHODS: Femoral vein blood, cardiac whole blood, urine, and gastric content 
samples were taken at autopsy for toxicological analysis. Qualitative and 
quantitative analyses were performed using LC-MS/MS. In addition, optical isomer 
separation for the amphetamine detected was conducted. The stability of LDX in 
whole blood and urine was also examined at three different temperatures.
RESULTS: The concentrations of LDX were < 4.00, 30.9, and 4.42 ng/mL in whole 
blood, urine, and gastric content samples, respectively. The concentrations of 
amphetamine were 329, 510, 2970, and 915 ng/mL in femoral vein blood, heart 
whole blood, urine, and gastric contents, respectively. The amphetamine detected 
in this case was identified to be only d-amphetamine by optical isomer 
separation. The d-amphetamine detected was considered to be derived from LDX. 
Stability experiments revealed that LDX in whole blood decreased at ambient 
temperature.
CONCLUSIONS: The results in the present case report may be useful in 
interpreting whether or not the amphetamine detected in a cadaver is a 
metabolite of LDX."
800,"Campylobacter fetus is a gram-negative motile bacterium, with two subspecies 
relevant to cattle health: C. fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv) and C. fetus subsp. 
fetus (Cff). Both subspecies are associated with reproductive losses in cattle. 
In this study, we evaluated the identification of C. fetus for the diagnosis of 
bovine campylobacteriosis through bacteriological culture, direct 
immunofluorescence (DIF) and molecular tests in preputial smegma (PS) samples of 
three Angus bulls challenged with Cfv, Cfv biovar intermedius (Cfvi) or Cff, 
respectively, in an experiment imitating the natural infection. Two DNA 
extraction protocols were tested (in-house thermal extraction and commercial 
kit). Aspiration and scraping collection for PS were compared by conventional 
tests. Additionally, bacteremia was also evaluated in blood samples. Bulls were 
challenged by natural mating with heifers that had been experimentally infected 
with C. fetus subspecies; which led to infection. The Cfv- and Cfvi-bulls were 
positive for at least 9 months. Although Cff is not considered a venereal 
strain, in this study it was transmissible to bull from heifers experimentally 
infected, as evidenced by its colonization and persistence in the preputial 
cavity for 5 to 6 months. This finding suggests a potential risk of 
dissemination within herds. The results obtained by bacteriological culture or 
direct immunofluorescence (DIF) showed no significant differences, regardless 
the sampling device used (aspiration with Cassou pipette, metal and plastic 
scraper). C. fetus qPCR, on the other hand, yielded better results with an 
in-house DNA extraction method than with a commercial kit (75% vs 66.6%). 
Furthermore, qPCR diagnosis was more efficient than culture (66.6%) or DIF 
(56%). Bacteremia in whole blood samples was negative by qPCR and 
bacteriological culture in all samples. Altogether, this study demonstrated the 
transmission of Cff from heifers to bull and also showed that PCR-based methods 
are promising for the diagnosis of Bovine Genital Campylobacteriosis from 
clinical samples of PS."
801,"PURPOSE: CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) combined with endocrine therapy have 
improved HR + /HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC) outcomes. However, it is 
still unclear whether the response to CDK4/6i is similar for all races. 
Therefore, we aimed to assess overall survival (OS) trends stratified by race in 
patients with HR + /HER2- MBC after the approval of CDK4/6i, as part of the 
standard of care, in 2015.
METHODS: We performed a population-based study using the SEER database. Patients 
with HR + /HER2- MBC were divided into two time-based cohorts: 1) pre-CDK4/6i 
era (diagnosed in 2011-2013) and 2) post-CDK4/6i era (diagnosed in 2015-2017). 
We used propensity score matching and identified 2,684 patients in each cohort 
that matched in several characteristics. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to 
estimate 2-year OS. Association between cohort and OS was evaluated using 
marginal Cox proportional hazards models with robust sandwich variance 
estimator. We conducted competing risk analysis to estimate the risk of breast 
cancer death in both cohorts.
RESULTS: The 2-year OS rate was 65% for the post-CDK4/6i era and 62% for the 
pre-CDK4/6i era (stratified log-rank p = 0.025). The 2-year OS for non-Hispanic 
White (NHW) patients improved in the post-CDK4/6i era compared to the 
pre-CDK4/6i era (67% vs. 63%, p = 0.033). However, OS did not improve for 
non-Hispanic Black (NHB) (54% vs. 54%, p = 0.876) or Hispanic (67% vs. 65%, 
p = 0.617) groups. The risk of breast cancer death decreased in the post-CDK4/6i 
era as compared to the pre-CDK4/6i era (2-year risk of breast cancer death: 33% 
vs. 30%, p = 0.015); however, this effect was observed only in NHW (sHR 0.84, 
p = 0.005) women, but not in NHB (sHR 0.94, p = 0.630) or Hispanic (sHR 0.91, 
p = 0.550) women.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that outcomes for HR + /HER2- MBC have improved 
after CDK4/6i were introduced in 2015. However, this effect is primarily driven 
by the improved OS in NHW patients, without significant improvement in OS in NHB 
or Hispanics."
802,"Rebleeding before intervention is a devastating complication of aneurysmal 
subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH). It often occurs early and is associated with 
poor outcomes. We present a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify 
potential predictors of rebleeding in aSAH. A database search identified studies 
detailing the occurrence of pre-intervention rebleeding in aSAH, and 809 studies 
were screened. The association between rebleeding and a variety of demographic, 
clinical, and radiological factors was examined using random effects 
meta-analyses. Fifty-six studies totalling 33,268 patients were included. 
Rebleeding occurred in 3,223/33,268 patients (11.1%, 95%CI 9.4-13), with risk 
decreasing by approximately 0.2% per year since 1981. Systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) during admission was higher in patients who rebled compared with those who 
did not (MD 7.4 mmHg, 95%CI 2.2 - 12.7), with increased risk in cohorts with 
SBP > 160 mmHg (RR 2.12, 95%CI 1.35-3.34), but not SBP > 140 mmHg. WFNS Grades 
IV-V (RR 2.05, 95%CI 1.13-3.74) and Hunt-Hess grades III-V (RR 2.12, 95%CI 
1.38-3.28) were strongly associated with rebleeding. Fisher grades IV (RR 2.24, 
95%CI 1.45-3.49) and III-IV (RR 2.05, 95%CI 1.17-3.6) were also associated with 
an increased risk. Awareness of potential risk factors for rebleeding is 
important when assessing patients with aSAH to ensure timely management in 
high-risk cases. Increased SBP during admission, especially > 160 mmHg, poorer 
clinical grades, and higher radiological grades are associated with an increased 
risk. These results may also aid in designing future studies assessing 
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of rebleeding."
803,"Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a common haemorrhage control agent in both emergency 
department (ED) settings and intra-operatively. While efficacy and potential 
harms are well-studied, there are no overviews of reviews completed on TXA 
efficacy in the ED setting. We set out to provide an overview of systematic 
reviews on TXA efficacy in trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and subarachnoid 
haemorrhage in the ED setting, with outcomes including short and long-term 
mortality, thromboembolic (TE) events, and whether bleeding continued. Our 
review is guided by the PRIOR statement. We searched Pubmed, Medline, and EMBASE 
using broad search terms for systematic reviews, and calculated pooled 
relative-risk ratios using random and fixed-effects modelling from these 
studies. A risk-of-bias assessment was also completed for each review. We 
identified 13 systematic reviews for inclusion, with a variety of different 
outcomes. We identified improvements in 24-h mortality for trauma (RR 0.88, 95% 
CI 0.84-0.92) and gastrointestinal bleeds (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23-0.39), and 
decreased long-term gastrointestinal bleed mortality (RR 0.57, 95% CI 
0.48-0.69). We also identified an increase in TE risk in gastrointestinal 
bleeding scenarios (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09-1.94), but no other clinical scenarios. 
TXA is effective in reducing mortality following trauma and gastrointestinal 
bleeds, however, there is limited evidence at this time to support TXA 
administration in the context of subarachnoid haemorrhage. TE risk is elevated 
when used in gastrointestinal bleeds. Selective use in high-risk patients may be 
warranted. TXA should strongly be considered in management in ED and prehospital 
settings."
804,"This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of bovine gammaherpesvirus 4 
(BoHV-4) among healthy cattle and buffaloes as well as those associated with 
different diseases (respiratory tract infection, mastitis and reproductive tract 
infection) in District Chakwal, Pakistan. Blood, swab and milk samples of cattle 
and buffaloes were randomly collected from different areas of Chakwal. DNA was 
isolated from the samples and subjected to nested PCR using thymidine kinase 
gene primers. Out of 300 samples (200 blood, 50 swab and 50 milk samples) from 
both species (cattle and buffalo), an overall prevalence of BoHV-4 of 3.33% was 
obtained. Samples from cattle showed a higher species-specific prevalence 
(4.16%) than samples from buffalo (2.78%). One sample out of 50 swab samples and 
1 out of 50 milk samples were also positive for BoHV-4. DNA sequencing of a 
positive PCR product from cattle confirmed that the sequence was from the 
thymidine kinase gene of BoHV-4. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed close 
similarities with other BOHV-4 thymidine kinase sequences. To detect BoHV-4 
antibodies, an indirect ELISA was also performed. Two hundred blood samples were 
also collected from the same animals in nonanticoagulant-containing tubes for 
the isolation of serum and were subjected to indirect ELISA. Sixteen samples 
(8%) were positive for BoHV-4 antibodies. This study will be useful in further 
diagnoses of BoHV-4 in Pakistan and in devising measures to control the spread 
of BoHV-4."
805,"A few protein kinases and phosphatases regulate tau protein phosphorylation and 
an imbalance in their enzyme activity results in tau hyper-phosphorylation. 
Aberrant tau phosphorylation causes tau to dissociate from the microtubules and 
clump together in the cytosol to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which lead 
to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and other tauopathies. Hence, targeting hyperphosphorylated tau protein is 
a restorative approach for treating neurodegenerative tauopathies. The 
cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk5) and the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β) have 
both been implicated in aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation. The limited transport 
of drugs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for reaching the central nervous 
system (CNS) thus represents a significant problem in the development of drugs. 
Drug delivery systems based on nanocarriers help solve this problem. In this 
review, we discuss the tau protein, regulation of tau phosphorylation and 
abnormal hyperphosphorylation, drugs in use or under clinical trials, and 
treatment strategies for tauopathies based on the critical role of tau 
hyperphosphorylation in the pathogenesis of the disease. Pathology of 
neurodegenerative disease due to hyperphosphorylation and various therapeutic 
approaches including nanotechnology for its treatment."
806,"INTRODUCTION: Metformin may provide a therapeutic benefit in different types of 
malignancy.
PURPOSE: We aimed at evaluating the effect of metformin as an adjuvant therapy 
to letrozole on estradiol and other biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of 
breast cancer in overweight and obese postmenopausal women.
METHODS: Seventy-five postmenopausal stages II-III breast cancer female patients 
were assessed for eligibility in an open-labeled parallel pilot study. 
Forty-five patients met the inclusion criteria and were assigned into three 
arms: the lean arm (n = 15) women who received letrozole 2.5 mg/day, the control 
arm (n = 15) overweight/obese women who received letrozole 2.5 mg/day, and the 
metformin arm (n = 15) overweight/obese women who received letrozole 2.5 mg/day 
plus metformin (2000 ± 500 mg/day). The intervention duration was 6 months. 
Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 6 months after intervention for the 
measurement of serum estradiol, leptin, osteocalcin levels, fasting blood 
glucose concentration, and serum insulin.
RESULTS: After the intervention and as compared to the control arm, the 
metformin arm showed a significantly lower ratio to the baseline (significant 
reduction) for estradiol (p = 0.0433), leptin (p < 0.0001), fasting blood 
glucose (p = 0.0128), insulin (p = 0.0360), osteocalcin serum levels 
(p < 0.0001), and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance 
""HOMA-IR"" value (p = 0.0145). There was a non-significant variation in the 
lactate ratio to the baseline among the three study arms (p = 0.5298).
CONCLUSION: Metformin may exert anti-cancer activity by decreasing the 
circulating estradiol, leptin, and insulin. Metformin might represent a safe and 
promising adjuvant therapy to letrozole in overweight/obese postmenopausal women 
with breast cancer.

807,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) 
susceptibility in a cohort of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis (MS) patients 
and to evaluate possible correlations between NAWM susceptibility and disability 
progression.
METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with a diagnosis of MS (n = 53) or clinically 
isolated syndrome (CIS) (n = 6) were recruited and followed up. All participants 
underwent neurological examination, blood sampling for serum neurofilament light 
chain (sNfL) level assessment, lumbar puncture for the quantification of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid1-42 (Aβ) levels, and brain MRI. T2-weighted 
scans were used to quantify white matter (WM) lesion loads. For each scan, we 
derived the NAWM volume fraction and the WM lesion volume fraction. Quantitative 
susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the NAWM was calculated using the susceptibility 
tensor imaging (STI) suite. Susceptibility maps were computed with the STAR 
algorithm.
RESULTS: Primary progressive patients (n = 9) showed a higher mean 
susceptibility value in the NAWM than relapsing-remitting (n = 44) and CIS (n = 
6) (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02). Patients with a higher susceptibility in the NAWM 
showed increased sNfL concentration (ρ = 0.38, p = 0.004) and lower CSF Aβ 
levels (ρ = -0.34, p = 0.009). Mean NAWM susceptibility turned out to be a 
predictor of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) worsening at follow-up 
(β = 0.41, t = 2.66, p = 0.01) and of the MS severity scale (MSSS) (β = 0.38, t 
= 2.43, p = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: QSM in the NAWM seems to predict the EDSS increment over time. This 
finding might provide evidence on the role of QSM in identifying patients with 
an increased risk of early disability progression.
KEY POINTS: • NAWM-QSM is higher in PPMS patients than in RRMS. • NAWM-QSM seems 
to be a predictor of EDSS worsening over time. • Patients with higher NAWM-QSM 
show increased sNfL concentration and lower CSF Aβ levels."
808,"OBJECTIVES: Myocardial flow reserve (MFR), derived from ammonia N-13 positron 
emission tomography (NH3-PET), can predict the prognosis of patients with 
various heart diseases. We aimed to investigate whether myocardial strain ratio 
(MSR) was useful in predicting MACE and allowed for further risk stratification 
of cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) in 
addition to MFR.
METHODS: Ninety-five patients underwent NH3-PET because of IHD. MFR was 
determined as the ratio of hyperemic to resting myocardial blood flow (MBF). MSR 
was defined as the ratio of strains at stress and rest. The endpoint was major 
adverse cardiac events (MACE), including all-cause death, acute coronary 
syndrome, heart failure hospitalization, and revascularization. The ability to 
predict MACE was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analysis, and the predictability of ME was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. 
The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the hazard 
ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: The ROC curve analysis demonstrated a cutoff of 0.93 for MACE with MSR 
(sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 71%, respectively). Patients with MSR < 
0.93 displayed a significantly higher MACE rate than those with MSR ≥ 0.93 (p = 
0.0036). The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that MSR was 
an independent marker that could predict MACE in imaging and clinical parameters 
(HR, 7.32; 95% CI: 1.59-33.7, p = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: MSR was an independent predictor of MACE and was useful for further 
risk stratification in IHD. MSR has the potential for a new indicator of 
revascularization in patients with IHD.
KEY POINTS: • We hypothesized that combining myocardial flow reserve (MFR) with 
the myocardial strain ratio (MSR) obtained by applying the feature-tracking 
technique to ammonia N-13 PET would make it predictive of major adverse cardiac 
events (MACE) compared to MFR alone. • MSR was an independent predictor of MACE, 
allowing for further risk stratification in addition to MFR in patients with 
ischemic heart disease. • MSR is a potential new indicator of revascularization."
809,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of high-frequency 
physiologic data during the extubation process and other clinical variables for 
describing the physiologic profile of extubation failure in neonates with 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) post-Norwood procedure. This is a 
single-center, retrospective analysis. Extubation events were collected from 
January 2016 until July 2021. Extubation failure was defined as the need for 
re-intubation within 48 h of extubation. The data included streaming heart rate, 
respiratory rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and cerebral/renal 
near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The most recent blood laboratory results 
before extubation were also included. These markers, demographics, clinical 
characteristics, and ventilatory settings were compared between successful and 
failed extubations. The analysis included 311 extubations. The extubation 
failure rate was 10%. According to univariable analyses, failed extubations were 
preceded by higher respiratory rates (p = 0.029), lower end-tidal CO2 
(p = 0.009), lower pH (p = 0.043), lower serum bicarbonate (p = 0.030), and 
lower partial pressure of O2 (p = 0.022). In the first 10 min after extubation, 
the failed events were characterized by lower arterial (p = 0.028) and cerebral 
NIRS (p = 0.018) saturations. Failed events were associated with persistently 
lower values for cerebral NIRS 2 h post-extubation (p = 0.027). In multivariable 
analysis, vocal cord anomaly, cerebral NIRS at 10 min post-extubation, renal 
NIRS at pre-extubation and post-extubation, and end-tidal CO2 at pre-extubation 
remained as significant co-variables. Oximetric indices before, in the 10 min 
immediately after, and 2 h after extubation and vocal cords paralysis are 
associated with failed extubation events in patients with parallel circulation."
810,"In the pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for patients with atrial 
fibrillation, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) had similar or even superior 
efficacy and safety compared to warfarin. However, RCTs comparing different 
DOACs are non-existent and previous observational studies have yielded 
conflicting results. In this nationwide cohort study, rates of any stroke or 
systemic embolism (stroke/SE) and major bleeding were compared between new users 
of apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban with atrial fibrillation from 
2014-2019. Inverse probability weighting was used to yield balanced study groups 
and outcomes were compared using Cox regression. Stroke/SE rates were similar 
between patients receiving apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban. Dabigatran was 
associated with twofold higher rates of myocardial infarction compared to 
rivaroxaban (1.4 events/100-py vs 0.7 events/100-py, HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.00-4.90) 
and apixaban (1.4 events/100-py vs 0.7 events/100-py, HR 2.26, 95% CI 
0.90-5.67), although the second comparison included the possibility of a null 
effect. Rivaroxaban was associated with higher major bleeding rates compared to 
apixaban (2.9 events/100-py vs 1.8 events/100-py, HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.37) and 
dabigatran (2.9 events/100-py vs 1.4 events/100-py, HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.21-3.93). 
Specifically, rivaroxaban had higher rates of major gastrointestinal bleeding 
and other major bleeding compared to apixaban. In conclusion, while stroke/SE 
rates were similar between DOACs, rivaroxaban was associated with higher rates 
of major bleeding compared to other DOACs and lower rates of myocardial 
infarction compared to dabigatran. These results may help guide oral 
anticoagulant selection, especially in patients at high risk of bleeding or 
myocardial infarction."
811,"Posterior mediastinal dumb-bell tumours are neurogenic tumours that extend from 
the mediastinum to the intraspinal canal. They represent a surgical challenge 
because they may be resected using a staged or a single-stage approach. Until 
recently, a classic posterolateral thoracotomy was the gold standard for 
surgical resection for the intrathoracic segment. In the meantime, 
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has gained great acceptance among most 
thoracic surgeons because of the decreased surgical trauma, less operative blood 
loss and fewer postoperative complications and the shorter hospital stays. 
Proper selection of cases for thoracoscopic excision is crucial for ensuring 
good surgical outcomes. Factors such as tumour size, location and presence or 
absence of features suggesting malignancy should be considered. This procedure 
can offer great help in different case scenarios involving posterior mediastinal 
dumb-bell tumours. For giant tumours that will eventually need a thoracotomy, 
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery helps the surgical team to choose an 
optimal site for a tailored thoracotomy incision and rule out any metastatic 
pleura seedings. In cases of small intrathoracic segments of dumb-bell tumours 
(≤ 6-8 cm) that require combined spinal and thoracic procedures in a 
single-stage approach, a combined posterior and video-assisted thoracoscopic 
surgical approach can be implemented for total resection of the tumour."
812,"The Notch signaling pathway is an important regulator in fate decisions and 
immune responses of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). However, the function of Notch 
signaling in ILCs in acute coronary syndrome is still not fully elucidated. 
Thirty-one unstable angina pectoris (UAP) patients, 21 acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) patients, and 20 controls were included in this study. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated. The mRNA expression 
levels of Notch receptors and ligands were measured by real-time PCR, while ILC 
subsets were measured by flow cytometry. Lin- cells were purified and stimulated 
with γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI). ILC subsets, transcription factors, and 
secreted cytokines were assessed. Notch receptor and ligand mRNA levels were 
elevated in PBMCs and peripheral lin- cells from AMI patients. There was no 
significant difference in total lin-CD45+CD161+CD127+ ILC frequency among three 
groups. The CRTH2-CD117- ILC1 subset was down-regulated, while the CRTH2+ ILC2 
subset was up-regulated in AMI patients. The CRTH2-CD117+ ILC3 subpopulation was 
comparable among the three groups. ILC1% was negatively correlated with Notch1 
and Notch2 in AMI patients. Inhibition of Notch signaling pathway by GSI induced 
elevations in ILC1 frequency, T-bet mRNA expression, and interferon-γ secretion 
and reduced ILC2 frequency, GATA3 mRNA levels, and interleukin-5/interleukin-13 
production by lin- cells from AMI patients. The current data indicated that 
activation of Notch signaling pathway might contribute to ILC1-to-ILC2 shift in 
peripheral blood in AMI patients."
813,"The rarity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) poses a great challenge to their 
clinical application as reliable ""liquid biopsy"" markers for cancer diagnosis. 
Meanwhile, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) led to a reduced 
efficiency in capturing cells with lost or downregulated epithelial cell 
adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expressions. In this study, we proposed an integrated, 
highly efficient strategy for heterogeneous CTC capture and portable detection 
from the blood of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. First, the 
cellulose wrinkled hydrogel with excellent biocompatibility and high specific 
area was employed as the biointerface to capture heterogeneous CTCs with an 
improved capture efficiency in virtue of dual targeting against epithelial and 
mesenchymal ones. Meanwhile, the strategy of glucometer readout was introduced 
for the quantification of captured CTCs on the same hydrogel interface by a 
detection probe, Au-G-MSN-Apt, which was fabricated via entrapping glucose into 
the amino group functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) framework 
sealed by l-cysteine modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and then linked with 
dual aptamers of EpCAM and Vimentin. The number of captured CTCs on the hydrogel 
could be reflected according to the portable glucose meter (PGM) readings. 
Moreover, it was found that the captured cells maintained a higher viability on 
the hydrogel and could be in situ recultured without releasing from the 
substrate. Finally, this integrated strategy was successfully applied to inspect 
the correlations between the number of heterogeneous CTCs in the blood of NSCLC 
patients with disease stage and whether there was distant metastasis."
814,"Few studies have assessed endogenous steroid hormone levels and subsequent 
endometriosis diagnosis. We prospectively evaluated premenopausal plasma sex 
hormone levels and the risk of laparoscopically-confirmed endometriosis in a 
nested case-control study within the Nurses' Health Study II. Between blood 
collection (1996-1999) and 2009, we ascertained 446 women with incident 
endometriosis and matched them to 878 controls through risk-set sampling. We 
conducted multivariable conditional logistic regression accounting for matching 
and confounders to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI). Women with greater early follicular total or free estradiol levels had a 
non-linear increased risk of endometriosis (early follicular total estradiol: 
2nd quartile vs 1st, RR=2.23(CI=1.44-3.47); 3rd quartile, RR=1.83(CI=1.16-2.88); 
4th quartile, RR=1.68(CI=1.05-2.68); early follicular free estradiol: 2nd 
quartile vs 1st, RR=1.63(CI=1.05-2.54); 3rd quartile, RR=2.02(CI=1.31-3.12); 4th 
quartile, RR=1.04(CI=0.66-1.65)). Free testosterone assessed in quartile 
categories was not associated with endometriosis, although a threshold effect 
was observed with a positive association among women in the top 2% of free 
testosterone levels. Mid-luteal total and free estradiol, follicular and luteal 
estrone, total testosterone, progesterone, and sex hormone binding globulin 
levels were not associated with endometriosis risk. These results support the 
role of sex steroids in endometriosis etiology, although the relationships 
suggest complex threshold effects."
815,"Noncompressible hemorrhage is a major cause of posttrauma death and occupies the 
leading position among potentially preventable trauma-associated deaths. 
Recently, multiple studies have shown that strongly adhesive materials can serve 
as hemostatic materials for noncompressible hemorrhage. However, the risk of 
severe tissue adhesion limits the use of adhesive hydrogels as hemostatic 
materials. Here, we report a promising material system comprising an injectable 
sol and liquid spray as a potential solution. Injectable sol is mainly composed 
of gelatin (GEL) and sodium alginate (SA), which possess hemostasis and adhesive 
properties. The liquid spray component, a mixture of tannic acid (TA) and 
calcium chloride (CaCl2), rapidly forms an antibacterial, antiadhesive and 
smooth film structure upon contact with the sol. In vitro and in vivo 
experiments demonstrated the bioabsorbable, biocompatible, antibacterial, and 
antiadhesion properties of the in situ forming hydrogel with a sol-spray system. 
Importantly, the addition of tranexamic acid (TXA) enhanced hemostatic 
performance in noncompressible areas and in deep wound hemorrhage. Our study 
offers a new multifunctional hydrogel system to achieve noncompressible 
hemostasis."
816,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are utilized in a variety of clinical 
settings for the management of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer (mNSCLC). While any organ may be subject to immune-related adverse events 
(irAEs) as a consequence of ICI therapy, hematological irAEs are uncommon. We 
describe a scenario involving a patient with oncogene-addicted mNSCLC who 
experienced the rare, life-threatening complication of hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and cytokine release syndrome following the receipt of 
the IMPower150 regimen (carboplatin/paclitaxel/atezolizumab/bevacizumab) after 
progression on initial tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Malignancy-associated 
HLH, while previously described, is more typically associated with hematological 
rather than solid cancers and has only very recently been reported among 
patients receiving ICIs. While identification of hemophagocytosis on bone marrow 
examination is pathognomonic, this feature is not essential for confirming a 
diagnosis of HLH. Prompt recognition of suspicious laboratory and clinical 
features by medical oncologists and engagement with other relevant disciplines 
is hence critical to ensure optimal management of the condition."
817,"AIM: In the United Kingdom people with diabetes who do not attend annual review 
appointments often have higher Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels.1-3 We aim to 
determine the acceptability of self-collected posted capillary blood samples, 
and if they produce accurate and reliable HbA1c results.
METHODS: We include adult studies comparing capillary blood to venous blood for 
measuring HbA1c. We exclude methods not suitable for postage. Electronic 
databases of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and 
OpenGrey were searched from inception to September 2021, as well as relevant 
conference abstracts. Two reviewers performed study selection, data extraction, 
and risk of bias assessment independently. Narrative synthesis was performed.
RESULTS: Our search retrieved 3747 records. Following de-duplication and 
screening 30 articles were included. The mean difference (MD) and limits of 
agreement (LoA) between capillary and venous HbA1c were smaller and narrower 
respectively when micro/capillary tubes (micro/cap) were used for capillary 
blood storage compared to Dried Blood Spots (capDBS). (micro/cap MD range -0.4 
to 1.4 mmol/mol vs capDBS MD range -4.3 to 7.2 mmol/mol, micro/cap LoA width 2.4 
to 6mmol/mol vs capDBS LoA width 11.7 to 16.8 mmol/mol). After using 
self-collection kits, 83-96% of participants reported satisfaction, 87-99% found 
it easy, and 69-94% reported they would use it again.
CONCLUSION: Microtubes/capillary tubes look promising as a method of 
self-collecting and posting capillary blood samples for the measurement of HbA1c 
based on the accuracy and reliability findings presented. DBS samples 
demonstrated comparatively poorer accuracy. Data on acceptability were limited 
and further research is needed."
818,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR), a common condition in the westernized world, 
is suggested to be more immunologically complex than the archetypical 'Th2' 
inflammation. New approaches are needed to decode this complexity.
AIMS/OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explored a novel histology-based analysis for 
circulating blood leukocyte profiling in 16 patients with seasonal AR outside 
and during the pollen season.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Leukocytes were purified with minimal ex-vivo artefacts, 
embedded into agarose-paraffin pellets for immunohistochemistry-based immune 
cell profiling. Blood leukocyte mapping was performed.
RESULTS: Samples collected during the pollen season had statistically increased 
eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and CD8+ T-lymphocytes compared to the 
off-season baseline. In contrast, no change was observed for CD20+ B-lymphocytes 
and CD3+ T-lymphocytes. Subclassification of CD4+ T-helper cells demonstrated a 
parallel and significant expansion of Th2 and Th17-cells during the pollen 
season, while Th1-cells remained unchanged. Whereas absolute basophils numbers 
were unaltered, the basophil markers GATA2 and CPA3 increased during the pollen 
season.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This study introduces a novel and applicable 
method for systemic immune cell screening and provides further evidence of 
complex and parallel Th2 and Th17-immune signatures in seasonal AR. It also 
forwards GATA2 and CPA3 as potential biomarkers for ongoing allergic 
inflammation."
819,"Two organophosphate esters (OPEs) used as flame retardants and plasticizers, 
triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) and isopropylated phenyl phosphate (IPP), have been 
detected in environmental samples around the world. Human exposure primarily 
occurs via oral ingestion with reported higher concentrations in children. 
Currently, there are no data to evaluate potential risk from exposure to either 
TPHP or IPP during fetal development. These short-term perinatal studies in rats 
provide preliminary toxicity data for TPHP and IPP, including information on 
transfer to fetus/offspring and across the pup blood brain barrier. In separate 
experiments, TPHP or IPP were administered via dosed feed at concentrations 0, 
1000, 3000, 10,000, 15,000 or 30,000 ppm to time-mated Hsd: Sprague Dawley® SD® 
rats from gestation day (GD) 6 through postnatal day (PND) 28; offspring were 
provided dosed feed at the same concentration as their dam (PND28-PND 56). TPHP 
and IPP-related toxicity resulted in removal of both 30,000 ppm groups on GD12 
and 15,000 ppm IPP group after parturition. Body weight and organ weights were 
impacted with exposure in remaining dams. Reproductive performance was perturbed 
at ≥ 10,000 ppm TPHP and all IPP exposure groups. In offspring, both TPHP and 
IPP-related toxicity was noted in pups at ≥ 10,000 ppm as well as reduction in 
bodyweights, delays in pubertal endpoints, and/or reduced cholinesterase enzyme 
activity starting at 1000 ppm TPHP or IPP. Preliminary internal dose assessment 
indicated gestational and lactational transfer following exposure to TPHP or 
IPP. These findings demonstrate that offspring development is sensitive to 
1000 ppm TPHP or IPP exposure."
820,"Despite the burden of anemia among Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients, data 
evaluating red cell concentrate transfusion are limited. We retrospectively 
studied 285 newly diagnosed HL patients who received first-line adriamycin, 
bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine (ABVD) treatment at 
Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. HIV prevalence in the cohort was 39.5% and 
74.2% of patients had advanced stage HL. Patient prognosis was scored using the 
HL International Prognostic Score (IPS-7) and HL IPS-3. Seventy (24.6%) patients 
were transfused with a median of 2 (IQR 1-5) units per patient. Compared to 
HIV-negative patients, more HIV-positive patients were transfused (14.1% vs. 
40.4%, p < .001) and received more units, median 2 (IQR 1-3) vs. 3 (IQR 2-5), 
p = .035. HL IPS-7 (OR 2.1, p < .001) and HL IPS-3 (OR 2.6, p < .001) were 
independently associated with transfusion. HL IPS-7, HL IPS-3, and HIV 
positivity remained associated with transfusion after adjusting for covariates.

822,"BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized 
by hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone diseases, with or without neurological 
symptoms. Plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a highly sensitive and specific 
biomarker for GD, has been used for diagnosis and monitoring the response to 
treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective treatment for the 
non-neurologic symptoms of GD. Neuronopathic GD (type 2 and 3) accounts for 
60%-70% of the Asian affected population.
METHODS: We explored combination therapy of ERT followed by hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) and its long-term outcomes in patients with GD type 
3 (GD3).
RESULTS: Four patients with GD3 and one with GD type 1 (GD1) underwent HSCT. The 
types of donor were one matched-related, one matched-unrelated, and three 
haploidentical. The age at disease onset was 6-18 months and the age at HSCT was 
3.8-15 years in the patients with GD3. The latest age at follow-up was 
8-22 years, with a post-HSCT duration of 3-14 years. All patients had successful 
HSCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in one patient. The enzyme 
activities were normalized at 2 weeks post HSCT. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations became 
lower than the pathological value. All of the patients are still alive and 
physically independent. Most of them (4/5) returned to school. None of the 
patients with GD3 had seizures or additional neurological symptoms after HSCT, 
but showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: ERT followed by HSCT could be considered as an alternative 
treatment for patients with GD3 who have a high risk of fatal neurological 
progression."
823,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic persistent intestinal disorder, 
with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease being the most common. However, the 
physio-pathological development of IBD is still unknown. Therefore, research on 
the etiology and treatment of IBD has been conducted using a variety of 
approaches. Short-chain fatty acids such as 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) are known 
to have various physiological activities. In particular, the production of 3-HB 
by the intestinal microflora is associated with the suppression of various 
inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated whether 
poly-D-3-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB), a polyester of 3-HB, is degraded by 
intestinal microbiota and works as a slow-release agent of 3-HB. Further, we 
examined whether PHB suppresses the pathogenesis of IBD models. As long as a PHB 
diet increased 3-HB concentrations in the feces and blood, PHB suppressed weight 
loss and histological inflammation in a dextran sulfate sodium-induced IBD 
model. Furthermore, PHB increased the accumulation of regulatory T cells in the 
rectum without affecting T cells in the spleen. These results indicate that PHB 
has potential applications in treating diseases related to the intestinal 
microbiota as a sustained 3-HB donor. We show for the first time that 
biodegradable polyester exhibits intestinal bacteria-mediated bioactivity toward 
IBD. The use of bioplastics, which are essential materials for sustainable 
social development, represents a novel approach to diseases related to 
dysbiosis, including IBD."

825,"A 66-year-old male from Venezuela with history of high blood pressure and 
diverticulosis is being studied on an outpatient basis for abdominal pain and 
weight loss of several months of evolution. He presented to the emergency 
department due to worsening abdominal pain in the last 48 hours and fever. His 
abdomen was mildly tender to palpation in the left hypochondrium but did not 
exhibit signs of peritonitis. An abdominal x-ray was performed, revealing an 
oval, smooth-walled mass located in the left upper quadrant that contained a 
gas-fluid level. An outpatient abdominal CT scan performed two months earlier 
showed an intraabdominal, 14.8x10x16cm air cystic lesion, proposing giant 
colonic diverticulum as first diagnostic possibility. Given the findings of the 
abdominal x-ray, urgent abdominal CT was requested (image 3) with results 
suggestive of sigmoid-dependent giant diverticulum, complicated by probable 
superinfection and torsion of the sigma at its base. Considering the suspected 
diagnosis, the patient underwent diverticulectomy, demonstrating purulent 
content inside. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis. Evolution after surgery 
was favourable and the patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day."
826,"We report a highly accurate single-step label-free testing technology for 
simultaneous and independent hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hb) level 
detection from a drop of whole blood by employing a disposable paper strip 
sensor interfaced with a portable impedimetric device. The paper strip is 
fabricated by in situ automated printing of a customized electrode template on 
the non-glossy side of a commercially available photo paper substrate followed 
by graphite deposition. The integrated platform device technology additionally 
includes a compact detection cum readout unit comprising a high precision 
impedance converter system that combines an on-board frequency generator with an 
analog-to-digital converter evaluation board, collectively interfaced with a 
central processor, calibration circuit, and smartphone. Employing a dispensed 
blood sample volume of 25 μL, the device is shown to have a sensitivity of 92 
Ω/Hct and 287 Ω/Hb at an optimal frequency of 57 kHz. The respective linear 
response regimes appear to be wide enough to cover physiologically relevant 
limits, with excellent stability and reproducibility. Validation with clinical 
samples reveals limits of detection of Hct and Hb levels as low as 4.66% and 
1.89 g dL-1, respectively, which are beyond the quantitative capability of 
commonly used affordable point of care test kits. The envisaged paradigm of 
rapid, robust, highly accurate, energy-efficient, simple, user-friendly, 
multiplex portable detection, obviating any possible ambiguities in 
interpretation due to common artefacts of colorimetric detection technologies 
such as optical interference with the image analytical procedure due to the 
inherent redness of blood samples and background illumination, renders this 
ideal for deployment in resource-limited settings."
827,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. The aim of the study was to guide researchers and 
commissioners of cardiovascular disease preventative services towards possible 
cost-effective interventions by reviewing published economic analyses of 
interventions for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, conducted 
for or within the UK NHS.
METHODS: In January 2021, electronic searches of MEDLINE and Embase were carried 
out to find economic evaluations of cardiovascular disease preventative 
services. We included fully published economic evaluations (including economic 
models) conducted alongside randomised controlled trials of any form of 
intervention that was aimed at the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, 
including, but not limited to, drugs, diet, physical activity and public health. 
Full systematic review methods were used with predetermined inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, data extraction and formal quality appraisal [using the Consolidated 
Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist and the framework for 
the quality assessment of decision analytic modelling by Philips et al. (Philips 
Z, Ginnelly L, Sculpher M, Claxton K, Golder S, Riemsma R, et al. Review of 
guidelines for good practice in decision-analytic modelling in health technology 
assessment. Health Technol Assess 2004;8(36)].
RESULTS: Of 4351 non-duplicate citations, eight articles met the review's 
inclusion criteria. The eight articles focused on health promotion (n = 3), 
lipid-lowering medicine (n = 4) and blood pressure-lowering medication (n = 1). 
The majority of the populations in each study had at least one risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease or were at high risk of cardiovascular disease. For the 
primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, all strategies were cost-effective 
at a threshold of £25,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, except increasing 
motivational interviewing in addition to other behaviour change strategies. 
Where the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was reported, interventions 
varied from dominant (i.e. less expensive and more effective than the comparator 
intervention) to £55,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
FUTURE WORK AND LIMITATIONS: We found few health economic analyses of 
interventions for primary cardiovascular disease prevention conducted within the 
last decade. Future economic assessments should be undertaken and presented in 
accordance with best practices so that future reviews may make clear 
recommendations to improve health policy.
CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to establish direct comparisons or draw firm 
conclusions because of the uncertainty and heterogeneity among studies. However, 
interventions conducted for or within the UK NHS were likely to be 
cost-effective in people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease when 
compared with usual care or no intervention.

828,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening disease for which critically important 
antimicrobials (CIA) frequently are used. Diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines 
for sepsis and critically ill calves are largely lacking.
OBJECTIVES: Identify factors associated with mortality in critically ill calves 
and describe bacteria obtained from blood cultures of critically ill calves with 
sepsis and their antimicrobial resistance.
ANIMALS: Two-hundred thirty critically ill calves, mainly Belgian Blue beef 
cattle.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Logistic regression, survival analysis, and 
decision tree analysis were used to determine factors associated with mortality.
RESULTS: Of the critically ill calves, 34.3% had sepsis and 61.3% died. The 
final survival model indicated that calves with sepsis (hazard risk [HR]: 1.6; 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-2.5; P = .05), abnormal behavior (HR: 2.3; 95% 
CI: 1.3-4.0; P = .005), and hypothermia (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72-0.95; P = .01) 
had a significantly higher mortality risk. In a second survival model, 
hypothermia (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78-0.96; P = .004) and hypoglycemia (HR: 2.2; 
95% CI: 1.5-3.3; P < .001) were risk factors for mortality. Decision tree 
analysis emphasized the importance of behavior, hypochloremia, hypoglycemia, 
hyperkalemia, and lung ultrasonography for mortality risk. Escherichia coli 
(30.6%) was most frequently isolated from blood cultures, of which 90.9% were 
multidrug resistant. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials was frequent for 
penicillin, amoxicillin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, but less for CIA.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Many critically ill calves have sepsis, 
which increases mortality risk. Bacteria involved are often resistant to 
first-intention antimicrobials but less resistant to CIA. The other identified 
risk factors for mortality can support therapeutic decision-making."
829,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral small-vessel disease may alter cerebral blood 
flow (CBF) leading to brain changes and, hence, cognitive impairment and 
dementia. CBF and the spatial coefficient of variation can be measured 
quantitatively by arterial spin-labeling. We aimed to investigate the 
associations of demographics, vascular risk factors, location, and severity of 
cerebral small-vessel disease as well as the etiologic subtypes of cognitive 
impairment and dementia with CBF and the spatial coefficient of variation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred ninety patients with a diagnosis of no 
cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment no dementia, vascular cognitive 
impairment no dementia, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia were recruited 
from the memory clinic. Cerebral microbleeds and lacunes were categorized into 
strictly lobar, strictly deep, and mixed-location and enlarged perivascular 
spaces into the centrum semiovale and basal ganglia. Total and region-specific 
white matter hyperintensity volumes were segmented using FreeSurfer. CBF (n = 
333) and the spatial coefficient of variation (n = 390) were analyzed with 
ExploreASL from 2D-EPI pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling images in white 
matter (WM) and gray matter (GM). To analyze the effect of demographic and 
vascular risk factors as well as the location and severity of cerebral 
small-vessel disease markers on arterial spin-labeling parameters, we 
constructed linear regression models, whereas logistic regression models were 
used to determine the association between arterial spin-labeling parameters and 
cognitive impairment no dementia, vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, 
Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia.
RESULTS: Increasing age, male sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of 
heart disease, and smoking were associated with lower CBF and a higher spatial 
coefficient of variation. Higher numbers of lacunes and cerebral microbleeds 
were associated with lower CBF and a higher spatial coefficient of variation. 
Location-specific analysis showed mixed-location lacunes and cerebral 
microbleeds were associated with lower CBF. Higher total, anterior, and 
posterior white matter hyperintensity volumes were associated with a higher 
spatial coefficient of variation. No association was observed between enlarged 
perivascular spaces and arterial spin-labeling parameters. A higher spatial 
coefficient of variation was associated with the diagnosis of vascular cognitive 
impairment no dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced CBF and an increased spatial coefficient of variation were 
associated with cerebral small-vessel disease, and more specifically lacunes, 
whereas cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities were associated 
with WM-CBF and GM spatial coefficient of variation. The spatial coefficient of 
variation was associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, suggesting that 
hypoperfusion might be the key underlying mechanism for vascular brain damage."
830,"BACKGROUND: In India, more than 60% of hospital beds are in private facilities, 
yet several studies have observed suboptimal quality of care in private 
facilities. We aimed to understand the role of Manyata, a quality improvement 
initiative in private facilities focused on mentorship and clinical standards, 
to improve the knowledge and skills of health care providers, their adherence to 
key childbirth-related clinical practices, and health outcomes for women and 
newborns.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of Manyata program data collected 
from 466 private facilities across 3 states (Jharkhand, Maharashtra, and Uttar 
Pradesh) in India from October 2016 to February 2019. We calculated means and 
95% confidence intervals for knowledge and skills assessment, adherence to 
facility standards was analyzed by calculating the proportion of facilities 
passing a given quality standard at baseline and endline, and changes in 
pregnancy outcomes were assessed with autoregression modeling.
RESULTS: From assessments conducted before and after training among providers in 
Manyata, we observed a significant increase in average knowledge score (6.3 vs. 
13.2 of 20) and skill score (8.0 vs. 34.3 of 40). Overall, a significant 
increase occurred in adherence to clinical standards between baseline and 
endline assessments (29% vs. 93%). The standards with the greatest improvements 
were identification and management of eclampsia/preeclampsia, postpartum 
hemorrhage, and neonatal resuscitation. There were no significant changes over 
time in absolute rate of reported complications; however, referral rates from 
private facilities for preeclampsia and newborn sepsis identification and 
management declined.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates private facilities' adherence to quality 
standards and nurses' childbirth knowledge and practical skills increased during 
Manyata. Additional efforts are needed to ensure high-quality care during 
cesarean deliveries at private facilities. Future studies with rigorous design 
are required to evaluate the impact of this quality improvement initiative in 
improving pregnancy outcomes."
831,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown after ischemic stroke exacerbates brain 
injury and BBB senescence can cause severe neurological deficits in aged 
ischemic stroke population. Recent evidence reveals that inducible pluripotent 
stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (iPSC-sEVs) possess phenomenal 
antisenescence capability. However, whether iPSC-sEVs can rejuvenate BBB 
senescence to improve stroke outcomes in aged mice remains unknown. Here, we 
showed that long-term treatment with iPSC-sEVs alleviated aging-induced BBB 
senescence in aged mice. In aged stroke mice, iPSC-sEVs significantly mitigated 
BBB integrity damage, reduced the following infiltration of peripheral 
leukocytes, and decreased the release of pro-inflammatory factors from the 
leukocytes, which ultimately inhibited neuronal death and improved 
neurofunctional recovery. Mechanism studies showed that iPSC-sEVs could activate 
the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and up-regulate sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) 
in senescent endothelial cells. Blocking the activation of eNOS abolished 
iPSC-sEV-mediated rejuvenation of BBB senescence and the protection of BBB 
integrity. Proteomics results demonstrated that iPSC-sEVs were enriched with 
bioactive factors including AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) and calmodulin 
(CALM) to activate the eNOS-Sirt1 axis. Further investigation showed that AKT1 
and CALM inhibitors blocked iPSC-sEV-afforded activation of the eNOS-Sirt1 axis 
in senescent endothelial cells. Taken together, iPSC-sEVs can protect against 
ischemic stroke in aged mice by rejuvenating BBB senescence, partially, through 
delivering AKT1 and CALM to activate eNOS-Sirt1 axis, which indicates that 
iPSC-sEVs treatment is an effective alternative to treat ischemic stroke in the 
aged population."
832,"BACKGROUND: Development of biomarkers for predicting the occurrence of hepatitis 
E virus related-acute liver failure (HEV-ALF) is conducive to prevention and 
early intervention.
METHODS: Serum samples from 250 HEV-ALF patients, 250 patients with acute 
hepatitis E (AHE) and 250 health controls (HCs) were collected. We assessed the 
predictive ability of extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived argininosuccinate 
synthase 1 (ASS1) levels for HEV-ALF occurrence.
RESULTS: Serum EVs were successfully isolated. EV-derived ASS1 levels in the 
HEV-ALF patients were significantly higher than those in the AHE patients and 
HCs. In HEV-ALF patients, EV-derived ASS1 levels were positively correlated with 
the number of failed organs and disease progression. The logistical regression 
showed that EV-derived ASS1 level is an independent risk factor for HEV-ALF, and 
orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) also suggested 
that EV-derived ASS1 level has high predictive capability. Besides, the area 
under the curve (AUC) of EV-derived ASS1 level to predict HEV-ALF occurrence was 
0.728 (0.684-0.772) with the sensitivity and specificity being 72.80% and 
64.80%, which had a high decision-making ability. Furthermore, there existed no 
significant difference between the age ≥60 and age <60 groups in EV-derived ASS1 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum EV-derived ASS1 level is a promising predictor for the 
occurrence of HEV-ALF. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

833,"OBJECTIVES: Compared with the general population, patients with sickle cell 
disease (SCD) typically have substantially reduced life expectancies. It is 
unclear whether SCD patients who acquire COVID-19 have higher rates of 
complications and mortality than the general population. We sought to elucidate 
COVID-19 presentation and outcomes in patients with SCD.
METHODS: Using retrospective chart review, we evaluated demographic 
characteristics, presenting symptoms, chest imaging findings, blood transfusion 
requirements, need for mechanical ventilation or pressor support, medication 
administration (including remdesivir and dexamethasone), and survival among 
individuals with SCD hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 2020 to December 
2021.
RESULTS: Among 72 SCD patients, increased pain was the most common presenting 
symptom followed by cough, fever, and dyspnea. Thirty-seven (44%) received 
simple transfusion and 14 (17%) underwent exchange transfusion. Lung imaging 
findings suggestive of COVID-19 were observed in 27 (37%) patients; 21 (29%) 
patients were treated with remdesivir and 26 (35%) received dexamethasone. Three 
patients (4%) required mechanical ventilation and pressor support; all three 
died from COVID complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain is the most common presenting symptom in SCD patients with 
COVID-19. We observed a mortality rate higher than that among the general 
population among patients who required mechanical ventilation and pressor 
support."
834,"Point-of-care (POC) HIV viral load (VL) tests are needed to enhance access to 
HIV VL testing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and to enable HIV VL 
self-testing at home, which in turn have the potential to enhance the global 
management of the disease. While methods based on real-time reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are highly sensitive and 
quantitatively accurate, they often require bulky and expensive instruments, 
making applications at the POC challenging. On the other hand, although methods 
based on isothermal amplification techniques could be performed using low-cost 
instruments, they have shown limited quantitative accuracies, i.e., being only 
semiquantitative. Herein, we present a sensitive and quantitative POC HIV VL 
quantification method from blood that can be performed using a small power-free 
three-dimensional-printed plasma separation device and a portable, low-cost 
magnetofluidic real-time RT-PCR instrument. The plasma separation device, which 
is composed of a plasma separation membrane and an absorbent material, 
demonstrated 96% plasma separation efficiency per 100 μL of whole blood. The 
plasma solution was then processed in a magnetofluidic cartridge for automated 
HIV RNA extraction and quantification using the portable instrument, which 
completed 50 cycles of PCR in 15 min. Using the method, we achieved a limit of 
detection of 500 HIV RNA copies/mL, which is below the World Health 
Organization's virological failure threshold, and a good quantitative accuracy. 
The method has the potential for sensitive and quantitative HIV VL testing at 
the POC and at home self-testing."
835,"Prometastatic and antitumor effects of different anesthetics have been 
previously analyzed in several studies with conflicting results. Thus, the 
underlying perioperative molecular mechanisms mediated by anesthetics 
potentially affecting tumor phenotype and metastasis remain unclear. It was 
hypothesized that anesthetic‑specific long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) expression 
changes are induced in the blood circulation and play a crucial role in tumor 
outcome. In the present study, high‑throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR 
were performed in order to identify lncRNA and mRNA expression changes affected 
by two therapeutic regimes, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and volatile 
anesthetic gas (VAG) in patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) resection. 
Total blood RNA was isolated prior to and following resection and characterized 
using RNA sequencing. mRNA‑lncRNA interactions and their roles in cancer‑related 
signaling of differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified using 
bioinformatics analyses. The comparison of these two time points revealed 35 
differentially expressed lncRNAs in the TIVA‑group, and 25 in the VAG‑group, 
whereas eight were shared by both groups. Two lncRNAs in the TIVA‑group, and 23 
in the VAG‑group of in silico identified target‑mRNAs were confirmed as 
differentially regulated in the NGS dataset of the present study. Pathway 
analysis was performed and cancer relevant canonical pathways for TIVA were 
identified. Target‑mRNA analysis of VAG revealed a markedly worsened 
immunological response against cancer. In this proof‑of‑concept study, 
anesthesic‑specific expression changes in lncRNA and mRNA profiles in blood were 
successfully identified. Moreover, the data of the present study provide the 
first evidence that anesthesia‑induced lncRNA pattern changes may contribute 
further in the observed differences in CRC outcome following tumor resection."
836,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. The 
complete burden and outcomes in Uganda are unknown. The study was a multicenter 
retrospective chart review of children aged between 0 to 15 years diagnosed with 
NB from 2010 to 2020. Demographic, clinical and tumor-related characteristics 
were extracted for analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression 
models were used to determine the one-year overall survival (OS) and identify 
prognostic factors. Seventy-five patients were evaluated, with a median age at 
diagnosis of 48 months (IQR 26-108 months). Fever (74.7%), weight loss (74.7%), 
high blood pressure (70.3%) and abdominal swelling/mass (65.3%) were the most 
common features at diagnosis. Suprarenal tumors (52%) and stage 4 disease 
(70.7%) were also common. The one-year OS was 60.0% (95%CI 56.8%; 64.3%) with a 
median survival time of 12.6 months (95% CI: 8.1; 20.8). The one-year OS for 
non-metastatic and metastatic disease was 67.3% and 42.6% (p = 0.11) 
respectively. Leukocytosis (p < 0.001) at diagnosis was of prognostic 
significance while clinical remission after induction chemotherapy (p < 0.001) 
provided survival advantages. Children who received maintenance chemotherapy had 
a longer median survival time of 38.5 months (range 10.8-69.5). Age (p = 0.001), 
lung metastasis (p < 0.001), and leukocytosis (p < 0.001) remained significant 
on multivariate analysis. In this Ugandan study, leukocytosis was a clinical 
predictor of prognosis, metastatic disease had management challenges and 
maintenance chemotherapy prolonged the survival time but not OS."

838,"Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death for women in low-resource 
settings. The World Health Organization recommends that cervical cancer 
screening programs incorporate HPV DNA testing, but available tests are 
expensive, require laboratory infrastructure, and cannot be performed at the 
point-of-care. We developed a two-dimensional paper network (2DPN), 
hybrid-capture, signal amplification assay and a point-of-care sample 
preparation protocol to detect high-risk HPV DNA from exfoliated cervical cells 
within an hour. The test does not require expensive equipment and has an 
estimated cost of <$3 per test without the need for batching. We evaluated 
performance of the paper HPV DNA assay with short synthetic and genomic HPV DNA 
targets, HPV positive and negative cellular samples, and two sets of clinical 
samples. The first set of clinical samples consisted of 16 biobanked, 
provider-collected cervical samples from a study in El Salvador previously 
tested with careHPV and subsequently tested in a controlled laboratory 
environment. The paper HPV DNA test correctly identified eight of eight 
HPV-negative clinical samples and seven of eight HPV-positive clinical samples. 
We then performed a field evaluation of the paper HPV DNA test in a hospital 
laboratory in Mozambique. Cellular controls generated expected results 
throughout field testing with fully lyophilized sample preparation and 2DPN 
reagents. When evaluated with 16 residual self-collected cervicovaginal samples 
previously tested by the GeneXpert HPV assay (""Xpert""), the accuracy of the HPV 
DNA paper test in the field was reduced compared to testing in the controlled 
laboratory environment, with positive results obtained for all eight 
HPV-positive samples as well as seven of eight HPV-negative samples. Further 
evaluation showed reduction in performance was likely due in part to increased 
concentration of exfoliated cells in the self-collected clinical samples from 
Mozambique compared with provider-collected samples from El Salvador. Finally, a 
formal usability assessment was conducted with users in El Salvador and 
Mozambique; the assay was rated as acceptable to perform after minimal training. 
With additional optimization for higher cell concentrations and inclusion of an 
internal cellular control, the paper HPV DNA assay offers promise as a low-cost, 
point-of-care cervical cancer screening test in low-resource settings."
839,"BACKGROUND: The study aims to clarify the association of sarcopenia with 
perioperative and postoperative complications in oral cavity squamous cell 
carcinoma (OCSCC) patients undergoing curative surgery and to understand the 
reasons causing the poor oncologic outcomes for OCSCC.
METHODS: We conducted a propensity score matching study to investigate the 
association of perioperative and postoperative outcomes in OCSCC patients with 
sarcopenia and without sarcopenia. A retrospective analysis of a large national 
data set from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database was conducted. At least two 
claims for patients with a principal diagnosis of sarcopenia within the 12-month 
preoperative period were defined as the criteria for sarcopenia diagnosis 
(ICD-10-CM code M62.84). Sarcopenia was diagnosed through the measurement of low 
muscle strength and low muscle mass by any one of the patient's attending 
orthopaedic physician, rehabilitation physician, family medicine specialist or 
geriatrician. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the 
perioperative, and postoperative major complications.
RESULTS: Our final cohort included 16 293 patients with OCSCC (10 862 and 5 431 
in the sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups, respectively) who were eligible for 
further analysis. The sarcopenia group was 10.40% female and 89.60% male, and 
the nonsarcopenia group was 9.74% female and 90.26% male. The mean 
age ± standard deviation (SD) were 56.44 ± 11.14 and 56.22 ± 11.29 for 
sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups. OCSCC patients with sarcopenia undergoing 
curative surgery had a significantly higher blood transfusion rate and volume; 
longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay; higher postoperative 
30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
[1.07, 1.56]) and rates of pneumonia (aOR: 1.34, 95% CI [1.20, 1.50]), acute 
renal failure (aOR: 1.45, 95% CI [1.12, 1.87]) and septicaemia (aOR: 1.29, 95% 
CI [1.15, 1.45]); higher postoperative first-year mortality (aOR: 1.18, 95% CI 
[1.13, 1.51]) and rates of pneumonia (aOR: 1.43, 95% CI [1.30, 1.56]), acute 
myocardial infarction (aOR: 1.52, 95% CI [1.06, 2.18]) and septicaemia (aOR: 
1.29, 95% CI [1.15, 1.45]).
CONCLUSIONS: OCSCC patients with sarcopenia might exhibit more perioperative and 
surgical complications than those without sarcopenia."
840,"Infecting the stomach of almost 50% of people, Helicobacter pylori is a 
causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcers and stomach cancers. Interactions 
between bacterial membrane-bound lectin, Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin 
(BabA), and human blood group antigens are key in the initiation of infection. 
Herein, we report the synthesis of a B-antigen hexasaccharide (B6) and a B-Lewis 
b heptasaccharide (BLeb7) and Bovine Serum Albumin glycoconjugates thereof to 
assess the binding properties and preferences of BabA from different strains. 
From a previously reported trisaccharide acceptor a versatile key 
Lacto-N-tetraose tetrasaccharide intermediate was synthesized, which allowed us 
to explore various routes to the final targets, either via initial introduction 
of fucosyl residues followed by introduction of the B-determinant or vice versa. 
The first approach proved unsuccessful, whereas the second afforded the target 
structures in good yields. Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology 
allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic 
multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition 
binding studies were performed with H. pylori strains displaying high or low 
affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the 
high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B-determinant in the 
Bleb7-conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue 
in the B6-conjugate."
841,"BACKGROUND: Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes most cases of haemorrhagic fever 
with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe. PUUV infection is characterised by acute 
kidney injury, thrombocytopenia and increased capillary leakage. Typical 
symptoms are fever, headache, nausea, abdominal and back pain. This study aimed 
to evaluate the amount and distribution of intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal and 
pleural fluid and the association of fluid collections to the symptoms and 
clinical findings in patients with acute PUUV infection.
METHODS: Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 27 
hospitalised patients with acute PUUV infection. The clinical and laboratory 
findings and patients' symptoms were analysed in relation to the imaging 
findings. The thickness of the fluid collections was measured in millimetres 
(mm) from axial images.
RESULTS: Fluid collections were found in all patients. The amount of 
intraperitoneal fluid correlated positively with plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) 
level (r = 0.586, p = .001), while it had an inverse correlation with serum 
creatinine concentration (r = -0.418, p = .030). Retroperitoneal fluid also 
correlated inversely with serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations 
(r = -0.501, p = .008 and r = -0.383, p = .048, respectively). The amount of 
fluid was not greater in patients with abdominal or back pain. Patients with 
back pain had higher serum creatinine compared with patients without back pain, 
452 µmol/L (range 88-1071) vs. 83 µmol/L (range 60-679), p = .004.
CONCLUSIONS: Fluid collections were found in all patients. A greater amount of 
intraperitoneal fluid associates with higher CRP concentrations but not with 
higher serum creatinine levels. Back pain associates with higher creatinine 
level but not with the presence of fluids."
842,"OBJECTIVES: The immune dysregulation during SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to 
worsen immune homeostasis after recovery. Patients with hematological

recovery from COVID-19 in hematological patients.
METHODS: Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the lymphocyte subsets

including 42 with hematological malignancies 4-6 weeks after COVID-19.
RESULTS: Hematological COVID-19 convalescents had deep reduction in CD3+ T 
cells, including helper T cells (CD3+CD4+), naïve helper T cells 
(CD3+CD4+CD45RA+) and memory CD4+ T cells among with extremely low levels of 
Treg cells and decreased expression of both TCRα/β and TCRγ/δ. Severe immune 
dysregulation in hematological convalescents was expressed by increased 
activation of T lymphocytes, both as elevated levels of activated T cells 
(CD3+HLA-DR+) and activated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a profound impairment of the adaptive immune 
response in hematological convalescents which might be a result of persistent 
activation of T cells. Convalescents with lymphoid malignancies showed more 
pronounced depletion of key T lymphocytes subpopulations in creating an 
effective adaptive response and immune memory. This article is protected by

843,"INTRODUCTION: This systematic review aimed to retrieve patients diagnosed with 
de novo immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after COVID-19 immunization to 
determine their epidemiological characteristics, clinical course, therapeutic 
strategies, and outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted the review using four major databases, 
comprising PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library, until April 
2022. A systematic search was performed in duplicate to access eligible articles 
in English. Furthermore, a manual search was applied to the chosen papers' 
references to enhance the search sensitivity. Data were extracted and analyzed 
with the SPSS 20.1 software.
RESULTS: A total of 77 patients with de novo COVID-19 vaccine-associated ITP 
were identified from 41 studies, including 31 case reports and 10 case series. 
The median age of patients who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated ITP was 
54 years (IQR 36-72 years). The mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, including 
BNT16B2b2 and mRNA-1273, were most implicated (75.4%). Those were followed by 
the adenovirus vector-based vaccines, inclusive of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 
vAd26.COV2.S. No report was found relating ITP to other COVID-19 vaccines. Most 
cases (79.2%) developed ITP after the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination. 75% of 
the patients developed ITP within 12 days of vaccination, indicating a shorter 
lag time compared to ITP after routine childhood vaccinations. Sixty-seven 
patients (87%) patients were hospitalized. The management pattern was similar to 
primary ITP, and systemic glucocorticoids, IVIg, or both were the basis of the 
treatment in most patients. Most patients achieved therapeutic goals; only two 
individuals required a secondary admission, and one patient who presented with 
intracranial hemorrhage died of the complication.
CONCLUSIONS: De Novo ITP is a rare complication of COVID-19 vaccination, and 
corresponding reports belong to mRNA-based and adenovirus vector-based vaccines, 
in order of frequency. This frequency pattern may be related to the scale of 
administration of individual vaccines and their potency in inducing 
autoimmunity. The more the COVID-19 vaccine is potent to induce antigenic 
challenge, the shorter the lag time would be. Most patients had a benign course 
and responded to typical treatments of primary ITP."
844,"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem opened the first medical school in Israel in 
May 1949. One of the select 45 students of its first class was Bracha (Chweidan) 
Ramot. After completing her medical studies with distinction, she went on to 
specialize in internal medicine and hematology and soon became a central figure 
in the development of hematology in Israel. In 1958, Ramot established the 
Hematological Institute at Tel-Hashomer hospital and served as its director 
until 1991. She devoted much of her time and effort to researching environmental 
and genetic factors that influence hematological conditions: deficiencies in 
coagulation factors, glucose metabolism disorders, and especially leukemias and 
lymphomas, including the type known as Hodgkin's disease. In 2001, Ramot, ""The 
Doyenne of Israeli Hematology"" as she was called in publications of the Albert 
Einstein Institute, was awarded the Israel Prize in Medical Sciences, the 
country's most prestigious prize. Her biography personifies the ability to 
overcome obstacles and challenges in one's personal life while concurrently 
becoming an exceedingly successful physician and researcher of extraordinary 
achievement."
845,"BACKGROUND: Acute urticaria and angioedema are emergency dermatological 
conditions associated with various etiologic factors.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiological causes in patients with acute urticaria 
and angioedema, and to investigate whether more than one etiological cause was 
present, along with the patients' laboratory values.
METHODS: The study was conducted in a tertiary hospital with one center. 
Etiological causes and laboratory parameters in 284 patients diagnosed with 
acute urticaria and angioedema were retrospectively studied.
RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the 
patients was 42.7 ± 15.6 years, where 163 (57.4%) were women and 121 (42.6%) 
were men. Acute urticaria and angioedema occurred together in 149 (52.5%) 
patients. At least one precipitating factor among the predisposing risk factors 
was present in 220 (77.5%) patients, and more than one precipitating factor was 
found in 51 (18%) patients. Medication use was found in 157 (55.3%) patients and 
infection in 54 (19%). The development of urticaria after food consumption was 
noted in nine (3.2%) individuals. A history of infection and medication intake 
was present in 50 (17.6%) patients. A joint history of food consumption and 
medication intake was present in only one patient. Elevated C-reactive protein 
level was found in 178 (62.7%) patients and elevated anti-streptolysin O titer 
in 41 (14.4%) patients. Vitamin B12 deficiency was found in 116 (40.8%) patients 
and vitamin D deficiency in 254 (89.4%).
CONCLUSION: Acute urticaria and angioedema may occur as a result of multiple 
etiological factors, in which different triggers may be present simultaneously."
846,"Known hereditary human diseases featuring impaired copper trafficking across 
cellular membranes involve ATP7A (Menkes disease, occipital horn disease, 
X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 3) and ATP7B (Wilson disease). Herein, we 
report a newborn infant of consanguineous parents with a homozygous pathogenic 
variant in a highly conserved sequence of SLC31A1, coding for the copper influx 
transporter 1, CTR1. This missense variant, c.236T > C, was detected by whole 
exome sequencing. The infant was born with pulmonary hypoplasia and suffered 
from severe respiratory distress immediately after birth, necessitating 
aggressive mechanical ventilation. At 2 weeks of age, multifocal brain 
hemorrhages were diagnosed by cerebral ultrasound and magnetic resonance 
imaging, together with increased tortuosity of cerebral arteries. Ensuing 
seizures were only partly controlled by antiepileptic drugs, and the infant 
became progressively comatose. Laboratory investigations revealed very low serum 
concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin. No hair shaft abnormalities were 
detected by dermatoscopy or light microscopic analyses of embedded hair shafts 
obtained at 4 weeks of life. The infant died after redirection of care and 
elective cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation at 1 month of age. This 
case adds SLC31A1 to the genes implicated in severe hereditary disorders of 
copper transport in humans."
847,"Key homeostasis providing cells in the central nervous system (CNS) are 
astrocytes, which belong to the class of cells known as atroglia, a highly 
heterogeneous type of neuroglia and a prominent element of the brain defence. 
Diseases evolve due to altered homeostatic state, associated with 
pathology-induced astroglia remodelling represented by reactive astrocytes, 
astroglial atrophy and astrodegeneration. These features are hallmarks of most 
infectious insults, mediated by bacteria, protozoa and viruses; they are also 
prominent in the systemic infection. The COVID-19 pandemic revived the focus 
into neurotropic viruses such as SARS-CoV2 (Coronaviridae) but also the 
Flaviviridae viruses including tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) and Zika virus 
(ZIKV) causing the epidemic in South America prior to COVID-19. Astrocytes 
provide a key response to neurotropic infections in the CNS. Astrocytes form a 
parenchymal part of the blood-brain barrier, the site of virus entry into the 
CNS. Astrocytes exhibit aerobic glycolysis, a form of metabolism characteristic 
of highly morphologically plastic cells, like cancer cells, hence a suitable 
milieu for multiplication of infectious agent, including viral particles. 
However, why the protection afforded by astrocytes fails in some circumstances 
is an open question to be studied in the future."
848,"Objective: Blood stream infections (BSIs) are well described in pediatric 
cardiac intensive care units (PCICU). We noted that postoperative high-risk 
patients may develop BSI after a preceding clinical event (PCE). The study aim 
was to investigate whether high-risk patients who developed bacteremia 
experienced more PCEs than a similar group of high-risk patients. Design: 
Retrospective case-control study. Setting: Referral pediatric center. Patients: 
We enrolled patients who developed bacteremia from March 2010 to November 2019, 
after undergoing open-heart surgery at a pediatric center. The control group was 
comprised of case-matched patients with immediate consecutive same surgery. 
Interventions: None. Measurements: We recorded operative data, common risk 
factors, postoperative indicators of organ dysfunction, mortality, and PCEs 72 
to 24 h before bacteremia emerged. Main results: A total of 200 patients were 
included (100 with bacteremia and 100 controls). Key demographic and operative 
parameters were matched. Bacteremia emerged on average on postoperative day 
12.8. Skin-associated Gram-positive bacteria were cultured in 10% and 
Gram-negative bacteria in 84% of the patients. Average central-venous lines 
(CVL) duration was 9.5 ± 8.4 days. Postoperatively (72 h), indicators of organ 
dysfunction were significantly worse in patients with bacteremia, with a higher 
rate of postoperative complications during PCICU length-of-stay (LOS). In the 
bacteremia group, 72 to 24 h prior to the development of bacteremia, 92 (92%) 
PCEs were recorded, as compared to 21 (21%) in controls during their entire LOS 
(odds ratio [OR] 43.3, confidence interval [CI] 18.2-103.1, P < .0001). 
Conclusions: We propose a 3-hit model demonstrating that high-risk patients 
undergoing open-heart surgery have significantly higher risk for bacteremia 
after a PCE."
849,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of deferasirox (DFX) by comparison with 
deferoxamine (DFO) in managing iron overload in patients with sickle cell 
anaemia (SCA).
METHODS: Online databases were systematically searched for studies published 
from January 2007 to July 2022 that had investigated the efficacy of DFX 
compared with DFO in managing iron overload in patients with SCA.
RESULTS: Of the 316 articles identified, three randomized clinical trials met 
the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of liver tissue iron concentration (LIC) 
showed that iron overload was not significantly higher in the DFX group compared 
with DFO group (WMD, -1.61 mg Fe/g dw (95% CI -4.42 to 1.21). However, iron 
overload as measured by serum ferritin was significantly lower in DFO compared 
with DFX group (WMD, 278.13 µg/l (95% CI 36.69 to 519.57). Although 
meta-analysis was not performed on myocardial iron concentration due to 
incomplete data, the original report found no significant difference between DFX 
and DFO.
CONCLUSION: While limited by the number of studies included in this 
meta-analysis, overall, the results tend to show that DFX was as effective as 
DFO in managing iron overload in patients with SCA."
850,"BACKGROUND: There is a knowledge gap regarding lobar versus sublobar resection 
for atypical carcinoid (AC) of the lung. As such, the authors sought to 
understand and analyze the outcomes of sublobar resection versus lobectomy in 
this patient population.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis using the National Cancer Database was 
performed to compare overall survival (OS) between patients treated with 
lobectomy and patients treated with sublobar resection for AC of the lung 
between the years 2004 and 2016. Patient characteristics were compared with χ2 
tests. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS distributions, and the 
log-rank test was used to compare distributions by treatment strategy. A 
multivariable Cox regression model was used to assess associations between the 
treatment strategy and OS. A propensity score matching method was also 
implemented to further eliminate treatment selection bias in the study sample.
RESULTS: The database identified 669 patients with T1-T4 and N0-N3 lung ACs that 
were surgically resected. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves did not 
demonstrate an OS difference between lobectomy and sublobar resection 
(p = .094). After propensity score matching, curves demonstrated a numerical 
improvement in OS with lobectomy; however, it was not statistically significant 
(p = .5). In a subgroup analysis, lobectomy and node-negative disease were 
associated with the best OS, whereas sublobar resection and node-positive 
disease were associated with the worst OS (p < .0001). Nodal involvement was 
associated with worse survival, regardless of surgical treatment (p < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T1-T4 and N0-N3 ACs of the lung, lobectomy was not 
associated with an improvement in OS in comparison with sublobar resection."
851,"Circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and lipid mediators were 
extracted from human red blood cells and quantified using liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method encompassed 13 
different PUFAs and lipid mediators, however, due to instrument capability only 
five were confidently quantified (EPA, ALA, AA, DHA, and LA). The extraction 
focused on free polyunsaturated fatty acids since they have a strong correlation 
with health in humans. The study design was a secondary analysis of the OPPERA-2 
study of chronic overlapping pain conditions in adults. The data included are: 
a) raw LC-MS/MS data (.raw); b) processed data (.xlsx) including chromatographic 
peak area for each compound and a concentration (ng/mL) based on external 
calibration with internal standardization using pure analytical grade standards 
and heavy-isotope labeled internal standards; c) study participant demographics 
and phenotypes (.xlsx). This dataset consisting of circulating PUFA quantities 
measured in 605 humans has been made publicly available for analysis and 
interpretation."
852,"INTRODUCTION: The role of foundation year-1 (FY1) doctors during the 
out-of-hours (OOHs) period was explored, identifying areas to improve their 
training.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected for 1 year of foundation training 
(2018-2019) from an electronic task system between 17:00 to 08:00, Monday to 
Sunday, in a 798-bed teaching hospital in Exeter, UK.
RESULTS: Thirty-two thousand, two hundred and sixty OOHs jobs were requested 
with 21,816 (67.6%) assigned to FY1 doctors and the clinical site practitioner. 
Jobs were distributed with 12,044 (55.2%) for FY1 medicine, 5,739 (26.3%) for 
FY1 surgery and 4,033 (18.5%) for the clinical site practitioner. The three most 
common jobs requested were prescribing (31.1%), patient reviews (17.9%), and 
interpreting or taking bloods (11.6%). Procedural jobs accounted for 22.2% of 
all jobs. Prescribing and patient review jobs were further categorised into 
commonly encountered themes.
CONCLUSION: This study describes the nature of jobs performed by FY1 doctors 
working OOHs and identifies three areas to focus foundation doctor training. 
First, improving the preparedness of new graduates as guided by commonly 
identified jobs. Second, monitoring the appropriateness of performed jobs. 
Third, ensuring the evolving roles of allied health professionals and foundation 
doctors are clearly understood in relation to one another."
853,"Regular chronic kidney disease (CKD) screening can facilitate earlier diagnosis 
of CKD and preventative action to reduce the risk of CKD progression. People 
with type 2 diabetes are at a higher risk of developing CKD; hence, it is 
recommended that they undergo annual screening. However, resources may be 
limited, particularly in lower-to-middle income countries, and those at the 
highest risk of having an abnormal CKD screening result should be prioritised 
for screening. We have developed models to determine which patients are at a 
high risk of renal impairment. We have shown that, for people with type 2 
diabetes and no previous diagnosis of CKD stage 3-5, it is possible to use age, 
gender, body mass index, duration of type 2 diabetes and blood pressure 
information to detect those at a higher risk of a reduced glomerular filtration 
rate. When blood measurements are available, triglyceride and cholesterol 
measurements can be used to improve the estimate of the risk. Even though risk 
factors were associated with an increased urine albumin:creatinine ratio, we 
found no clinical benefit of using the model over a screen-all approach."
854,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of studies that used registered 
dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) or registered nurses (RNs) to deliver 
pharmacological therapy using protocols for diabetes, dyslipidemia, or 
hypertension.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A database search of PubMed, the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature was conducted of literature published from 1 January 
2000 to 31 December 2019.
RESULTS: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria, representing randomized 
controlled trials (12), retrospective (1) and prospective cohort design studies 
(6), and time series (1). In all, the studies include 7,280 participants with a 
median study duration of 12 months (range 6-25 months). Fifteen studies were led 
by RNs alone, two by RDNs, and three by a combination of RDNs and RNs. All 
demonstrated improvements in A1C, blood pressure, or lipids. Thirteen studies 
provided a lifestyle behavior change component in addition to medication 
protocols.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides evidence that RDN- and RN-led 
medication management using physician-approved protocols or treatment algorithms 
can lead to clinically significant improvements in diabetes, dyslipidemia, and 
hypertension management and is as good or better than usual care."
855,"Enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) increase the risk of 
hyperglycemia and adverse outcomes, including mortality, in patients with and 
without diabetes. A blood glucose target range of 140-180 mg/dL is recommended 
for hospitalized patients receiving artificial nutrition. Using a 
diabetes-specific EN formula, lowering the dextrose content, and using a 
hypocaloric PN formula have all been shown to prevent hyperglycemia and 
associated adverse outcomes. Insulin, given either subcutaneously or as a 
continuous infusion, is the mainstay of treatment for hyperglycemia. However, no 
subcutaneous insulin regimen has been shown to be superior to others. This 
review summarizes the evidence on and provides recommendations for the treatment 
of EN- and PN-associated hyperglycemia and offers strategies for hypoglycemia 
prevention. The authors also highlight their institution's protocol for the safe 
use of insulin in the PN bag. Randomized controlled trials evaluating safety and 
efficacy of targeted insulin therapy synchronized with different types of EN or 
PN delivery are needed."
856,"BACKGROUND: Recently, the in vitro blood brain barrier (BBB) models derived from 
human pluripotent stem cells have been given extensive attention in therapeutics 
due to the implications it has with the health of the central nervous system. It 
is essential to create an accurate BBB model in vitro in order to better 
understand the properties of the BBB and how it can respond to inflammatory 
stimulation and be passed by targeted or non-targeted cell therapeutics, more 
specifically extracellular vesicles.
METHODS: Brain-specific pericytes (iPCs) were differentiated from iPSK3 cells 
using dual SMAD signaling inhibitors and Wnt activation plus fibroblast growth 
factor 2 (FGF-2). The derived cells were characterized by immunostaining, flow 
cytometry and RT-PCR. In parallel, blood vessels organoids were derived using 
Wnt activation, BMP4, FGF2, VEGF and SB431542. The organoids were replated and 
treated with retinoic acid to enhance the blood brain barrier (BBB) features in 
the differentiated brain endothelial cells (iECs). Co-culture was performed for 
the iPCs and iECs in transwell system and 3-D microfluidics channels.
RESULTS: The derived iPCs expressed common markers PDGFRb and NG2, as well as 
brain-specific genes FOXF2, ABCC9, KCNJ8, and ZIC1. The derived iECs expressed 
common endothelial cell markers CD31, VE-cadherin, as well as BBB-associated 
genes BRCP, GLUT-1, PGP, ABCC1, OCLN, SLC2A1. The co-culture of the two cell 
types responded to the stimulation of amyloid β42 oligomers by the upregulation 
of expression of TNFa, IL6, NFKB, Casp3, SOD2 and TP53. The co-culture also 
showed the property of trans-endothelial electrical resistance. The 
proof-of-concept vascularization strategy was demonstrated in a 3-D 
microfluidics-based device.
CONCLUSION: The derived iPCs and iECs have brain-specific properties and the 
co-culture of iPCs and iECs provides an in vitro BBB model that show 
inflammatory response. This study has significance in establishing 
micro-physiological systems for neurological disease modeling and drug 
screening."
857,"BACKGROUND: Local tissue and serum metal ions have been shown to be elevated in 
some metal-on-metal and metal-on-polyethylene joint replacements. Local 
elevations have been linked to adverse local tissue reactions in some patients, 
and systemic elevation has been less commonly implicated cardiac and neurologic 
issues. Using a prospective study design, we aimed to identify the changes in 
serum metal ion levels after hip or knee megaprosthesis reconstruction. 
Furthermore, we will evaluate the occurrence of adverse effects and 
complications, possibly linked to metal ion elevation.
METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients receiving a Modular Universal Tumor 
Revision System megaprosthesis were enrolled. Blood samples were collected 
preoperatively and postoperatively to determine the serum ion concentrations of 
aluminum, chromium, cobalt, and silver. To evaluate the safety of the 
megaprostheses and the subsequently possible related (elevated) serum metal ion 
concentrations, all adverse effects and complications were registered until last 
outpatient clinic visit at the time of this study.
RESULTS: Compared to the preoperative median serum concentrations, the 
postoperative median serum concentrations of chromium, silver, and cobalt 
increased 11-fold, 62-fold, and 64-fold, respectively. The median serum 
concentration of aluminum increased with 16%. Elevations were primarily noted in 
patients with knee prostheses. Eight patients had no adverse effects or 
complications during the period between preoperative and postoperative blood 
sampling. One adverse effect directly related to the serum metal ion 
concentrations, namely argyria, was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documents significantly elevated concentrations of the 
metal ions, but only one adverse effect directly related to the metal ion 
concentrations was observed. Future studies are needed to further assess the 
impact of elevated metal ion levels after megaprostheses, specifically knee 
implants, which are metal-on-metal."
858,"Although breast vascular tumors are exceedingly rare, the benign group's most 
common tumor, the hemangioma, is frequently found in lumpectomy or mastectomy 
tissues during histological analyses. The 3 types of hemangiomas are capillary, 
cavernous, and venous. The most typical kind of hemangioma is cavernous. 
Cavernous hemangiomas are benign blood vessel tumors that arise from established 
blood vessels. The best imaging technique for examining the makeup of breast 
vessels is magnetic resonance imaging. In this article, we purposed to describe 
an exceptionally uncommon case of giant breast cavernous hemangioma."
859,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener 
granulomatosis, is a rare small vessel vasculitis affecting mainly Whites. The 
prevalence of GPA in the United States is estimated to be 3 of 100,000 
individuals. Classically, GPA affects upper airways, lungs, and kidneys, with 
the upper airways being the most common site. Occasionally, other organs 
affected by GPA include eyes, skin, joints, and the nervous system. The 
gastrointestinal system is rarely affected; however, some cases have been 
reported. In this case report, we present a patient with hemorrhagic gastritis 
and pancolitis consistent with GPA and discuss features from the literature of 
gastrointestinal manifestations in patients with GPA."
860,"Background. Hypodontia, or the absence of one or more teeth during tooth 
formation, is a highly prevalent dental anomaly. Nevertheless, the main causes 
are still unknown. Mutations in PAX9, MSX1, WNT10A, and AXIN2 genes are most 
commonly associated with non-syndromic tooth agenesis in the literature. This 
study investigated these candidate genes in an Iranian family with non-syndromic 
hypodontia and oligodontia. Methods. Peripheral blood samples of the proband and 
her family members were collected, and DNA extractions using the salting-out 
method were carried out. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger 
sequencing for candidate genes were performed. Results. A missense variant 
(rs4904210) was identified in the PAX9 gene, with one heterozygous missense 
variant (rs2240308) and one stop-gained variant (rs121908568) in the AXIN2 gene. 
Conclusion. By surveying similar studies and analyzing the variant in 
bioinformatics websites, we concluded that the heterozygous stop-gained variant 
rs121908568 in exon 8 of the AXIN2 gene could be responsible for tooth agenesis 
in the Iranian population."
861,"The incidence of periprosthetic proximal femoral fractures is increasing with 
the increase in arthroplasty being performed as well as aging populations. We 
describe an open reduction and internal fixation and cement-in-cement technique 
utilizing a well-fixed cement mantle. The advantages of this allow for a shorter 
operative time, reduction in risk of iatrogenic femoral fractures, and reduction 
in blood loss. This was a retrospective study reviewing 20 patients that 
underwent this technique for periprosthetic fractures. Thirty percent (n = 6) of 
patients underwent subsequent surgery. We had a 95% (n = 19) union rate with 1 
case refracturing through the old fracture. This technique can allow for shorter 
operative times and a lower physiological insult in reducible periprosthetic 
proximal femur fractures with a stable cement mantle."
862,"PURPOSE: To identify clinical factors associated with the need for future 
surgical intervention following closed globe ocular trauma.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SUBJECTS PARTICIPANTS AND/OR CONTROLS: Patients in the American Academy of 
Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS®) Registry with a diagnosis of 
closed globe ocular trauma occurring between 2013 and 2019, identified using 
International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision and Systematized 
Nomenclature of Medicine codes.
METHODS: Diagnosis codes were used to identify multiple concomitant diagnoses 
present on the date of closed globe ocular trauma. Survival analyses were 
performed for each outcome of interest, and linear regression was used to 
identify clinical factors associated with the risk of surgical intervention.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included retinal break treatment, retinal 
detachment (RD) repair, retinal break treatment or RD repair, glaucoma surgery, 
and cataract surgery.
RESULTS: Of the 206 807 patients with closed globe ocular trauma, 9648 underwent 
surgical intervention during the follow-up period (mean, 444 days): 1697 (0.8%) 
had RD repair, 1658 (0.8%) had retinal break treatment, 600 (0.3%) had glaucoma 
surgery, and 5693 (2.8%) had cataract surgery. Traumatic cataract was the 
strongest risk factor for cataract surgery (hazard ratio, 13.0; 95% confidence 
interval, 10.8-15.6), traumatic hyphema showed highest risk for glaucoma surgery 
(7.24; 4.60-11.4), and vitreous hemorrhage was the strongest risk factor for 
retinal break treatment and detachment repair (11.01; 9.18-13.2 and 14.2; 
11.5-17.6, respectively) during the first 60 days after trauma date. Vitreous 
hemorrhage was a risk factor for cataract surgery at > 60 days after trauma date 
only. Iris-angle injury was the strongest risk factor for glaucoma surgery > 60 
days after trauma, while vitreous hemorrhage remained the strongest factor for 
retinal break treatment and detachment repair at > 60 days. Traumatic hyphema 
was a risk factor for all surgical outcomes during all follow-up intervals.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of concomitant traumatic cataract, vitreous hemorrhage, 
traumatic hyphema, and other risk factors may increase the likelihood of 
requiring surgical intervention after closed globe ocular trauma."
863,"Recent reports have clearly demonstrated a tight correlation between obesity and 
elevated circulating uric acid levels (hyperuricemia). However, nearly all 
preclinical work in this area has been completed with male mice, leaving the 
field with a considerable gap in knowledge regarding female responses to obesity 
and hyperuricemia. This deficiency in sex as a biological variable extends 
beyond unknowns regarding uric acid (UA) to several important comorbidities 
associated with obesity including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To 
attempt to address this issue, herein we describe both phenotypic and metabolic 
responses to diet-induced obesity (DIO) in female mice. Six-week-old female 
C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (60% calories derived from fat) for 32 
weeks. The DIO female mice had significant weight gain over the course of the 
study, higher fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and elevated 
plasma insulin levels compared to age-matched on normal chow. While these 
classic indices of DIO and NAFLD were observed such as increased circulating 
levels of ALT and AST, there was no difference in circulating UA levels. Obese 
female mice also demonstrated increased hepatic triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, 
and cholesteryl ester. In addition, several markers of hepatic inflammation were 
significantly increased. Also, alterations in the expression of redox-related 
enzymes were observed in obese mice compared to lean controls including 
increases in extracellular superoxide dismutase (Sod3), heme oxygenase (Ho)-1, 
and xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh). Interestingly, hepatic UA levels were 
significantly elevated (~2-fold) in obese mice compared to their lean 
counterparts. These data demonstrate female mice assume a similar metabolic 
profile to that reported in several male models of obesity in the context of 
alterations in glucose tolerance, hepatic steatosis, and elevated transaminases 
(ALT and AST) in the absence of hyperuricemia affirming the need for further 
study."
864,"Background: Osteopetrosis includes a variety of rare inherited skeletal 
disorders characterized by increased bone density and thickness. It has 
different clinical forms, including infantile autosomal recessive, intermediate 
autosomal recessive, and late-onset autosomal dominant forms. Intermediate 
autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (IARO) displays high variability. Case Report: 
A 10-year-old male presented to our pediatrics emergency department with 
abdominal distension, low-grade fever, and swelling of the right maxilla with 
associated discharge. His local physician had treated the lesion with drainage 
and aspiration of pus without improvement. Examination revealed pallor, 
hepatosplenomegaly, poor dentition, and dental caries. Eye examination showed 
reduced visual acuity, absent color vision, nystagmus, and bilateral optic nerve 
atrophy. Laboratory investigations showed anemia and thrombocytopenia. 
Radiography yielded classic features of osteopetrosis. Detailed intraoral 
examination revealed an area of exposed necrotic bone in the alveolar region of 
the right maxilla, leading to a diagnosis of IARO with underlying osteomyelitis. 
The intraoral wound was treated with bismuth iodoform paraffin paste dressing, 
and the infection was treated with antibiotics. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were 
managed supportively by transfusion of packed red blood cells and platelets. 
Conclusion: IARO commonly presents with multiple fractures, so the absence of 
fractures in our patient was unusual. Studies evaluating the intermediate 
variant are meager; hence, documenting its various presentations is essential to 
aid physicians in making early diagnoses. Osteomyelitis of the jaws is a feared 
complication in these patients. Therefore, practitioners need to be cautious of 
infections of dental origin."
865,"Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has been reported to 
be a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death. The 
clinical presentation of SCAD varies from asymptomatic to sudden death. 
Pregnancy is associated with SCAD, and autoimmune diseases, especially systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE), may play an important role in SCAD etiology. Case 
Report: A 37-year-old female with hypertension, SLE, a history of preeclampsia 
with 3 cesarean deliveries, and an active smoking habit presented to the 
emergency department with chest pain. On arrival, the patient was hypertensive 
with blood pressure of 152/122 mm Hg and a normal heart rate and respiratory 
rate. Given the patient's history of SLE and preeclampsia, antiphospholipid 
antibodies were tested. The anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 immunoglobulin G 
concentration was elevated at 30 U/mL, and lupus anticoagulant was positive. 
Electrocardiogram showed minimum ST elevation in lead V2. Initial troponin was 
0.1 ng/mL, with a peak of 54.5 ng/mL after 6 hours. Aspirin 325 mg was 
administered, and the patient underwent urgent cardiac catheterization. 
Intravascular angiography showed evidence of intimal flap (mid left anterior 
descending artery) spontaneous dissection with subintimal hematoma. The 
angioplasty resulted in successful stent placement in the mid left anterior 
descending artery. Conclusion: SCAD diagnosis is challenging and requires a high 
index of suspicion. This case shows the challenge of early diagnosis of SCAD and 
highlights its association with autoimmune diseases, specifically SLE. Early 
recognition of this pathology results in better outcomes."
866,"PURPOSE: Immune system modulation, with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
has drastically changed the field of oncology. Strong preclinical data indicate 
that radiation therapy (RT) may enhance the response rate to such drugs via in 
situ vaccination, although these data do not consider immune radiotoxicity. This 
meta-analysis investigates whether radio-induced lymphopenia (RIL) is associated 
with overall survival (OS).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic literature search and quantitative analysis 
were planned, conducted, and reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses 
checklists. The literature from January 1990 to March 2021 was searched to 
identify clinical studies with OS data in patients treated with RT and 
presenting with lymphopenia. A random-effect model was employed for the 
meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Publication 
bias was estimated using a P-curve analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 56 studies with 13 223 patients and 11 types of cancers were 
selected. The mean follow-up time was 35.9 months. Over a third of patients had 
RIL (37.25%). After removing outlying studies (n = 14), the between-study 
heterogeneity variance was estimated at t2 = 0.018 (P = .01) with an I2 value of 
36.0% (95% confidence interval, 6%-56%). The results showed that RIL was 
significantly associated with worse OS (hazard ratio: 1.70; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.55-1.86; P < .01; 95% prediction interval, 1.27-2.26). A subgroup 
analysis was performed based on the type of primary tumor, and a difference 
between the subgroups was found (P < .01). Based on the P-curve analysis, a 
significant evidential value was found, and no significant publication bias was 
identified among the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: RIL is a significant prognostic factor for mortality in virtually 
all solid cancers. Pooled-effect estimates indicate a significantly reduced risk 
of death in patients without RIL. Tailoring RT regimens to spare the immune 
system and updating dosimetric constraints for new organs at risk, such as major 
blood vessels, organs with rich blood supplies, bones, and all lymph node areas, 
may improve prognoses."
867,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is the most modifiable factor associated with 
cardiovascular events and complications. The conventional blood pressure (BP) 
meter method is simple but is limited in terms of real-time monitoring abnormal 
BP. Therefore, the development of a multifunction smartwatch (HUAWEI WATCH D) 
sphygmomanometer could significantly improve integrated BP monitoring.
METHODS: We enrolled 361 subjects from Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 
China to validate the accuracy of the smartwatch versatile sphygmomanometer 
using ISO 81060-2:2018. Resting and ambulatory BP accuracy of the smartwatch 
were compared with gold standard clinical sphygmomanometers using ISO 
81060-2:2018 guidelines, the accuracy of 24 h systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
circadian rhythm monitoring, and diurnal high SBP alert for this smartwatch were 
assessed using a confusion matrix approach. Additionally, we analyzed online 
users of different ages for compliance.
RESULTS: Eighty-five subjects underwent resting BP measurements; the mean 
resting BP differences between two devices were -0.683 ± 6.203 mmHg (SBP) (P = 
0.723) and 1.628 ± 5.028 mmHg (diastolic blood pressure, DBP) (P = 0.183). In 35 
subjects' ambulatory BP measurements, the mean differences of ambulatory BP were 
-1.943 ± 5.475 mmHg (SBP) (P = 0.923) and 3.195 ± 5.862 mmHg (DBP) (P = 0.065). 
All data complied with ISO 81060-2:2018 guidelines (mean ≤ ±5 mmHg and standard 
deviation ≤ ±8 mmHg) with no significant differences. Positive predictive values 
(PPV) of resting SBP and DBP were 0.635 and 0.671, respectively. The PPV of 
ambulatory SBP and DBP were 0.686. Also, 24 h SBP circadian rhythm monitoring 
was performed in 107 subjects: accuracy = 0.850, specificity = 0.864, 
precision/PPV = 0.833, sensitivity = 0.833, and F1-measure (F1) = 0.833. The 
accuracy, specificity, precision, sensitivity, and F1 values in 85 subjects 
undergoing diurnal high SBP alerting were 0.858, 0.876, 0.706, 0.809, and 0.754, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When compared with the gold standard clinical sphygmomanometer, 
smartwatch results were consistent and accurate. Online user feedback showed 
that elderly individuals cared more about BP monitoring accuracy, with better 
compliance."
868,"BACKGROUND: MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is related to hypertension and cardiac 
remodelling. Left atrium (LA) dilation is highly sensitive to small haemodynamic 
changes in the left ventricle (LV) that are induced by hypertension. This study 
aimed to elucidate the relationship between miR-21 expression and LA dilation in 
elderly patients with essential hypertension (EH).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, one hundred elderly patients with EH 
were recruited for the study. According to their left atrium diameters (LADs), 
the patients were divided into the LA dilation group [42 patients (42%)] and the 
no-LA dilation group [58 patients (58%)]. The serum levels of miR-21 and 
chemical biomarkers used in the clinic, such as creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, 
uric acid, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Lp(a), 
apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), and apolipoprotein B, were measured. All the patients 
underwent echocardiographic examination, and the LAD, interventricular septum 
(IVS), right atrium diameter (RAD), right ventricle diameter (RVD), left 
ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular end-systolic 
diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured.
RESULTS: The levels of miR-21 [8.02 (5.21, 14.39) vs. 6.05 (3.81, 8.95), P = 
0.011] and LVEF (67.02 ± 3.82 vs. 64.14 ± 4.43, P = 0.001) were higher in the LA 
dilation group. The levels of creatinine [70.40 (64.45, 80.15) vs. 63.9(60.1, 
73.43)], P = 0.020] were higher in the no-LA dilation group. The levels of HDLC 
(r = - 0.209, P = 0.037), apoA1 (r = -0.269, P = 0.007) and RAD (r = 0.203, P = 
0.043) were significantly correlated with miR-21 expression. The LAD was 
significantly correlated with the RAD (r = 0.287, P = 0.004), RVD (r = 0.450, P 
< 0.001), LVEDD (r = 0.248, P = 0.013) and LVEF (r = 0.232, P = 0.020). 
Multivariate logistic regression revealed that miR-21 significantly influenced 
LA dilation in elderly patients with EH (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating serum levels of miR-21 are increased in elderly 
patients with EH with LA dilation. miR-21 levels are significantly correlated 
with LA dilation in elderly patients with EH, and miR-21 may be a factor related 
to the clinical pathophysiological occurrence of and treatment for the 
progression of hypertension-related early heart damage in EH patients."
869,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) provokes an early 
injury response, partially represented by dynamic changes in inflammatory 
markers. TAVR greatly benefits the elderly and we aimed to determine whether 
increased inflammatory markers post-TAVR in octagenerians were different than 
their younger counterparts and whether it was associated with adverse clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent 
transfemoral TAVR from January 2010 to December 2021 were enrolled. Total white 
blood cells (WBC) count and subpopulation dynamics were evaluated.
RESULTS: Five-hundred and seven patients were finally included in the study, 65% 
of these patients were 80 or more years old (54% female, median age 84 [82-87]) 
years, with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. In patients aged above 80 years 
(patients ≥ 80), we noticed significant kinetic changes in the WBC and their 
differential cellular subpopulations (P < 0.0001) between admission and early 
days post-procedure. This was evident by a significant increase in total WBC 
(median 7.1 to 9.4) and absolute neutrophil count (median 4.7 to 7.4), 
neutrophil-lymphocyte (NL) ratio (median 2.82 to 7.21), and a meaningful 
decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (median 1.5 to 1.0). Implantation of 
self-expandable valves (SEVs) was associated with a more pronounced inflammatory 
response than balloon-expandable valves (BEVs). Higher WBC and neutrophil counts 
were associated with higher mortality and major vascular complications at 30 
days, in addition, higher neutrophil counts and NL ratios were found to be 
correlated to arrhythmia at 30 days with P values of 0.04 and 0.028, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first description of a differential age-related 
inflammatory response in patients after TAVR, which shows an association between 
inflammatory markers post procedure and clinical outcome. Nevertheless, survival 
rates were similar in the elderly population and in younger patients, despite 
the presence of comorbid conditions."
870,"Red blood cells (RBCs) clump together under low flow conditions in a process 
called RBC aggregation, which can alter RBC perfusion in a microvascular 
network. As elevated RBC aggregation is commonly associated with cardiovascular 
and inflammatory diseases, a better understanding of aggregation is essential. 
Unlike RBC aggregation in polymer solutions which can be well explained by 
polymer depletion theory, plasma-mediated RBC aggregation has features that best 
match explanations with cross-bridging mechanisms. Previous studies have 
demonstrated the dominant role of fibrinogen (Fg) in promoting aggregate 
formation and recent cell-force spectroscopy (CFS) experiments on interacting 
RBC doublets in plasma have reported an inverse relationship between 
disaggregation force and the adhesive contact area between RBCs. This has led 
investigators to revisit the hypothesis of inter-RBC cross-bridging which 
involves cross-bridge migration under interfacial tension during the forced 
disaggregation of RBC aggregates. In this study, we developed the cross-bridge 
migration model (CBMM) in plasma that mechanistically represents the migrating 
cross-bridge hypothesis. Transport of mobile Fg cross-bridges (mFg) was 
calculated using a convection-diffusion transport equation with our novel 
introduction of convective cross-bridge drift that arises due to intercellular 
friction. By parametrically transforming the diffusivity of mFg in the CBMM, we 
were able to match experimental observations of both RBC doublet formation 
kinematics and RBC doublet disaggregation forces under optical tweezers tension. 
We found that non-specific cross-bridging promotes spontaneous growth of 
adhesion area between RBC doublets whereas specific cross-bridging tends to 
prevent adhesion area growth. Our CBMM was also able to correlate Fg 
concentration shifts from healthy population blood plasma to SLE (lupus) 
condition blood plasma with the observed increase in doublet disaggregation 
forces for the RBC doublets in SLE plasma."
871,"OBJECTIVES: This is a retrospective study that set out to assess the safety, 
feasibility and cost savings of temporary relaxed blood test monitoring for 
patients on MTX under the rheumatology service that was rolled out during the 
coronavirus pandemic.
METHODS: This is a single-centre study that reviewed the blood tests of all 
patients who received an MTX prescription from the trust between December 2019 
and November 2020. After the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
the blood testing intervals and findings were analysed and collated. The cost of 
the blood tests was obtained from the laboratory.
RESULTS: A total of 1194 patients were identified as having received an MTX 
prescription. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 462 patients were 
included. Of these, 395 (85%) patients had a blood test within the standard 
3-month schedule and 67 had blood tests within the relaxed blood monitoring 
schedule. Six patients had an abnormality identified on their blood tests, but 
no harm was caused by any of these abnormalities. The intervention resulted in a 
cost savings of at least £1187 from the blood test costs alone.
CONCLUSION: MTX is a widely used steroid-sparing agent that requires regular 
blood test monitoring to reduce adverse outcomes for patients. During 
extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic, relaxing the interval between 
monitoring blood tests in stable patients is a feasible intervention. A relaxed 
monitoring blood test interval for a set period is safe, achievable and cost 
effective."
872,"COVID-19 appeared in December 2019, needing efforts of science. Besides, a range 
of light therapies (PDT, Ultraviolet UV, Laser) has shown scientific 
alternatives to conventional decontamination therapies. METHODS: Investigating 
the efficacy of light-based therapies for environment decontamination against 
SARS-CoV2, a PRISMA systematic review of Phototherapies against SARS-CoV or 
MERS-CoV species discussing changes in viral RT-PCR was done. After searching 
MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS we have found studies about cell cultures 
irradiation (18), blood components irradiation (10), N95 masks decontamination 
(03), inanimate surface decontamination (03), aerosols decontamination (03), 
hospital rooms irradiation (01) with PDT, LED, and UV therapy. The best quality 
results showed an effective low time and dose UV irradiation for environments 
and inanimate surfaces without human persons as long as the devices have safety 
elements dependent on the surfaces, viral charge, humidity, radiant exposure. To 
interpersonal contamination in humans, PDT or LED therapy seems very promising 
and are encouraged."
873,"BACKGROUND: The average frequency of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 is 
still high despite low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylactic. Global 
hemostasis assays, particularly thrombodynamics (TD), known to be sensitive to 
both hypercoagulation and heparin effects, could potentially be useful for 
individual management of anticoagulant therapy.
METHODS: A total of 74 patients with lung involvement >50% were randomized into 
two groups: Group A (44 patients) received weight-based dosing of LMWH, and 
Group B (30 patients) received the first LMWH dose by a weight-based dosing 
protocol and then received an adjusted dose based on TD daily results. The 
endpoints of the study were thrombosis and bleeding as well as discharge or 
death of the patient.
RESULTS: The incidence of thrombosis was 3 times lower in Group B under TD 
control compared to Group A without TD control: 7% versus 23 respectively 
(p = .05). The relative risk of thrombosis if the average clot growth rate V in 
TD exceeded the threshold value of 25 μm/min was 14.3 (p = .0005, 95% confidence 
interval 3.2-63.7). There were no clinically significant bleeding episodes in 
Group B while there were 7% in unregulated Group A. Mortality in Group B under 
TD control was lower than that in Group A without control: 27% versus 36%, 
respectively (p = .13).
CONCLUSIONS: The dosing LMWH under thrombodynamics control in severe patients 
with COVID-19 allows for a significant reduction in thrombotic complications. 
Long-term hypercoagulation revealed by thrombodynamics (3 and more days) is a 
strong predictor of thrombosis (AUC = 0.83)."
874,"OBJECTIVES: Sedentary life style separated during COVID-19 pandemic. Patients 
with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are vulnerable with sedentary life style. 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 8 weeks of 
combined and high intensity interval training (HIIT) on C Reactive protein, 
galectin-3, leptin, fibrinogen and insulin resistance index in coronary heart 
disease after COVID-19.
METHODS: Thirty-six cardiovascular patients (55.14 ± 1.4 years, 78.6 ± 5.1 kg) 
were divided into three groups of combined exercise (n=13), HIIT (n=12) and 
control group (n=11). Combined exercise consisted of aerobic (4 weeks) and 
aerobic + HIIT exercise (4 weeks), three sessions per weeks. The protocol of the 
HIIT group included performing high intensity interval training, three sessions 
per weeks for 8 weeks. Blood samples were taken 24 h before the first training 
session and 48 h after the last training. C Reactive protein (CRP), galectin-3, 
leptin, fibrinogen measured with ELISA kit.
RESULTS: CRP, galectin-3 and fibrinogen decreased significantly after 8 weeks of 
combined training and HIIT (compare to pre-test). Also, insulin resistance index 
after 8 weeks of combined exercise showed a significant decrease compare to 
pre-test (p<0.05). After 8 weeks, CRP, galectin-3 and insulin resistance 
significantly decreased compare to control group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In the patient with CVD, combined exercise training may be more 
effective than HIIT in reducing metabolic and heart risk factors after an 
epidemic such as COVID-19. However, change of leptin need to more studies."
875,"Rapid positive blood culture reporting allows early and appropriate treatment of 
severe infections to improve patient prognosis. This study evaluated performance 
of the VersaTREK system with gas pressure detection and tornado stirring method 
and the conventional BacT/ALERT 3D system. Time to positivity (TTP) of simulated 
blood cultures without whole blood using 17 ATCC strains was faster with 
VersaTREK than BacT/ALERT 3D, averaging 6.3 h in aerobic bottles and 12.7 hours 
in anaerobic bottles. In simulated blood cultures with whole blood using 53 
clinical isolates, on average, VersaTREK was faster in aerobic bottles by 6.5 h 
but slower in anaerobic bottles by 3.8 h. Fifty of 53 simulated blood cultures 
with whole blood (94%) showed fastest TTP with VersaTREK. TTP of VersaTREK for 
anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens, 
Helicobacter cinaedi, and Candida glabrata was fast, and viable bacteria numbers 
in bottles using the Miles and Misra method increased quickly."
876,"BACKGROUND: Register-based reproductive and perinatal databases rarely contain 
detailed information from medical records or repeated measurements throughout 
pregnancy and delivery. This lack of enriched pregnancy and birth data led to 
the initiation of the Swedish Stockholm-Gotland Perinatal Cohort (SGPC).
OBJECTIVES: To describe the strengths of the SGPC, as well as the unique 
research questions that can be addressed using this cohort.
POPULATION: The SGPC is a prospectively collected, population-based cohort that 
includes all births (from 22 completed gestational weeks onwards) between 1 
January 2008 and 15 June 2020 in the Stockholm and Gotland regions of Sweden (N 
335,153 singleton and N 11,025 multiple pregnancies).
DESIGN: Descriptive study.
METHODS: The SGPC is based on the electronic medical records of women and their 
infants. The medical record system is used for all antenatal clinic visits and 
admissions, delivery and neonatal admissions, as well as postpartum clinical 
visits. SGPC has been further enriched with data linkages to 10 Swedish National 
Health Care and Quality Registers.
PRELIMINARY RESULTS: In contrast to other reproductive and perinatal databases 
available in Sweden, including the Medical Birth Register and the Pregnancy 
Register, SGPC contains highly detailed medical record data, including 
time-varying serial measurements for physiological parameters throughout 
pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum, for both mother and infant. These strengths 
have enabled studies that were previously inconceivable; the effects of serial 
measurements of pregnancy weight gain, changes in haemoglobin counts and blood 
pressure during pregnancy, fetal weight estimations by ultrasound, duration of 
stages and phases of labour, cervical dilatation and oxytocin use during 
delivery, and constructing reference curves for umbilical cord pH.
CONCLUSIONS: The SGPC-with its rich content, repeated measurements and linkages 
to numerous health care and quality registers-is a unique cohort that enables 
high-quality perinatal studies that would otherwise not be possible."
877,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is an important issue causing both health hazards and 
socioeconomic losses. Kumamoto City regularly performs Obesity-related Lifestyle 
Disease Screenings, including physical examinations, blood tests, and special 
examination referrals, for fourth grade children with obesity. We 
retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of the screenings conducted from 2011 to 
2020.
METHODS: The percentage of overweight was calculated using the data from the 
Lifestyle Disease Screening Board of Kumamoto City from 2011 to 2020. The 
percentage of overweight, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, and 
laboratory test outcomes of the Secondary Lifestyle Disease Test were evaluated.
RESULTS: The proportion of children with obesity in grades 1-4 in Kumamoto was 
higher than the national average, while that in grades 5-6 was lower than the 
national average. Among the fourth graders screened, 6521 were eligible for the 
Secondary Lifestyle Disease Tests, of which 3291 children underwent the test. In 
the testing, 22.3% of the boys and 29.1% of the girls were nonobese. Moreover, 
25.9% of the boys and 19.2% of the girls, including nonobese children, required 
further examination and intervention. Notably, 62.1% of the boys and 46.2% of 
the girls who were nonobese and required special examination had waist 
circumferences ≥75 cm or waist-to-height ratios ≥0.5.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity-related Lifestyle Disease Screenings contributed to 
preventing obesity progression. Abdominal circumference measurements may be 
useful in determining nonobese children at a risk of lifestyle diseases."
878,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are epithelial malignancies that can arise from 
multiple tissues. Gastrointestinal (GI) NETs are the most common; in this review 
of extra-abdominal carcinoid tumors, we focus our discussion on bronchial and 
thymic carcinoid tumors. Bronchial carcinoid tumors comprise a quarter of all 
NETs and less than 2% of all lung cancers. Thymic carcinoid tumors are extremely 
rare, accounting for 5% of thymic tumors. Both bronchial and thymic carcinoid 
tumors are histologically classified as either typical or atypical based on 
their mitotic rate (less than 2 or 2-10 mitoses per 10 high-powered fields 
(HPF), respectively). Both bronchial and thymic carcinoids can present with 
symptoms of obstruction and potentially carcinoid syndrome. The gold standard of 
management of bronchial and thymic carcinoid tumors is surgical resection. For 
patients with advanced disease, first-line systemic therapy is generally 
somatostatin analog monotherapy with octreotide or lanreotide. In patients with 
refractory disease, therapy generally involves peptide receptor radioligand 
therapy, everolimus, or cytotoxic chemotherapy. There are ongoing, prospective 
trials comparing the mainstays of systemic therapy for these patients, as well 
as ongoing evaluations of immune checkpoint inhibitors and multi-kinase 
inhibitors. Prognosis for both bronchial and thymic carcinoid tumors depends on 
histologic grade, local versus invasive disease, and extent of metastases. 
Herein we provide a summary of the pathophysiologic and clinical background, the 
current state of the field in diagnosis and management, and note of key ongoing 
prospective trials for patients with bronchial and thymic carcinoid tumors."
879,"Thrombosis remains a major problem in our society, manifesting across multiple 
demographic groups and with high associated morbidity and mortality. Thrombus 
development is the result of a complex mechanism in which multiple cell types 
and soluble factors play a crucial role. One cell that has gained the most 
attention in recent years is the neutrophil. This key member of the innate 
immune system can form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to 
activating stimuli in circulation. NETs form a scaffold for thrombus formation, 
both initiating the process and stabilizing the final product. As the first 
responders of the host immune system, neutrophils have the flexibility to 
recognize a variety of molecules and can quickly interact with a range of 
different cell types. This trait makes them sensitive to exogenous stimuli. NET 
formation in response to pathogens is well established, leading to 
immune-mediated thrombus formation or immunothrombosis. NETs can also be formed 
during sterile inflammation through the activation of neutrophils by fellow 
immune cells including platelets, or activated endothelium. In chronic 
inflammatory settings, NETs can ultimately promote the development of tissue 
fibrosis, with organ failure as an end-stage outcome. In this review, we discuss 
the different pathways through which neutrophils can be activated toward NET 
formation and how these processes can result in a shared outcome: thrombus 
formation. Finally, we evaluate these different interactions and mechanisms for 
their potential as therapeutic targets, with neutrophil-targeted therapies 
providing a future approach to treating thrombosis. In contrast to current 
practices, such treatment could result in reduced pathogenic blood clot 
formation without increasing the risk of bleeding."
880,"BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of prolonged steep Trendelenburg position and 
CO2 pneumoperitoneum during robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RC) on 
intraoperative conditions and immediate postoperative recovery remains to be 
assessed. The current study investigates intraoperative and immediate 
postoperative outcomes for open RC (ORC) versus robot-assisted RC with 
intracorporal urinary diversion (iRARC) in a blinded randomised trial. We 
hypothesised that ORC would result in a faster haemodynamic and respiratory 
post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) recovery compared to iRARC.
METHODS: This study is a predefined sub-analysis of a single-centre, 
double-blinded, randomised feasibility study. Fifty bladder cancer patients were 
randomly assigned to ORC (n=25) or iRARC (n=25). Patients, PACU staff, and ward 
personnel were blinded to the surgical technique. Both randomisation arms 
followed the same anaesthesiologic procedure, fluid treatment plan, and PACU 
care. The primary outcome was immediate postoperative recovery using a 
standardised PACU Discharge Criteria (PACU-DC) score. Secondary outcomes 
included respiration- and arterial O2 saturation scores as well as perioperative 
interventions and recordings.
RESULTS: All patients underwent the allocated treatment. The total PACU-DC score 
was highest six hours postoperatively with no difference in the total score 
between randomisation arms (p=0.80). Both the ORC and iRARC groups maintained a 
mean respiration- and arterial O2 saturation score below 1 (out of 3) throughout 
PACU stay. The iRARC patients had significantly, but clinically acceptable, 
higher maximum airway pressure and arterial blood pressure, as well as lower 
minimum pH levels. The ORC group received significantly more opioids after 
extubation but marginally less analgesics in the PACU, compared to the iRARC 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged Trendelenburg position and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was 
well-tolerated during iRARC, and immediate postoperative recovery was similar 
for ORC and iRARC patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

881,"BACKGROUND Schwannoma is an uncommon benign tumor that develops from Schwann 
cells in the peripheral nervous system; 25-50% of such tumors occur in the head 
and neck. A rare variety of schwannoma, known as an ancient schwannoma, exhibits 
calcification, cystic degeneration, hemorrhage, myxoid stroma, pleomorphism, and 
nuclear hyperchromatism. Such characteristics may contribute to this tumor being 
incorrectly diagnosed as malignant. Almost all reported intra-oral ancient 
schwannomas behave innocuously. CASE REPORT A 20-year-old man presented to the 
oral surgery clinic with a right facial swelling that began a few months before. 
CT and MRI were performed and showed a well-defined cystic lesion anterior to 
the right masseter muscle, located in the subcutaneous area and measuring 
28×24×20 mm. No extension to the surrounding tissues nor any other similar 
lesions were seen. Microscopic examination revealed an encapsulated nodular mass 
with cystic cavities, hemorrhage, and variably distributed myxoid and hyalinized 
stroma. The tumor demonstrated 2 distinct cell distributions: hypercellular 
areas (Antoni A) and myxoid hypocellular areas (Antoni B). Focal areas in 
high-power magnification showed atypical cells with hyperchromatic and 
pleomorphic nuclei. The tumor cells showed diffuse positivity for S-100 in IHC. 
The diagnosis of ancient schwannoma was made. At 1-year follow-up, there was no 
evidence of nerve injury or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS One more case of oral 
ancient schwannoma is added to the literature. This is the first reported in 
Saudi Arabia. It is prudent to be familiar with the degenerative and cytologic 
alterations of ancient schwannoma, as this may limit the likelihood of 
misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of this benign tumor, with an excellent 
prognosis."
882,"African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious viral hemorrhagic disease that affects 
domestic pigs and wild boar. The disease is notifiable to the World Organization 
of Animal Health (WOAH), and causes significant deaths and economic losses. 
There is currently no fully licensed vaccine available. As a result, early 
identification of the causative agent, ASF virus (ASFV), is crucial for the 
implementation of control measures. PCR and real-time PCR are the 
WOAH-recommended standard methods for the direct detection of ASFV. However, 
under special field conditions or in simple or remote field laboratories, there 
may be no sophisticated equipment or even stable electricity available. Under 
these circumstances, point-of-care systems can be put in place. Along these 
lines, a previously published, rapid, reliable, and electricity-free extraction 
method (TripleE) was used to isolate viral nucleic acid from diagnostic 
specimens. With this tool, nucleic acid extraction from up to eight diagnostic 
samples can be realized in one run in less than 10 min. In addition, the 
possibility of completely omitting viral DNA extraction was analyzed with 
so-called direct real-time PCR protocols using ASFV original samples diluted to 
1:40 in RNase-free water. Furthermore, three real-time PCR cyclers, developed 
for use under field conditions (IndiField, Liberty16 and UF-300 GenecheckerTM), 
were comparatively applied for the sensitive high-speed detection of ASFV 
genomes, with overall PCR run times between 20 and 54 min. Depending on the 
viral DNA extraction/releasing method used and the point-of-care cycler applied, 
a total time for detection of 30 to 60 min for up to eight samples was feasible. 
As expected, the limitations in analytical sensitivity were positively 
correlated to the analysis time. These limitations are acceptable for ASFV 
diagnostics due to the expected high ASFV genome loads in diseased animals or 
carcasses."
883,"Although past research has shown an association between obesity and herpes 
simplex virus infection, the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and 
herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) recurrence has never been investigated. In this 
study, we included HSK patients who received oral valacyclovir as prophylactic 
treatment between January 2016 and January 2021. Recurrence, possible risk 
factors, and the time to recurrence were recorded during follow-ups. Among the 
56 patients included in this study, recurrence was reported in 21 (37.5%) 
patients. The age at disease onset and mean follow-up time were not 
significantly different in the recurrence and non-recurrence groups. However, in 
the Cox regression analysis, BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2 was noted as the variable having 
significant correlation with recurrence (p = 0.01 in univariate analysis and p = 
0.001 in multivariate analysis). In conclusion, overweight and obesity were 
revealed as risk factors for HSK recurrence in patients receiving long-term 
antiviral prophylaxis. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate 
acyclovir concentrations in the blood or aqueous humour in order to achieve 
desirable prophylactic effects, especially in the overweight and obese patients."
884,"Senecavirus A (SVA) is a causative agent for vesicular disease in swine, which 
is clinically indistinguishable from other vesicular diseases of swine including 
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Recently, it was reported that buffalo in 
Guangdong, China were experiencing clinical symptoms similar to FMD including 
mouth ulcers and lameness tested positive for SVA. The objective of this study 
was to determine the susceptibility of cattle (Bos taurus) to SVA infection. 
Initial in vitro work using the PrimeFlow assay demonstrated that bovine cell 
lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from cattle were susceptible to SVA 
infection. Subsequently, six colostrum-deprived Holstein calves were challenged 
with SVA intranasally. No vesicular lesions were observed after challenge. 
Serum, oral, nasal, and rectal swabs tested for SVA nucleic acid did not support 
significant viral replication and there was no evidence of seroconversion. 
Therefore, demonstrating cattle from this study were not susceptible to 
experimental SVA infection."
885,"Goose astrovirus (GAstV) is an important pathogen causing visceral gout and high 
mortality in goslings, which has broken out and spread across China. In 2021, a 
disease characterized by urate deposition on the visceral surface and 30% 
mortality occurred in commercial adult Landaise geese in Zhejiang Province, 
China. A systematic study identified an infecting astrovirus, designated ZJCX, 
that was efficiently isolated from a diseased goose with a chicken 
hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (LMH). In contrast to other GAstVs 
originating from goslings, ZJCX caused cytopathogenic effects in LMH cells, and 
the crystalline arrangement of viral particles was observed through transmission 
electron microscopy. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide homology 
comparison revealed that ZJCX isolate belongs to the genotype II cluster of 
GAstVs and displays 97.8-98.4% identity with other GAstV II strains. However, 
several specific mutations occurred in the polyprotein and capsid protein 
regions. Moreover, a pathogenicity assessment of ZJCX with a gosling model was 
conducted, and typical visceral gout was reproduced and led to 18% mortality. 
The viral loads of ZJCX in the blood, kidney, and liver were detected with 
specific primers after inoculation, which demonstrated that the kidney and liver 
presented viral loads peaking at seven days post-inoculation (dpi). Biochemical 
parameter examination showed that AST, ALT, γ-GT, UA, and BUN levels were 
significantly increased by GAstV, whereas body weight was reduced. Overall, this 
study indicated that the GAstV isolate could infect adult geese, and the results 
regarding the viral loads and biochemical parameters induced by ZJCX provide 
insight into GAstV pathogenicity."
886,"The analysis of the HIV-1 proviral dynamics after superinfection in the context 
of both natural and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-mediated suppression could 
yield unique insights into understanding the persistence of viral variants that 
seeded the infected cells at different times. In this study, we performed a 
longitudinal analysis of the env diversity of PBMC-associated HIV DNA 
quasispecies in two HIV controllers (EEC09 and VC32) that were superinfected 
with subtype F1 viruses several years after primoinfection with subtype B 
viruses. Patient EEC09 started ART soon after superinfection, while patient VC32 
maintained a natural control of virus replication for at least six years 
following the superinfection. Our analysis revealed no significant temporal 
changes in the overall proportion of primo-infecting and superinfecting proviral 
variants over 2-3 years after superinfection in both HIV controllers. Upon the 
introduction of ART, individual EEC09 displayed no evidence of HIV-infected cell 
turnover or viral evolution, while subject VC32 displayed some level of 
HIV-infected cell reseeding and detectable evolution (divergence) of both viral 
variants. These results confirm that proviral variants that seeded the reservoir 
at different times throughout infection could persist for long periods under 
fully suppressive ART or natural viremic control, but the HIV-1 proviral 
dynamics could be different in both settings."
887,"The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a multicellular microenvironment that plays an 
important role in regulating bidirectional transport to and from the central 
nervous system (CNS). Infections by many acutely infectious viruses such as 
alphaviruses and flaviviruses are known to impact the integrity of the 
endothelial lining of the BBB. Infection by Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus 
(VEEV) through the aerosol route causes significant damage to the integrity of 
the BBB, which contributes to long-term neurological sequelae. An effective 
therapeutic intervention strategy should ideally not only control viral load in 
the host, but also prevent and/or reverse deleterious events at the BBB. Two 
dimensional monocultures, including trans-well models that use endothelial 
cells, do not recapitulate the intricate multicellular environment of the BBB. 
Complex in vitro organ-on-a-chip models (OOC) provide a great opportunity to 
introduce human-like experimental models to understand the mechanistic 
underpinnings of the disease state and evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic 
candidates in a highly relevant manner. Here we demonstrate the utility of a 
neurovascular unit (NVU) in analyzing the dynamics of infection and 
proinflammatory response following VEEV infection and therapeutic effectiveness 
of omaveloxolone to preserve BBB integrity and decrease viral and inflammatory 
load."
888,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes as a 
biological vector. Because of its biting behavior, the widespread snow-melt 
mosquito Aedes punctor could be a potential bridge vector for WNV to humans and 
nonhuman mammals. However, little is known on its role in transmission of WNV. 
The aim of this study was to determine the vector competence of German Ae. 
punctor for WNV lineages 1 and 2. Field-collected larvae and pupae were reared 
to adults and offered infectious blood containing either an Italian WNV lineage 
1 or a German WNV lineage 2 strain via cotton stick feeding. Engorged females 
were incubated for 14/15 or 21 days at 18 °C. After incubation; surviving 
mosquitoes were dissected and forced to salivate. Mosquito bodies with abdomens, 
thoraces and heads, legs plus wings and saliva samples were investigated for WNV 
RNA by RT-qPCR. Altogether, 2/70 (2.86%) and 5/85 (5.88%) mosquito bodies were 
found infected with WNV lineage 1 or 2, respectively. In two mosquitoes, viral 
RNA was also detected in legs and wings. No saliva sample contained viral RNA. 
Based on these results, we conclude that Ae. punctor does not play an important 
role in WNV transmission in Germany."
889,"The Ebola virus has caused outbreaks in Central and West Africa, with high rates 
of morbidity and mortality. Clinical trials of recombinant virally vectored 
vaccines did not explicitly include pregnant or nursing women, resulting in a 
gap in knowledge of vaccine-elicited maternal antibody and its potential 
transfer. The role of maternal antibody in Ebola virus disease and vaccination 
remains understudied. Here, we demonstrate that a protein subunit vaccine can 
elicit robust humoral responses in pregnant mice, which are transferred to pups 
in breastmilk. These findings indicate that an intramuscular protein subunit 
vaccine may elicit Ebola-specific IgG capable of being transferred across the 
placenta as well as into the breastmilk. We have previously shown protective 
efficacy with these vaccines in non-human primates, offering a potential safe 
and practical alternative to recombinant virally vectored vaccines for pregnant 
and nursing women in Ebola endemic regions."
890,"During the 2015-2016 outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, a previously 
unknown severe complication of ZIKV infection during pregnancy resulting in 
birth defects was reported. Since the ZIKV outbreak occurred in regions that 
were highly endemic for the related dengue virus (DENV), it was speculated that 
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of a ZIKV infection, caused by the presence 
of cross-reactive DENV antibodies, could contribute to ZIKV disease severity. 
Emerging evidence indicates that, while in vitro models can show ADE of ZIKV 
infection, ADE does not seem to contribute to congenital ZIKV disease severity 
in humans. However, the role of ADE of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and in 
vertical ZIKV transmission is not well studied. In this study, we hypothesized 
that pregnancy may affect the ability of myeloid cells to become infected with 
ZIKV, potentially through ADE. We first systematically assessed which cell lines 
and primary cells can be used to study ZIKV ADE in vitro, and we compared the 
difference in outcomes of (ADE) infection experiments between these cells. 
Subsequently, we tested the hypothesis that pregnancy may affect the ability of 
myeloid cells to become infected through ADE, by performing ZIKV ADE assays with 
primary cells isolated from blood of pregnant women from different trimesters 
and from age-matched non-pregnant women. We found that ADE of ZIKV infection can 
be induced in myeloid cell lines U937, THP-1, and K562 as well as in 
monocyte-derived macrophages from healthy donors. There was no difference in 
permissiveness for ZIKV infection or ADE potential of ZIKV infection in primary 
cells of pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. In conclusion, no 
increased permissiveness for ZIKV infection and ADE of ZIKV infection was found 
using in vitro models of primary myeloid cells from pregnant women compared to 
age-matched non-pregnant women."
891,"Epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), defined by co-infection with Human Herpes Virus 
8 (HHV-8) and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), is a major cause of 
mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly 
reduces the risk of developing KS, and for those with KS, tumors frequently 
resolve with ART alone. However, for unknown reasons, a significant number of KS 
cases do not resolve and can progress to death. To explore how HIV responds to 
ART in the KS tumor microenvironment, we sequenced HIV env-nef found in DNA and 
RNA isolated from plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and tumor 
biopsies, before and after ART, in four Ugandan study participants who had 
unresponsive or progressive KS after 180-250 days of ART. We performed 
immunohistochemistry experiments to detect viral proteins in matched 
formalin-fixed tumor biopsies. Our sequencing results showed that HIV diversity 
and RNA expression in KS tumors are maintained after ART, despite undetectable 
plasma viral loads. The presence of spliced HIV transcripts in KS tumors after 
ART was consistent with a transcriptionally active viral reservoir. 
Immunohistochemistry staining found colocalization of HIV Nef protein and 
tissue-resident macrophages in the KS tumors. Overall, our results demonstrated 
that even after ART reduced plasma HIV viral load to undetectable levels and 
restored immune function, HIV in KS tumors continues to be transcriptionally and 
translationally active, which could influence tumor maintenance and progression."
892,"There is mounting evidence of SARS-CoV-2 spillover from humans into many 
domestic, companion, and wild animal species. Research indicates that humans 
have infected white-tailed deer, and that deer-to-deer transmission has 
occurred, indicating that deer could be a wildlife reservoir and a source of 
novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. We examined the hypothesis that the Omicron variant 
is actively and asymptomatically infecting the free-ranging deer of New York 
City. Between December 2021 and February 2022, 155 deer on Staten Island, New 
York, were anesthetized and examined for gross abnormalities and illnesses. 
Paired nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were collected and analyzed for 
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Of 135 serum samples, 19 (14.1%) 
indicated SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and 11 reacted most strongly to the wild-type B.1 
lineage. Of the 71 swabs, 8 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (4 Omicron and 4 
Delta). Two of the animals had active infections and robust neutralizing 
antibodies, revealing evidence of reinfection or early seroconversion in deer. 
Variants of concern continue to circulate among and may reinfect US deer 
populations, and establish enzootic transmission cycles in the wild: this 
warrants a coordinated One Health response, to proactively surveil, identify, 
and curtail variants of concern before they can spill back into humans."
893,"Older adults experience declining influenza vaccine-induced immunity and are at 
higher risk of influenza and its complications. For this reason, high dose 
(e.g., Fluzone) and adjuvanted (e.g., Fluad) vaccines are preferentially 
recommended for people age 65 years and older. However, T cell transcriptional 
activity shaping the humoral immune responses to Fluzone and Fluad vaccines in 
older adults is still poorly understood. We designed a study of 234 older adults 
(≥65 years old) who were randomly allocated to receive Fluzone or Fluad vaccine 
and provided blood samples at baseline and at Day 28 after immunization. We 
measured the humoral immune responses (hemagglutination inhibition/HAI antibody 
titer) to influenza A/H3N2 and performed mRNA-Seq transcriptional profiling in 
purified CD4+ T cells, in order to identify T cell signatures that might explain 
differences in humoral immune response by vaccine type. Given the large 
differences in formulation (higher antigen dose vs adjuvant), our hypothesis was 
that each vaccine elicited a distinct transcriptomic response after vaccination. 
Thus, the main focus of our study was to identify the differential gene 
expression influencing the antibody titer in the two vaccine groups. Our 
analyses identified three differentially expressed, functionally linked 
genes/proteins in CD4+ T cells: the calcium/calmodulin dependent 
serine/threonine kinase IV (CaMKIV); its regulator the TMEM38B/transmembrane 
protein 38B, involved in maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ release; and the 
transcriptional coactivator CBP/CREB binding protein, as regulators of 
transcriptional activity/function in CD4+ T cells that impact differences in 
immune response by vaccine type. Significantly enriched T cell-specific 
pathways/biological processes were also identified that point to the importance 
of genes/proteins involved in Th1/Th2 cell differentiation, IL-17 signaling, 
calcium signaling, Notch signaling, MAPK signaling, and regulation of TRP cation 
Ca2+ channels in humoral immunity after influenza vaccination. In summary, we 
identified the genes/proteins and pathways essential for cell activation and 
function in CD4+ T cells that are associated with differences in influenza 
vaccine-induced humoral immunity by vaccine type. These findings provide an 
additional mechanistic perspective for achieving protective immunity in older 
adults."
894,"Because of the interface between coagulation and the immune response, it is 
expected that COVID-19-associated coagulopathy occurs via activated protein C 
signaling. The objective was to explore putative changes in the expression of 
the protein C signaling network in the liver, peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells, and nasal epithelium of patients with COVID-19. Single-cell 
RNA-sequencing data from patients with COVID-19 and healthy subjects were 
obtained from the COVID-19 Cell Atlas database. A functional protein-protein 
interaction network was constructed for the protein C gene. Patients with 
COVID-19 showed downregulation of protein C and components of the downstream 
protein C signaling cascade. The percentage of hepatocytes expressing protein C 
was lower. Part of the liver cell clusters expressing protein C presented 
increased expression of ACE2. In PBMC, there was increased ACE2, inflammatory, 
and pro-coagulation transcripts. In the nasal epithelium, PROC, ACE2, and PROS1 
were expressed by the ciliated cell cluster, revealing co-expression of ACE-2 
with transcripts encoding proteins belonging to the coagulation and immune 
system interface. Finally, there was upregulation of coagulation factor 3 
transcript in the liver and PBMC. Protein C could play a mechanistic role in the 
hypercoagulability syndrome affecting patients with severe COVID-19."
895,"Bats carry thousands of viruses from 28 different families. To determine the 
presence of various pathogens in bat populations in Kazakhstan, 1149 samples 
(393 oropharyngeal swabs, 349 brain samples, 407 guano) were collected. The 
samples were collected from four species of bats (Vespertilio murinus, Nyctalus 
noctula, Myotis blythii, Eptesicus serotinus) in nine regions. The Coronavirus 
RNA was found in 38 (4.75%) samples, and the rabies virus in 27 (7.74%) samples 
from bats. Coronaviruses and the rabies virus were found in bats in six out of 
nine studied areas. The RNAs of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, TBE, CCHF, WNF, influenza A 
viruses were not detected in the bat samples. The phylogeny of the RdRp gene of 
12 samples made it possible to classify them as alphacoronaviruses and divide 
them into two groups. The main group (n = 11) was closely related to bat 
coronaviruses from Ghana, Zimbabwe and Kenya. The second group (n = 1) was 
closely related to viruses previously isolated in the south of Kazakhstan. The 
phylogeny of the N gene sequence from a bat from west Kazakhstan revealed its 
close relationship with isolates from the Cosmopolitan group of rabies viruses 
(Central Asia). These results highlight the need for a continuous monitoring of 
volatile populations to improve the surveillance and detection of infectious 
diseases."
896,"OBJECTIVES: Recently, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) have been identified as 
receptors or attachment factors of several viral pathogens. Among rotaviruses, 
HBGAs interact with the outer viral protein, VP4, which has been identified as a 
potential susceptibility factor, although the findings are inconsistent 
throughout populations due to HBGA polymorphisms. We investigated the 
association between HBGA phenotypes and rotavirus infection in children with 
acute gastroenteritis in northern Pretoria, South Africa.
METHODS: Paired diarrheal stool and saliva samples were collected from children 
aged ≤ 59 months (n = 342) with acute moderate to severe diarrhea, attending two 
health care facilities. Rotaviruses in the stool samples were detected by 
commercial EIA and the rotavirus strains were characterized by RT-PCR targeting 
the outer capsid VP7 (G-type) and VP4 (P-type) antigens for genotyping. 
Saliva-based ELISAs were performed to determine A, B, H, and Lewis antigens for 
blood group typing.
RESULTS: Blood type O was the most common blood group (62.5%) in this 
population, followed by groups A (26.0%), B (9.3%), and AB (2.2%). The H1-based 
secretors were common (82.7%) compared to the non-secretors (17.3%), and the 
Lewis antigen positive phenotypes (Le(a+b+)) were predominant (54.5%). Blood 
type A children were more likely to be infected by rotavirus (38.8%) than any 
other blood types. P[4] rotaviruses (21/49; 42.9%) infected only secretor 
individuals, whereas P[6] rotaviruses (3/49; 6.1%) only infected Le(a-b-), 
although the numbers were very low. On the contrary, P[8] rotaviruses infected 
children with a wide range of blood group phenotypes, including Le(a-b-) and 
non-secretors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that Lewis antigens, or the lack thereof, 
may serve as susceptibility factors to rotaviral infection by specific VP4 
genotypes as observed elsewhere. Potentially, the P[8] strains remain the 
predominant human VP4 genotype due to their ability to bind to a variety of HBGA 
phenotypes."
897,"Anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV-1) is a pathogen that causes hemorrhagic disease 
in various farmed and wild freshwater eel species, resulting in significant 
economic losses. Although AngHV-1 has been detected in the American eel 
(Anguilla rostrata), its pathogenicity has not been well characterized. In this 
study, an AngHV-1 isolate, tentatively named AngHV-1-FC, was isolated from 
diseased American eels with similar symptoms as those observed in 
AngHV-1-infected European eels and Japanese eels. AngHV-1-FC induced severe 
cytopathic effects in the European eel spleen cell line (EES), and numerous 
concentric circular virions were observed in the infected EES cells by 
transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, AngHV-1-FC caused the same symptoms 
as the naturally diseased European eels and Japanese eels through experimental 
infection, resulting in a 100% morbidity rate and 13.3% mortality rate. The 
whole genome sequence analyses showed that the average nucleotide identity value 
between AngHV-1-FC and other AngHV-1 isolates ranged from 99.28% to 99.55%. 
However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that there was a genetic divergence 
between AngHV-1-FC and other AngHV-1 isolates, suggesting that AngHV-1-FC was a 
new isolate of AngHV-1. Thus, our results indicated that AngHV-1-FC can infect 
farmed American eels, with a high pathogenicity, providing new knowledge in 
regard to the prevalence and prevention of AngHV-1."
898,"An adenoviral (AdV)-based vector system is a promising platform for vaccine 
development and gene therapy applications. Administration of an AdV vector 
elicits robust innate immunity, leading to the development of humoral and 
cellular immune responses against the vector and the transgene antigen, if 
applicable. The use of high doses (1011-1013 virus particles) of an AdV vector, 
especially for gene therapy applications, could lead to vector toxicity due to 
excessive levels of innate immune responses, vector interactions with blood 
factors, or high levels of vector transduction in the liver and spleen. 
Additionally, the high prevalence of AdV infections in humans or the first 
inoculation with the AdV vector result in the development of vector-specific 
immune responses, popularly known as preexisting vector immunity. It 
significantly reduces the vector efficiency following the use of an AdV vector 
that is prone to preexisting vector immunity. Several approaches have been 
developed to overcome this problem. The utilization of rare human AdV types or 
nonhuman AdVs is the primary strategy to evade preexisting vector immunity. The 
use of heterologous viral vectors, capsid modification, and vector encapsulation 
are alternative methods to evade vector immunity. The vectors can be optimized 
for clinical applications with comprehensive knowledge of AdV vector immunity, 
toxicity, and circumvention strategies."
899,"Only a few qualitative studies of neutralizing antibody titers (NATs) against 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have focused on epitope-specific antibody 
(ESA) levels. Here, NATs against RSV in sera were measured using the blood of 
412 mothers and cord blood (CB) of 95 of the 412 mother-child pairs. ESA levels 
against sites zero (Ø) and IIa of the F protein of RSV were measured in 87 of 
the 95 mother-child pairs. The median gestational age was 39 weeks. The NATs and 
ESA levels in CB were slightly higher than those in maternal blood (MB). The 
NATs for RSV subtype A (RSV-A) in MB and CB showed a positive correlation (r = 
0.75). The ESA levels against sites Ø and IIa in MB and CB showed positive 
correlations, r = 0.76 and r = 0.69, respectively. In MB, the NATs and ESA 
levels against RSV were positively correlated, more significantly against site Ø 
(RSV-A: r = 0.70, RSV-B: r = 0.48) than against site IIa (RSV-A: r = 0.19, 
RSV-B: r = 0.31). Sufficient amounts of ESAs against sites Ø and IIa of RSV were 
transferred from mothers to term infants. ESA levels against site Ø contribute 
to NATs."
900,"The Salmon gill poxvirus (SGPV) has emerged in recent years as the cause of an 
acute respiratory disease that can lead to high mortality in farmed Atlantic 
salmon presmolts, known as Salmon gill poxvirus disease. SGPV was first 
identified in Norway in the 1990s, and its large DNA genome, consisting of over 
206 predicted protein-coding genes, was characterized in 2015. This review 
summarizes current knowledge relating to disease manifestation and its effects 
on the host immune system and describes dissemination of the virus. It also 
demonstrates how newly established molecular tools can help us to understand 
SGPV and its pathogenesis. Finally, we conclude and ask some burning questions 
that should be addressed in future research."
901,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic human herpesvirus infecting 
approximately 90% of the world's population. The oral cavity serves a central 
role in the life cycle, transmission, and pathogenesis of EBV. Transmitted to a 
new host via saliva, EBV circulates between cellular compartments within oral 
lymphoid tissues. Epithelial cells primarily support productive viral 
replication, while B lymphocytes support viral latency and reactivation. EBV 
infections are typically asymptomatic and benign; however, the latent virus is 
associated with multiple lymphomas and carcinomas arising in the oral cavity. 
EBV association with cancer is complex as histologically similar cancers often 
test negative for the virus. However, the presence of EBV is associated with 
distinct features in certain cancers. The intrinsic ability of EBV to 
immortalize B-lymphocytes, via manipulation of survival and growth signaling, 
further implicates the virus as an oncogenic cofactor. A distinct mutational 
profile and burden have been observed in EBV-positive compared to EBV-negative 
tumors, suggesting that viral infection can drive alternative pathways that 
converge on oncogenesis. Taken together, EBV is also an important prognostic 
biomarker that can direct alternative therapeutic approaches. Here, we discuss 
the prevalence of EBV in oral malignancies and the EBV-dependent mechanisms 
associated with tumorigenesis."
902,"Cats are susceptible to coronavirus infections, including infection by human 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In human ABO system 
blood groups, alloantibodies can play a direct role in resistance to infectious 
diseases. Individuals with the AB blood type were over-represented in the 
SARS-CoV-2 infection group. Blood type AB individuals lack both anti-A and 
anti-B antibodies, and therefore lack the protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 
infection given by these antibodies. Starting from this knowledge, this pilot 
preliminary study evaluated a possible association between feline blood 
phenotypes A, B, and AB and serostatus for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in cats. We 
also investigated selected risk or protective factors associated with 
seropositivity for this coronavirus. A feline population of 215 cats was 
analysed for AB group system blood phenotypes and antibodies against the 
nucleocapsid (N-protein) SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a double antigen ELISA. 
SARS-CoV-2 seropositive samples were confirmed using a surrogate virus 
neutralization test (sVNT). Origin (stray colony/shelter/owned cat), breed 
(DSH/non DSH), gender (male/female), reproductive status (neutered/intact), age 
class (kitten/young adult/mature adult/senior), retroviruses status 
(seropositive/seronegative), and blood phenotype (A, B, and AB) were evaluated 
as protective or risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Seropositivity for 
antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein was recorded in eight cats, but only 
four of these tested positive with sVNT. Of these four SARS-CoV-2 seropositive 
cats, three were blood phenotype A and one was phenotype AB. Young adult age 
(1-6 years), FeLV seropositivity and blood type AB were significantly associated 
with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity according to a univariate analysis, but only 
blood type AB (p = 0.0344, OR = 15.4, 95%CI: 1.22-194.39) and FeLV 
seropositivity (p = 0.0444, OR = 13.2, 95%CI: 1.06-163.63) were significant 
associated risk factors according to a logistic regression. Blood phenotype AB 
might be associated with seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This could be 
due, as in people, to the protective effect of naturally occurring 
alloantibodies to blood type antigens which are lacking in type AB cats. The 
results of this pilot study should be considered very preliminary, and we 
suggest the need for further research to assess this potential relationship."
903,"The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most common cause of 
neurodegenerative disease in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region; 
approximately 1.15 billion people are at risk, and thousands suffer from 
permanent neurological disorders across Asian countries, with 10-15 thousand 
people dying each year. JEV crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and forms a 
complex with receptors on the surface of neurons. GRP78, Src, TLR7, caveolin-1, 
and dopamine receptor D2 are involved in JEV binding and entry into the neurons, 
and these receptors also play a role in carcinogenic activity in cells. JEV 
binds to GRP78, a member of the HSP70 overexpressed on malignant cells to enter 
neurons, indicating a higher chance of JEV infection in cancer patients. 
However, JEV enters human brain microvascular endothelial cells via an endocytic 
pathway mediated by caveolae and the ezrin protein and also targets 
dopamine-rich areas for infection of the midbrain via altering dopamine levels. 
In addition, JEV complexed with CLEC5A receptor of macrophage cells is involved 
in the breakdown of the BBB and central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. 
CLEC5A-mediated infection is also responsible for the influx of cytokines into 
the CNS. In this review, we discuss the neuronal and macrophage surface 
receptors involved in neuronal death."
904,"Equine sarcoids are common, locally aggressive skin tumors induced by bovine 
papillomavirus types 1, 2, and possibly 13 (BPV1, BPV2, BPV13). Current in vitro 
models do not mimic de novo infection. We established primary fibroblasts from 
horse skin and succeeded in infecting these cells with native BPV1 and BPV2 
virions. Subsequent cell characterization was carried out by cell culture, 
immunological, and molecular biological techniques. Infection of fibroblasts 
with serial 10-fold virion dilutions (2 × 106-20 virions) uniformly led to DNA 
loads settling at around 150 copies/cell after four passages. Infected cells 
displayed typical features of equine sarcoid cells, including 
hyperproliferation, and loss of contact inhibition. Neither multiple passaging 
nor storage negatively affected cell hyperproliferation, viral DNA replication, 
and gene transcription, suggestive for infection-mediated cell immortalization. 
Intriguingly, extracellular vesicles released by BPV1-infected fibroblasts 
contained viral DNA that was most abundant in the fractions enriched for 
apoptotic bodies and exosomes. This viral DNA is likely taken up by non-infected 
fibroblasts. We conclude that equine primary fibroblasts stably infected with 
BPV1 and BPV2 virions constitute a valuable near-natural model for the study of 
yet unexplored mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of BPV1/2-induced 
sarcoids."
905,"The broad spectrum of interactions between autoimmune diseases and the 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is not fully understood. This study aims to evaluate the 
prevalence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-ENA, anticardiolipin 
antibodies (ACL), and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-β2GPI) before 
and after the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in a real-life setting in healthcare 
professionals. The identification of risk factors associated with vaccine 
immunogenicity was evaluated. The study group consisted of employees of two 
hospitals (354 individuals). Samples for antibody assays were collected before 
vaccination and at 7-9 months after complete immunisation. There was no 
significant increase in the prevalence of ANA, ACL or anti-β2GPI antibodies, or 
autoimmune diseases in subjects who were vaccinated 7-9 months after complete 
immunisation. In terms of detected anti-ENA, the anti-DFS70 antibodies were 
found in 6 times more subjects than before vaccination at the second blood draw 
(in 18 and 3 subjects, respectively) (p = 0.001). There were no significant 
relationships between a SARS-CoV-2 infection history, humoral response, cellular 
response, subject category, smoking, sex, body weight, ANA, anti-ENA, ACL, or 
anti-β2GPI. This study revealed a possible association between the severity of 
vaccine adverse events (VAEs) and ANA titre. Individuals with more severe VAEs 
(&gt;10 points) after the second dose of the vaccine had significantly higher 
ANA titre after complete immunization. When analysing the significance of time 
between the ANA, anti-ENA, ACL, and anti- β2GPI assays and complete immunisation 
antibody values, no qualitative result was statistically significant. There was 
correlation between the time since complete immunization and ANA after."
906,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes one of the most devastating diseases 
affecting pigs and wild suids, a worldwide epizootic situation exacerbated in 
recent years due to the lack of vaccine or effective treatment. ASFV has a 
restricted cell tropism, and is prone to replicate in porcine monocytes and 
alveolar macrophages with high efficiency. Here, the replication capabilities of 
ASFV were examined in swine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and compared 
with 3D4/21, PK-15, MA-104 and Marc-145 cell lines using PCR, qPCR and Western 
blot with monoclonal antibodies against the viral p30 and p72 proteins. The 
results showed that ASFV has a variety of infection characteristics in PAMs and 
showed four cell lines with distinct defects during virus early 
transcription-translation, genome replication and late protein synthesis. 
Furthermore, an antiviral role of the stress granule pathway was revealed 
against ASFV, and ASFV infection inhibited stress granule formation in PAMs but 
not 3D4/21. These results will help to deepen our knowledge on ASFV infection 
and to develop ASFV susceptible cell lines."
907,"Only few studies exist on the phenotype distribution of peripheral blood 
lymphocytes concerning persistent oral HPV infection. T-lymphocyte subsets were 
phenotyped in women who had persistent genital or oral HPV16 infection, using 
HPV-negative women as a reference group. A subset of 42 mothers and their 
children (n = 28), were stratified into two groups according to the mothers' HPV 
status. PBMCs from previously cryopreserved venous samples were immunophenotyped 
by flow cytometry. Proportions of the CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes by their 
immunophenotype subsets were compared between HPV-positive and -negative mothers 
and their children. The mean rank distribution of CD8+ memory cells was 
significantly higher among mothers with persistent genital HPV16 infection. The 
median levels of both the antigen-presenting CD4+ cells and activated CD8+ cells 
were significantly lower in mothers with persistent oral HPV16 infection. When 
oral and genital HPV16-persistors were analyzed as a group, a marker of terminal 
effector cells was significantly increased as compared to HPV-negative women. 
Significantly higher levels of activated CD4+, CD8+ and circulating CD8+ memory 
cells were found among children whose mothers had persistent oral HPV16 
infection. Persistent HPV16 infections are associated with changes in peripheral 
blood T-lymphocyte subsets. The mother's persistent oral HPV16 infection 
possibly results in immune alterations in her offspring."
908,"Newcastle disease (ND) is endemic in poultry in Bangladesh. We performed 
genotypic and pathotypic characterization of four ND virus (NDV) isolates from 
recent outbreaks in broiler chickens in Bangladesh during the period of 
2020-2021. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete fusion protein gene 
coding sequences classified the viruses into NDV class II genotype VII.2 
together with viruses from Indonesia isolated between 2014 and 2021 and a single 
2020 Indian isolate. Pathogenicity testing using the intracerebral pathogenicity 
index in day-old chickens and mean embryo death time in embryonating chicken 
eggs revealed that the Bangladeshi isolates are velogenic. Inoculation of 
35-day-old chickens with two NDV isolates (LT67 and N5) resulted in 100% 
morbidity by 3 days post inoculation (DPI), and all birds succumbed to infection 
by 7 DPI. Massive hemorrhages, congestion and necrotic lesions were observed in 
different visceral organs, which were typical for infection with a velogenic 
viscerotropic pathotype of NDV. At microscopic examination, tracheitis, severe 
pneumonia, focal proventriculitis, transmural enteritis, focal myocarditis, 
severe congestion and necrosis in kidneys, and lymphoid depletion in lymphoid 
tissues were found. Our study reports the first outbreak of the panzootic 
genotype VII.2 NDV in poultry in Bangladesh and documents a possible recent 
re-introduction of this NDV genotype from Southeast or East Asia. This study 
further provides viral distribution and epidemiological data that can facilitate 
the effective control of NDV."
909,"In South Korea, a total of 21 African swine fever (ASF) infected farms were 
confirmed during 2019-2021. ASF viruses (ASFVs) were isolated from the blood and 
spleen samples of the 21 affected farms and their genetic characteristics were 
analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 21 Korean ASFV strains 
belonged to p72 genotype II and serogroup 8. All isolates were of the intergenic 
region (IGR) II variant with 10 tandem repeat sequences between I73R and I329L 
and the central variable region (CVR) 1 variant of the B602L gene. There were no 
IGR variations between the A179L and A137R and between the MGF 505 9R and10R nor 
mutations in the O174L, K145R, MGF 505-5R, CP204L, and Bt/Sj regions. The genes 
of the 21 ASFV strains were identical to those of Georgia 2007/1 and Chinese and 
Vietnamese strains (Pig/HLJ/2018, China/2018/AnhuiXCGQ, and ASFV_NgheAn_2019); 
however, X69R of the J268L region of the 18th isolate (Korea/Pig/Goseong/2021) 
had three nucleotide (CTA) insertions at the 209th position, which led to the 
addition of one tyrosine (Y) at the C-terminal. This suggests that there are 
variations among ASFVs circulating in South Korea and the 18th ASFV-infected 
farm was due to a variant different from those of the other 20 pig farms."
910,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination, 
supported by social and public health measures, has proven efficacious for 
reducing disease severity and virus spread. However, the emergence of highly 
transmissible viral variants that escape prior immunity highlights the need for 
additional mitigation approaches. Heparin binds the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and 
can inhibit virus entry and replication in susceptible human cell lines and 
bronchial epithelial cells. Primary infection predominantly occurs via the nasal 
epithelium, but the nasal cell biology of SARS-CoV-2 is not well studied. We 
hypothesized that prophylactic intranasal administration of heparin may provide 
strain-agnostic protection for household contacts or those in high-risk settings 
against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we investigated the ability of heparin 
to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in differentiated human nasal 
epithelial cells and showed that prolonged exposure to heparin inhibits virus 
infection. Furthermore, we establish a method for PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 
viral genomes in heparin-treated samples that can be adapted for the detection 
of viruses in clinical studies."
911,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a vector-borne viral hemorrhagic 
disease with global clinical significance. Certain species of ticks are vectors 
of CCHF, which can be transmitted from animals to humans and humans to humans by 
direct exposure to blood or other body fluids. The zoonotic transmission at the 
human-animal interface from viremic animal hosts to humans is a public health 
concern with a paucity of data in Nigeria. Samples from 184 pastoral cattle from 
three local government areas (LGAs) of Plateau state, Nigeria, were screened for 
CCHF virus using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ID Screen® CCHF 
Double Antigen for Multi-Species). Overall seropositivity of 30.4% (n = 56) (95% 
CI: 23.88%, 37.63%) was recorded from the study areas in Plateau State, while 
48/126 (38.1%, 95% CI: 29.59%, 47.17%) sampled cows tested positive for CCHFV 
antibodies. Seropositivity was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) among older 
cattle greater than two years, 54.69% (95% CI: 2.88%, 11.24%) compared to cattle 
younger than two years, 17.5% (95% CI: 11.17%, 25.50%). The location of farms 
played a significant role in the seropositivity of CCHF with the least risk 
observed in Wase LGA. CCHF is an important zoonotic disease in different parts 
of the globe with a high risk of transmission to pastoralists, livestock 
keepers/slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians who handle animals. There is a 
need for a collaborative one-health approach with various stakeholders to 
unravel the dynamics of CCHFV epidemiology in Nigeria."
912,"During the last few decades, efforts to increase the safety of blood and blood 
products have mainly focused on preventing the viral infections HCV, HIV, HBV 
and Treponema pallidum. The evolution of these approaches and the achieved 
increase in safety is shown for the last 25 years in Switzerland. In detail, the 
prevalences and incidences of the infection disease and the theoretical 
estimated residual risks (RR) of these blood-borne infections are presented. 
Prevalences, incidences and, in particular, the RR have decreased considerably 
over the last 25 years. This was achieved primarily by the adoption of strict 
criteria for the selection of blood donors, refined questionnaires, the 
introduction of increasingly sensitive serological screening tests and the 
implementation of nucleic acid testing (NAT) for these blood-borne pathogens. 
These NAT assays have significantly shortened the window period between 
infection and the first detection of the infectious agent in the blood of an 
infected individual. A form of ""real life"" comparison or confirmation is 
provided by the reported lookback procedures (LBP) and the haemovigilance data 
of the Swiss competent authority, Swissmedic. These data are in agreement, and 
thus support the very low prevalences, incidences and RR."
913,"Significant advances in the field of HIV-1 therapeutics to achieve 
antiretroviral treatment (ART)-free remission and cure for persons living with 
HIV-1 are being made with the advent of broadly neutralizing antibodies and very 
early ART in perinatal infection. The need for HIV-1 remission and cure arises 
due to the inability of ART to eradicate the major reservoir for HIV-1 in 
resting memory CD4+ T cells (the latent reservoir), and the strict adherence to 
lifelong treatment. To measure the efficacy of these cure interventions on 
reservoir size and to dissect reservoir dynamics, assays that are sensitive and 
specific to intact proviruses are critical. In this review, we provided a broad 
overview of some of the key interventions underway to purge the reservoir in 
adults living with HIV-1 and ones under study in pediatric populations to reduce 
and control the latent reservoir, primarily focusing on very early treatment in 
combination with broadly neutralizing antibodies. We also summarized assays 
currently in use to measure HIV-1 reservoirs and their feasibility and 
considerations for studies in children."
914,"(1) Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that 
causes inflammation of the intestines, which participates in human 
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation from its latent reservoir. CMV-associated 
colitis plays a pejorative role in the clinical course of UC. We took advantage 
of a model of chemically induced enteritis to study the viral reactivation of 
murine CMV (MCMV) in the context of gut inflammation. (2) Methods: 
Seven-week-old BALB/c mice were infected by 3 × 103 plaque-forming units (PFU) 
of MCMV; 2.5% (w/v) DSS was administered in the drinking water from day (D) 30 
to D37 post-infection to induce enteritis. (3) Results: MCMV DNA levels in the 
circulation decreased from D21 after infection until resolution of the acute 
infection. DSS administration resulted in weight loss, high disease activity 
index, elevated Nancy index shortening of the colon length and increase in fecal 
lipocalin. However, chemically induced enteritis had no impact on MCMV 
reactivation as determined by qPCR and immunohistochemistry of intestinal 
tissues. (4) Conclusions: Despite the persistence of MCMV in the digestive 
tissues after the acute phase of infection, the gut inflammation induced by DSS 
did not induce MCMV reactivation in intestinal tissues, thus failing to 
recapitulate inflammation-driven HCMV reactivation in human UC."
915,"A vaccine is a type of medicine that increases immunity and the number of 
antibodies (IgM and IgG) when injected into the body, preparing it in case of an 
actual viral infection. It has been shown in several studies that there is a 
significant relationship between physical activity and vaccination. Furthermore, 
it has been documented that physical activity can play a major role in reducing 
stress. Evidence also shows the existence of a relationship between immunity, 
vaccine response, and sleep duration. To investigate the effects of physical 
activity on the level of COVID-19 antibodies and lifestyle-related factors, 
Health Science Center (HSC) students who had taken the third dose of the vaccine 
and had no prior infection of the COVID-19 virus were investigated. To serve the 
purpose of this study, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 test was applied by taking a blood 
sample from the students. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires and the Borg's 15-point scale were given to 
the participants to fill out. The study utilized a two-arm randomized control 
research design in which 40 participants were randomly assigned into one of two 
groups, either the control group (n = 20) or the treatment group (n = 20). All 
tests and assessments were performed before and after intervention for both 
groups. The control group walked less than 5000 steps every day for one month 
with a 20 min rest during the exercise session, while the treatment group walked 
more than 12,000 steps every day for the same time and exercise task session. 
The students' steps were monitored using an Apple watch. There was a significant 
decrease in the IgG antibody level in the treatment group compared to the 
control group (p &lt; 0.001). The IgM antibody level of all groups did not show 
any significant difference before starting the intervention. However, there was 
a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in the IgM level of the treatment group 
after treatment compared to before treatment. Moreover, there was a significant 
decrease in the treatment group's stress level and sleep disruption, indicating 
better sleep quality, compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.035). The levels 
of IgG and IgM did not improve for the treatment group. However, the treatment 
group improved their stress level and sleep disruption. Therefore, further 
rigorous research is needed to investigate vaccine efficacy among more 
physically active people."
916,"Between the first case of COVID-19 in January 2020 and the end of 2021, Thailand 
experienced four waves of the epidemic. The third and fourth waves were caused 
by the alpha and delta strains from April 2021 to November 2021. 
Serosurveillance studies provide snapshots of the true scale of the outbreak, 
including the asymptomatic infections that could not be fully captured by a 
hospital-based case detection system. We aimed to investigate the distribution 
of SARs-CoV-2 seroprevalence in unvaccinated adults after the delta wave 
outbreak. From November to December 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional survey 
study in 12 public health areas (PHAs) across Thailand. A total of 26,717 blood 
samples were collected and tested for SARs-CoV-2 antibodies (anti-S IgG) using a 
qualitative immunoassay. The results showed that seropositive prevalence in this 
cohort was 1.4% (95% CI: 1.24 to 1.52). The lowest prevalence was in the 
northern region (PHA 1) and in central Thailand (PHA 3) at 0.4% (95% CI: 0.15 to 
0.95), while the highest was in the southern region of Thailand (PHA 12) at 5.8% 
(95% CI: 4.48 to 7.29). This seropositive prevalence was strikingly lower than 
the reports from other countries. Our serosurveillance results suggest that the 
vaccination of unvaccinated groups should be accelerated, especially in the 
public health areas with the lowest seroprevalence."
917,"Introduction: The BNT162b2 vaccination studies did not specifically focus on 
groups that were heavily exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we aimed to 
assess the safety and efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine among healthcare workers 
(HCWs). Methods: Study participants were recruited from hospital employees who 
received BNT162b2 vaccination at the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Warsaw. 
Blood samples were collected before and after each vaccination dose. At each 
timepoint, the levels of anti-SARS CoV-2 IgM, anti-n SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and S-RBD 
antibodies were measured. Data on concomitant diseases and the vaccine's adverse 
events (VAE) were collected after each vaccination dose. In the statistical 
analyses, non-parametric tests were used. Results: In total, 170 healthcare 
workers were included in the analysis. Their median age was 51 years 
(interquartile range (IQR): 41-60 years); most of them were women (n = 137, 
80.6%) working in direct contact with patients (n = 137, 73.2%); and 46 (27.0%) 
had concomitant diseases. More than one fifth of subjects had COVID-19 before 
their first dose of vaccination (n = 38, 22.6%). In terms of immunological 
responses, our investigations showed a high level of efficacy for the BNT162b2 
mRNA vaccination as measured by S-RBD antibody concentrations: these were 
positive in 100% of participants 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine. 
It was also observed that employees with high S-RBD antibodies (&gt;=433 BAU/mL) 
were more likely to be COVID-19 convalescents before receiving the first vaccine 
dose (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The BNT162b2 vaccine is safe and effective 
among HCWs. Vaccine adverse events occurred, but serious events were not 
observed. Moreover, the BNT162b2 vaccine is effective against symptomatic and 
severe COVID-19-none of the workers that acquired a SARS-CoV-2 infection after 
vaccination required hospitalization or medical care. We also observed higher 
immunological responses among COVID-19 convalescents."
918,"The quantification of neutralising antibodies (NAb) for SARS-CoV-2 has become an 
important tool for monitoring protective immunity following infection or 
immunisation. In this study, we evaluated using 
World-Health-Organisation-standard immunoglobulin preparations, a novel 
point-of-care test that quantitates NAb by time-resolved fluorescent 
immunoassay. The assay provided robust data of binding antibody units (BAU) in 
15 min that were well correlated with NAb values obtained by traditional in 
vitro neutralisation assay. The data also correlated well to 
spike-receptor-binding domain-binding antibodies over a broad range of plasma 
dilutions. The assay was extremely sensitive, able to detect positive samples 
after dilution 1:10,000 and over a wide range of BAU. Assay specificity was 
estimated at 96% using Pre-COVID-19 serum samples when applying a cut-off value 
of 47 BAU/mL, although readings of up to 100 BAU/mL could be considered 
borderline. This point-of-care diagnostic test is useful for rapid population 
screening and includes the use of capillary blood samples. Furthermore, it 
provides results for SARS-CoV-2 NAb in 15 min, which can inform immediate 
decisions regarding protective immunity levels and the need for continued COVID 
immunisations."
919,"Antibiotic resistance is a global health and development threat, especially 
during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Therefore, the current study was conducted to describe antibiotic usage and 
resistance among patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) in 
Makkah, Saudi Arabia. In this cross-sectional study, only patients with positive 
COVID-19 status (42 patients) admitted to the ICU at the King Faisal Hospital 
were selected using a census sampling method. The susceptibility test of 
bacteria was carried out according to the standard protocol. The identified 
strains were tested in-vitro against several antibiotics drugs. Statistical 
analysis was performed using SPSS version 24. A total of 42 patients were 
included, with a mean age of 59.35 ± 18 years. Of them, 38.1% were males, and 
61.9% were females. 35.7% have blood group O +. For age and blood groups, 
statistically significant associations were found between males and females, 
with p-values = 0.037 and 0.031, respectively. A large percentage (42.7%) of the 
obtained samples contained Klebsiella Pneumoniae; all bacteria were 
multidrug-resistance bacteria. Furthermore, 76.2% of bacteria were resistant to 
Ampicillin, 66.7% were resistant to Ciprofloxacin, 64.3% were resistant to 
Levofloxacin, 57.1% were resistant to Imipenem, and 57.1% were resistant to 
Moxifloxacin. On the contrary, among the 40 examined antibiotics, the effective 
antibiotics were Daptomycin, Linezolid, Mupirocin, Synercid, Teicoplanin, 
Vancomycin, and Nitrofurantoin. Our study demonstrates that antibiotic 
resistance is highly prevalent among ICU patients with COVID-19 at the King 
Faisal Hospital. Additionally, all bacteria were multidrug-resistance bacteria. 
Therefore, this high prevalence should be seriously discussed and urgently 
considered."
920,"BACKGROUND: Heterologous prime-boost vaccination potentially augments the immune 
response against SARS-CoV-2 in liver transplant (LT) recipients. We investigated 
immunogenicity induced by different primary prime-boost vaccination protocols 
and the subsequent response to the booster vaccine among LT recipients.
METHODS: LT recipients, who received primary immunisation with ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1 
or ChAdOx1/BNT162b2, were administered the third dose of mRNA-1273 three months 
following the primary vaccination. Blood samples were collected before and after 
primary vaccination and post-booster. The levels of receptor binding domain 
antibody (anti-RBD) and neutralising antibody (sVNT) and spike-specific T-cell 
responses were assessed.
RESULTS: Among the 89 LT recipients, patients receiving ChAdOx1/BNT162b2 had 
significantly higher anti-RBD titres, sVNT, and cellular response after primary 
vaccination than those receiving ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1 (p &lt; 0.05). The antibody 
response decreased 12 weeks after the primary vaccination. After the booster, 
humoral and cellular responses significantly improved, with comparable 
seroconversion rates between the heterologous and homologous groups. Positive 
sVNT against the wild type occurred in &gt;90% of LT patients, with only 12.3% 
positive against the Omicron variant.
CONCLUSIONS: ChAdOx1/BNT162b2 evoked a significantly higher immunological 
response than ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1 in LT recipients. The booster strategy 
substantially induced robust immunity against wild type in most patients but was 
less effective against the Omicron strain."
921,"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AGOG) recommends the 
FDA-approved Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and boosters for all 
eligible pregnant women in the US. However, COVID-19 vaccine confidence and 
uptake among pregnant minority women have been poor. While the underlying 
reasons are unclear, they are likely to be associated with myths and 
misinformation about the vaccines. Direct and indirect factors that deter 
minority mothers in the US from receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines require 
further investigation. Here, we examine the historical perspectives on 
vaccinations during pregnancy. We will examine the following aspects: (1) the 
influenza and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis 
(Tdap) vaccinations during pregnancy; (2) the exclusion of pregnant and 
lactating women from COVID-19 vaccine trials; (3) COVID-19 vaccine safety during 
pregnancy, obstetric complications associated with symptomatic COVID-19 during 
pregnancy, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among pregnant minority women, and racial 
disparities experienced by pregnant minority women due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
as well as their potential impact on pregnancy care; and (4) strategies to 
improve COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake among pregnant minority women in 
the US. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among minority mothers can be mitigated by 
community engagement efforts that focus on COVID-19 vaccine education, awareness 
campaigns by trusted entities, and COVID-19-appropriate perinatal counseling 
aimed to improve COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake."
922,"High-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is an immunogenic tumor 
with a unique tumor microenvironment (TME) that extends to the peritoneal 
cavity. The immunosuppressive nature of TME imposes the major challenge to 
develop effective treatment options for HGSOC. Interaction of immune cells in 
TME is an important factor. Hence, a better understanding of immune profile of 
TME may be required for exploring alternative treatment options. Immune 
profiling of peritoneal fluid (PF), tumor specimens, and blood were carried out 
using flowcytometry, ELISA, and Procartaplex immunoassay. The frequency of 
CD56BrightNK cells and expression of functional receptors were reduced in PF. 
Increased activating NKp46+CD56DimNK cells may indicate differential antitumor 
response in PF. Functional receptors on NK, NKT-like and T cells were reduced 
more drastically in tumor specimens. Soluble ligands MIC-B and PVR were reduced, 
whereas B7-H6 was increased in PF. Dissemination of tumor cells contributes to 
soluble ligands in PF. A differential cytokine profile was found in serum and PF 
as IL-2, IL-8, IL-15, IL-27, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF were elevated specifically in PF. 
In conclusion, the differential immune profile and correlation of soluble 
parameters and NK cell receptors with chemo response score may add knowledge to 
understand anti-tumor immune response to develop effective treatment modality."
923,"We evaluated the immune response against the Omicron variant after mRNA-based 
COVID-19 booster vaccination in medical students. We prospectively enrolled 
medical students who received two primary doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. The 
neutralizing response and the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response was evaluated. 
A total of 56 serum samples were obtained before booster vaccination. Nineteen 
students (33.9%) developed COVID-19 two months after booster vaccination. Of 56 
students, 35 students (12 infected and 23 uninfected) were available for blood 
sampling four months after booster vaccination. In comparison with uninfected 
students, infected students showed a significantly higher level of 
SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG (5.23 AU/mL vs. 5.12 AU/mL, p &lt; 0.001) and rate of 
neutralizing response (96.22% vs. 27.18%, p &lt; 0.001) four months after 
booster vaccination. There was no significant difference in the 
SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response. Among 23 infection-naive students, the 
neutralizing response was significantly higher in those who received the 
mRNA-1273 booster than in those who received the BNT162b2 booster (69.07% vs. 
26.43%, p = 0.02). In our study, booster vaccination with mRNA-1273 instead of 
BNT162b2 was significantly associated with a higher neutralizing response."
924,"(a) Background: Omalizumab is an anti-IgE humanized monoclonal antibody marketed 
in China for the conventional treatment of poorly controlled moderate-to-severe 
allergic asthma. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of 
omalizumab, but the data from studies in actual clinical treatment are still 
relatively limited. (b) Methods: Thirty-two patients with moderate-to-severe 
allergic asthma treated with omalizumab on the basis of ICS-LABA (inhaled 
corticosteroids/long-acting beta2-agonist) were selected. Clinical 
characteristics before and after treatment were collected to analyze the 
relationship between changes in serum total IgE levels and peripheral blood EOS 
(eosinophil) levels, FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), PEF (peak 
expiratory flow), OCS (oral glucocorticoid) dosage, ATC (asthma control test) 
score, and the number of acute exacerbations and the treatment response, in 
order to observe the efficacy of omalizumab in addition to primary therapy, and 
to investigate whether baseline clinical characteristics such as serum total IgE 
and EOS levels could predict a treatment response. (c) Results: Using the ACT 
score as an evaluation, 68.75% of patients benefited from omalizumab treatment 
at the end of 16 weeks. The response group has a reduction in OCS dosage 
(p-values of 0.026 and 0.039), a significant reduction in ACT scores (both p 
&lt; 0.001), and a reduction in the number of acute exacerbations (p = 0.034 and 
0.025, respectively) after omalizumab treatment. The binary logistics analysis 
of factors affecting the effectiveness of omalizumab in the treatment of 
allergic asthma were total serum IgE and the presence of comorbidities (p-values 
of 0.039 and 0.046, respectively). (d) Conclusions: Combining omalizumab with 
ICS-LABA for 16 weeks significantly improves asthma symptoms in Chinese adults 
and can be used as an add-on treatment. In addition, high serum IgE levels and 
the presence of comorbidities were predictors of its therapeutic efficacy."
925,"Despite the negative impact of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) and infectious 
hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) on European rainbow trout farming, no vaccines are 
commercially available in Europe. DNA vaccines are protective under experimental 
conditions, but testing under intensive farming conditions remains 
uninvestigated. Two DNA vaccines encoding the glycoproteins (G) of recent 
Italian VHSV and IHNV isolates were developed and tested for potency and safety 
under experimental conditions. Subsequently, a field vaccination trial was 
initiated at a disease-free hatchery. The fish were injected intramuscularly 
with either the VHS DNA vaccine or with a mix of VHS and IHN DNA vaccines at a 
dose of 1 µg/vaccine/fish, or with PBS. At 60 days post-vaccination, fish were 
moved to a VHSV and IHNV infected facility. Mortality started 7 days later, 
initially due to VHS. After 3 months, IHN became the dominant cause of disease. 
Accordingly, both DNA vaccinated groups displayed lower losses compared to the 
PBS group during the first three months, while the VHS/IHN vaccinated group 
subsequently had the lowest mortality. A later outbreak of ERM caused equal 
disease in all groups. The trial confirmed the DNA vaccines to be safe and 
efficient in reducing the impact of VHS and IHN in farmed rainbow trout."
926,"Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM) is a rare hyperacute form of acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). The disease is characterized by fulminant 
inflammation and demyelination in the brain and spinal cord and is often 
preceded by an infection or vaccination. This case report presents a 53-year-old 
male with rheumatoid arthritis and ongoing treatment with methotrexate and 
etanercept who developed fatal AHEM following the second dose of the COVID-19 
vaccine. The disease course was complicated by multiorgan thromboembolic disease 
and the presence of high/moderate levels of cardiolipin IgG antibodies and 
anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1 IgG antibodies suggesting a possible antiphospholipid 
syndrome. Treatment with immunosuppressive therapies failed to improve the 
course. The report comprises comprehensive clinical, neuroimaging, and 
neuropathological findings. The case highlights diagnostic challenges in a 
patient with several preceding risk factors, including autoimmune disease, 
immunotherapy, and vaccination, with possible pathophysiological implications. 
The temporal association with the COVID-19 vaccination may suggest possible 
causality although evidence cannot be ascertained. Reporting possible adverse 
events following COVID-19 vaccination is important to identify at-risk 
populations and to accomplish control of the current pandemic."
927,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has led to a loss of human life in millions and 
devastating socio-economic consequences worldwide. So far, vaccination is the 
most effective long-term strategy to control and prevent severe COVID-19 
disease. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the humoral immune 
responses raised against the BNT162b2 vaccine in hospital healthcare workers.
METHODS: Total number of 173 healthcare workers enrolled in the study. Their 
blood samples were collected in three different time intervals after the second 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and evaluated by the ELISA method to detect anti-spike 
protein IgM and IgG antibodies. The baseline characteristics of all participants 
were collected using questionnaires and were evaluated for finding any 
significant data.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the levels of antibodies were higher in 
the young group (21-30 years old) and also among male participants. Moreover, 
the highest levels of antibodies were detected from the group that received the 
third shot vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that age, gender and third-dose vaccination 
can affect the levels of humoral immune responses against the BNT162b2 vaccine 
in healthcare workers."
928,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a serious and 
life-threatening complication occurring after adenovirus-vector COVID-19 
vaccines, and is rarely reported after other vaccine types. Herein, we report a 
case of possible VITT after the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine booster, who 
presented with extensive lower limb deep vein thrombosis, severe 
thrombocytopenia, markedly elevated D-dimer and positive anti-PF4 antibody 
occurring 2 weeks post-vaccination, concurrent with a lupus anticoagulant. A 
complete recovery was made after intravenous immunoglobulin, prednisolone and 
anticoagulation with the oral direct Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban. The presenting 
features of VITT may overlap with those of antiphospholipid syndrome associated 
with anti-PF4 and immune thrombocytopenia. We discuss the diagnostic 
considerations in VITT and highlight the challenges of performing VITT 
confirmatory assays in non-specialized settings. The set of five diagnostic 
criteria for VITT is a useful tool for guiding initial management, but may 
potentially include patients without VITT. The bleeding risks of severe 
thrombocytopenia in the face of thrombosis, requiring anticoagulant therapy, 
present a clinical challenge, but early recognition and management can 
potentially lead to favorable outcomes."
929,"The objective of the study was to compare the maternal and neonatal humoral 
immune responses among different groups of women, namely those vaccinated by the 
BNT162b2 vaccine, not vaccinated, and COVID-19-recovered parturient women at the 
time of delivery. This is a prospective cohort study of pregnant women, divided 
into four groups: Group A ""Recovered""-recovered and not vaccinated. Group B 
""Second Vaccination""-first and second doses only. Group C ""Third 
Vaccination""-third dose. Group D ""No Third Vaccination""-women eligible for the 
third dose of the vaccine but did not receive it. Maternal and umbilical cord 
blood were sampled and tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies on admittance to 
labor and immediately postpartum, respectively. Maternal serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG 
levels were significantly higher among Group C compared to Group B (741.6 
(514.5-1069) vs. 333.5 (327-340.2), respectively). Both groups had higher 
antibody levels compared to Groups A and D (113.5 (61.62-209.1) and 57.99 
(32.93-102.1), respectively). Similarly, umbilical cord blood SARS-CoV-2 IgG 
levels were also highest among Group C compared to the other three groups (1269 
(953.4-1690) vs. Group B, 322.6 (305.6-340.5), Group A, 109 (49.01-242.6), and 
Group D, 103.9 (48.59-222), respectively). In conclusion, pregnant women who 
were fully vaccinated with three dosages before delivery generated the highest 
levels of maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies."
930,"In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has produced remarkable results in tumor 
treatment. Nevertheless, its effects are severely limited in patients with low 
or absent pre-existing T cell immunity. Accordingly, metastasis remains the 
major cause of tumor-associated death. On the other hand, natural killer (NK) 
cells have the unique ability to recognize and rapidly act against tumor cells 
and surveil tumor cell dissemination. The role of NK cells in metastasis 
prevention is undisputable as an increase in the number of these cells mostly 
leads to a favorable prognosis. Hence, it is reasonable to consider that 
successful metastasis involves evasion of NK-cell-mediated immunosurveillance. 
Therefore, harnessing NK cells to control metastasis is promising. Circulating 
tumor cells (CTCs) are the seeds for distant metastasis, and the number of CTCs 
detected in the blood of patients with tumor is associated with a worse 
prognosis, whereas NK cells can eliminate highly motile CTCs especially in the 
blood. Here, we review the role of NK cells during metastasis, particularly the 
specific interactions of NK cells with CTCs, which may provide essential clues 
on how to harness the power of NK cells against tumor metastasis. As a result, a 
new way to prevent or treat metastatic tumor may be developed."
931,"Cancer is a chronic disease, and it can be lethal due to limited therapeutic 
options. The conventional treatment options for cancer have numerous challenges, 
such as a low blood circulation time as well as poor solubility of anticancer 
drugs. Therapeutic cancer vaccines emerged to try to improve anticancer drugs' 
efficiency and to deliver them to the target site. Cancer vaccines are 
considered a viable therapeutic technique for most solid tumors. Vaccines boost 
antitumor immunity by delivering tumor antigens, nucleic acids, entire cells, 
and peptides. Cancer vaccines are designed to induce long-term antitumor memory, 
causing tumor regression, eradicate minimal residual illness, and prevent 
non-specific or unpleasant effects. These vaccines can assist in the elimination 
of cancer cells from various organs or organ systems in the body, with minimal 
risk of tumor recurrence or metastasis. Vaccines and antigens for anticancer 
therapy are discussed in this review, including current vaccine adjuvants and 
mechanisms of action for various types of vaccines, such as DNA- or mRNA-based 
cancer vaccines. Potential applications of these vaccines focusing on their 
clinical use for better therapeutic efficacy are also discussed along with the 
latest research available in this field."
932,"This study aimed to test zona pellucida (ZP) vaccines' immunocontraceptive 
efficacy and safety when formulated with non-Freund's adjuvant (6% Pet Gel A and 
500 Μg Poly(I:C)). Twenty-four jennies were randomly assigned to three treatment 
groups: reZP (n = 7) received three doses of recombinant ZP vaccine; pZP (n = 9) 
received two doses of native porcine ZP; and Control group (n = 8) received two 
injections of placebo. Jennies were monitored weekly via transrectal 
ultrasonography and blood sampling for serum progesterone profiles and anti-pZP 
antibody titres. In addition, adverse effects were inspected after vaccination. 
Thirty-five days after the last treatment, jacks were introduced to each group 
and rotated every 28 days. Vaccination with both pZP and reZP was associated 
with ovarian shutdown in 44% (4/9) and 71% (4/7) of jennies, 118 ± 33 and 91 ± 
20 days after vaccination, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). Vaccination delayed the 
chances of a jenny becoming pregnant (p = 0.0005; Control, 78 ± 31 days; pZP, 
218 ± 69 days; reZP, 244 ± 104 days). Anti-pZP antibody titres were elevated in 
all vaccinated jennies compared to Control jennies (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, 
only mild local injection site reactions were observed in the jennies after 
treatment. In conclusion, ZP vaccines formulated with non-Freund's adjuvant 
effectively controlled reproduction in jennies with only minor localised side 
effects."
933,"Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a thyroid disease associated with viral 
infections. Its relationship with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
antigens was shown before. SAT cases triggered by different types of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines have been 
reported. In this study, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes of 27 SAT 
patients (13 vaccine-associated (V-SAT) and 14 non-SARS-CoV-2-infection 
non-vaccine-associated (non-V-SAT)) were compared with those of 362 healthy 
donors. HLA analyses were performed with low-resolution DNA-based 
sequence-specific oligonucleotide or sequence-specific primer methods. 
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and Stata/MP 
14.1 with the hapipf function. Allele and haplotype frequencies were estimated 
by PyPop and gene[RATE] tool programs. The allele frequencies of HLA-A*11, 
HLA-B*35, and HLA-C*04 were higher in the patient groups. Both the allele 
frequency of HLA-A*11 and the haplotype frequency of A*11-B*35-C*04 were higher 
in the V-SAT group. The A*11-B*35-C*04 haplotype, including all three loci of 
MHC class I genes, is shown to be associated with the disease for the first 
time, especially in the V-SAT group. This finding will contribute to a better 
understanding of the etiopathogenesis of vaccine-associated SAT and the role of 
HLA genotypes in the functioning mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."
934,"Numerous diseases such as hemorrhage, sepsis or cardiogenic shock induce a 
heterogeneous perfusion of the capillaries. To detect such alterations in the 
human blood flow pattern, diagnostic devices must provide an appropriately high 
spatial resolution. Shifted position-diffuse reflectance imaging (SP-DRI) has 
the potential to do so; it is an all-optical diagnostic technique. So far, 
SP-DRI has mainly been developed using Monte Carlo simulations. The present 
study is therefore validating this algorithm experimentally on realistic optical 
phantoms with thread structures down to 10 μm in diameter; a SP-DRI sensor 
prototype was developed and realized by means of additive manufacturing. SP-DRI 
turned out to be functional within this experimental framework. The position of 
the structures within the optical phantoms become clearly visible using SP-DRI, 
and the structure thickness is reflected as modulation in the SP-DRI signal 
amplitude; this performed well for a shift along the x axis as well as along the 
y axis. Moreover, SP-DRI successfully masked the pronounced influence of the 
illumination cone on the data. The algorithm showed significantly superior to a 
mere raw data inspection. Within the scope of the study, the constructive design 
of the SP-DRI sensor prototype is discussed and potential for improvement is 
explored."
935,"Color Doppler (CD) imaging is widely used in diagnostics since it allows 
real-time detection and display of blood flow superimposed on the B-mode image. 
Nevertheless, to date, a shared worldwide standard on Doppler equipment testing 
is still lacking. In this context, the study herein proposed would give a 
contribution focusing on the combination of five test parameters to be included 
in a novel Quality Assessment (QA) protocol for CD systems testing. A first 
approach involving the use of the Kiviat diagram was investigated, assuming the 
diagram area, normalized with respect to one of the gold standards, as an index 
of the overall Doppler system performance. The QA parameters were obtained from 
the post-processing of CD data through the implementation of custom-written 
image analysis methods and procedures, here applied to three brand-new 
high-technology-level ultrasound systems. Experimental data were collected 
through phased and convex array probes, in two configuration settings, by means 
of a Doppler flow phantom set at different flow rate regimes. The outcomes 
confirmed that the Kiviat diagram might be a promising tool applied to quality 
controls of Doppler equipment, although further investigations should be 
performed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed approach."
936,"The multi-angle Doppler method was introduced for the estimation of velocity 
vectors by measuring axial velocities from multiple directions. We have recently 
reported that the autocorrelation-based velocity vector estimation could be 
ameliorated significantly by estimating the wavenumbers in two dimensions. Since 
two-dimensional wavenumber estimation requires a snapshot of an ultrasonic 
field, the method was first implemented in plane wave imaging. Although plane 
wave imaging is predominantly useful for examining blood flows at an extremely 
high temporal resolution, it was reported that the contrast in a B-mode image 
obtained with a few plane wave emissions was lower than that obtained with 
focused beams. In this study, the two-dimensional wavenumber analysis was first 
implemented in a framework with focused transmit beams. The simulations showed 
that the proposed method achieved an accuracy in velocity estimation comparable 
to that of the method with plane wave imaging. Furthermore, the performances of 
the methods implemented in focused beam and plane wave imaging were compared by 
measuring human common carotid arteries in vivo. Image contrasts were analyzed 
in normal and clutter-filtered B-mode images. The method with focused beam 
imaging achieved a better contrast in normal B-mode imaging, and similar 
velocity magnitudes and angles were obtained by both the methods with focused 
beam and plane wave imaging. In contrast, the method with plane wave imaging 
gave a better contrast in a clutter-filtered B-mode image and smaller variances 
in velocity magnitudes than those with focused beams."
937,"Human bio-signal fusion is considered a critical technological solution that 
needs to be advanced to enable modern and secure digital health and well-being 
applications in the metaverse. To support such efforts, we propose a new 
data-driven digital twin (DT) system to fuse three human physiological 
bio-signals: heart rate (HR), breathing rate (BR), and blood oxygen saturation 
level (SpO2). To accomplish this goal, we design a computer vision technology 
based on the non-invasive photoplethysmography (PPG) technique to extract raw 
time-series bio-signal data from facial video frames. Then, we implement machine 
learning (ML) technology to model and measure the bio-signals. We accurately 
demonstrate the digital twin capability in the modelling and measuring of three 
human bio-signals, HR, BR, and SpO2, and achieve strong performance compared to 
the ground-truth values. This research sets the foundation and the path forward 
for realizing a holistic human health and well-being DT model for real-world 
medical applications."
938,"Healthcare systems in recent times have witnessed timely diagnoses with a high 
level of accuracy. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-enabled deep learning (DL) 
models have been used to support medical diagnostics in real time, thus 
resolving the issue of late-stage diagnosis of various diseases and increasing 
performance accuracy. The current approach for the diagnosis of leukemia uses 
traditional procedures, and in most cases, fails in the initial period. Hence, 
several patients suffering from cancer have died prematurely due to the late 
discovery of cancerous cells in blood tissue. Therefore, this study proposes an 
IoMT-enabled convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect malignant and 
benign cancer cells in the patient's blood tissue. In particular, the 
hyper-parameter optimization through radial basis function and dynamic 
coordinate search (HORD) optimization algorithm was used to search for optimal 
values of CNN hyper-parameters. Utilizing the HORD algorithm significantly 
increased the effectiveness of finding the best solution for the CNN model by 
searching multidimensional hyper-parameters. This implies that the HORD method 
successfully found the values of hyper-parameters for precise leukemia features. 
Additionally, the HORD method increased the performance of the model by 
optimizing and searching for the best set of hyper-parameters for the CNN model. 
Leukemia datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model 
using standard performance indicators. The proposed model revealed significant 
classification accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art models."
939,"A novel exercise modality combined with electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) has 
been reported to increase cardiovascular and metabolic responses, such as blood 
lactate concentration. We aimed to examine the effect of constant load pedaling 
exercise, combined with EMS, by non-invasively and continuously measuring sweat 
lactate levels. A total of 22 healthy young men (20.7 ± 0.8 years) performed a 
constant load pedaling exercise for 20 min at 125% of the pre-measured 
ventilatory work threshold with (EMS condition) and without (control condition) 
EMS stimulation. Blood lactate concentration was measured by blood samples 
obtained from the earlobe every minute. Sweat lactate was monitored in real time 
using a sensor placed on the forearm. The sweat lactate threshold (sLT) was 
defined as the point of increase in sweat lactate. sLT occurred significantly 
earlier in the EMS condition than in the control condition. In the single 
regression analysis, the difference in sLT between the two conditions, as the 
independent variable, was a significant predictor of the difference in blood 
lactate concentrations at the end of the exercise (p &lt; 0.05, r = -0.52). 
Sweat lactate measurement may be a noninvasive and simple alternative to blood 
lactate measurement to determine the effectiveness of exercise combined with 
EMS."
940,"Artemether (ATM) is an effective antimalarial drug that also has a short 
half-life in the blood. Furthermore, ATM is also cardiotoxic and is associated 
with pro-arrhythmogenic risks. We aimed to develop a delivery system enabling 
the prolonged release of ATM into the blood coupled with reduced cardiotoxicity. 
To achieve this, we prepared polymeric nanocapsules (NCs) from different 
biodegradable polyesters, namely poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA), poly-ε-caprolactone 
(PCL), and surface-modified NCs, using a monomethoxi-polyethylene 
glycol-block-poly(D,L-lactide) (PEG5kDa-PLA45kDa) polymer. Using this approach, 
we were able to encapsulate high yields of ATM (&gt;85%, 0-4 mg/mL) within the 
oily core of the NCs. The PCL-NCs exhibited the highest percentage of ATM 
loading as well as a slow release rate. Atomic force microscopy showed 
nanometric and spherical particles with a narrow size dispersion. We used the 
PCL NCs loaded with ATM for biological evaluation following IV administration. 
As with free-ATM, the ATM-PCL-NCs formulation exhibited potent antimalarial 
efficacy using either the ""Four-day test"" protocol (ATM total at the end of the 
4 daily doses: 40 and 80 mg/kg) in Swiss mice infected with P. berghei or a 
single low dose (20 mg/kg) of ATM in mice with higher parasitemia (15%). In 
healthy rats, IV administration of single doses of free-ATM (40 or 80 mg/kg) 
prolonged cardiac QT and QTc intervals and induced both bradycardia and 
hypotension. Repeated IV administration of free-ATM (four IV doses at 20 mg/kg 
every 12 h for 48 h) also prolonged the QT and QTc intervals but, paradoxically, 
induced tachycardia and hypertension. Remarkably, the incorporation of ATM in 
ATM-PCL-NCs reduced all adverse effects. In conclusion, the encapsulation of ATM 
in biodegradable polyester NCs reduces its cardiovascular toxicity without 
affecting its antimalarial efficacy."
941,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is unjustly neglected today as a food grain. 
Interest in the use of barley in the food industry has increased recently. The 
reason for this is its content of dietary fibre, especially β-glucan, which has 
been shown to reduce blood cholesterol and lower blood sugar levels. The main 
nutritional components of barley and barley products, besides the mentioned 
β-glucan, are starch, sugar, proteins, fat and ash. Although not common in the 
production of bakery products, barley can be very easily involved in the 
production of the same products, and such products have improved nutritional 
characteristics and acceptable sensory characteristics, which make them 
desirable. Barley has great potential for use in a wide range of cereal-based 
foods as a partial or full replacement for currently used grains (such as wheat, 
oats, rice and corn). This article provides basic and general information about 
the use of barley in food and the processing of barley grains for use in the 
manufacturing of cereal-based products, with particular attention to the use of 
barley in the manufacturing of bread (flatbread and leavened bread), noodles and 
pasta, muffins and cakes and cookies and biscuits."
942,"Myelosuppression is a major adverse effect of chemotherapy. With the increasing 
number of cancer patients worldwide, there is a growing interest in therapeutic 
approaches that reduce the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Angelica gigas Nakai 
(AGN) roots have been widely used in oriental medicine to treat blood-related 
diseases, including cancer. However, the effects of AGN on myelosuppression have 
not been studied. Here, we investigated the effects of AGN ethanol extract 
(AGNEX) on cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression. AGNEX treatment 
significantly decreased white blood cell levels while increasing red blood cell 
and platelet levels in the peripheral blood. It inhibited thymus and spleen 
atrophy. It also enhanced serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α. qRT-PCR results showed that AGNEX decreased the expression of 
IL-1b and stem cell factor (SCF) in the bone marrow (BM) while increasing the 
mRNA expression of IL-3 and IL-6 in the spleen. Although AGNEX did not 
significantly decrease apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the BM and 
splenocytes, AGNEX plays a positive role in cyclophosphamide-induced 
myelosuppression. AGNEX administration increased BM cells in the femur while 
decreasing apoptotic BM cells. These findings suggest that AGNEX could be used 
to treat myelosuppression and as a combination therapy in cancer patients."
943,"Antibodies that recognize cancer biomarkers, such as MUC16, can be used as 
vehicles to deliver contrast agents (imaging) or cytotoxic payloads (therapy) to 
the site of tumors. MUC16 is overexpressed in 80% of epithelial ovarian cancer 
(EOC) and 65% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), where effective 
'theranostic' probes are much needed. This work aims to develop fully human 
antibodies against MUC16 and evaluate them as potential immuno-PET imaging 
probes for detecting ovarian and pancreatic cancers. We developed a fully human 
monoclonal antibody, M16Ab, against MUC16 using phage display. M16Ab was 
conjugated with p-SCN-Bn-DFO and radiolabeled with 89Zr. 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab was then 
evaluated for binding specificity and affinity using flow cytometry. In vivo 
evaluation of 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab was performed by microPET/CT imaging at different 
time points at 24-120 h post injection (p.i.) and ex vivo biodistribution 
studies in mice bearing MUC16-expressing OVCAR3, SKOV3 (ovarian) and SW1990 
(pancreatic) xenografts. 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab bound specifically to MUC16-expressing 
cancer cells with an EC50 of 10nM. 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab was stable in serum and showed 
specific uptake and retention in tumor xenografts even after 120 h p.i. 
(microPET/CT) with tumor-to-blood ratios &gt; 43 for the SW1990 xenograft. 
Specific tumor uptake was observed for SW1990/OVCAR3 xenografts but not in 
MUC16-negative SKOV3 xenografts. Pharmacokinetic study shows a relatively short 
distribution (t1/2α) and elimination half-life (t1/2ß) of 4.4 h and 99 h, 
respectively. In summary, 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab is an effective non-invasive imaging 
probe for ovarian and pancreatic cancers and shows promise for further 
development of theranostic radiopharmaceuticals."
944,"Aspirin is an historic blockbuster product, and it has been proposed in a wide 
range of formulas. Due to exacerbation risks, the pulmonary route has been 
seldom considered as an alternative to conventional treatments. Only recently, 
owing to overt advantages, inhalable acetylsalicylic acid dry powders (ASA DPI) 
began to be considered as an option. In this work, we developed a novel highly 
performing inhalable ASA DPI using a nano spray-drying technique and leucine as 
an excipient and evaluated its pharmacokinetics compared with oral 
administration. The formulation obtained showed remarkable respirability and 
quality features. Serum and lung ASA DPI profiles showed faster presentation in 
blood and higher retention compared with oral administration. The dry powder was 
superior to the DPI suspension. The relative bioavailability in serum and lungs 
claimed superiority of ASA DPI over oral administration, notwithstanding a 
fourfold lower pulmonary dose. The obtained ASA DPI formulation shows promising 
features for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious lung pathologies."
945,"Sustained-release formulations of decoquinate were evaluated for the long-term 
prophylaxis of malaria. In the initial experiment, mice were protected from 
liver-stage Plasmodium infection by intramuscular administration of a 
lipids-based formulation at a dose of decoquinate 200 mg/kg. The mice that were 
inoculated with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites 34 days after the administration 
of a one-time drug dose were continuously monitored for 60 days and shown to be 
free of Plasmodium parasites. The optimized formulation for the sustained 
release of decoquinate was prepared by hot melt extrusion, constructed by lipids 
including cholesterol and mono or diglycerides, and had a drug load of 20 to 40% 
and particle size of 30 to 50 μm. Decoquinate of the lipids-based formulation 
was slowly released in vitro at a constant rate for the duration of two months, 
and was examined and continuously exposed at a therapeutic level in the blood 
for as long as 4 to 6 months. Further evaluation showed that the lipids-based 
formulation at doses of decoquinate 100 to 150 mg/kg could protect mice from 
Plasmodium infection for a period of 120 days. It is the first time that 
cholesterol has been used for a controlled drug delivery system of decoquinate. 
The results may provide useful information, not only for preparing a formulation 
of long-acting decoquinate but also in general for developing a controlled drug 
release system. The one-time administration of pharmaceutical agents in such a 
slow-release system may serve patients with no concerns about compliance."
946,"Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) present outstanding properties making them 
suitable as therapeutic agents for hyperthermia treatments. Since the main 
safety concerns of MNPs are represented by their inherent instability in a 
biological medium, strategies to both achieve long-term stability and monitor 
hazardous MNP degradation are needed. We combined a dynamic approach relying on 
flow field flow fractionation (FFF)-multidetection with conventional techniques 
to explore frame-by-frame changes of MNPs injected in simulated biological 
medium, hypothesize the interaction mechanism they are subject to when 
surrounded by a saline, protein-rich environment, and understand their behaviour 
at the most critical point of intravenous administration. In the first moments 
of MNPs administration in the patient, MNPs change their surrounding from a 
favorable to an unfavorable medium, i.e., a complex biological fluid such as 
blood; the particles evolve from a synthetic identity to a biological identity, 
a transition that needs to be carefully monitored. The dynamic approach 
presented herein represents an optimal alternative to conventional batch 
techniques that can monitor only size, shape, surface charge, and aggregation 
phenomena as an averaged information, given that they cannot resolve different 
populations present in the sample and cannot give accurate information about the 
evolution or temporary instability of MNPs. The designed FFF method equipped 
with a multidetection system enabled the separation of the particle populations 
providing selective information on their morphological evolution and on 
nanoparticle-proteins interaction in the very first steps of infusion. Results 
showed that in a dynamic biological setting and following interaction with serum 
albumin, PP-MNPs retain their colloidal properties, supporting their safety 
profile for intravenous administration."
947,"Fermentation of red ginseng (RG) produces fermented red ginseng (FRG), thereby 
increasing the relative amount of downstream ginsenosides, including compound Y 
(CY), F2, Rh2, compound K (CK), compound O, protopanaxadiol (PPD), and 
protopanaxatriol (PPT). These downstream ginsenosides have beneficial 
pharmacological effects, and are easily absorbed by the human body. Based on 
these expectations, a randomized, single-dose, two-period, crossover clinical 
trial was planned to compare the pharmacokinetic characteristics of seven types 
(Rb1, CY, F2, CK, Rh2, PPD, and PPT) of ginsenoside components after FRG and RG 
administration. The safety and tolerability profiles were assessed in this 
clinical trial. Sixteen healthy Korean male subjects were administered 6 g of 
FRG or RG. All ginsenosides except Rb1 showed higher systemic exposure after FRG 
administration than after RG administration, based on comparisons of ginsenoside 
Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) between FRG and RG. CK, 
the main ginsenoside component produced during the fermentation process, had 
69.23/74.53-fold higher Cmax/AUClast after administration of FRG than RG, and 
Rh2 had 20.27/18.47-fold higher Cmax/AUClast after administration of FRG than 
RG. In addition, CY and F2 were detected in FRG; however, all plasma 
concentrations of CY and F2, except in one subject, were below the lower limit 
of quantification in RG. There were no clinically significant findings with 
respect to clinical laboratory tests, blood pressures, or adverse events. 
Therefore, regular administration of FRG may exert better pharmacological 
effects than RG."
948,"For peripherally administered drugs to reach the central nervous system (CNS) 
and treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), they must cross the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). As mounting evidence suggests that the ultrastructure of the BBB 
is altered in individuals with ALS and in animal models of ALS (e.g., SOD1G93A 
mice), we characterized BBB transporter expression and function in transgenic 
C9orf72 BAC (C9-BAC) mice expressing a hexanucleotide repeat expansion, the most 
common genetic cause of ALS. Using an in situ transcardiac brain perfusion 
technique, we identified a 1.4-fold increase in 3H-2-deoxy-D-glucose transport 
across the BBB in C9-BAC transgenic (C9) mice, relative to wild-type (WT) mice, 
which was associated with a 1.3-fold increase in brain microvascular glucose 
transporter 1 expression, while other general BBB permeability processes 
(passive diffusion, efflux transporter function) remained unaffected. We also 
performed proteomic analysis on isolated brain microvascular endothelial cells, 
in which we noted a mild (14.3%) reduction in zonula occludens-1 abundance in C9 
relative to WT mice. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted trends in 
changes to various BBB transporters and cellular metabolism. To our knowledge, 
this is the first study to demonstrate altered BBB function in a C9orf72 repeat 
expansion model of ALS, which has implications on how therapeutics may access 
the brain in this mouse model."
949,"Methylene blue (MB) is the oldest synthetic anti-infective. Its high potency 
against asexual and sexual stages of malaria parasites is well documented. This 
study aimed to investigate possible additional activities of MB in interfering 
with parasite transmission and determine target stages in Anopheles vectors and 
humans. MB's transmission-blocking activity was first evaluated by an ex vivo 
direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA) using Plasmodium falciparum field isolates. 
To investigate anti-mosquito stage activity, Plasmodium berghei-infected 
Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were fed a second blood meal on mice that had 
been treated with methylene blue, 3, 6- and 15-days after the initial infectious 
blood meal. Anti-sporozoite and liver stage activities were evaluated in vitro 
and in vivo via sporozoite invasion and liver stage development assays, 
respectively. MB exhibited a robust inhibition of P. falciparum transmission in 
An. gambiae, even when added shortly before the DMFA but only a moderate effect 
against P. berghei oocyst development. Exposure of mature P. berghei and P. 
falciparum sporozoites to MB blocked hepatocyte invasion, yet P. berghei liver 
stage development was unaffected by MB. Our results indicate previously 
underappreciated rapid specific activities of methylene blue against Plasmodium 
transmission stages, preventing the establishment of both mosquito midgut and 
liver infections as the first essential steps in both hosts."
950,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed type of cancer, with 2.26 million cases and 
685,000 deaths recorded in 2020. If left untreated, this deadly disease can 
metastasize to distant organs, which is the reason behind its incurability and 
related deaths. Currently, conventional therapies are used to treat breast 
cancer, but they have numerous shortcomings such as low bioavailability, short 
circulation time, and off-target toxicity. To address these challenges, 
nanomedicines are preferred and are being extensively investigated for breast 
cancer treatment. Nanomedicines are novel drug delivery systems that can improve 
drug stability, aqueous solubility, blood circulation time, controlled release, 
and targeted delivery at the tumoral site and enhance therapeutic safety and 
effectiveness. Nanoparticles (NPs) can be administered through different routes. 
Although the injectable route is less preferred than the oral route for drug 
administration, it has its advantages: it helps tailor drugs with targeted 
moiety, boosts payload, avoids first-pass metabolism, and improves the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Targeted 
delivery of nanomedicine, closer to organelles such as the mitochondria and 
nuclei in breast cancer, reduces the dosage requirements and the toxic effects 
of chemotherapeutics. This review aims to provide the current status of the 
recent advances in various injectable nanomedicines for targeted treatment of 
breast cancer."
951,"Aptamer-drug conjugates (ApDCs) are potential targeted pharmaceutics, but their 
clinical applications are hampered by fast clearance in blood. Herein we report 
the construction of ApDCs modified with artificial base F and the study of 
biological activities. Two types of F-base-modified ApDCs were prepared, 
Sgc8-paclitaxel by conjugation and Sgc8-gemcitabine, by automated solid-phase 
synthesis. In vitro experiments showed that F-base-modified ApDCs retain the 
specificity of the aptamer to target cells and the biological stability is 
improved. In vivo studies demonstrated that the circulatory time is increased by 
up to 55 h or longer, as the incorporated F base leads to a stable ApDC-albumin 
complex as the formulation for targeted delivery. Moreover, conjugated drug 
molecules were released efficiently and the drug (paclitaxel) concentration in 
the tumor site was improved. The results demonstrate that an F-base-directed 
ApDC-albumin complex is a potential platform for drug delivery and targeted 
cancer therapy."
952,"Mutations in the CSF1R gene are the most common cause of adult-onset 
leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a 
neurodegenerative disease with rapid progression and ominous prognosis. 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been increasingly offered to 
patients with CSF1R-ALSP. However, different therapy results were observed, and 
it was not elucidated which patient should be referred for HSCT. This study 
aimed to determine predictors of good and bad HSCT outcomes in CSF1R-ALSP. We 
retrospectively analyzed 15 patients, 14 symptomatic and 1 asymptomatic, with 
CSF1R-ALSP that underwent HSCT. Median age of onset was 39 years, and the median 
age of HSCT was 43 years. Cognitive impairment was the most frequent initial 
manifestation (43%), followed by gait problems (21%) and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms (21%). Median post-HSCT follow-up was 26 months. Good outcomes were 
associated with gait problems as initial (p = 0.041) and predominant (p = 0.017) 
manifestation and younger age at HSCT (p = 0.044). Cognitive impairment as first 
manifestation was a predictor of a bad outcome (p = 0.016) and worsening of 
cognition post-HSCT (p = 0.025). In conclusion, gait problems indicated a milder 
phenotype with better response to HSCT and good therapy outcomes. In contrast, 
patients with a higher burden of cognitive symptoms were most likely not to 
benefit from HSCT."
953,"Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma (GR) is a traditional herbal medicine widely used 
in Asian countries. GR was the most frequently used medicine among stroke 
patients in Donguibogam, the most representative book in Korean medicine. In the 
present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of the GR methanolic 
extract (GRex) on an ischemic stroke mice model. Ischemic stroke was induced by 
a 90 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and GRex was 
administered to mice with oral gavage after reperfusion of MCA blood flow. The 
MCAO-induced edema and infarction volume was measured, and behavioral changes 
were evaluated by a novel object recognition test (NORT). Immunofluorescence 
stains and Western blotting identified underlying mechanisms of the protective 
effects of GRex. GRex post-treatment in mice with MCAO showed potent effects in 
reducing cerebral edema and infarction at 125 mg/kg but no effects when the 
dosage was much lower or higher than 125 mg/kg. GRex inhibited the decrease of 
spontaneous motor activity and novel object recognition functions. The 
neuroprotective effects of GRex on ischemic stroke were due to its regulation of 
inflammation-related neuronal cells, such as microglia and astrocytes."
954,"Currently, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are considered potential 
immunomodulatory agents and as targets for activity modulation are granulocytes, 
which have the most abundant population of immune blood cells. The present study 
aims to evaluate the cytotoxic effect and its effect on the functional responses 
of granulocytes. In addition to the intrinsic activity of SeNPs, we studied the 
activity of the combination of SeNPs and IgG antibodies. Using laser ablation 
and fragmentation, we obtained nanoparticles with an average size of 100 nm and 
a rather narrow size evolution. The resulting nanoparticles do not show acute 
toxicity to primary cultures of fibroblasts and hepatocytes, epithelial-like 
cell line L-929 and granulocyte-like culture of HL-60 at a concentration of 109 
NPs/mL. SeNPs at a concentration of 1010 NPs/mL reduced the viability of HL-60 
cells by no more than 10% and did not affect the viability of the primary 
culture of mouse granulocytes, and did not have a genotoxic effect on progenitor 
cells. The addition of SeNPs can affect the production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) by mouse bone marrow granulocytes, modulate the proportion of 
granulocytes with calcium spikes and enhance fMLF-induced granulocytes 
degranulation. SeNPs can modulate the effect of IgG on the physiological 
responses of granulocytes. We studied the expression level of genes associated 
with inflammation and cell stress. SeNPs increase the expression of catalase, 
NF-κB, Xrcc5 and some others; antibodies enhance the effect of SeNPs, but IgG 
without SeNPs decreases the expression level of these genes. This fact can be 
explained by the interaction between SeNPs and IgG. It has been established that 
antibodies interact with SeNPs. We showed that antibodies bind to the surface of 
selenium nanoparticles and are present in aqueous solutions in a bound form from 
DLS methods, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, vibrational-rotational 
spectrometry, fluorescence spectrometry, and refractometry. At the same time, in 
a significant part of the antibodies, a partial change in the tertiary and 
secondary structure is observed. The data obtained will allow a better 
understanding of the principles of the interaction of immune cells with 
antibodies and SeNPs and, in the future, may serve to create a new generation of 
immunomodulators."
955,"Ovarian damage and fertility impairment are major side effects of chemotherapy 
in pre-menopausal cancer patients. Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic 
drug. The present study was designed to assess the ameliorative effects of 
melatonin as an adjuvant for fertility preservation. Thirty-two adult female 
Wistar rats were divided randomly into four equal groups: Control, Melatonin, 
Cisplatin (CP) treated, and CP + Melatonin treated. The cisplatin-treated group 
showed decreased body and ovarian weights, decreased serum E2 and AMH, increased 
serum LH and FSH, reduced ovarian levels of SOD, CAT, GSH, and TAC, and 
increased ovarian MDA. The histopathological examination of the 
cisplatin-treated group showed deleterious changes within ovarian tissue in the 
form of damaged follicles and corpus luteum, hemorrhage, and inflammatory 
infiltrates with faint PAS reaction in zona pellucida, increased ovarian 
collagen deposition, and marked expression of caspase-3 immune reaction in 
granulosa and theca cells, stroma, and oocytes. Alongside, there was a 
significant downregulation in the mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes, 
IL10, AMPK, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and PTEN, while TGF-β1, IL1β, IL6, TNF-α, NF-Kβ, 
P53, p38-MAPK, JNK, and FOXO3 mRNA expressions were upregulated in 
cisplatin-treated rats' ovarian tissue. Coadministration of cisplatin-treated 
rats with melatonin reversed these changes significantly. In conclusion, 
melatonin's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities could 
modulate ovarian disturbances induced by cisplatin and preserve fertility."
956,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder mainly characterized by obesity, 
hyperglycemia, altered lipid profile, oxidative stress, and vascular compromise. 
Physalis peruviana is a plant used in traditional Colombian medicine for its 
known activities of glucose regulation. This study aimed to evaluate the 
anti-diabetic activity of the butanol fraction from an extract of Physalis 
peruviana calyces in two doses (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) in induced type 2 
diabetic mice. Blood glucose levels were evaluated once a week, demonstrating 
that a dose of 100 mg/kg resulted in greater regulation of blood glucose levels 
in mice throughout the experiment. The same overall result was found for the 
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the homeostatic model assessment for 
insulin resistance (HOMA- IR). The lipid profile exhibited improvement compared 
to the non-treated group, a dose of 100 mg/kg having greater protection against 
oxidative stress (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde levels). 
Histopathological findings in several tissues showed structure preservation in 
most of the animals treated. The butanol fraction from Physalis peruviana at 100 
mg/kg showed beneficial results in improving hyperglycemia, lipidemia, and 
oxidative stress status, and can therefore be considered a beneficial coadjuvant 
in the therapy of diabetes mellitus."
957,"VEGF is an important neurotrophic and vascular factor involved in mental 
disorders. The objective of this study was to verify the effect of genetic 
polymorphisms in the VEGF pathway on the risk for depression, symptom intensity, 
and suicide attempts. To examine the association between the VEGF pathway and 
depression, we genotyped polymorphisms and measured the plasma concentrations of 
VEGF, KDR, and FLT1 proteins. The participants were 160 patients with depression 
and 114 healthy controls. The questionnaires that assessed the clinical profile 
of the patients were the MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, 
GRID-HAMD21, CTQ, BSI, and the number of suicide attempts. Genotyping of 
participants was performed using the real-time PCR and protein measurements were 
performed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). VEGF and its 
inhibitors were reduced in depression. Individuals with depression and 
displaying the homozygous AA of the rs699947 polymorphism had higher plasma 
concentrations of VEGF (p-value = 0.006) and were associated with a greater 
number of suicide attempts (p-value = 0.041). Individuals with depression that 
were homozygous for the G allele of the FLT1 polymorphism rs7993418 were 
associated with lower symptom severity (p-value = 0.040). Our results suggest 
that VEGF pathway polymorphisms are associated with the number of suicide 
attempts and the severity of depressive symptoms."
958,"Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC extract-loaded nanoemulsions have 
demonstrated potential for wound healing, with promising effects on keratinocyte 
proliferation. We carried out the first in vivo investigation of the wound 
healing activity of a hydrogel containing A. satureioides extract-loaded 
nanoemulsions. We prepared hydrogels by adding the gelling agent (Carbopol® 
Ultrez) to extract-loaded nanoemulsions (~250 nm in diameter) obtained by 
spontaneous emulsification. The final flavonoid content in formulation was close 
to 1 mg/mL, as estimated by ultra-fast liquid chromatography. 
Permeation/retention studies using porcine ear skin showed that flavonoids 
reached deeper layers of pig ear skin when it was damaged (up to 3.2 µg/cm² in 
the dermis), but did not reach the Franz-type diffusion cell receptor fluid. For 
healing activity, we performed a dorsal wound model using Wistar rats, 
evaluating the lesion size, anti-inflammatory markers, oxidative damage, and 
histology. We found that extract-loaded formulations promoted wound healing by 
increasing angiogenesis by ~20%, reducing inflammation (tumor necrosis factor α) 
by ~35%, decreasing lipid damage, and improving the re-epithelialization process 
in lesions. In addition, there was an increase in the number of blood vessels 
and hair follicles for wounds treated with the formulation compared with the 
controls. Our findings indicate that the proposed formulation could be promising 
in the search for better quality healing and tissue reconstruction."
959,"INTRODUCTION: Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) is an emerging target for imaging 
and therapy of many types of cancer. Nuclear imaging of NTSR1 allows for 
noninvasive assessment of the receptor levels of NTSR1 on the primary tumor, as 
well as potential metastases. This work focuses on a the neurotensin peptide 
analogue NT-20.3 conjugated to the chelator NOTA for radiolabeling for use in 
noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET). NOTA-NT-20.3 was radiolabeled 
with gallium-68, copper-64, and cobalt-55 to determine the effect that 
modification of the radiometal has on imaging and potential therapeutic 
properties of NOTA-NT-20.3.
METHODS: In vitro assays investigating cell uptake and subcellular localization 
of the radiolabeled peptides were performed using human colorectal 
adenocarcinoma HT29 cells. In vivo PET/CT imaging was used to determine the 
distribution and clearance of the peptide in mice bearing NTSR1 expressing HT29 
tumors.
RESULTS: Cell uptake studies showed that the highest uptake was obtained with 
[55Co] Co-NOTA-NT-20.3 (18.70 ± 1.30%ID/mg), followed by [64Cu] Cu-NOTA-NT-20.3 
(15.46 ± 0.91%ID/mg), and lastly [68Ga] Ga-NOTA-NT-20.3 (10.94 ± 0.46%ID/mg) (p 
&lt; 0.001). Subcellular distribution was similar across the three constructs, 
with the membranous fraction containing the highest amount of radioactivity. In 
vivo PET/CT imaging of the three constructs revealed similar distribution and 
tumor uptake at the 1 h imaging timepoint. Tumor uptake was receptor-specific 
and blockable by co-injection of non-radiolabeled NOTA-NT-20.3. SUV ratios of 
tumor to heart at the 24 h imaging timepoint show that [55Co] Co-NOTA-NT-20.3 
(20.28 ± 3.04) outperformed [64Cu] Cu-NOTA-NT-20.3 (6.52 ± 1.97). In conclusion, 
our studies show that enhanced cell uptake and increasing tumor to blood ratios 
over time displayed the superiority of [55Co] Co-NOTA-NT-20.3 over [68Ga] 
Ga-NOTA-NT-20.3 and [64Cu] Cu-NOTA-NT-20.3 for the targeting of NTSR1."
960,"It is well known that the presence of a blood-brain barrier (BBB) makes drug 
delivery to the brain more challenging. There are various mechanistic routes 
through which therapeutic molecules travel and deliver the drug across the BBB. 
Among all the routes, the transcellular route is widely explored to deliver 
therapeutics. Advances in nanotechnology have encouraged scientists to develop 
novel formulations for brain drug delivery. In this article, we have broadly 
discussed the BBB as a limitation for brain drug delivery and ways to solve it 
using novel techniques such as nanomedicine, nose-to-brain drug delivery, and 
peptide as a drug delivery carrier. In addition, the article will help to 
understand the different factors governing the permeability of the BBB, as well 
as various formulation-related factors and the body clearance of the drug 
delivered into the brain."
961,"Periodontal disease (PD) is a common oral disease in dogs. Recent in vitro 
research revealed that nisin-biogel is a promising compound for canine PD 
control. In this work, a clinical trial was developed to assess the in vivo 
efficacy of nisin-biogel in dogs by determining the dental plaque index (DPI), 
gingivitis index (GI), and periodontal pocket depth (PPD) after dental 
administration. The biogel's influence on aerobic bacteria counts was also 
evaluated, as well as its acceptance/adverse effects in dogs. Twenty animals 
were allocated to one of two groups: a treatment group (TG) subjected to a 
dental topical application of nisin-biogel for 90 days and a control group (CG) 
with no treatment. Besides daily monitoring, on day 1 (T0) and at the end of the 
assay (T90), animals were subjected to blood analysis, periodontal evaluation, 
dental plaque sampling, scaling, and polishing. Statistical analysis with mixed 
models showed a significant reduction in mean PPD (estimate = -0.371, p-value 
&lt; 0.001) and DPI (estimate = -0.146, p-value &lt; 0.05) in the TG animals at 
T90. A reduction in the GI (estimate = -0.056, p-value &gt; 0.05) was also 
observed but with no statistical significance. No influence on total bacterial 
counts was observed, and no adverse effects were detected. The nisin-biogel was 
revealed to be a promising compound for canine PD control."
962,"Perhaps the greatest limitation for the continually advancing developments in 
cancer immunotherapy remains the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). 
The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) axis 
is an emerging immunotherapy target, with the resulting type I interferons and 
transcription factors acting at several levels in both tumor and immune cells 
for the generation of adaptive T cell responses. The cGAS-STING axis activation 
by therapeutic agents that induce DNA damage, such as certain chemotherapies, 
continues to be reported, highlighting the importance of the interplay of this 
signaling pathway and the DNA damage response in cancer immunity/immunotherapy. 
We have developed a multi-targeted mannosylated cationic liposomal 
immunomodulatory system (DS) which contains low doses of the chemotherapeutic 
cytarabine (Ara-C). In this work, we show that entrapment of non-cytotoxic doses 
of Ara-C within the DS improves its ability to induce DNA double strand breaks 
in human ovarian and colorectal cancer cell lines, as well as in various immune 
cells. Importantly, for the first time we demonstrate that the DNA damage 
induced by Ara-C/DS translates into cGAS-STING axis activation. We further 
demonstrate that Ara-C/DS-mediated DNA damage leads to upregulation of surface 
expression of immune ligands on cancer cells, coinciding with priming of 
cytotoxic lymphocytes as assessed using an ex vivo model of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells from colorectal cancer patients, as well as an in vitro NK 
cell model. Overall, the results highlight a broad immunotherapeutic potential 
for Ara-C/DS by enhancing tumor-directed inflammatory responses."
963,"According to the WHO, cancer caused almost 10 million deaths worldwide in 2020, 
i.e., almost one in six deaths. Among the most common are breast, lung, colon 
and rectal and prostate cancers. Although the diagnosis is more perfect and 
spectrum of available drugs is large, there is a clear trend of an increase in 
cancer that ends fatally. A major advance in treatment was the introduction of 
gentler antineoplastics for targeted therapy-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
Although they have undoubtedly revolutionized oncology and hematology, they have 
significant side effects and limited efficacy. In addition to the design of new 
TKIs with improved pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, and being more resistant 
to the development of drug resistance, high expectations are placed on the 
reformulation of TKIs into various drug delivery lipid-based nanosystems. This 
review provides an insight into the history of chemotherapy, a brief overview of 
the development of TKIs for the treatment of cancer and their mechanism of 
action and summarizes the results of the applications of self-nanoemulsifying 
drug delivery systems, nanoemulsions, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, 
lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers used as 
drug delivery systems of TKIs obtained in vitro and in vivo."
964,"Thanks to specific physico-chemical properties, drug delivery systems based on 
nanoparticles have proven to effectively transport delicate molecules for 
therapeutic purposes, protecting them from degradation, increasing their 
stability in the blood circulation and allowing to convey and release the 
transported substances in specific areas of the body. Nanoparticles obtained 
from biopolymers for applications in medicine and pharmaceutics have become 
particularly popular in recent years due to the enormous research effort in the 
field of vaccines to respond to the pandemic emergency. Among the various types 
of biopolymers used to produce nanoparticles for therapeutics, lipids have 
characteristics that make them biocompatible, with low toxicity and ease of 
clearance. They can be synthesized by designing their characteristics according 
to the foreseen administration path, or to the target of the transported drug. 
The analytical methods mostly used to evaluate the characteristics of lipid 
nanosytems for drug delivery involve studying their effects on cells, in vitro 
and in vivo. Although it is often considered a ""niche technique"" for research in 
the bio-related sciences, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is a versatile 
tool to study the structure of nanosystems based on lipids, both ex situ and in 
situ. Therefore, it allows to evaluate both the effect of the different 
synthesis parameters and of the exposure of lipid nanoparticles to physiological 
conditions, which is of fundamental importance to design efficient drug delivery 
systems. In this mini-review, we will report some recent examples of 
characterization and design of nanoparticles based on lipids, where SAXS has 
been a fundamental step both to guide the synthesis of nanomaterials with 
tailored characteristics, and to understand the interaction between 
nanomaterials and cells."
965,"Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) constitute the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB), which prevents the transfer of substances into the brain. Recently, in 
vitro BBB models using human-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived brain 
microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMELCs) have been created. However, it is 
suggested that iBMELCs differentiated by the existing methods are different from 
the BMECs that occur in vivo. This study aimed to establish iBMELCs generated 
via human iPS cell-derived endothelial progenitor cells (iEPCs) (E-iBMELCs). 
Expanded and cryopreserved iEPCs were thawed and differentiated into mature 
endothelial cells under various conditions. Intercellular barriers were 
significantly enhanced in E-iBMELCs using a B-27 supplement, transforming growth 
factor-β receptor inhibitor, and laminin 511 fragment. Expression of the 
endothelial cell markers was higher in the E-iBMELCs generated in this study 
compared with conventional methods. In addition, E-iBMELCs expressed 
P-glycoprotein. E-iBMELCs developed in this study will significantly contribute 
to drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases and might elucidate the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases associated with BBB disruption."
966,"(1) Background: TDMQ20 is a specific regulator of copper homeostasis in the 
brain, able to inhibit cognitive impairment in the early stages of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) in mouse models of AD. To promote the further development of this 
drug-candidate, preliminary data on the pharmacokinetics of TDMQ20 in a mammal 
model have been collected. Since TDMQ20 should be administered orally, its 
absorption by the gastrointestinal tract was evaluated by comparison of blood 
concentrations after administration by oral and IV routes, and its ability to 
reach its target (the brain) was confirmed by comparison between blood and brain 
concentrations after oral administration. (2) Methods: plasmatic and brain 
concentrations of the drug after oral or intravenous treatment of rats at 
pharmacologically relevant doses were determined as a function of time. (3) 
Results: oral absorption of TDMQ20 was rapid and bioavailability was high (66% 
and 86% for males and females, respectively). The drug accumulated in the brain 
for several hours (brain-plasma ratio 3 h after oral administration = 2.6), and 
was then efficiently cleared. (4) Conclusions: these data confirm that TDMQ20 
efficiently crosses the brain-blood barrier and is a relevant drug-candidate to 
treat AD."
967,"Polysaccharides are important structural components of all plant species. 
Gel-like polysaccharides have found wide application in various fields, 
including medicine, construction, and the food industry. In the present work, 
galactomannan and galactoglucomannan gel-like polysaccharides were modified with 
sulfate groups and their anticoagulant activity was studied. Sulfation with 
chlorosulfonic acid in pyridine and with sulfamic acid in pyridine and a 
sulfamic acid-urea deep eutectic solvent were used as synthesis routes. The 
resulting gel-like polysaccharide sulfates were studied by elemental analysis, 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gel permeation chromatography. It 
was established that the anticoagulant effect of sulfated galactoglucomannan 
(SGGM) and galactomannan (SGM-1 and SGM-2) is related to an independent 
antithrombin-independent decrease in the amidolytic activity of thrombin and 
factor Xa. It is shown that the inhibitory activity of SGGM and SGM-2 against 
the collagen-induced platelet aggregation can be an additional factor in 
selecting compounds that are most promising for modifying polymer surfaces to 
ensure resistance to blood clotting."
968,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) receives growing interest in different 
psychiatric clinical settings (emergency, inpatient, and outpatient services). 
Despite its usefulness, TDM remains underemployed in mental health. This is 
partly due to the need for evidence about the relationship between drug serum 
concentration and efficacy and tolerability, both in the general population and 
even more in subpopulations with atypical pharmacokinetics. This work aims at 
reviewing the scientific literature published after 2017, when the most recent 
guidelines about the use of TDM in mental health were written. We found 164 
pertinent records that we included in the review. Some promising studies 
highlighted the possibility of correlating early drug serum concentration and 
clinical efficacy and safety, especially for antipsychotics, potentially 
enabling clinicians to make decisions on early laboratory findings and not 
proceeding by trial and error. About populations with pharmacokinetic 
peculiarities, the latest studies confirmed very common alterations in drug 
blood levels in pregnant women, generally with a progressive decrease over 
pregnancy and a very relevant dose-adjusted concentration increase in the 
elderly. For adolescents also, several drugs result in having different 
dose-related concentration values compared to adults. These findings stress the 
recommendation to use TDM in these populations to ensure a safe and effective 
treatment. Moreover, the integration of TDM with pharmacogenetic analyses may 
allow clinicians to adopt precise treatments, addressing therapy on an 
individual pharmacometabolic basis. Mini-invasive TDM procedures that may be 
easily performed at home or in a point-of-care are very promising and may 
represent a turning point toward an extensive real-world TDM application. 
Although the highlighted recent evidence, research efforts have to be carried 
on: further studies, especially prospective and fixed-dose, are needed to 
replicate present findings and provide clearer knowledge on relationships 
between dose, serum concentration, and efficacy/safety."
969,"Innovative cross-over study designs were explored in non-human primate (NHP) 
studies to determine the value of this approach for the evaluation of drug 
efficacy against tuberculosis (TB). Firstly, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of each 
of the drugs Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z) and Ethambutol (E), 
that are standardly used for the treatment of tuberculosis, was established in 
the blood of macaques after oral dosing as a monotherapy or in combination. Two 
studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
different drug combinations using cross-over designs. The first employed a 
balanced, three-period Pigeon design with an extra period; this ensured that 
treatment by period interactions and carry-over could be detected comparing the 
treatments HR, HZ and HRZ using H37Rv as the challenge strain of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (M. tb). Although the design accounted for considerable variability 
between animals, the three regimens evaluated could not be distinguished using 
any of the alternative endpoints assessed. However, the degree of pathology 
achieved using H37Rv in the model during this study was less than expected. 
Based on these findings, a second experiment using a classical AB/BA design 
comparing HE with HRZ was conducted using the M. tb Erdman strain. More 
extensive pathology was observed, and differences in computerized tomography 
(CT) scores and bacteriology counts in the lungs were detected, although due to 
the small group sizes, clearer differences were not distinguished. Type 1 T 
helper (Th1) cell response profiles were characterized using the IFN-γ ELISPOT 
assay and revealed differences between drug treatments that corresponded to 
decreases in disease burden. Therefore, the studies performed support the 
utility of the NHP model for the determination of PK/PD of TB drugs, although 
further work is required to optimize the use of cross-over study designs."
970,"The development of a biodegradable vascular scaffold (BVS) for the treatment of 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) still requires some improvement. Among them, 
re-endothelialization and anti-inflammation are clinically important to restore 
vascular function. In this study, we proposed a coating system to deliver 
hydrophilic bioactive agents to BVS using nanoemulsion and drop-casting methods. 
The poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) scaffold containing magnesium hydroxide (MH) was 
coated on the surface with bioactive molecules such as polydeoxyribonucleotide 
(PDRN), L-arginine (Arg, R), and mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular 
vesicles (EVs). PDRN upregulates the expression of VEGF as one of the A2A 
receptor agonists; and Arg, synthesized into nitric oxide by intracellular eNOS, 
induces endothelialization. In particular, EVs, which are composed of a lipid 
bilayer and transfer bioactive materials such as protein and nucleic acid, 
regulate homeostasis in blood vessels. Such a bioactive agent coating system and 
its PLLA composite suggest a new platform for the treatment of cardiovascular 
dysfunction."
971,"Neurological diseases remain some of the major causes of death and disability in 
the world. Few types of drugs and insufficient delivery across the blood-brain 
barrier limit the treatment of neurological disorders. The past two decades have 
seen the rapid development of extracellular vesicle-based therapeutics in many 
fields. As the physiological and pathophysiological roles of extracellular 
vesicles are recognized in neurological diseases, they have become promising 
therapeutics and targets for therapeutic interventions. Moreover, advanced 
nanomedicine technologies have explored the potential of extracellular vesicles 
as drug delivery systems in neurological diseases. In this review, we discussed 
the preclinical strategies for extracellular vesicle-based therapeutics in 
neurological disorders and the struggles involved in their clinical application."
972,"[11C]metoclopramide PET imaging provides a sensitive and translational tool to 
explore P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). 
Patients with neurological diseases are often treated with cytochrome (CYP) 
modulators which may impact the plasma and brain kinetics of 
[11C]metoclopramide. The impact of the CYP inducer carbamazepine or the CYP 
inhibitor ritonavir on the brain and plasma kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide was 
investigated in rats. Data obtained in a control group were compared with groups 
that were either orally pretreated with carbamazepine (45 mg/kg twice a day for 
7 days before PET) or ritonavir (20 mg/kg, 3 h before PET) (n = 4 per 
condition). Kinetic modelling was performed to estimate the brain penetration 
(VT) of [11C]metoclopramide. CYP induction or inhibition had negligible impact 
on the plasma kinetics and metabolism of [11C]metoclopramide. Moreover, 
carbamazepine neither impacted the brain kinetics nor VT of [11C]metoclopramide 
(p &gt; 0.05). However, ritonavir significantly increased VT (p &lt; 0.001), 
apparently behaving as an inhibitor of P-gp at the BBB. Our data suggest that 
treatment with potent CYP inducers such as carbamazepine does not bias the 
estimation of P-gp function at the BBB with [11C]metoclopramide PET. This 
supports further use of [11C]metoclopramide for studies in animals and patients 
treated with CYP inducers."
973,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a safe and biodegradable polymer. Given the unique 
physical and chemical properties of PVA, we physically cross-linked PVA with 
kaolin (K) and cedar essential oil (Ced) using the freeze-thawing approach to 
fabricate PVA/Ced/K sponge hydrogels as hemostatic, antibacterial, and 
antioxidant wound healing materials. The physicochemical characteristics of 
PVA/Ced/K hydrogels, including water swelling profiles and gel fractions, were 
surveyed. Additionally, the functional groups of hydrogels were explored by 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), while their microstructures were 
studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the thermal 
features of the hydrogels were probed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Evidently, alterations in cedar 
concentrations resulted in significant variations in size, water uptake 
profiles, and hydrolytic degradation of the hydrogels. The incorporation of 
cedar into the PVA/K endowed the hydrogels with significantly improved 
antibacterial competency against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) and Escherichia 
coli (E. coli). Moreover, PVA/Ced/K exhibited high scavenging capacities toward 
ABTS•+ and DPPH free radicals. Beyond that, PVA/Ced/K hydrogels demonstrated 
hemocompatibility and fast blood clotting performance in addition to 
biocompatibility toward fibroblasts. These findings accentuate the prospective 
implementation of PVA/Ced/K composite hydrogel as a wound dressing."
974,"Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania. 
Leishmania braziliensis (L.b) is one of the most clinically relevant pathogens 
that affects the skin and mucosa, causing single or multiple disfiguring and 
life-threatening injuries. Even so, the few treatment options for patients have 
significant toxicity, high dropout rates, high cost, and the emergence of 
resistant strains, which implies the need for studies to promote new and better 
treatments to combat the disease. Zinc oxide nanocrystals are microbicidal and 
immunomodulatory agents. Here, we develop new Ag-ZnO/xAgO nanocomposites (NCPs) 
with three different percentages of silver oxide (AgO) nanocrystals (x = 49%, 
65%, and 68%) that could act as an option for tegumentary leishmaniasis 
treatment. Our findings showed that 65% and 68% of AgO inhibit the extra and 
intracellular replication of L.b. and present a high selectivity index. 
Ag-ZnO/65%AgO NCPs modulate activation, expression of surface receptors, and 
cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells toward a 
proinflammatory phenotype. These results point to new Ag-ZnO/AgO nanocomposites 
as a promising option for L. braziliensis treatment."
975,"Cartilage damage is a common injury. Currently, tissue engineering scaffolds 
with composite seed cells have emerged as a promising approach for cartilage 
repair. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels are attractive tissue engineering 
scaffold materials as they have high water absorption capacity as well as 
nontoxic and nutrient transport properties. However, PEG is fundamentally 
bio-inert and lacks intrinsic cell adhesion capability, which is critical for 
the maintenance of cell function. Cell adhesion peptides are usually added to 
improve the cell adhesion capability of PEG-based hydrogels. The suitable cell 
adhesion peptide can not only improve cell adhesion capability, but also promote 
chondrogenesis and regulate the immune microenvironment. To improve the 
interactions between cells and PEG hydrogels, we designed 
cysteine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (CRGD), a cell adhesion peptide 
covalently cross-linked with PEG hydrogels by a Michael addition reaction, and 
explored the tissue-engineering hydrogels with immunomodulatory effects and 
promoted chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The 
results indicated that CRGD improved the interaction between peripheral blood 
mesenchymal stem cells (PBMSCs) and PEG hydrogels. PEG hydrogels modified with 1 
mM CRGD had the optimal capacity to promote chondrogenic differentiation, and 
CRGD could induce macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype to promote 
tissue regeneration and repair. PEG-CRGD hydrogels combined with PBMSCs have the 
potential to be suitable scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering."
976,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising add-on therapy to the current standard 
of care for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). The traditional explanation of the 
anti-cancer PDT effects involves the PDT-induced generation of a singlet oxygen 
in the GBM cells, which causes tumor cell death and microvasculature collapse. 
Recently, new vascular mechanisms of PDT associated with opening of the 
blood-brain barrier (OBBB) and the activation of functions of the meningeal 
lymphatic vessels have been discovered. In this review, we highlight the 
emerging trends and future promises of immunotherapy for brain tumors and 
discuss PDT-OBBB as a new niche and an important informative platform for the 
development of innovative pharmacological strategies for the modulation of brain 
tumor immunity and the improvement of immunotherapy for GBM."
977,"Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), in conjunction with 
circulating microbubbles, is an emerging technology that can transiently enhance 
the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) locally and non-invasively to 
facilitate targeted drug delivery to the brain. In this clinical trial, the 
feasibility and safety of BBB modulation in the putamen were evaluated for 
biweekly therapeutic agent delivery in patients with Parkinson's disease. The 
performance of the clinical MRgFUS system's cavitation feedback controller for 
active power modulation throughout the exposures was examined. The putamen was 
targeted unilaterally by an ExAblate Neuro MRgFUS system operating at 220 kHz. 
Definity microbubbles were infused via a saline bag gravity drip at a rate of 4 
µL/kg per 5 min. A cavitation emissions-based feedback controller was employed 
to modulate the acoustic power automatically according to prescribed target 
cavitation dose levels. BBB opening was measured by Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced 
T1-weighted MR imaging, and the presence of potential micro-hemorrhages induced 
by the exposures was assessed via T2*-weighted MR imaging. A total of 12 
treatment sessions were carried out across four patients, with target cavitation 
dose levels ranging from 0.20-0.40. BBB permeability in the targeted putamen was 
elevated successfully in all treatments, with a 14% ± 6% mean increase in 
Gd-enhanced T1-weighted MRI signal intensity relative to the untreated 
contralateral side. No indications of red blood cell extravasations were 
observed on MR imaging scans acquired one day following each treatment session. 
The cavitation emissions-based feedback controller was effective in modulating 
acoustic power levels to ensure BBB permeability enhancement while avoiding 
micro-hemorrhages, however, further technical advancements are warranted to 
improve its performance for use across a wide variety of brain diseases."
978,"The objective of this study was to develop a new preparation method for 
cisplatin (CDDP)-incorporated gelatin hydrogels without using chemical 
crosslinking nor a vacuum heating instrument for dehydrothermal crosslinking. By 
simply mixing CDDP and gelatin, CDDP-crosslinked gelatin hydrogels (CCGH) were 
prepared. CDDP functions as a crosslinking agent of gelatin to form the gelatin 
hydrogel. Simultaneously, CDDP is incorporated into the gelatin hydrogel as a 
controlled release carrier. CDDP's in vitro and in vivo anticancer efficacy 
after incorporation into CCGH was evaluated. In the in vitro system, the CDDP 
was released gradually due to CCGH degradation with an initial burst release of 
approximately 16%. CDDP metal-coordinated with the degraded fragment of gelatin 
was released from CCGH with maintaining the anticancer activity. After 
intraperitoneal administration of CCGH, CDDP was detected in the blood 
circulation while its toxicity was low. Following intraperitoneal administration 
of CCGH in a murine peritoneal dissemination model of human gastric cancer 
MKN45-Luc cell line, the survival time was significantly prolonged compared with 
free CDDP solution. It is concluded that CCGH prepared by the CDDP-based 
crosslinking of gelatin is an excellent sustained release system of CDDP to 
achieve superior anticancer effects with minimal side effects compared with free 
CDDP solution."
979,"The discovery and improvements of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have become an 
alternative to conventional antibiotics. They are usually small and heat-stable 
peptides, exhibiting inhibitory activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive 
bacteria. In this way, studies on broad-spectrum AMPs found in amphibians with 
the remarkable capability to regenerate a wide array of tissues are of 
particular interest in the search for new strategies to treat 
multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. In this work, the use of bioinformatic 
approaches such as sequence alignment with Fasta36 and prediction of 
antimicrobial activity allowed the identification of the Ramosin peptide from 
the de novo assembled transcriptome of the plethodontid salamander Bolitoglossa 
ramosi obtained from post-amputation of the upper limb tissue, heart, and 
intestine samples. BLAST analysis revealed that the Ramosin peptide sequence is 
unique in Bolitoglossa ramosi. The peptide was chemically synthesized, and 
physicochemical properties were characterized. Furthermore, the in vitro 
antimicrobial activity against relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative human 
pathogenic bacteria was demonstrated. Finally, no effect against eukaryotic 
cells or human red blood cells was evidenced. This is the first antibacterial 
peptide identified from a Colombian endemic salamander with interesting 
antimicrobial properties and no hemolytic activity."
980,"This study systematically reviews and characterizes the existing literature on 
transferrin/transferrin receptor-mediated drug delivery. Transferrin is an 
iron-binding protein. It can be used as a ligand to deliver various proteins, 
genes, ions, and drugs to the target site via transferrin receptors for 
therapeutic or diagnostic purposes via transferrin receptors. This study is 
based on a cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of 583 papers limited to the 
subject areas of pharmacology, toxicology, and pharmaceutics as extracted from 
the Scopus database in mid-September 2022. The data were analyzed, and we 
carried out a performance analysis and science mapping. There was a significant 
increase in research from 2018 onward. The countries that contributed the most 
were the USA and China, and most of the existing research was found to be from 
single-country publications. Research studies on transferrin/transferrin 
receptor-mediated drug delivery focus on drug delivery across the blood-brain 
barrier in the form of nanoparticles. The thematic analysis revealed four 
themes: transferrin/transferrin receptor-mediated drug delivery to the brain, 
cancer cells, gene therapy, nanoparticles, and liposomes as drug delivery 
systems. This study is relevant to academics, practitioners, and decision makers 
interested in targeted and site-specific drug delivery."
981,"(1) Background: Continuous monitoring of tacrolimus (TAC), mycophenolic acid 
(MPA), and creatinine (Cre) after renal transplantation is vitally important. In 
this study, we developed a new method based on volumetric absorptive 
microsampling (VAMS) combined with Ultra Performance Liquid 
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to simultaneously quantify 
three analytes including TAC, MPA, and Cre in whole blood. (2) Methods: The 
VAMS-based UPLC-MS/MS assay used a shared extraction and a single injection to 
simultaneously quantify the included TAC, MPA, and Cre. Development and 
validation were carried out following the Food and Drug Administration and 
European Medicines Agency guidelines for the validation of bioanalytical 
methods. Moreover, clinical validation for the three analytes was performed in 
both dried blood spot (DBS) and VAMS. Furthermore, a willingness survey was 
conducted using the system usability scale (SUS) for renal transplant 
recipients. (3) Results: The assay was successfully validated for all analytes. 
No interference, carryover, or matrix effects were observed, and extraction 
recoveries and process efficiencies were &gt;90.00%. Analysis was unaffected by 
hematocrit (0.20~0.60, L/L) and anticoagulants (EDTA-2K). Dried VAMS samples 
were stable for 7 days at ambient temperature and stable for at least 1 month at 
-20 °C. During clinical validation, the measured TAC, corrected MPA, and Cre 
concentrations of VAMS samples met the analytical standards (95.00%, 88.57%, and 
92.50%). When more stringent clinical acceptance criteria were set, the results 
obtained by VAMS (90.00%, 71.43%, and 85.00%) better than DBS (77.50%, 62.86%, 
and 70.00%). Compared with DBS, the survey found that renal transplant 
recipients are more inclined to use VAMS. (4) Conclusions: A robust extraction 
and UPLC-MS/MS analysis method in VAMS tips was developed and fully validated 
for the simultaneous quantification of TAC, MPA, and Cre concentrations. This 
method provides analytical support for the one-sample remote monitoring of both 
immunosuppressive drug concentrations and renal function in allo-renal 
recipients. Based on the good consistency between this method and the routine 
detection of venous blood samples and higher patient satisfaction than DBS, we 
believe that VAMS sampling can be a better alternative to venous whole-blood 
sampling."
982,"Medicinal plants have great prominence in research into the development of new 
medicines. Eugenia uniflora L. (Myrtaceae) is an edible and medicinal plant with 
economic value in the northeast region of Brazil. Several preparations from E. 
uniflora leaves and its fruits are employed as a source of nutrients and 
bioactive compounds. In this study we evaluated the preclinical toxicology of 
crude extract and vaginal gel obtained from the leaves of E. uniflora (5%, 10%, 
and 15%) aiming to provide safety for its use in the treatment of 
vulvovaginitis. Both formulations were applied to the vaginal cavity for 14 
days. Detailed observations of the vaginal region, including pruritus, swelling, 
irritation, burning, pain, and vaginal secretion, as well as the estrous cycle 
were evaluated. On the fifth day, blood samples were obtained from the 
supraorbital plexus for biochemical and hematological analyses. The animals were 
subsequently euthanized. All animals underwent necropsy and macroscopic 
examination of the vaginal mucosa and reproductive system. A histological 
examination was also performed. No clinically significant changes were detected 
during the entire experimental period. All biochemical, hematological, or 
histopathological parameters were within the normal range for the species. The 
data obtained allow us to suggest that the E. uniflora vaginal formulations are 
safe in this experimental model."
983,"The advancement of high-throughput sequencing and genomic analysis revealed that 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease. The 
abundance of such genetic data in ALL can also be utilized to identify potential 
targets for drug discovery and even drug repurposing. We aimed to determine 
potential genes for drug development and further guide the identification of 
candidate drugs repurposed for treating ALL through integrated genomic network 
analysis. Genetic variants associated with ALL were retrieved from the GWAS 
Catalog. We further applied a genomic-driven drug repurposing approach based on 
the six functional annotations to prioritize crucial biological ALL-related 
genes based on the scoring system. Lastly, we identified the potential drugs in 
which the mechanisms overlapped with the therapeutic targets and prioritized the 
candidate drugs using Connectivity Map (CMap) analysis. Forty-two genes were 
considered biological ALL-risk genes with ARID5B topping the list. Based on 
potentially druggable genes that we identified, palbociclib, sirolimus, and 
tacrolimus were under clinical trial for ALL. Additionally, chlorprothixene, 
sirolimus, dihydroergocristine, papaverine, and tamoxifen are the top five drug 
repositioning candidates for ALL according to the CMap score with dasatinib as a 
comparator. In conclusion, this study determines the practicability and the 
potential of integrated genomic network analysis in driving drug discovery in 
ALL."
984,"Cancers and neurological disorders are two major types of diseases. We 
previously developed a new concept termed ""Aberrant Cell Cycle Diseases"" (ACCD), 
revealing that these two diseases share a common mechanism of aberrant cell 
cycle re-entry. The aberrant cell cycle re-entry is manifested as 
kinase/oncogene activation and tumor suppressor inactivation, which are 
hallmarks of both tumor growth in cancers and neuronal death in neurological 
disorders. Therefore, some cancer therapies (e.g., kinase inhibition, tumor 
suppressor elevation) can be leveraged for neurological treatments. The United 
States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has so far approved 74 kinase 
inhibitors, with numerous other kinase inhibitors in clinical trials, mostly for 
the treatment of cancers. In contrast, there are dire unmet needs of 
FDA-approved drugs for neurological treatments, such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke (IS), traumatic brain 
injury (TBI), and others. In this review, we list these 74 FDA-approved 
kinase-targeted drugs and identify those that have been reported in preclinical 
and/or clinical trials for neurological disorders, with a purpose of discussing 
the feasibility and applicability of leveraging these cancer drugs (FDA-approved 
kinase inhibitors) for neurological treatments."
985,"Clinical trials have shown the significant efficacy of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 for 
treating prostate cancer. However, the pharmacokinetic characteristics and 
therapeutic performance of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 still need further improvement to 
meet clinical expectations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
feasibility and therapeutic potential of three novel 177Lu-labeled ligands for 
the treatment of prostate cancer. The novel ligands were efficiently synthesized 
and radiolabeled with non-carrier added 177Lu; the radiochemical purity of the 
final products was determined by Radio-HPLC. The specific cell-binding affinity 
to PSMA was evaluated in vitro using prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1and PC-3. 
Blood pharmacokinetic analysis, biodistribution experiments, small animal SPCET 
imaging and treatment experiments were performed on normal and tumor-bearing 
mice. Among all the novel ligands developed in this study, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-Q 
showed the highest uptake in 22Rv1 cells, while there was almost no uptake in 
PC-3 cells. As the SPECT imaging tracer, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-Q is highly specific in 
delineating PSMA-positive tumors, with a shorter clearance half-life and higher 
tumor-to-background ratio than [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. Biodistribution studies 
verified the SPECT imaging results. Furthermore, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-Q serves well as 
an effective therapeutic ligand to suppress tumor growth and improve the 
survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. All the results strongly demonstrate that 
[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-Q is a PSMA-specific ligand with significant anti-tumor effect in 
preclinical models, and further clinical evaluation is worth conducting."
986,"Tacrolimus (Tac) is a pivotal immunosuppressant agent used to prevent 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
(alloHSCT). Tac is characterized by a narrow therapeutic window and a high 
inter-patient and intra-patient pharmacokinetic variability (IPV). Although high 
IPV of Tac concentrations has been associated with adverse post-transplant 
outcomes following solid organ transplantation, the effects of Tac IPV on 
alloHSCT recipients have not been determined. Tac IPV was therefore 
retrospectively evaluated in 128 alloHSCT recipients receiving high-dose 
post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and the effects of Tac IPV on the 
occurrence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) were analyzed. Tac IPV was calculated from 
pre-dose concentrations (C0) measured during the first month after Tac 
initiation. The cumulative rates of grades II-IV and grades III-IV aGVHD at day 
+100 were 22.7% and 7%, respectively. Higher Tac IPV was associated with a 
greater risk of developing GVHD, with patients having IPV &gt; 50th percentile 
having significantly higher rates of grades II-IV (34.9% vs. 10.8%; hazard ratio 
[HR] 3.858, p &lt; 0.001) and grades III-IV (12.7% vs. 1.5%; HR 9.69, p = 0.033) 
aGVHD than patients having IPV ≤ 50th percentile. Similarly, patients with IPV 
&gt; 75th percentile had higher rates of grades II-IV (41.9% vs. 16.5%; HR 3.30, 
p &lt; 0.001) and grades III-IV (16.1% vs. 4.1%; HR 4.99, p = 0.012) aGVHD than 
patients with IPV ≤ 75th percentile. Multivariate analyses showed that high Tac 
IPV (&gt;50th percentile) was an independent risk factor for grades II-IV (HR 
2.99, p = 0.018) and grades III-IV (HR 9.12, p = 0.047) aGVHD. Determination of 
Tac IPV soon after alloHSCT could be useful in identifying patients at greater 
risk of aGVHD."
987,"Acyclovir has a short half-life and offers poor bioavailability. Its daily dose 
is 200 mg five times a day. A tamarind gum and β-cyclodextrin-based 
pH-responsive hydrogel network for sustained delivery of acyclovir was developed 
using the free-radical polymerization technique. Developed networks were 
characterized by FTIR, DSC, TGA, PXRD, EDX, and SEM. The effect of varying feed 
ratios of polymers, monomers, and crosslinker on the gel fraction, swelling, and 
release was also investigated. FTIR findings confirmed the compatibility of the 
ingredients in a new complex polymer. The thermal stability of acyclovir was 
increased within the newly synthesized polymer. SEM photomicrographs confirmed 
the porous texture of hydrogels. The gel fraction was improved (from 90.12% to 
98.12%) with increased reactant concentrations. The pH of the dissolution medium 
and the reactant contents affected swelling dynamics and acyclovir release from 
the developed carrier system. Based on the R2 value, the best-fit model was 
zero-order kinetics with non-Fickian diffusion as a release mechanism. The 
biocompatibility of the developed network was confirmed through hematology, LFT, 
RFT, lipid profile, and histopathological examinations. No sign of pathology, 
necrosis, or abrasion was observed. Thus, a pH-responsive and biocompatible 
polymeric system was developed for sustained delivery of acyclovir to reduce the 
dosing frequency and improve patient compliance."
988,"Melanoma cells secrete pro-angiogenic factors, which stimulates growth, 
proliferation and metastasis, and therefore are key therapeutic targets. 
Buddleja saligna (BS), and an isolated triterpenoid mixture (DT-BS-01) showed a 
fifty percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 33.80 ± 1.02 and 5.45 ± 0.19 
µg/mL, respectively, against melanoma cells (UCT-MEL-1) with selectivity index 
(SI) values of 1.64 and 5.06 compared to keratinocytes (HaCat). Cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX-2) inhibition was observed with IC50 values of 35.06 ± 2.96 (BS) and 26.40 
± 4.19 µg/mL (DT-BS-01). BS (30 µg/mL) significantly inhibited interleukin 
(IL)-6 (83.26 ± 17.60%) and IL-8 (100 ± 0.2%) production, whereas DT-BS-01 (5 
µg/mL) showed 51.07 ± 2.83 (IL-6) and 0 ± 6.7% (IL-8) inhibition. Significant 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, by 15.84 ± 4.54 and 12.21 
± 3.48%, respectively, was observed. In the ex ovo chick embryo yolk sac 
membrane assay (YSM), BS (15 µg/egg) significantly reduced new blood vessel 
formation, with 53.34 ± 11.64% newly formed vessels. Silver and palladium BS 
nanoparticles displayed noteworthy SI values. This is the first report on the 
significant anti-angiogenic activity of BS and DT-BS-01 and should be considered 
for preclinical trials as there are currently no US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved drugs to inhibit angiogenesis in melanoma."
989,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) 
and the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) worldwide. A 
significant number of drugs have been clinically investigated for the treatment 
of DKD. However, a large proportion of patients still develop end-stage kidney 
disease unstoppably. As a result, new effective therapies are urgently needed to 
slow down the progression of DKD. Recently, there is increasing evidence that 
targeted drug delivery strategies such as large molecule carriers, small 
molecule prodrugs, and nanoparticles can improve drug efficacy and reduce 
adverse side effects. There is no doubt that targeted drug delivery strategies 
have epoch-making significance and great application prospects for the treatment 
of DKD. In addition, the proximal tubule plays a very critical role in the 
progression of DKD. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to summarize the 
current understanding of proximal tubule cell-targeted therapy, screen for 
optimal targeting strategies, and find new therapeutic approaches for the 
treatment of DKD."
990,"Background: Due to the blood-brain barrier and limited antibiotic choices, 
polymyxin is currently the first-line agent for the treatment of central nervous 
system infections (CNSIs) caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria 
(MDR-GNB). Colistin sulfate, as a polymyxin E different from CMS, is used in 
Chinese clinics, and there are limited reports on its use in the treatment of 
CNSIs. Case Presentation: This case describes a 76-year-old man who underwent 
complex neurosurgery for cervical spinal stenosis. Postoperatively, the patient 
developed a fever and a poorly healed surgical wound. Numerous blood routine 
tests, inflammatory markers, pathogenic tests of cervical secretions, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and sputum were sent for diagnosis. After empirical 
antimicrobial treatments failed, the CSF and wound pus cultured 
carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The regimen was adjusted to colistin 
sulfate intravenously and intrathecal injection combined with tigecycline. In 
addition, the management of infection foci, including continuous lumbar pool 
drain, cervical 3-5 internal fixation removal with cervical 1-6 spine dilation, 
CSF leak repair, and right thigh broad fasciotomy, were performed. After 
treatment, the patient was discharged with multiple sets of negative CSF 
cultures and the infection under control. Conclusions: For CNSIs caused by 
MDR-GNB, the selection of colistin sulfate for intravenous and topical 
combination treatment is a viable choice."
991,"Natural biometabolites of plants have been reported to be useful in chronic 
diseases including diabetes and associated complications. This research is aimed 
to investigate how the biometabolites of Lasia spinosa methanol stem (MEXLS) 
extract ameliorative diabetes and diabetes-related complications. MEXLS was 
examined for in vitro antioxidant and in vivo antidiabetic effects in a 
streptozotocin-induced diabetes model, and its chemical profiling was done by 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The results were verified by 
histopathological examination and in silico ligand-receptor interaction of 
characterized natural biometabolites with antidiabetic receptor proteins AMPK 
(PDB ID: 4CFH); PPARγ (PDB ID: 3G9E); and mammalian α-amylase center (PDB ID: 
1PPI). The MEXLS was found to show a remarkable α-amylase inhibition (47.45%), 
strong antioxidant action, and significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in blood 
glucose level, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), urea, uric acid, creatinine, total 
cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), liver glycogen, creatinine kinase (CK-MB), and 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and increase in serum insulin, glucose tolerance, 
and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Rat's pancreas and kidney tissues were found 
to be partially recovered in histopathological analyses. Methyl 
α-d-galactopyranoside displayed the highest binding affinity with AMPK (docking 
score, -5.764), PPARγ (docking score, -5.218), and 1PPI (docking score, -5.615) 
receptors. Data suggest that the MEXLS may be an exciting source to potentiate 
antidiabetic activities affirming a cell-line study."
992,"In order to enable 18F- and 177Lu-labelling within the same molecule, we 
introduced a silicon-based fluoride acceptor (SiFA) into the hexa-D-glutamate 
chain of DOTA-PP-F11N. In addition, minigastrin analogues with a prolonged as 
well as γ-linked D-glutamate chain were synthesised and evaluated. CCK-2R 
affinity (IC50, AR42J cells) and lipophilicity (logD7.4) were determined. 
Biodistribution studies at 24 h post-injection (p.i.) and µSPECT/CT imaging at 
1, 4 and 24 h p.i. were carried out in AR42J tumour-bearing CB17-SCID mice. 
CCK-2R affinity of (R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-1 to 18 was enhanced with increasing 
distance between the SiFA building block and the binding motif. Lipophilicity of 
[177Lu]Lu-(R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-1 to 18 was higher compared to that of 
[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N and [177Lu]Lu-CP04. The respective α- and γ-linked rhCCK 
derivatives revealing the highest CCK-2R affinity were further evaluated in 
vivo. In comparison with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N, [177Lu-]Lu-(R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-9 
and -16 exhibited three- to eight-fold increased activity levels in the tumour 
at 24 h p.i. However, activity levels in the kidneys were elevated as well. We 
could show that the introduction of a lipophilic SiFA moiety into the 
hydrophilic backbone of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N led to a decelerated blood 
clearance and thus improved tumour retention. However, elevated kidney retention 
has to be addressed in future studies."
993,"Background: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, caused by the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus led to a global pandemic. 
HCQ and FPV were used early in the pandemic as a treatment modality for 
COVID-19. Various studies evaluated the HCQ and FPV effectiveness, based on the 
mortality endpoint and showed conflicting results. We hypothesize that analyzing 
the difference in the LOS as a significant endpoint would be of a major 
interest, especially for healthcare providers, to prevent a lengthy 
hospitalization and disease progression. Methods: This is a retrospective 
observational study, conducted via a medical chart review of COVD-19 patients 
who were admitted between April 2020 and March 2021 with a moderate to severe 
illness. The LOS endpoint was tested using the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank (WSR) 
model. Prior to using the WSR model, the balance between the HCQ and FPV groups, 
the propensity score matching, the LOS distribution, and the normality 
assumptions were tested. Two sensitivity statistical analyses were conducted to 
confirm the results (stratified log-rank test and U Welch test after 
transforming the LOS by the squared root values). Results: A total of 200 
patients were included for the analysis: 83 patients in the HCQ group and 117 
patients in the FPV group. Thirty-seven patients were matched in each group. The 
LOS data was positively skewed and violated the normality (Shapiro-Wilk p &lt; 
0.001) and had an unequal variance (Levene's test, p = 0.019). The WSR test 
showed no statistical significance in the LOS endpoint, with a median of -0.75 
days (95% confidence interval: -4.0 to 2.5, p = 0.629), in favor of the HCQ 
group (four days), in comparison to seven days of the FPV group. The WSR 
findings were further confirmed with the stratified log rank test (p = 740) and 
the U Welch test (p = 391). Conclusions: The study concluded that the HCQ and 
FPV treatments have a comparable effectiveness in terms of the LOS in the 
moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. This study highlights the importance of 
analyzing the LOS as a relevant endpoint, in order to prevent the costs of a 
lengthy hospitalization and disease progression. The current study also 
emphasizes the importance of applying the appropriate statistical testing when 
dealing with two-sample paired data and analyzing non-parametric data such as 
the LOS."
994,"Bioorthogonal pretargeted imaging using the inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder 
(IEDDA) reaction between a tetrazine (Tz) and a trans-cyclooctene (TCO) 
represents an attractive strategy for molecular imaging via antibodies. The 
advantages of using a pretargeted imaging approach are on the one hand the 
possibility to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio and imaging contrast; on the 
other hand, the method allows the uncoupling of the biological half-life of 
antibodies from the physical half-life of short-lived radionuclides. A 
brain-penetrating antibody (mAb) specific for β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques was 
functionalized with TCO moieties for pretargeted labeling of Aβ plaques in 
vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo by a tritium-labeled Tz. The overall aim was to 
explore the applicability of mAbs for brain imaging, using a preclinical model 
system. In vitro clicked mAb-TCO-Tz was able to pass the blood-brain barrier of 
transgenic PS2APP mice and specifically visualize Aβ plaques ex vivo. Further 
experiments showed that click reactivity of the mAb-TCO construct in vivo 
persisted up to 3 days after injection by labeling Aβ plaques ex vivo after 
incubation of brain sections with the Tz in vitro. An attempted in vivo click 
reaction between injected mAb-TCO and Tz did not lead to significant labeling of 
Aβ plaques, most probably due to unfavorable in vivo properties of the used Tz 
and a long half-life of the mAb-TCO in the blood stream. This study clearly 
demonstrates that pretargeted imaging of CNS targets via antibody-based click 
chemistry is a viable approach. Further experiments are warranted to optimize 
the balance between stability and reactivity of all reactants, particularly the 
Tz."
995,"Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a haemorrhagic stroke that causes 
approximately 5% of all stroke incidents. We have been working on a treatment 
strategy that targets changes in cerebrovascular contractile receptors, by 
blocking the MEK/ERK1/2 signalling pathway. Recently, a positive effect of 
trametinib was found in male rats, but investigations of both sexes in 
pre-clinical studies are an important necessity. In the current study, a SAH was 
induced in female rats, by autologous blood-injection into the pre-chiasmatic 
cistern. This produces a dramatic, transient increase in intracranial pressure 
(ICP) and an acute and prolonged decrease in cerebral blood flow. Rats were then 
treated with either vehicle or three doses of 0.5 mg/kg trametinib (specific 
MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor) intraperitoneally at 3, 9, and 24 h after the SAH. The 
outcome was assessed by a panel of tests, including intracranial pressure (ICP), 
sensorimotor tests, a neurological outcome score, and myography. We observed a 
significant difference in arterial contractility and a reduction in subacute 
increases in ICP when the rats were treated with trametinib. The sensory motor 
and neurological outcomes in trametinib-treated rats were significantly 
improved, suggesting that the improved outcome in females is similar to that of 
males treated with trametinib."
996,"Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely utilized chemotherapeutic; however, it carries 
side effects, including drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) and 
increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Currently, the mechanisms for 
Dox-associated DITP and VTE are poorly understood, and an effective inhibitor to 
relieve these complications remains to be developed. In this study, we found 
that Dox significantly induced platelet activation and enhanced platelet 
phagocytosis by macrophages and accelerated platelet clearance. Importantly, we 
determined that salvianolic acid C (SAC), a water-soluble compound derived from 
Danshen root traditionally used to treat cardiovascular diseases, inhibited 
Dox-induced platelet activation more effectively than current standard-of-care 
anti-platelet drugs aspirin and ticagrelor. Mechanism studies with tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors indicate contributions of phospholipase C, spleen tyrosine 
kinase, and protein kinase C signaling pathways in Dox-induced platelet 
activation. We further demonstrated that Dox enhanced platelet-cancer cell 
interaction, which was ameliorated by SAC. Taken together, these findings 
suggest SAC may be a promising therapy to reduce the risk of Dox-induced DITP, 
VTE, and the repercussions of amplified platelet-cancer interaction in the tumor 
microenvironment."
997,"Leishmania donovani causes both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis (CL and VL) 
in Sri Lanka, where chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney transplant 
recipients' (KTR) geographical areas overlap. This study aimed to determine the 
risk of exposure to Leishmania infection among renal patients. This 
cross-sectional study in a renal unit assessed clinical symptoms and signs of CL 
and VL in recipients of blood/kidney or immunosuppressives. Sera were tested 
with Leishmania-specific DAT and rK-39 ELISA. There were 170 participants. A 
total of 84.1% (n = 143) were males (CKD: 101, KTR; 42, mean age 45) and 27 were 
females (females: CKD: 23, KTR: 4, mean age 39 years). Recipients of blood 
transfusion/s within last 2 years: 75.9% (CKD: 115, KTR: 14), on 
immunosuppressive therapy: 34.1% (CKD: 13, KTR: 45). Two CKD patients repeatedly 
showed clear positive titres (1: 12,800 and 1: 3200) with Leishmania-DAT and 
another two (CKD) became marginally positive with rK39-ELISA. Prevalence of 
anti-Leishmania antibodies: 2.4% (4/170). All four patients were clinically 
asymptomatic and were recipients of recent blood transfusions. Attributable risk 
of exposure to Leishmania infection through blood transfusions was 0.032, OR 
2.99 (95% CI = 0.16 to 56.45, p = 0.47). Therefore, routine screening of 
kidney/blood donors and CKD and KTR patients in Sri Lanka may not be necessary."
998,"The rapid spread of the African swine fever virus (ASFV), causing severe disease 
with often high fatality rates in Eurasian suids, prevails as a threat for pig 
populations and dependent industries worldwide. Although advancing scientific 
progress continually enhances our understanding of ASFV pathogenesis, 
alternative transmission routes for ASFV have yet to be assessed. Here, we 
demonstrate that ASFV can efficiently be transferred from infected boars to 
naïve recipient gilts through artificial insemination (AI). In modern pig 
production, semen from boar studs often supplies many sow herds. Thus, the 
infection of a boar stud presents the risk of rapidly and widely distributing 
ASFV within or between countries. Daily blood and semen collection from four 
boars after intramuscular inoculation with ASFV strain 'Estonia 2014' resulted 
in the detection of ASFV genomes in the semen as early as 2 dpi, in blood at 1 
dpi while semen quality remained largely unaffected. Ultimately, after 
insemination with extended semen, 7 of 14 gilts were ASFV positive by 7 days 
post insemination, and all gilts were ASFV positive by 35 days post 
insemination. Twelve out of 13 pregnant gilts aborted or resorbed at the onset 
of fever. A proportion of fetuses originating from the remaining gilt showed 
both abnormalities and replication of ASFV in fetal tissues. Thus, we present 
evidence for the efficient transmission of ASFV to gilts via AI and also to 
implanted embryos. These results underline the critical role that boar semen 
could play in ASFV transmission."
999,"BACKGROUND: Campylobacter fetus rarely causes gastrointestinal diseases but 
shows an affinity for the endovascular epithelium.
METHODS: We describe a case of C. fetus bacteremia related to vascular 
prosthesis and pseudoaneurysm infection, with a review of the literature.
RESULTS: A 67-year-old male was admitted with a history of fever, weakness and 
painful swelling of the groin. After unsuccessful treatment with ciprofloxacin, 
the patient was transferred to our hospital, where he had been previously 
treated for aortoiliac occlusive disease including a prosthetic aortobifemoral 
and popliteal bypass with polyester graft placement. An angiography showed a 
pseudoaneurysm in the groin and, therefore, repair of the pseudoaneurysm, 
removal of the prosthesis and biologic graft placement were performed. Blood 
cultures and tissue samples of the vascular prosthesis and pseudoaneurysm 
yielded C. fetus resistant to ciprofloxacin. The patient was treated with 
meropenem for four weeks, followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate for another two 
weeks after discharge. Eight previously published cases of C. fetus bacteremia 
due to infected cardiovascular prosthetic devices (prosthetic heart valves, 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and a permanent pacemaker) were 
summarized in the review.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a C. fetus bacteremia 
related to post-surgical infection of a vascular prosthesis causing a 
pseudoaneurysm."
1000,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new coronavirus 
causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a major topic of global human 
health concern. The Delta and Omicron variants have caused alarming responses 
worldwide due to their high transmission rates and a number of mutations. During 
a one-year follow-up (from June 2020 to June 2021), we included 114 patients 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection to study the long-term dynamics and the correlative 
factors of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in convalescent patients. The blood 
samples were collected at two detection time points (at 6 and 12 months after 
discharge). We evaluated the NAbs response of discharged patients by performing 
a micro-neutralization assay using a SARS-CoV-2 wild type. In addition, a total 
of 62 serum samples from discharged COVID-19 patients with Alpha, Beta, Delta, 
and Omicron variants of infection were enrolled to perform cross-neutralization 
tests using the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and VOCs variants (including Alpha, 
Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants) and to assess the ability of NAbs 
against the SARS-CoV-2 variants. NAbs seroconversion occurred in 91.46% of 
patients (n = 82) in the first timepoint and in 89.29% of patients (n = 84) in 
the second detection point, and three kinds of NAbs kinetics curves were 
perceived. The NAbs levels in young patients had higher values than those in 
elder patients. The kinetics of disease duration was accompanied by an opposite 
trend in NAbs levels. Despite a declining NAbs response, NAbs activity was still 
detectable in a substantial proportion of recovered patients one year after 
discharge. Compared to the wild strain, the Omicron strain could lead to a 
23.44-, 3.42-, 8.03-, and 2.57-fold reduction in neutralization capacity in 
""SAlpha"", ""SBeta"", ""SDelta"", and ""SOmicron"", respectively, and the NAbs levels 
against the Omicron strain were significantly lower than those of the Beta and 
Delta variants. Remarkably, the NAbs activity of convalescent serum with Omicron 
strain infection was most obviously detectable against six SARS-CoV-2 strains in 
our study. The role of the vaccination history in NAbs levels further confirmed 
the previous study that reported vaccine-induced NAbs as the convincing 
protection mechanism against SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our findings highlighted 
the dynamics of the long-term immune responses after the disappearance of 
symptoms and revealed that NAbs levels varied among all types of convalescent 
patients with COVID-19 and that NAbs remained detectable for one year, which is 
reassuring in terms of protection against reinfection. Moreover, a moderate 
correlation between the duration of disease and Nabs titers was observed, 
whereas age was negatively correlated with Nabs titers. On the other hand, 
compared with other VOCs, the Omicron variant was able to escape the defenses of 
the immune system more significantly, and the convalescent serum infected with 
the Omicron variant played a critical part in protection against different 
SARS-CoV-2 variants. Recovery serum from individuals vaccinated with inactivated 
vaccine preceding infection with the Omicron strain had a high efficacy against 
the original strain and the VOCs variants, whereas the convalescent serum of 
persons vaccinated by inactivated vaccine prior to infection with the Delta 
variant was only potent against the wild-type strain."
1001,"Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. There 
is currently no generally recognized method of assessing gastrointestinal injury 
in unconscious or sedated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. I-FABP (intestinal 
fatty acid binding protein) and citrulline have previously been studied as 
potential biomarkers of enterocyte damage in various gastrointestinal tract 
diseases, and changes in the levels of these markers may reflect intestinal wall 
damage in COVID-19. Patients with critical COVID-19, with diagnosed sepsis, or 
septic shock requiring ICU treatment were included in the study. Blood samples 
for citrulline and I-FABP were taken daily from day 1 to 5. I-FABP levels were 
significantly higher in patients who eventually died from COVID-19 than in 
survivors, and the optimal I-FABP cut-off point for predicting 28-day mortality 
was 668.57 pg/mL (sensitivity 0.739, specificity 0.765). Plasma levels of 
I-FABP, but not citrulline, were associated with significantly higher mortality 
and appeared to be a predictor of poor outcome in multivariate logistic 
regression analysis. In conclusion, I-FABP seems to be an effective prognostic 
marker in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Assessing mortality risk based on 
intestinal markers may be helpful in making clinical decisions regarding the 
management of intestinal injury, imaging diagnostics, and potential surgical 
interventions."
1002,"Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is characterized by the presence of low 
levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and undetectable HBsAg in the blood. The 
prevalence of OBI in blood donors in Asia ranges from 0.013% (China) to 10.9% 
(Laos), with no data available from Vietnam so far. We aimed to investigate the 
prevalence of OBI among Vietnamese blood donors. A total of 623 (114 women and 
509 men) HBsAg-negative blood donors were screened for anti-HBc and anti-HBs by 
ELISA assays. In addition, DNA from sera was isolated and nested PCR was 
performed for the HBV surface gene (S); a fragment of the S gene was then 
sequenced in positive samples. The results revealed that 39% (n = 242) of blood 
donors were positive for anti-HBc, and 70% (n = 434) were positive for anti-HBs, 
with 36% (n = 223) being positive for both anti-HBc and anti-HBs. In addition, 
3% of blood donors (n = 19) were positive for anti-HBc only, and 34% (n = 211) 
had only anti-HBs as serological marker. A total of 27% (n = 170) were 
seronegative for any marker. Two of the blood donors (0.3%) were OBI-positive 
and sequencing revealed that HBV sequences belonged to HBV genotype B, which is 
the predominant genotype in Vietnam."
1003,"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous zoonotic parasite, with felines being the only 
definitive hosts. Cats shed oocysts with their faeces, and seroprevalence 
studies can be used to indirectly assess the environmental contamination. The 
current study aimed to evaluate T. gondii seroprevalence in Greek cats and 
identify possible risk factors. In total, 1554 blood samples were analyzed from 
different cats across all nine geographic regions of Greece, and a short 
questionnaire was completed for each cat. A rapid immunochromatographic test was 
used to detect anti-T. gondii antibodies, IgG type, and 21.8% of cats were 
seropositive. Regarding risk factors, when chi-square tests were applied, 
seropositivity was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in rural cats, cats with 
outdoor access, and hunting cats. Gender, age, ownership, and raw feeding were 
not significant risk factors, although female, adult, stray, and raw-feeding 
cats had a higher seroprevalence than their counterparts. Binary logistic 
regression models were developed to adjust for the confounding effects of the 
initially recognized risk factors, and only hunting in urban areas remained a 
significant risk factor. Greek cats had lower seropositivity than the average 
European value, and the present research highlights the importance of updated 
seroprevalence and risk factor studies within the context of One-Health."
1004,"On the African continent, a large number of arthropod-borne viruses 
(arboviruses) with zoonotic potential have been described, and yet little is 
known of most of these pathogens, including their actual distribution or genetic 
diversity. In this study, we evaluated as a proof-of-concept the effectiveness 
of the nonspecific sequencing technique sequence-independent single primer 
amplification (SISPA) on third-generation sequencing techniques (MinION 
sequencing, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) by comparing the 
sequencing results from six different samples of arboviruses known to be 
circulating in Africa (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Rift 
Valley fever virus (RVFV), Dugbe virus (DUGV), Nairobi sheep disease virus 
(NSDV), Middleburg virus (MIDV) and Wesselsbron virus (WSLV)). All sequenced 
samples were derived either from previous field studies or animal infection 
trials. Using this approach, we were able to generate complete genomes for all 
six viruses without the need for virus-specific whole-genome PCRs. Higher Cq 
values in diagnostic RT-qPCRs and the origin of the samples (from cell culture 
or animal origin) along with their quality were found to be factors affecting 
the success of the sequencing run. The results of this study may stimulate the 
use of metagenomic sequencing approaches, contributing to a better understanding 
of the genetic diversity of neglected arboviruses."
1005,"Triatoma melanica is a sylvatic vector species in Brazil. In We aimed to 
characterize the Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs), the parasitic 
loads, and the blood meal sources of insects collected in rocky outcrops in 
rural areas in the state of Minas Gerais. An optical microscope (OM) and 
kDNA-PCR were used to examine natural infection by T. cruzi, and positive 
samples were genotyped by conventional multilocus PCR. Quantification of the T. 
cruzi load was performed using qPCR, and the blood meal sources were identified 
by Sanger sequencing the 12S rRNA gene. A total of 141 T. melanica were 
captured. Of these, ~55% (61/111) and ~91% (63/69) were positive by OM and 
KDNA-PCR, respectively. We genotyped ~89% (56/63) of the T. cruzi-positive 
triatomines, with TcI (~55%, 31/56) being the most prevalent DTU, followed by 
TcIII (~20%, 11/56) and TcII (~7%, 4/56). Only TcI+TcIII mixed infections were 
detected in 10 (~18%) specimens. A wide range of variation in the parasitic 
loads of T. melanica was observed, with an overall median value of 104 
parasites/intestine, with females having higher T. cruzi loads than N2, N4, and 
N5. TcII showed lower parasitic loads compared to TcI and TcIII. The OM positive 
diagnosis odds ratio between T. cruzi infection when the parasite load is 107 
compared to 103 was approximately 29.1. The most frequent blood meal source was 
Kerodon rupestris (~58%), followed by Thrichomys apereoides (~18%), Wiedomys 
cerradensis (~8%), Galactis cuja (~8%) and Gallus gallus (~8%). Our findings 
characterize biological and epidemiological aspects of the sylvatic population 
of T. melanica in the study area, highlighting the need to extend surveillance 
and control to this vector."
1006,"Listeriosis is a serious food-borne illness, especially in susceptible 
populations, including children, pregnant women, and elderlies. The disease can 
occur in two forms: non-invasive febrile gastroenteritis and severe invasive 
listeriosis with septicemia, meningoencephalitis, perinatal infections, and 
abortion. Expression of each symptom depends on various bacterial virulence 
factors, immunological status of the infected person, and the number of ingested 
bacteria. Internalins, mainly InlA and InlB, invasins (invasin A, LAP), and 
other surface adhesion proteins (InlP1, InlP4) are responsible for epithelial 
cell binding, whereas internalin C (InlC) and actin assembly-inducing protein 
(ActA) are involved in cell-to-cell bacterial spread. L. monocytogenes is able 
to disseminate through the blood and invade diverse host organs. In persons with 
impaired immunity, the elderly, and pregnant women, the pathogen can also cross 
the blood-brain and placental barriers, which results in the invasion of the 
central nervous system and fetus infection, respectively. The aim of this 
comprehensive review is to summarize the current knowledge on the epidemiology 
of listeriosis and L. monocytogenes virulence mechanisms that are involved in 
host infection, with a special focus on their molecular and cellular aspects. We 
believe that all this information is crucial for a better understanding of the 
pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes infection."
1007,"Trypanosomes are a group of pathogens distributed in the continents of Africa, 
America, Asia and Europe, and they affect all vertebrates including the 
neotropical primate group. Information about the trypanosome's diversity, 
phylogeny, ecology and pathology in non-human primates (NHPs) from the 
neotropical region is scarce. The objective of the study was to identify 
Trypanosoma and Babesia molecularly in NHPs under the phylogenetic species 
concept. We extracted DNA from a total of 76 faecal samples collected between 
2019 and 2021, from a total of 11 non-human primate species of which 46 are from 
captive NHPs and 30 are free-living NHPs in the Western Amazon region of 
Ecuador. We did not detect DNA of Babesia sp. by polymerase chain reaction test 
in any of the faecal samples. However, the nested-PCR-based method revealed 
Trypanosoma parasites by ITS gene amplification in two faecal samples; one for 
the species Leontocebus lagonotus (from the captive population) and a second one 
for Cebus albifrons (from the free-ranging population). Maximum parsimony and 
likelihood methods with the Kimura2+G+I model inferred the evolutionary history 
of the two records, which showed an evolutionary relationship with the genus 
Trypanosoma. Two sequences are monophyletic with Trypanosoma. However, the 
number of sequences available in GenBank for their species identification is 
limited. The two samples present different molecular identifications and 
evolutionary origins in the tree topology. We are most likely referring to two 
different species, and two different localities of infection. We suggest that 
health management protocols should be implemented to prevent the transmission of 
blood-borne pathogens such as Trypanosoma sp. among captive populations. In 
addition, these protocols also protect the personnel of wildlife rehabilitation 
centers working in close proximity to NHPs and vice versa."
1008,"Although influenza A virus is endemic in wild waterfowl, domestic poultry, 
swine, humans, bats, cetaceans, dogs, and horses, there is a paucity of data on 
the potential role of camels in zoonotic transmission of the virus. To estimate 
the seroprevalence of the influenza A virus in camel populations, four local 
government areas of Nigeria that share an international border with the Niger 
Republic were selected. Blood samples from 184 one-hump camels (dromedaries) 
were collected and tested for influenza IgG antigen by ELISA. Each camel's 
demographic variable, such as age, gender, location, production system, and 
usage, was recorded. The overall seroprevalence rate of influenza virus IgG in 
this study was 10.33% (95%CI: 6.33-15.66%). In the bivariate model, there was no 
significant difference in gender, age, site location and production system, 
except for usage. There was a significantly lower seroprevalence rate among 
camels used for labour (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.10-0.97) than those 
used for meat consumption; however, not after adjusting for other variables in 
the model. Increase surveillance through early detection, prediction, and risk 
assessment of pathogens in animal reservoirs and environmental contamination as 
One Health strategies to reduce potential human spillover is recommended. 
Molecular epidemiology studies could better elucidate the role of camels in the 
dynamics of disease transmission pathways."
1009,"Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is responsible for hemorrhagic gastroenteritis

immune response. Three studies have analyzed the genomic mutations of CPV-2 
variants in Thailand. These investigations were independently conducted at 
different timepoints. Thus, a retrospective integrated analysis of CPV-2 genomic 
mutations has not been fully performed. Our study aimed at evaluating the 
evolutionary changes in CPV-2 in Thailand from 2003 to 2019. Two hundred and 
sixty-eight Thai CPV-2 nucleotide sequences were used for multiple amino acid 
sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses. From 2003 to 2010, CPV-2a and -2b 
were the only variants detected. CPV-2c, emerged in 2014, replacing CPV-2a and 
-2b, and has become a major variant in 2019. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 
the proposed mutation pattern of VP2 amino acid residues could help distinguish 
Thai CPV-2 variants. This comprehensive examination provides insight into the 
genomic evolution of CPV-2 in Thailand since its first reporting in 2003, which 
may facilitate the surveillance of the potential genetic alteration of emergent 
CPV-2 variants."
1010,"Background: The robustness of sero-surveillance has delineated the high burden 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children; however, these existing data showed wide 
variation. This study aimed to identify the serostatus of antibodies against 
SARS-CoV-2 and associated factors among children following the fourth pandemic 
wave in Vietnam. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Vietnam 
National Children's Hospital (VNCH) between March 13 and April 3, 2022. Thus, 
4032 eligible children seeking medical care for any medical condition not 
related to acute COVID-19 infection were tested for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by 
ADVIA Centaur® SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sCOVG) assay using the residuals of routine blood 
samples. Results: The median age of enrolled children was 39 (IQR = 14-82) 
months. The overall seropositive prevalence was 59.2% (95%CI = 57.6-60.7) and 
the median antibody titer was 4.78 (IQR 2.38-9.57) UI/mL. The risk of 
seropositivity and the median antibody titer were not related to gender (58.6% 
versus 60.1%, 4.9 versus 4.6 UI/mL, all p &gt; 0.05). Children aged ≤12 months 
were likely to be seropositive compared to children aged 36 to &lt;60 months 
(59.2% versus 57.5%, p = 0.49) and those aged ≥144 months (59.2% versus 65.5%, p 
= 0.16). Children aged ≥144 months exhibited a significantly higher titer of 
protective COVID-19 antibodies than other age groups (p &lt; 0.001). In 
multivariate logistic regression, we observed independent factors associated 
with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, including the age 13 to &lt;36 months (OR = 
1.29, 95%CI = 1.06-1.56, p = 0.01), 60 to &lt;144 months (OR = 0.79, 95%CI = 
0.67-0.95, p = 0.01), ≥144 months (OR = 1.84, 95%CI = 1.21-2.8, p = 0.005), the 
presence of infected household members (OR = 2.36, 95%CI = 2.06-2.70, p &lt; 
0.001), participants from Hanoi (OR = 1.54, 95%CI = 1.34-1.77, p &lt; 0.001), 
underlying conditions (OR = 0.71, 95%CI = 0.60-0.85, p ≤ 0.001), and using 
corticosteroids or immunosuppressants (OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.48-0.86, p = 0.003). 
Conclusions: This study highlights a high seroprevalence of antibodies against 
SARS-CoV-2 among children seeking medical care for non-acute COVID-19-related 
conditions in a tertiary children's hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. In the context 
of reopening in-person schools and future emerging COVID-19 variants, this point 
will also be a key message about the necessity of ""rush-out"" immunization 
coverage for children, especially those under the age of five years."
1011,"African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of a highly contagious 
and lethal vector-borne disease in suids. Recently, a live attenuated virus 
strain, developed using the currently circulating, virulent Georgia strain 
(ASFV-G) with a single gene deletion (ASFV-G-ΔI177L), resulted in an effective 
vaccine. Nevertheless, protective immune response mechanisms induced by this 
candidate are poorly understood. In this study, Yorkshire crossbred swine 
intramuscularly vaccinated with 106 50% hemadsorption dose (HAD50) of 
ASFV-G-ΔI177L or a vehicle control were challenged at 28 days post-inoculation 
(dpi) with 102 HAD50 of ASFV-G. Analysis of purified peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells following inoculation and challenge revealed that CD4+, CD8+ 
and CD4+CD8+ central memory T cells (CD44+CD25-CD27-CD62L+CCR7+, Tcm) decreased 
significantly by 28 dpi in ASFV-G-ΔI177L-vaccinated swine compared to baseline 
and time-matched controls. Conversely, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD8+ effector memory T 
cells (CD44+CD25-CD27-CD62-CCR7-, Tem) increased significantly among 
ASFV-G-ΔI177L-vaccined swine by 28 dpi compared to baseline and time-matched 
controls. Additionally, the percentage of natural killer (NK), CD4+ and CD4+CD8+ 
Tem and CD8+ Tcm and Tem positive for IFNγ increased significantly following 
inoculation, surpassing that of controls by 28 dpi or earlier. These results 
suggest that NK and memory T cells play a role in protective immunity and 
suggest that studying these cell populations may be a surrogate immunity marker 
in ASF vaccination."
1012,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the Accelerate Pheno™ 
system (APS) (Accelerate Diagnostics, Denver, CO, USA) for rapid laboratory 
diagnosis of bloodstream infections. The study included 45 positive blood 
samples obtained from patients hospitalized in University Hospital No. 1 in 
Bydgoszcz, Poland. In 40 (88.9%) blood samples, the APS was capable of 
identification of at least one microorganism at the genus or species level and 
in 38 (84.4%) of them additionally assessed antimicrobial susceptibility. The 
time of identification and the time to result of antimicrobial susceptibility 
ranged from 1:32 to 1:42 and 5:02 to 5:36 h, respectively. Six positive blood 
samples revealed a poly-microbial culture. In these cases, only one out of two 
or three microorganisms was detected by the APS, and the system assessed 
antimicrobial susceptibility only for them. For 78.6% positive blood samples, 
agreement on identification compared to mass spectrometry was found. For all but 
one sample, a 96-100% compliance of the resistance category was achieved when 
comparing the antimicrobial susceptibility testing results to conventional 
methods. Using the APS, the total time to report was reduced from 13:34 to even 
63:47 h compared to the standard microbiological laboratory workflow. The APS is 
a very useful system, especially for the rapid assessment of antimicrobial 
susceptibility of bacteria directly from positive blood samples, offering the 
greatest potential for microbiology laboratories operating around the clock."
1013,"Staphylococcus hominis is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) commensal 
capable of causing serious systemic infections in humans. The emergence of 
multidrug-resistant S. hominis strains is of concern but little is known about 
the characteristics of this organism, particularly from Malaysia. Here, we 
present the comparative genome analysis of S. hominis ShoR14, a 
multidrug-resistant, methicillin-resistant blood isolate from Terengganu, 
Malaysia. Genomic DNA of S. hominis ShoR14 was sequenced on the Illumina 
platform and assembled using Unicycler v0.4.8. ShoR14 belonged to sequence type 
(ST) 1 which is the most prevalent ST of the S. hominis subsp. hominis. 
Comparative genomic analysis with closely related strains in the database with 
complete genome sequences, led to the discovery of a novel variant of the 
staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) type VIII element harboring the 
mecA methicillin-resistance gene in ShoR14 and its possible carriage of a SCCfus 
element that encodes the fusidic acid resistance gene (fusC). Up to seven 
possible ShoR14 plasmid contigs were identified, three of which harbored 
resistance genes for tetracycline (tetK), chloramphenicol (catA7), macrolides, 
lincosamides, and streptogramin B (ermC). Additionally, we report the discovery 
of a novel mercury-resistant transposon, Tn7456, other genomic islands, and 
prophages which make up the S. hominis mobilome."
1014,"Ticks and fleas are blood-sucking ectoparasites that cause irritation and 
anaemia to their hosts and act as vectors of pathogens (vector-borne pathogens, 
VBPs) of relevance for animal and human health. In the present study, tick and 
flea species in dogs and cats from Cyprus were recorded and VBPs were detected 
in the collected specimens. Ectoparasites were collected from 220 animals (161 
dogs and 59 cats), and a questionnaire including demographic, clinical, and 
other information was filled out for each animal. The ectoparasites were 
morphologically identified and the detection of VBPs was performed by 
PCR-coupled sequencing. Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato was found on 108 
dogs and 13 cats, and Ixodes gibbosus on 2 dogs. Ctenocephalides felis was the 
predominant flea species (on 62 dogs and 45 cats), while one dog and one cat 
were infested by Ctenocephalides canis and Echidnophaga gallinacea, 
respectively. The VBPs in ticks were Anaplasma platys, Rickettsia massiliae, 
Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia felis, Hepatozoon felis and Hepatozoon canis, 
while Rickettsia felis, Rickettsia sp., Bartonella koehlerae, Bartonella 
clarridgeiae, and Bartonella henselae were recorded in fleas. Statistical 
analysis (chi-square test and multiple univariate generalized linear model) 
showed that animals up to 6 months of age were less likely to be infested with 
ticks than older animals, but more likely to be infested with fleas. Ticks were 
more prevalent in sheltered than in owned animals, while the odds ratio of flea 
presence was higher in owned animals than those living in shelters. The present 
study is the first investigation on the occurrence of ticks and fleas in dogs 
and cats from Cyprus, showing the presence of different VBPs in these important 
ectoparasites. The results point out the importance of systematic ectoparasite 
control in dogs and cats."
1015,"Filoviruses are a group of single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses. The most 
well-known filoviruses that affect humans are ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. 
During infection, they can cause life-threatening symptoms such as inflammation, 
tissue damage, and hemorrhagic fever, with case fatality rates as high as 90%. 
The innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogenic insults 
such as filoviruses. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like 
receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors, C-type lectin 
receptors, AIM2-like receptors, and NOD-like receptors, detect pathogens and 
activate downstream signaling to induce the production of proinflammatory 
cytokines and interferons, alert the surrounding cells to the threat, and clear 
infected and damaged cells through innate immune cell death. However, 
filoviruses can modulate the host inflammatory response and innate immune cell 
death, causing an aberrant immune reaction. Here, we discuss how the innate 
immune system senses invading filoviruses and how these deadly pathogens 
interfere with the immune response. Furthermore, we highlight the experimental 
difficulties of studying filoviruses as well as the current state of 
filovirus-targeting therapeutics."
1016,"Treatment of obesity should be multidirectional and include, in addition to 
bariatric surgery, changing the key factors of lifestyle and eating habits. The 
study aimed to assess the impact of bariatric surgery and dietary care on 
anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, changes in lifestyle, and eating 
habits of patients within 9 months after the procedure, with the selection of 
environmental factors determining BMI variation. The study included 30 SG 
patients before surgery (month zero) and at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months after SG. 
Patients completed a questionnaire regarding age, sex, place of residence, 
education, professional activity, number of family members, financial situation, 
family history of obesity, previous forms of therapy, self-assessment of 
nutritional knowledge, receiving and following nutritional recommendations, 
eating habits, frequency of body weight control, leisure time. Body weight, 
height, waist and hip circumference, and systolic and diastolic pressure were 
measured, and BMI and WHR (Waist to Hip Ratio) were calculated. Within 9 months 
after the procedure, the patients' body weight and BMI decreased on average by 
26%. Post bariatric surgery, patients changed their eating habits. The influence 
of bariatric SG surgery and time after surgery was decisive for the 
normalization of BMI and explained the 33% variation in BMI up to 9 months after 
the procedure. Other factors important for the normalization of BMI after 
surgery were: male gender, older age of patients, family obesity (non-modifiable 
factors), as well as previous forms of therapy related to weight loss before 
surgery, shortening the intervals between meals and stopping eating at night 
(modifiable factors). The tested model explained 68% of the BMI variation after 
SG surgery for all assessed factors. Changes in lifestyle and eating habits in 
bariatric patients are crucial to maintaining the effect of bariatric surgery."
1017,"Existing reports focus on zinc-associated immunity and infection in malnourished 
children; however, whether zinc also plays an important role in the immune 
homeostasis of the non-zinc-deficient population remained unknown. This study 
aimed to investigate the association between zinc status and toll-like receptor 
(TLR)-related innate immunity and infectious outcome in well-nourished children. 
A total of 961 blood samples were collected from 1 through 5 years of age. Serum 
zinc was analyzed, and mononuclear cells isolated to assess TNF-α, IL-6, and 
IL-10 production by ELISA after stimulation with TLR ligands. Childhood 
infections were analyzed as binary outcomes with logistic regression. The 
prevalence of zinc deficiency was 1.4-9.6% throughout the first 5 years. There 
was significant association between zinc and TLR-stimulated cytokine responses. 
Higher serum zinc was associated with decreased risk of ever having pneumonia 
(aOR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99) at 3 years, and enterocolitis (aOR: 0.96; 95% 
CI: 0.93, 0.99) at 5 years. Serum zinc was lower in children who have had 
pneumonia before 3 years of age (72.6 ± 9 vs. 81.9 ± 13 μg/dL), and 
enterocolitis before 5 years (89.3 ± 12 vs. 95.5 ± 13 μg/dL). We emphasize the 
importance of maintaining optimal serum zinc in the young population."
1018,"Physical activity and muscle strengthening are essential for preventing and 
managing metabolic syndrome. This study was conducted to investigate the 
relationship between the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and meeting the 
guidelines for aerobic physical activity (APA), muscle strengthening exercise 
(MSE), and combined exercise. We used data from 22,467 Koreans aged 40 years or 
older, who participated in in the Korea National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2014-2019. We used the Global Physical Activity 
Questionnaire (GPAQ) to measure physical activity and surveyed frequency of MSE 
through a questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the 
American heart association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. 
Compared with none exercise group, odds ratios of APA, MSE, and combined 
exercise group (CEG) on metabolic syndrome prevalence were 0.85 (95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.74-0.98), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67-0.99), and 0.65 (95% CI, 
0.54-0.78) among men, respectively. Among women, ORs of APA, MSE, and CEG were 
0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.93), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58-0.91), and 0.74 (95% CI, 
0.58-0.93), respectively. This study showed that meeting guidelines for APA and 
MSE was associated with lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, 
subjects who met both APA and MSE had the lowest metabolic syndrome prevalence."
1019,"COVID-19 and imposed restrictions are linked with numerous health consequences, 
especially among endurance athletes (EA). Unfavorable changes in physical 
activity and nutrition may affect later sports and competition performance. The 
aims of this study were: (1) to assess the impact of COVID-19 infection and 
pandemic restrictions on the nutrition and physical activity of EAs and (2) to 
compare them with the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). In 
total, 49 EAs (nmale = 43, nfemale = 6, mean age = 39.9 ± 7.8 year., height = 
178.4 ± 6.8 cm, weight = 76.3 ± 10.4 kg; BMI = 24.0 ± 2.6 kg·m-2) underwent pre- 
and post-COVID-19 CPET and fulfilled the dietary and physical activity survey. 
COVID-19 infection significantly deteriorated CPET performance. There was a 
reduction in oxygen uptake and in heart rate post-COVID-19 (both p &lt; 0.001). 
Consuming processed meat and replacing meat with plant-based protein affected 
blood lactate concentration (p = 0.035). Fat-free mass was linked with consuming 
unsaturated fatty acids (p = 0.031). Adding salt to meals influenced maximal 
speed/power (p = 0.024) and breathing frequency (p = 0.033). Dietary and Fitness 
Practitioners and Medical Professionals should be aware of possible COVID-19 
infection and pandemic consequences among EA. The results of this study are a 
helpful guideline to properly adjust the treatment, nutrition, and training of 
EA."
1020,"Salvia plebeia R. Br. (SP), grown from autumn to spring, is used as a medicinal 
herb from roots to leaves. This herb exhibits antioxidant activities and various 
physiological effect, including anti-asthma, immune-promoting, anti-obesity, and 
anti-cholesterol effects. However, the effectiveness of SP against non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the associated mechanism have not been 
elucidated. In this study, alleviation of NAFLD by SP was confirmed in a mouse 
model of hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet and in HepG2 cells 
administered free fatty acids (FFA). In the experimental model, intrahepatic 
lipid accumulation was investigated using the AdipoRedTM assay, Oil Red O 
staining, biomarker analysis, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Furthermore, 
glucose tolerance was examined based on the fasting glucose levels and oral 
glucose tolerance. The molecular mechanisms related to hepatic steatosis were 
determined based on marker mRNA levels. Blood FFAs were found to flow into the 
liver via the action of fatty acid translocase, cluster of differentiation 36, 
and fatty acid transporter proteins 2 and 5. Salvia plebeia R. Br. water extract 
(SPW) suppressed the FFAs inflow by regulating the expression of the 
above-mentioned proteins. Notably, modulating the expression of AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) and liver X receptor, which are involved in the regulation 
of lipid metabolism, stimulated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α in 
the nucleus to induce the expression genes involved in β-oxidation and increase 
β-oxidation in the mitochondria. AMPK modulation also increased the expression 
of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, which activated lipid synthesis 
enzymes. As a consequence of these events, triglyceride synthesis was reduced 
and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was alleviated. Overall, our findings 
suggested that SPW could ameliorate NAFLD by inhibiting hepatic steatosis 
through AMPK modulation."
1021,"Hyperprolactinemia in males with prolactin-secreting adenomas, or prolactinomas, 
may be associated with endothelial dysfunction and co-existing cardiovascular 
risk factors. As a noninvasive technique of assessing cardiac function, 
impedance cardiography (ICG) may be useful in the early detection of hemodynamic 
dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to analyze and compare the 
hemodynamic profiles of patients with prolactinoma versus controls. A total of 
20 men with prolactinoma (PR group) (mean age 43 years) and 20 men from the 
control group (CG) were evaluated in this prospective, observational comparative 
clinical study. The study subjects were propensity score-matched in terms of 
clinical characteristics-age, mean blood pressure [MBP], arterial hypertension 
[AH] rates, and body mass index [BMI]. ICG assessments of hemodynamic profiles 
were conducted with the use of a Niccomo™ device and included stroke volume 
index (SI), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), 
velocity index (VI), acceleration index (ACI), Heather index (HI), and thoracic 
fluid content (TFC). AH was well-controlled in both study groups (116/76 mmHg PR 
vs. 119/76 mmHg CG). In comparison with CG patients, ICG revealed PR group 
patients to have higher rates of high thoracic fluid content (TFC) (&gt;35 
1/kOhm; p = 0.035) and lower SI values (&lt;35 mL/m2, p = 0.072). There was a 
convergent tendency towards lower values of other cardiac function parameters 
(SI, CI, VI, ACI, and HI). Prolactinoma-associated endocrine abnormalities are 
related to hemodynamic profile alterations, including higher rates of increased 
TFC and the risk of worsened cardiac function."
1022,"BACKGROUND: The quality of autonomic blood pressure (BP) control can be assessed 
by the entropy of serial BP data. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
effect of hemodialysis (HD) and glucose infusion (GI) on amplitude aware 
permutation entropy (AAPE) of hemodynamic variables during HD in chronic kidney 
disease patients with and without type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
METHODS: Twenty-one patients without DM (NDO) and ten with DM were studied. 
Thirty minutes after the start of HD, a 40% glucose solution was administered. 
Hemodynamic data were extracted from continuous recordings using the Portapres® 
system.
RESULTS: AAPE decreased during HD in all patients and all hemodynamic signals 
with the exception of AAPE of mean and diastolic BP in DM patients. GI led to an 
increase in AAPE for cardiac output in all patients, while AAPE for heart rate 
and ejection time increased only in DM studies, and AAPE for systolic, 
diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, as well as total peripheral resistance, 
increased only in NDO patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in entropy during HD indicates impaired autonomic 
control in response to external perturbations. This state is partially reversed 
by the infusion of glucose with differences in central and peripheral 
responsiveness in DM and NDO patients."
1023,"Currently, functional dairy products pave a promising way for the prophylaxis of 
essential hypertension, and the search for new strains capable of producing such 
products is a constant challenge for scientists around the world. In this study, 
the antihypertensive properties of milk fermented with several strains of 
traditional yogurt starters (Lactobacillus delbrueckii strains Lb100 and Lb200; 
Lactococcus lactis strains dlA, AM1 and MA1; Streptococcus&amp;nbsp;thermophilus 
strains 159 and 16t) and one strain of non-conventional probiotic starter 
(Lacticaseibacillus paracasei ABK) were assessed. The in vitro assessment using 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition assay was performed for all 
fermentation products, and the best performed products were tested in vivo using 
Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) animal model. In addition, for the best 
performed products the fatty acid (FA) composition and FA-related nutritional 
indices were determined. As a result, the milk fermented with two strains (Lb. 
delbrueckii LB100 and Lc. lactis AM1) demonstrated significant antihypertensive 
effect during both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, the milk 
fermented with Lb. delbrueckii Lb100 demonstrated significantly better 
FA-related nutritional indexes and lowered total cholesterol in SHRs upon 
regular consumption. The obtained results can be used in the future to develop 
new starter cultures producing effective functional antihypertensive dairy 
products."
1024,"Introduction: Medium-chain fatty acids contain 6-12 carbon atoms and are 
absorbed directly into the blood vessels, proceeding to the portal vein and, 
finally, to the liver, where they are immediately utilized for energy. We aimed 
to determine the medium-chain fatty acid levels in women with and without breast 
cancer. Materials and Methods: A total of 200 women (100 breast cancer subjects 
and 100 control subjects) were recruited for the study as per the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Blood samples were collected for biochemical estimations. 
Fatty acid methyl esters were isolated, and medium-chain fatty acid levels in 
plasma were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC-FID). Statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSS 20.0 software; p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. Results: The fatty acid analysis revealed a significant decrease in 
the levels of caprylic acid (C:8) and lauric acid (C:12) and a significant 
increase in the level of capric acid (C:10) in the breast cancer subjects when 
compared to the control group. The level of caproic acid (C:6) was not 
significantly increased in the breast cancer subjects. In particular, the HER2- 
and ER-positive breast cancer subjects showed a decrease in their caprylic acid 
and lauric acid levels compared to other receptors. Conclusions: The results of 
the current study imply that lower levels of caprylic and lauric acid may be 
associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. The relevance of medium-chain 
fatty acids for preventive and therapeutic interventions will be amplified by 
further research on the possibility that alteration in a patient's medium-chain 
fatty acid composition may mechanistically contribute to disease progression or 
breast cancer risk."
1025,"Nutrition-acquired osteomalacia is a bone mineralization disorder associated 
with dietary calcium and/or solar vitamin D deficiency, risk factors considered 
common in the Middle Eastern region. Establishing less invasive, cheap, and 
widely available diagnostic markers for this underdiagnosed entity is essential, 
in particular for screening in high-risk groups. This study assessed the 
prevalence of biochemical osteomalacia in Arab adolescents. In this 
cross-sectional study performed between September 2019 and March 2021, 
adolescents aged 12-17 years from 60 different secondary and preparatory year 
schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were included. Anthropometrics and fasting blood 
samples were collected. Biochemical osteomalacia was defined as any two of the 
following four serum markers of hypomineralization, namely low 25 hydroxyvitamin 
D (25OHD &lt; 30 nmol/L), high alkaline phosphatase (ALP), low calcium (Ca), 
and/or inorganic phosphorous (Pi). A total of 2938 Arab adolescents [1697 girls; 
mean age (years) 14.8 ± 1.8; 1241 boys; mean age 15.1 ± 1.6] were recruited. 
Vitamin D deficiency was noted in 56.2% (n = 953) of girls and 27.1% (n = 336) 
of boys (p &lt; 0.001). The overall prevalence of biochemical osteomalacia was 
10.0% (n = 295/2938) and was higher in girls than boys (14.7% vs. 3.6%, p &lt; 
0.001). The prevalence of low serum Ca and/or Pi was also higher in girls than 
in boys (24.2% vs. 12.5%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001), as well as elevated ALP 
(5.1% vs. 1.5%, p &lt; 0.001). Overall, girls were 4.6 times (95% CI 3.3-6.4) 
more likely to have biochemical osteomalacia than boys. Screening of apparently 
healthy Arab adolescents revealed a high prevalence of deranged mineralization 
markers suggestive of biochemical osteomalacia, which was significantly more 
common in girls than boys and was likely associated with Arab traditional 
clothing and diet. The proposed combination of typically altered mineralization 
markers for the diagnosis of osteomalacia is, at best, suggestive until further 
comparisons with established diagnostic tools (histological analysis of bone 
biopsies) are conducted."
1026,"INTRODUCTION: Dietary changes play a role in metabolic response of patients with 
metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, and there is little evidence on the 
use of partial meal replacement (pMR) diets in this pathology.
AIM: We decided to evaluate the modifications in transaminases levels after a 
pMR hypocaloric diet in subjects with obesity and elevated fatty liver index 
(FLI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 606 patients with obesity and FLI ≥ 60 were 
enrolled and treated during 3 months with a pMR diet. Patients were divided as 
group I (Alanine amino transferase (ALT) normal) or group II (ALT ≥ 43 UI/L).
RESULTS: Body mass index, body weight, total fat mass, waist circumference, 
blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, Low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, Homeostasis Model assessment 
(HOMA-IR), and FLI index improved significantly in the total group with pMR 
diet, without differences between group I and II. ALT, aspartate 
aminotransferase activity (AST), Gama glutamine transferase (GGT), and ratios of 
AST/ALT improved in both groups, too. This improvement was higher in group II 
(deltas group I vs. deltas group II); ALT (-4.2 ± 0.9 UI/L vs. -32.1 ± 5.7 UI/L: 
p = 0.01), AST (-4.8 ± 1.8 UI/L vs. -14.1 ± 1.9 UI/L: p = 0.02), GGT (-4.8 ± 1.4 
UI/L vs. -37.1 ± 4.2 UI/L: p = 0.01), and AST/ALT ratio (-0.04 ± 0.002 units vs. 
-0.19 ± 0.04 units: p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: We reported that a pMR diet is an effective method to lose weight 
and to improve metabolic parameters in patients with obesity and high FLI. The 
decrease in liver parameters was greater in patients with ALT ≥ 43 UI/L."
1027,"(1) Background: The florets of Carthamus tinctorius L. are traditionally used as 
a blood-activating drug and can be used for the treatment of atherosclerosis, 
but no compounds with anti-atherosclerotic activity have been reported. (2) 
Methods: This study investigated the chemical compounds from the florets of C. 
tinctorius. Comprehensive spectroscopic techniques revealed their structures, 
and ECD calculations established their absolute configurations. Nile Red 
staining, Oil Red O staining, and cholesterol assessment were performed on these 
compounds and their aglycones for the inhibitory activity against the formation 
of foam cells induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in RAW264.7 
macrophages. In addition, RAW264.7 macrophages were tested for their 
anti-inflammatory activity by measuring the inhibition of NO production caused 
by LPS. (3) Results: Five new sesquiterpenoids (1-5) isolated from the florets 
of C. tinctorius were identified as 
(-)-(1R,4S,9S,11R)-caryophyll-8(13)-en-14-ol-5-one (1), 
(+)-(1R,4R,9S,11R)-caryophyll-8(13)-en-14-ol-5-one (2), 
(-)-(3Z,1R,5S,8S,9S,11R)-5,8-epoxycaryophyll-3-en-14-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (3), 
(+)-(1S,7R,10S)-guai-4-en-3-one-11-O-β-D-fucopyranoside (4), and 
(-)-(2R,5R,10R)-vetispir-6-en-8-one-11-O-β-D-fucopyranoside (5). All compounds 
except for compound 3 reduced the lipid content in ox-LDL-treated RAW264.7 
cells. Compounds 3 and 4 and their aglycones were found to reduce the level of 
total cholesterol (TC) and free cholesterol (FC) in ox-LDL-treated RAW264.7 
cells. However, no compounds showed anti-inflammatory activity. (4) Conclusion: 
Sesquiterpenoids from C. tinctorius help to decrease the content of lipids, TC 
and FC in RAW264.7 cells, but they cannot inhibit NO production, which implies 
that their anti-atherogenic effects do not involve the inhibition of 
inflammation."
1028,"There is a growing interest for curcuminoids in the general population and the 
scientific research community. Curcuminoids, derived from turmeric spice, are 
lipophiles and therefore have a low solubility in water which hence have a low 
bioavailability in the human plasma. To circumvent this issue, a natural product 
developed by Biodroga Nutraceuticals combined curcuminoids with omega-3 fatty 
acids (OM3) esterified in monoglycerides (MAG). The objective was to perform a 
24 h pharmacokinetics in humans receiving a single dose of curcuminoid 
formulated by three different means, and to compare their plasma curcuminoids 
concentration. Sixteen males and fifteen females tested three formulations: 400 
mg of curcuminoids powder extract, 400 mg of curcuminoids in rice oil and 400 mg 
of curcuminoids with 1 g MAG-OM3. Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h post dose intake. Plasma samples were analyzed by ultra 
high-performance liquid chromatography with a triple quadrupole mass 
spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Twenty-four hours after a single dose intake, the 
total plasma curcuminoids area under the curve (AUC) reached 166.8 ± 17.8 
ng/mL*h, 134.0 ± 12.7 ng/mL*h and 163.1 ± 15.3 ng/mL*h when curcuminoids were 
provided with MAG-OM3, with rice oil or in powder, respectively. The Cmax of 
total curcuminoids reached between 11.9-17.7 ng/mL at around 4 h (Tmax). 
One-hour post-dose, the curcuminoids plasma concentration was 40% higher in 
participants consuming the MAG-OM3 compared to the other formulations. Thus, in 
a young population, plasma curcuminoids 24 h pharmacokinetics and its increase 
shortly after the single dose intake were higher when provided with MAG-OM3 than 
rice oil."
1029,"Population-based surveys matched by time but using different methodologies for 
determining hemoglobin (Hb) concentration have shown inconsistencies in 
estimating anemia prevalence. This study aimed to estimate measurement errors in 
Hb quantification in HemoCue 201+ using venous blood (VB) and capillary blood 
both drops (DCB) and pools (PCB), and compare the results against those of a 
reference method (VB analyzed in hematology analyzers based on the 
cyanmethemoglobin method). Children (n = 49), adult females (n = 50), and older 
adults (n = 50) were randomly allocated to donate VB (4 mL) and either DCB 
(three drops) or PCB (350 µL). Results in HemoCue were analyzed through Bland 
Altman and Lyn's concordance against Hb concentration by the reference method. A 
positive average bias (systematic error) was found for the HemoCue (0.31 g/dL) 
using the same VB samples. This value was then subtracted from all readings 
carried out in the device. After this adjustment, DCB still produced a positive 
bias (0.42 ± 0.81 g/dL), and the variation of single results was ±1.6 g/dL (95% 
CI). PCB and VB performed similarly; the average bias was negligible (-0.02 ± 
0.36 and 0.00 ± 0.33 g/dL, respectively) and the variation of the results (95% 
CI) was ±0.7 g/dL or lower. Lyn's concordance values were 0.86, 0.96, and 0.98 
for DCB, PCB, and VB, respectively. Random variation using DCB is too large to 
approximate the true Hb values, and therefore DCB should be discontinued for 
diagnosing anemia both in individuals and in populations."
1030,"This retrospective cohort study aims to determine the epidemiology of iron 
deficiency among extreme preterm neonates and the association of iron-deficient 
status during the NICU stay with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-24 months. 
Neonates ≤29 weeks gestational age (GA) born between June 2016 and December 
2019, who received routine iron supplementation were enrolled. Iron deficiency 
was defined as reticulocyte-hemoglobin (Ret-Hb) levels ≤ 29 pg at 36 weeks 
corrected age. A subcohort of neonates completed standardized developmental 
assessment at 18-24 months corrected age. Significant neurodevelopmental 
impairment (sNDI) was defined as either Bayley Scales of Infant Development 
score &lt; 70 or cerebral palsy or blindness or hearing aided. Among a cohort of 
215 neonates [GA 25.8 (1.7) weeks, birthweight 885 (232) g], prevalence of iron 
deficiency was 55%, 21%, 26%, and 13%, in neonates &lt;24 weeks, 24-25 + 6 
weeks, 26-27 + 6 weeks, and ≥ 28 weeks GA, respectively. Male sex and receipt of 
corticosteroid therapy were associated with iron-deficiency. In the subcohort 
analysis (n = 69), there was no statistically significant association between 
Ret-Hb levels at 36 weeks corrected age and the risk of sNDI [OR 0.99 (95% CI 
0.85-1.2)]. Male infants and those who received postnatal corticosteroids are 
likely to have iron-limited erythropoiesis at corrected term despite routine 
iron-supplementation; however, low Ret-Hb levels during the neonatal period were 
not associated with significant neurological disability in early childhood."
1031,"Vitamin D is among the increasingly consumed dietary supplements during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. It plays a regulatory role in the immune system and moderates 
the renin-angiotensin system, which is implicated in infection pathogenesis. 
However, the investigation of serum levels of vitamin D3 forms and their 
relative ratios in COVID-19 patients is worth investigation to understand the 
impacts of disease severity. Hence, we investigated the serum levels of vitamin 
D3 (cholecalciferol) and its metabolites (calcifediol and calcitriol), in 
addition to their relative ratios and correlations with angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2), interleukin-6 (Il-6), and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in 
COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Oropharyngeal specimens were 
collected from the study subjects for polymerase chain reaction testing for 
COVID-19. Whole blood samples were obtained for blood count and NLR testing, and 
sera were used for the analysis of the levels of the vitamin and its 
metabolites, ACE2, and IL-6. We enrolled 103 patients and 50 controls. ACE2, 
Il-6, and NLR were significantly higher in the patients group (72.37 ± 18.67 vs. 
32.36 ± 11.27 U/L, 95.84 ± 25.23 vs. 2.76 ± 0.62 pg/mL, and 1.61 ± 0.30 vs. 1.07 
± 0.16, respectively). Cholecalciferol, calcifediol, and calcitriol were 
significantly lower in patients (18.50 ± 5.36 vs. 29.13 ± 4.94 ng/mL, 14.60 ± 
3.30 vs. 23.10 ± 3.02 ng/mL, and 42.90 ± 8.44 vs. 65.15 ± 7.11 pg/mL, 
respectively). However, their relative ratios were normal in both groups. Levels 
of the vitamin and metabolites were strongly positively, strongly negatively, 
and moderately negatively correlated with ACE2, Il-6, and NLR, respectively. 
COVID-19 infection severity is associated with a significant decrease in vitamin 
D3 and its metabolites in a parallel pattern, and with a significant increase in 
ACE2, Il-6, and NLR. Higher levels of vitamin D and its metabolites are 
potentially protective against severe infection."
1032,"This study aimed to assess the effect of substituting plant-based mince for beef 
mince in a standard pasta meal on the amount consumed and on objective and 
subjective measures of post-prandial satiety. Healthy, adult males (n = 24) 
consumed a pasta lunch meal containing either plant-based or beef mince at 
separate visits, and the amount consumed measured at each visit. Perceptions of 
hunger, fullness and satisfaction were recorded and blood samples collected 
before and for 3 h after eating, when a buffet meal was provided. Participants 
consumed 586 kJ less of the pasta meal prepared with plant-based mince compared 
to beef mince (p &lt; 0.05). Energy intake at the buffet meal and measures of 
fullness, satiety and satisfaction after the pasta meal were not different 
between plant and beef mince (p &gt; 0.05). Post-prandial Glucagon-Like 
Peptide-1 (GLP-1), but not insulin or leptin concentrations, were lower after 
the plant-based pasta meal (p &lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that the pasta 
meal containing plant-based mince was more satiating than an equivalent meal 
prepared with beef mince, and that this was not associated with greater energy 
intake at a subsequent meal occasion. Further studies that evaluate the 
longer-term effects of replacing meat with plant-based mince on energy intakes 
and explore the mechanisms underlying the lower consumption of the plant-based 
mince meal would be valuable."
1033,"Effective nutrition therapy is a pressing issue in obesity and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) management. As such, this research aimed to determine the 
performance of a revised dietary strategy built on the protein-sparing diet in 
obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus with regard to obtaining a rapid and stable 
improvement in glucometabolic control, body weight, body composition, and energy 
metabolism when applying the strategy in just twenty-one days. The revised 
protein-sparing diet differs from the traditional protein-sparing modified fast 
(PSMF) because it does not include foods. The daily calorie intake of this diet 
is exclusively derived from Isolate whey protein in addition to a formulation of 
Isolate whey protein enriched with essential amino acids in free form, with the 
addition of lipids such as extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil as a source of 
medium chain fatty acids, where the latter is taken for only the first four days 
of the diet, together with the use, for the same duration, of extended-release 
metformin, as the only antihyperglycemic allowed. Anthropometric measurements, 
bioimpedance analysis, indirect calorimetry, and blood chemistry assessments 
were conducted at the beginning of the study, time 0 (T0), and at the end, time 
1 (T1), i.e., on the 21st day. The main outcomes of the revised protein-sparing 
diet after only twenty-one days were a reduction in body weight with the 
predominant loss of visceral atherogenic abdominal fat and, therefore, a 
possible contextual reduction in ectopic fat deposits together with a 
simultaneous reduction in insulin resistance and normalization of insulin 
levels, maintenance of free fat mass and basal metabolism, restoration of 
metabolic flexibility, and improvement of the glucometabolic and lipidic 
parameters. These results demonstrate the promising potential of the revised 
protein-sparing diet as an ""etiologic tool"" in the integrated nutritional 
treatment of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus."
1034,"BACKGROUND: Hemodialyzed patients with poor erythropoietin response tend to have 
low volume of visceral adipose tissue and score high on 
malnutrition-inflammation score. This study investigates in-depth the role of 
leptin and chosen cytokines in the development of malnutrition-inflammation 
syndrome (MIS) and erythropoietin resistance.
METHODS: Eighty-one hemodialyzed patients with erythropoietin-treated anemia 
were enrolled in the study. Their body composition was measured. Erythropoietin 
resistance index was calculated. Blood samples for leptin, IL-6, IL-18, 
TNF-alpha, and IL-1-alpha serum levels were drawn.
RESULTS: Leptin showed negative correlation with erythropoietin resistance index 
(ERI), whilst IL-6 showed the opposite. IL-6 seemed to be linked more to HD 
parameters and vintage, while TNF-alpha and leptin were more dependent on body 
composition. IL-18 and IL-1-alpha did not affect nutritional parameters nor ERI.
CONCLUSION: Modulation of adipokine- and cytokine-related signaling is a 
promising target in tempering malnutrition in hemodialyzed, and thus achieving 
better outcomes in anemia treatment. Large clinical studies that target the 
inflammatory response in hemodialysis, especially regarding IL-6, TNF-alpha, and 
leptin, would be of great worth."
1035,"Superabundant date fruit production in Al-Qassim in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
(KSA), a plentiful region for producing date syrup resulting in massive amounts 
of date fiber (DF), causes environmental issues with what is considered dietary 
waste. However, no food producer or researcher has thought of the valorization 
of DF by extracting the crude polysaccharides that can be converted to 
nanoparticles (flours) to increase its functional group and enhance its 
functionality. Using the DF was the primary goal, with the new biscuits used 
within the current study investigated as a potent integrated approach for 
controlling obesity levels and its effects. Obesity is one of the most important 
human problems worldwide, connected to many metabolic diseases, e.g., diabetes 
mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Its prevalence has recently increased among 
Saudi children and adolescents. An investigation of the biological effects of 
the formulated products was carried out by feeding the formulated biscuits with 
different DF levels (5, 10 and 15%) to obese albino rats, in addition to 
positive and negative control groups, to evaluate the effect of a reduced 
calorie product on controlling their body weight and health stats (lipid 
profile, blood sugars, kidney and liver functions). The collected data showed 
that the most positive results were obtained from rats fed diets supplemented 
with 10% DF biscuits. All TCHO, TrGs, HDL, and HDL were decreased to the best 
levels in this group compared to the positive control group (148.23, 145.30, 
37.50, and 81.67 vs. 238.37, 199.07, 62.57, and 135.99, respectively). To 
conclude, DF supplementation presented anti-obesity properties in animal models; 
however, more epidemiological trials are needed."
1036,"Selenium is an essential trace element in humans and animals and its role in 
selenoprotein and enzyme antioxidant activity is well documented. Food is the 
principal source of selenium, and it is important that selenium status in the 
body is adequately maintained for physiological functions. There has been 
increasing attention on the role of selenium in mitigating the toxic effects of 
mercury exposure from dietary intake in humans. In contrast, mercury is a 
neurotoxin, and its continuous exposure can cause adverse health effects in 
humans. The interactions of selenium and mercury are multi-factorial and involve 
complex binding mechanisms between these elements at a molecular level. Further 
insights and understanding in this area may help to evaluate the health 
implications of dietary mercury exposure and selenium status. This review aims 
to summarise current information on the interplay of the interactions between 
selenium and mercury in the body and the protective effect of selenium on 
at-risk groups in a population who may experience long-term mercury exposure."
1037,"The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) increased dramatically over the past 
years among adults in a separate province in China; little is known about newly 
diagnosed MetS in middle-aged and above residents nationwide. We investigated 
the prevalence of MetS and its components, the dietary patterns, and their 
relationship among the middle-aged and above population of China by using data 
from a national cross-sectional survey. General information involving lifestyles 
and health stations was collected, and dietary intake using a 3-day 24 h dietary 
recall and weighing method for edible oil and condiments was conducted. Height, 
weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were measured, and fasting serum 
lipids and glucose were tested by trained clinical staff. Dietary patterns were 
derived from 23 food categories by using cluster analysis, and a multivariate 
logistic regression model was used to evaluate the odd ratio of MetS and its 
component across obtained dietary patterns. The estimated prevalence of MetS was 
37.1% among 40,909 middle-aged and older participants in the study. Participants 
were classified into diversity pattern, northern pattern, and southern pattern 
that, respectively, accounted for 9.8%, 47.2%, and 43.0% of the total. Compared 
with those inclined to the northern pattern, participants prone to the southern 
pattern decreased the risk of MetS (OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.75- 0.87; p &lt; 0.001), 
central obesity (OR = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.65-0.76; p &lt; 0.001), and HDL-C (OR = 
0.82, 95%CI: 0.76-0.89; p &lt; 0.001), and elevated BP (OR = 0.86, 95%CI: 
0.79-0.93; p &lt; 0.001) respectively. However, participants of the southern 
pattern tended to have a higher risk of elevated glucose; the OR (95%CI) was 
1.13 (1.05, 1.22; p = 0.002) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. 
Greater adherence to diverse dietary patterns was negatively related to the risk 
of central obesity and elevated blood pressure with an OR (95%CI) of 0.82 (0.71, 
0.94; p = 0.005) and 0.77 (0.67, 0.88; p &lt; 0.001), respectively. We concluded 
that dietary improvement and health promotion for MetS should be based on the 
district-specific nutritional status of the Chinese middle-aged and elderly 
population."
1038,"Dietary pattern (DP) results in nutrition adequacy and may influence cognitive 
decline and cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study explored DP 
in 248 patients with AD. Two neurobehavioral assessments (intervals 13.4 months) 
and two cortical thickness measurements derived from magnetic resonance images 
(intervals 26.5 months) were collected as outcome measures. Reduced rank 
regression was used to assess the groups of DPs and a linear mixed-effect model 
to explore the cortical neurodegenerative patterns. At screening, underweight 
body mass index (BMI) was related to significant higher lipid profile, impaired 
cognitive function, smaller cortical thickness, lower protein DP factor loading 
scores and the non-spouse caregiver status. Higher mini-mental state examination 
(MMSE) scores were related to the DP of coffee/tea, compared to the lipid/sugar 
or protein DP group. The underweighted-BMI group had faster cortical thickness 
atrophy in the pregenual and lateral temporal cortex, while the correlations 
between cortical thickness degeneration and high HbA1C or low B12 and folate 
levels were localized in the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex. The 
predictive model suggested that factors related to MMSE score were related to 
the caregiver status. In conclusion, normal or overweight BMI, coffee/tea DP 
group and living with a spouse were considered as protective factors for better 
cognitive outcomes in patients with AD. The influence of glucose, B12 and folate 
on the cortical degeneration was spatially distinct from the pattern of AD 
degeneration."
1039,"Adolescence is a transitional period between childhood and adulthood. Nowadays, 
adolescents in Lebanon are growing during a time of unprecedented health crises 
and political instability. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and 
correlates of malnutrition, dietary diversity in adolescents' households, and 
adolescents' self-reported food insecurity in Lebanon. A national representative 
sample of 450 parent-adolescent dyads (parents: mean age ± standard deviation 
(SD) = 46.0 ± 7.0, mothers: 59.0%; adolescents: mean age ± SD = 15.0 ± 3.0, 
girls: 54.6%) were interviewed. Anthropometric and blood hemoglobin measurements 
were performed for adolescents. The Food Consumption Score, the Arab Family Food 
Security Scale and the Adolescent-Level Food-Security Scale were used. The 
overall prevalence of adolescent stunting, thinness, overweight, obesity and 
anemia was 6.7%, 4.7%, 19.3%, 12.9% and 16.7%, respectively. Almost 40.4% and 
68% of adolescent's households consumed undiversified diets and were food 
insecure, respectively. Food insecurity (FI) affected 54.0% of adolescents. 
Adolescents attending schools (vs. university) were eight times more likely to 
be stunted (p = 0.04). Boys had a 4.3 times higher thinness risk (p = 0.005) 
compared to girls. Households reporting an income decline since the start of the 
Lebanese economic crisis were three times more likely to have a thin adolescent 
(p = 0.01). Parental overweight/obesity (p = 0.002) and lower education level (p 
= 0.04) nearly doubled the risk of adolescent overweight or obesity. At a time 
when escalating crises in Lebanon are shifting diets for the youngest 
generations, the development of adolescent-responsive nutritional policies 
becomes a must."
1040,"Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is an important cause of long-term disability 
in extremely preterm infants, with no current treatment. We aimed to study in an 
IVH model in immature rats the neuroprotective effect of betulinic acid 
hydroxamate (BAH), a B55α/PP2A activator that inhibits the activity of the 
hypoxia-inducing factor prolyl-hydroxylase type 2. IVH was induced in 1-day-old 
(P1) Wistar rats by the left periventricular injection of Clostridial 
collagenase. Then, pups received i.p. vehicle or BAH 3 mg/kg single dose. At P6, 
P14 and P45, brain damage (area of damage, neurobehavioral deficits, 
Lactate/N-acetylaspartate ratio), white matter injury (WMI: corpus callosum 
atrophy and myelin basic protein signal reduction) and inflammation (TLR4, NF-κB 
and TNFα expression), excitotoxicity (Glutamate/N-acetylspartate) and oxidative 
stress (protein nitrosylation) were evaluated. BAH treatment did not reduce the 
volume of brain damage, but it did reduce perilesional tissue damage, preventing 
an IVH-induced increase in Lac/NAA. BAH restored neurobehavioral performance at 
P45 preventing WMI. BAH prevented an IVH-induced increase in inflammation, 
excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. In conclusion, in immature rats, BAH 
reduced IVH-induced brain damage and prevented its long-term functional 
consequences, preserving normal myelination in a manner related to the 
modulation of inflammation, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress."
1041,"Dietary fat intake in the Chinese population has increased. The PURE 
(prospective urban rural epidemiology) study concluded the potential advantage 
of total fat and saturated fats (SFA) over carbohydrates on blood lipids with 
the inaccurate assessment of dietary fats. We investigated the dietary fat 
profile among 48,315 participants (aged 30-70 years, national representative) 
from the China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (2015-2017), determined the 
relationship of various fats with blood lipid biomarkers in the selected 39,115 
participants, and compared the results with the PURE study. Dietary fat intake 
was calculated by using 3 days of 24 h recalls and food inventory. Serum lipid 
biomarkers were assessed at morning fasting state by health professionals. Plant 
fats (21.5% of total energy (TE)) dominated in total fat intake (69.5 g/day, 
35.6% TE), with monounsaturated fats (MUFA) in the largest (13.8% TE) portion 
and plant oils as the major source (43.7%). Two thirds of the population 
consumed more than 30% TE from dietary fats and nearly half more than 35%, while 
26.4% of them exceeded 10% TE from SFA. Total fat was positively associated with 
total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), but also 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and negatively with triglyceride 
(TG)-to-HDL-c ratio (TGHDL) (all p-trend &lt; 0.05). Replacing total fat with 
carbohydrate yielded adverse changes in most biomarkers (higher LDL-c, TG, and 
TGHDL, lower HDL-c, all p &lt; 0.05) when total fat was low (&lt;34.9% TE). 
Regardless of fat intake level, replacing plant fat or polyunsaturated fats 
(PUFA) with carbohydrate yielded the most adverse changes (higher TC, LDL-c, TG, 
TC-to-HDL-c ratio (TCHDL), and TGHDL, but lower HDL-c, all p &lt; 0.01), while 
replacing animal fat/SFA with plant fat/PUFA yielded the most favorable changes 
(lower all biomarkers, all p &lt; 0.01). The results suggested a less harmful 
effect of carbohydrate on blood lipids when total fat was high, and more 
beneficial effect of unsaturated fats, than the PURE. In conclusion, dietary fat 
intake in Chinese adults had reached quite a high level, but with a different 
profile from Western populations. Replacement of SFA (animal fat) with PUFA 
(plant fat) could most effectively improve blood lipids, while replacement with 
carbohydrate could slightly benefit only when total fat was high. The present 
results may be more applicable to the Chinese population than the PURE study."
1042,"Central obesity is associated with a higher risk of hypertension. This study 
aimed to analyze waist circumference (WC) trajectories and discover their 
association with blood pressure and the risk of hypertension. The data were 
obtained from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), with a sample of 
11,885 adults aged 18 or older. Trajectory groups of WC were identified by 
group-based trajectory modeling. Three trajectory groups were identified in 
males: ""normal-stable group"" (group 1), ""normal-increase to central obesity 
group"" (group 2), and ""central obesity-slight decrease group"" (group 3). There 
were also three identified in females: ""normal-increase to central obesity 
group"" (group 1), ""normal-stable group"" (group 2), and ""central obesity-increase 
group"" (group 3). For males, compared with group 1, systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased by 2.47 mmHg and 2.13 mmHg, 
respectively, in group 2, and by 3.07 mmHg and 2.54 mmHg, respectively, in group 
3. The adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 
hypertension in groups 2 and 3 were 1.16 (1.06-1.28) and 1.29 (1.10-1.50), 
respectively. For females, compared with group 2, SBP and DBP increased by 1.69 
mmHg and 1.68 mmHg, respectively, in group 1, and by 4.96 mmHg and 2.77 mmHg, 
respectively, in group 3. The HR and 95% CI of hypertension in groups 2 and 3 
were 1.21 (1.07-1.36) and 1.52(1.17-1.99), respectively. We found that the WC 
trajectory was a risk factor for hypertension and elevated blood pressure 
independent of basal WC. Increased risk of hypertension was nonlinearly 
associated with annual WC increase."
1043,"Magnesium plays a key role in metabolic disorder development, and hypomagnesemia 
may be implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its 
components. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the associations 
between hypomagnesemia, MetS, and MetS components among 231 adults (193 women 
and 38 men) living in Kuwait who were apparently healthy without chronic 
diseases. We used the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the United 
States National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP 
III) criteria to define participants with MetS. The Ministry of Health cutoff 
for hypomagnesemia (&lt;0.74 mmol/L) was employed. IDF- and ATP III-defined MetS 
prevalence was 22.1% and 15.2%, respectively. Hypomagnesemia occurred in 33.3% 
of all participants and 53.2% of participants with MetS (p &lt; 0.001). 
Magnesemia correlated negatively with body mass index, waist circumference, 
systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting blood 
glucose (FBG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and triglyceride 
level; magnesemia correlated positively with high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression, 
adjusting for BMI, age, and sex, showed that hypomagnesemia was associated with 
a 12- and 5-fold greater odds of getting IDF-defined (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 
11.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.87-28.14) and ATP-defined (aOR 5.44; 95% 
CI 2.10-14.10) MetS, respectively, in the study population. Hypomagnesemia was 
significantly associated with a 3.62, 9.29, 7.01, 2.88, 3.64, and 3.27 higher 
odds of an increased waist circumference (95% CI 1.48-8.85), elevated serum 
triglyceride level (95% CI 3.97-21.73), elevated FBG (95% CI 3.25-15.11), 
elevated SBP (95% CI 1.16-7.11), elevated DBP (95% CI: 1.22-10.89), and lowered 
HDL-C level (95% CI 1.69-6.32), respectively. Hypomagnesemia could be a 
consequence of the pathophysiology of MetS and its individual components among 
adults in Kuwait."
1044,"The pathophysiological process of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is very 
complex, involving various mechanisms such as apoptosis, oxidative stress and 
inflammation. As one of the key factors, the inflammatory response is 
responsible for the pathological process of acute brain injury and is associated 
with the prognosis of patients. Abnormal or dysregulated inflammatory responses 
after ICH can aggravate cell damage in the injured brain tissue. The NOD-like 
receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multiprotein 
complex distributed in the cytosol, which can be triggered by multiple signals. 
The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated after ICH, thus promoting neuroinflammation 
and aggravating brain edema. In addition, there is evidence that the gut 
microbiota is crucial in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The gut 
microbiota plays a key role in a variety of CNS disorders. Changes in the 
diversity and species of the gut microbiota affect neuroinflammation through the 
activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of inflammatory cytokines. 
In turn, the gut microbiota composition can be influenced by the activation of 
the NLRP3 inflammasome. Thereby, the regulation of the microbe-gut-brain axis 
via the NLRP3 inflammasome may serve as a novel idea for protecting against 
secondary brain injury (SBI) in ICH patients. Here, we review the recent 
evidence on the functions of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the gut microbiota in 
ICH, as well as their interactions, during the pathological process of ICH."
1045,"A fully provided, hypocaloric, carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet 
compared to a hypocaloric conventional diabetes (CD) diet for 6 weeks improved 
glycemic control to a greater extent in face of an intended 6% weight loss in 
individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The present 24-week extension 
of that study reports on the efficacy of CRHP and CD diets in a real-life 
setting. Sixty-five individuals with T2DM who completed the initial 6-week fully 
provided diet period (% energy from carbohydrate, protein, and fat was 30/30/40 
in CRHP, and 50/17/33 in CD) continued a free-living, dietician guided 24-week 
period of which 59 individuals completed. The CRHP compared to CD group reported 
a 4% lower carbohydrate intake and had higher urea excretion by 22% (both p ≤ 
0.05) at week 30, suggesting less difference in carbohydrate and protein intake 
between groups during the 24-week extension compared to week 6. The loss of body 
weight during the initial 6 weeks was maintained in both groups during the 
24-week extension (-5.5 ± 4.5 and -4.6 ± 4.8 kg) as well as HbA1c (-8.4 ± 6.2 
and -8.4 ± 6.9 mmol/mol) with no significant differences between groups. The 
additional benefits on glucoregulation harnessed by carbohydrate restriction 
under full diet provision for 6 weeks combined with titrated weight loss could 
not be maintained in a real-life setting of self-prepared diet aiming on similar 
diets for 6 months."
1046,"Macrophages are one of the most important cells in the immune system. They act 
as links between innate and adaptive immunities. In this study, the aim was to 
examine thymoquinone effects on the immunological properties of different 
macrophages. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from blood from 
healthy volunteers by negative selection of monocytes that had been cultured for 
seven days to differentiate into macrophages. Cells were cultured with or 
without the presence of thymoquinone (TQ), which was used in two different 
concentrations (50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL. Cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80), 
cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86), and human leukocyte antigen DR isotype 
(HLA-DR) were measured by flow cytometry, and the secretion of interferon gamma 
(IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was measured. Cells were also 
tested for their E. coli phagocytosis abilities. The data showed that the 
expression of HLA-DR was significantly higher in cells treated with 100 μL/mL 
TQ. In addition, IFN-γ concentration increased in the 100 μg/mL TQ-treated 
cells. The macrophage phagocytosis results showed a significant difference in 50 
μg/mL TQ-treated cells compared to the controls. TQ may enhance the 
immunological properties of macrophages during the early stages of innate 
immunity by activating phagocytosis ability and by increasing the expression of 
HLA-DR and the secretion of IFN-γ, which may enhance the antigen-presentation 
capabilities of macrophages."
1047,"Aged or fermented garlic extract (FGE) is a natural remedy that improves 
vascular function through increasing vascular nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. 
This is because nitrite (NO2-), a NO metabolite, can be produced through 
bioconversion with macrobacteria during the fermentation of foods like garlic. 
We aimed to evaluate the effects of NO2- in FGE on blood flow (BF), blood 
pressure (BP), velocity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid 
artery (ICA), regional cerebral BF (rCBF), and peripheral BF (PBF). The study 
was divided into two parts: (1) Thirty healthy adults were divided into FGE and 
placebo groups to compare BP and velocity of the CCA and ICA; and (2) 
Twenty-eight healthy adults were divided into FGE and placebo groups to compare 
rCBF and PBF and determine changes before/after ingestion. Significant changes 
were noted in BP and the velocity of both CCA 30-60 min after FGE ingestion. FGE 
ingestion resulted in significant increases in rCBF and increases in body 
surface temperature through alterations in PBF. No detectable clinical side 
effects were noted. Overall, oral administration of NO2- containing FGE 
demonstrated acute positive effects in upregulating BF, including the CCA, BP, 
rCBF, and PBF. Follow-up studies with larger sample sizes and long-term 
ingestion may be needed."
1048,"The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 9-month intensive lifestyle 
intervention could lead to weight loss and improve cardiovascular risk factors 
among young women with both gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and newly 
diagnosed diabetes. A total of 83 young women, who had GDM and were subsequently 
diagnosed as type 2 diabetes at an average of 2.6 years after delivery, 
participated in a 9-month intensive lifestyle intervention and a follow-up 
survey at 6-9 years postintervention. After the 9-month intervention, these 
women had a weight loss of 2.90 kg (-4.02% of initial weight), decreased waist 
circumference (-3.12 cm), body fat (-1.75%), diastolic blood pressure (-3.49 
mmHg), fasting glucose (-0.98 mmol/L) and HbA1c (-0.72%). During the 6-9 years 
postintervention period, they still had lower weight (-3.71 kg; -4.62% of 
initial weight), decreased waist circumference (-4.56 cm) and body fat (-2.10%), 
but showed a slight increase in HbA1c (0.22%). The prevalence of using 
glucose-lowering agents increased from 2.4% at baseline to 34.6% after the 
9-month lifestyle intervention, and to 48.4% at 6-9 years postintervention. A 
9-month intensive lifestyle intervention can produce beneficial effects on body 
weight, HbA1c and other cardiovascular risk factors among young women with 
previous GDM who subsequently developed new diabetes."
1049,"Perinatal leptin deficiency and reduced intake of mother's milk may contribute 
to the development of childhood obesity. Preterm infants have reduced leptin 
production, and they are at heightened risk of neonatal leptin deficiency. 
Because fresh human milk contains significantly more leptin than donor milk, we 
used a cross-over design to determine if blood leptin levels in maternal 
milk-fed preterm infants fall during conversion to donor human milk. Infants 
born between 22 0/7 and 31 6/7 weeks gestation on exclusive maternal milk 
feedings were enrolled into a 21-day cross-over trial. On days 1-7 and 15-21, 
infants were fed maternal milk, and on days 8-14, infants were fed donor milk. 
On day 1, study infants had a mean postmenstrual age of 33 weeks. Plasma leptin 
correlated with milk leptin, and leptin levels in maternal milk far exceed the 
leptin levels of donor milk. Plasma leptin did not increase during donor milk 
administration, but it did following resumption of maternal milk (p &lt; 0.05). 
In this crossover trial, preterm infant blood leptin levels correlated with milk 
leptin content. This suggests that preterm infants can enterally absorb leptin 
from human milk, and leptin-rich breast milk may be a targeted therapy for the 
prevention of obesity."
1050,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a systemic metabolic disorder characterized 
by insulin deficiency and insulin resistance. Recently, it has become a 
significant threat to public health. Polygonatum sibiricum saponin (PSS) has 
potential hypoglycemic effects, but its specific mechanism needs further study. 
In this study, PSS significantly decreased the level of blood glucose, water 
intake, and the organ index in diabetic mice. Meanwhile, PSS effectively reduced 
the content of total triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TCHO), low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) in the blood, and increased the content of high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). This suggests that PSS could reduce the content 
of blood lipids and initially improve the damage of hepatocytes. We found that 
PSS alleviated hepatic insulin resistance, repaired islet beta cells, and 
enabled insulin to play its biological role normally. It also improved oral 
glucose tolerance and abated serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and glycosylated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in T2DM mice. Furthermore, studies have found that PSS 
increased the content of phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT), thereby 
promoting the effect of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4), and activating glycogen 
synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3β) and glycogen synthase (GS) proteins to promote 
hepatic glycogen synthesis. Finally, we found that PSS could promote the growth 
of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, reduce the 
growth of harmful bacteria such as Enterococcus and Enterobacter, and 
preliminarily improve the composition of important bacteria in the intestine. 
These studies indicate that PSS has an excellent hypoglycemic effect, which 
provides a potential new treatment for T2DM and guidance for more in-depth 
research."
1051,"Dried tangerine peel (Citri reticulatae Pericarpium, CRP; Chenpi in Chinese) 
possesses medicine and food homology with hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant activities. This study aimed to explore the protective effect of CRP 
extract on endothelial function and inflammation in type 2 diabetic rats and the 
related mechanisms. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was induced by high-fat diet 
(HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ) in male Sprague Dawley rats, and CRP extract was 
orally administered at 400 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Rat and mouse aortas were 
treated with high glucose and CRP extract ex vivo. The data showed that the 
ethanolic extract of CRP normalized blood pressure and the plasma lipid profile 
as well as the plasma levels of liver enzymes in diabetic rats. Impaired 
endothelium-dependent relaxations in aortas, carotid arteries and renal arteries 
were improved. CRP extract suppressed vascular inflammatory markers and induced 
AMPK activation in aortas of diabetic rats. Exposure to high glucose impaired 
vasodilation in aortas of rats and mice, and this impairment was prevented by 
co-incubation with CRP extract. In conclusion, our findings suggest that CRP 
extract protects endothelial function by inhibiting the vascular inflammatory 
state on activation of AMPK in diabetic rats."
1052,"The sensory properties of foods guide food choices and intake, importantly 
determining nutritional and health status. In communities that have inconsistent 
access to nutritious foods, such as food deserts, food taste perceptions and 
preferences have yet to be explored. The purpose of this study was to examine 
how taster status (supertaster vs. non-taster) and food security status (high or 
marginal vs. low or very low) influences food taste intensities, food 
preferences and perceptions, and diet quality in a cohort of students from a 
food desert campus in the Central Valley of California. Moreover, the complex 
relationship of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and sex on cardiometabolic 
and cognitive health warrants further examination. Two hundred fifty 
participants (aged 18-24 years) living in a food desert campus were recruited in 
2018 for this cross-sectional study where participants underwent taste tests on 
selected fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and clinical tests (anthropometrics, 
blood glucose, blood pressure, and endothelial function), cognitive function 
tests (memory and attention), diet quality assessment (Healthy Eating Index 
(HEI)), and food preference and perception assessments. Food taste intensities 
were influenced by sex with bitter and umami taste intensities of several foods 
being perceived more intensely by males. Moreover, food liking was largely 
influenced by ethnicity with Hispanics having higher liking ratings for several 
foods compared with non-Hispanics. Both, Hispanics and females, had higher total 
fruit HEI scores and lower attention scores than non-Hispanics and males, 
respectively. Females also had lower blood pressure, reactive hyperemia index, 
and fasting blood glucose. Food-insecure individuals rated cost and convenience 
as more important factors for overall food consumption and had lower attention 
scores than those with higher food-security status. Future research should 
consider the complex interactions of factors such as taste and flavor 
perception, sex, ethnicity, prior exposure to foods, and other environmental 
factors when studying food preferences and health in young adults."
1053,"Wild watermelon contains various nutrients, but the effect of its acute 
ingestion on arterial stiffness is unclear. This study aimed to investigate 
whether a single bout of acute ingestion of wild watermelon-extracted juice 
decreased arterial stiffness concomitant with an increase in nitric oxide (NO) 
production. Twelve healthy young female participants were tested under two 
conditions in a randomized, double-blind crossover study: (1) a beverage 
containing 90 g of wild watermelon extract and (2) a control beverage: a 
placebo. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), an index of arterial stiffness, blood flow, 
and plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) levels were measured in the supine position at 
30, 60, and 90 min after the intake of each beverage. The changes in 
femoral-ankle PWV were significantly reduced after wild watermelon-extracted 
juice intake compared to those in the placebo group. Additionally, the changes 
in blood flow in the posterior tibial artery and plasma NOx levels after intake 
of wild watermelon-extracted juice were significantly increased compared to 
those in the placebo group. These data show that acute ingestion of wild 
watermelon-extracted juice reduces peripheral (lower limb) arterial stiffness 
and increases NO bioavailability. To confirm these associations, more detailed 
investigations of the nutrients that influence these effects should be 
conducted."
1054,"Current research into the role of engineered nanoparticles in drug delivery 
systems (DDSs) for medical purposes has developed numerous fascinating 
nanocarriers. This paper reviews the various conventionally used and current 
used carriage system to deliver drugs. Due to numerous drawbacks of conventional 
DDSs, nanocarriers have gained immense interest. Nanocarriers like polymeric 
nanoparticles, mesoporous nanoparticles, nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes, 
dendrimers, liposomes, metallic nanoparticles, nanomedicine, and engineered 
nanomaterials are used as carriage systems for targeted delivery at specific 
sites of affected areas in the body. Nanomedicine has rapidly grown to treat 
certain diseases like brain cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, cardiovascular 
diseases, and many others. These nanomedicines can improve drug bioavailability 
and drug absorption time, reduce release time, eliminate drug aggregation, and 
enhance drug solubility in the blood. Nanomedicine has introduced a new era for 
drug carriage by refining the therapeutic directories of the energetic 
pharmaceutical elements engineered within nanoparticles. In this context, the 
vital information on engineered nanoparticles was reviewed and conferred towards 
the role in drug carriage systems to treat many ailments. All these nanocarriers 
were tested in vitro and in vivo. In the coming years, nanomedicines can improve 
human health more effectively by adding more advanced techniques into the drug 
delivery system."
1055,"This research investigates hydrothermally synthesized hydroxyapatite 
nanoparticles doped with rubidium(I) and europium(III) ions. Investigation 
focused on establishing the influence of co-doped Eu3+ and Rb+ ions on 
hydroxyapatite lattice. Therefore, structural, and morphological properties were 
characterized via using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), infrared spectroscopy 
(FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Furthermore, this investigation evaluates 
the impact of various Rb+ ion doping concentrations on the distinct red emission 
of co-doped Eu3+ ions. Hence, luminescence properties of the obtained materials 
were evaluated by measuring emission excitation, emission spectra, and 
luminescence decays. As established by numerous studies, synthetic 
hydroxyapatite has excellent application in biomedical field, as it is fully 
biocompatible. Its biocompatible makes it highly useful in the biomedical field 
as a bone fracture filler or hydroxyapatite coated dental implant. By the 
incorporation of Eu3+ ions and Rb+ ions we established the impact these co-doped 
ions have on the biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite powders. Therefore, 
biocompatibility toward a ram's red blood cells was evaluated to exclude 
potential cytotoxic features of the synthesized compounds. Additionally, 
experimental in vitro bioactive properties of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles doped 
with Rb+ and Eu3+ ions were established using a mouse osteoblast model. These 
properties are discussed in detail as they contribute to a novel method in 
regenerative medicine."
1056,"Nanodiamonds (NDs) have high potential as a drug carrier and in combination with 
nitrogen vacancies (NV centers) for highly sensitive MR-imaging after 
hyperpolarization. However, little remains known about their physiological 
properties in vivo. PET imaging allows further evaluation due to its 
quantitative properties and high sensitivity. Thus, we aimed to create a 
preclinical platform for PET and MR evaluation of surface-modified NDs by 
radiolabeling with both short- and long-lived radiotracers. Serum albumin coated 
NDs, functionalized with PEG groups and the chelator deferoxamine, were labeled 
either with zirconium-89 or gallium-68. Their biodistribution was assessed in 
two different mouse strains. PET scans were performed at various time points up 
to 7 d after i.v. injection. Anatomical correlation was provided by additional 
MRI in a subset of animals. PET results were validated by ex vivo quantification 
of the excised organs using a gamma counter. Radiolabeled NDs accumulated 
rapidly in the liver and spleen with a slight increase over time, while rapid 
washout from the blood pool was observed. Significant differences between the 
investigated radionuclides were only observed for the spleen (1 h). In summary, 
we successfully created a preclinical PET and MR imaging platform for the 
evaluation of the biodistribution of NDs over different time scales."
1057,"Currently, no suitable clinical drugs are available for patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases complicated by depression. Based on a fusion 
technique to create effective multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs), we 
synthesized a series of 
(R)-N-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-2-(1-phenyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl) 
acetamides with substituted benzothiazoles and 
(S)-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline. All compounds were tested for their 
inhibitory potency against monoamine oxidase (MAO) and cholinesterase (ChE) by 
in vitro enzyme activity assays, and further tested for their specific 
inhibitory potency against monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and butyrylcholinesterase 
(BuChE). Among them, six compounds (4b-4d, 4f, 4g and 4i) displayed excellent 
activity. The classical antidepressant forced swim test (FST) was used to verify 
the in vitro results, revealing that six compounds reduced the immobility time 
significantly, especially compound 4g. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was 
assessed by the MTT method and Acridine Orange (AO) staining, with cell 
viability found to be above 90% at effective compound concentrations, and not 
toxic to L929 cells reversibility, kinetics and molecular docking studies were 
also performed using compound 4g, which showed the highest MAO-B and BuChE 
inhibitory activities. The results of these studies showed that compound 4g 
binds to the primary interaction sites of both enzymes and has good blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) penetration. This study provides new strategies for future 
research on neurodegenerative diseases complicated by depression."
1058,"There is increasing awareness of an association between the uptake of the HIV 
integrase inhibitor, dolutegravir, in first-line antiretroviral regimens with 
unusual weight gain and development of the metabolic syndrome, particularly in 
African women. Although seemingly unexplored, the development of systemic 
inflammation linked to the putative pro-inflammatory activity of dolutegravir 
represents a plausible pathophysiological mechanism of this unusual weight gain. 
This possibility was explored in the current study undertaken to investigate the 
effects of dolutegravir (2.5-20 μg/mL) on several pro-inflammatory activities of 
neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy, adult humans. These activities 
included the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation 
(elastase release) and alterations in the concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+ using 
chemiluminescence, spectrophotometric and fluorimetric procedures, respectively. 
Exposure of neutrophils to dolutegravir alone resulted in the abrupt, 
dose-related, and significant (p &lt; 0.0039-p &lt; 0.0022) generation of ROS 
that was attenuated by the inclusion of the Ca2+-chelating agent, EGTA, or 
inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium chloride, DPI), phospholipase C 
(U733122), myeloperoxidase (sodium azide) and phosphoinositol-3-kinase 
(wortmannin). In addition, exposure to dolutegravir augmented the release of 
elastase by stimulus-activated neutrophils. These pro-inflammatory effects of 
dolutegravir on neutrophils were associated with significant, rapid, and 
sustained increases in the concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+ that appeared to 
originate from the extracellular compartment, seemingly consistent with an 
ionophore-like property of dolutegravir. These findings are preliminary and 
necessitate verification in the clinical setting of HIV infection. Nevertheless, 
given the complex link between inflammation and obesity, these pro-inflammatory 
interactions of dolutegravir with neutrophils may contribute to unexplained 
weight gain, possibly via the development of insulin resistance."
1059,"The flower bud of Panax notoginseng (PNF) consumed as a tonic shows potential in 
the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. To identify the 
contained multi-components and, in particular, to clarify which components can 
be absorbed and what metabolites are transformed, unveiling the effective 
substances of PNF is of vital significance. A unique ultrahigh-performance 
liquid chromatography/ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC/IM-QTOF-MS) profiling approach and efficient data processing by the 
UNIFITM bioinformatics platform were employed to comprehensively identify the 
multi-components of PNF and the related metabolites in the plasma of rats after 
oral administration (at a dose of 3.6 g/kg). Two MS2 data acquisition modes 
operating in the negative electrospray ionization mode, involving 
high-definition MSE (HDMSE) and data-dependent acquisition (DDA), were utilized 
aimed to extend the coverage and simultaneously ensure the quality of the MS2 
spectra. As a result, 219 components from PNF were identified or tentatively 
characterized, and 40 thereof could be absorbed. Moreover, 11 metabolites were 
characterized from the rat plasma. The metabolic pathways mainly included the 
phase I (deglycosylation and oxidation). To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first report that systematically studies the in vivo metabolites of PNF, 
which can assist in better understanding its tonifying effects and benefit its 
further development."
1060,"Pomelo peel is a natural plant product with numerous pharmacological effects and 
is used in traditional Chinese medicine. In the present study, we extracted 
naringin from pomelo peel and aimed to decipher its therapeutic potential 
against hyperlipidemia. We used ultrasonic-assisted extraction to obtain 
naringin prior to identifying its structure, to evaluate its ability in binding 
sodium glycine cholate and sodium bovine cholate in vitro by simulating the 
gastrointestinal environment, so as to evaluate its blood lipid-lowering 
activity. The hyperlipidemia mouse model was established. Following the 
intragastric administration of naringin for 5 weeks, we measured the weight 
change, organ index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), serum total 
cholesterol (TC), serum triglycerides (TG), liver superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
level, malondialdehyde (MDA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) level of mice in the normal control and high-fat diet 
groups in addition to the high-, medium-, and low-dose naringin groups. The 
pathological changes in the liver were observed under a light microscope. The 
total RNA of the liver was extracted, and the mRNA expression level of lipid 
metabolism-related factors in mouse liver was detected via a fluorescence 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Naringin significantly (p &lt; 
0.01) reduced the body weight, organ index, serum TG, LDL-C, and TC levels of 
hyperlipidemic mice, but increased the serum HDL-C levels (p &lt; 0.01). 
Furthermore, naringin increased GSH Px and SOD activity (p &lt; 0.01), while 
decreasing MDA, ALT, and AST levels, as well as the liver index (p &lt; 0.01). 
There was no statistically significant difference in the brain, heart, spleen, 
kidney, and other indicators (p &gt; 0.05). A histopathological analysis of 
mouse liver showed that naringin could alleviate the degenerative damage of 
fatty liver cells in hyperlipidemic mice. Naringin could significantly (p &lt; 
0.01) reduce the expression of FAS and SREBP-1c mRNA, and simultaneously 
increase PPARα mRNA expression. This study shows that naringin has the strong 
effect of lowering lipids and protecting the liver in hyperlipidemic mice. Our 
findings underscore the anti-hyperlipidemia potential of naringin and increase 
the scientific understanding of its anti-hyperlipidemia effects, that may lead 
to its potential application as a dietary strategy for hyperlipidemia management 
in the future."
1061,"Carotenoid compounds are ubiquitous in nature, providing the characteristic 
colouring of many algae, bacteria, fruits and vegetables. They are a critical 
component of the human diet and play a key role in human nutrition, health and 
disease. Therefore, the clinical importance of qualitative and quantitative 
carotene content analysis is increasingly recognised. In this review, the 
structural and optical properties of carotenoid compounds are reviewed, 
differentiating between those of carotenes and xanthophylls. The strong 
non-resonant and resonant Raman spectroscopic signatures of carotenoids are 
described, and advances in the use of Raman spectroscopy to identify carotenoids 
in biological environments are reviewed. Focus is drawn to applications in 
nutritional analysis, optometry and serology, based on in vitro and ex vivo 
measurements in skin, retina and blood, and progress towards establishing the 
technique in a clinical environment, as well as challenges and future 
perspectives, are explored."
1062,"Diabetes mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood 
glucose, not only poses a serious threat to human life and health, but also 
places an economic burden on society. Currently available antidiabetic 
pharmacological agents have some adverse effects, which have stimulated 
researchers to explore novel antidiabetic agents with different mechanisms of 
action. G-protein Coupled Receptor 120 (GPR120), also known as free fatty acid 
receptor 4 (FFAR4), which is activated by medium-chain and long-chain fatty 
acids, has emerged as an interesting potential target for the treatment of 
metabolic disorders. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of novel 
GPR120 agonists based on the structure of TUG-891, which is susceptible to 
β-oxidation and loses its GPR120 agonistic activity in vivo. Among the designed 
compounds, 14d showed excellent agonistic activity and selectivity and could 
improve glucose tolerance in normal mice in a dose-dependent manner. In 
addition, the compound 14d displayed good antidiabetic effects in diet-induced 
obese (DIO) mice and elevated insulin levels. Molecular simulations illustrated 
that compound 14d could enter the active site of GPR120 and interact with ARG99, 
which plays an important role in GPR120 activation. Based on these observations, 
compound 14d may be a promising lead compound deserving of further biological 
evaluation and structural modifications."
1063,"Pigment red 53 is a synthetic dye that has been banned in cosmetic products due 
to the possibility of causing blood disorders and spleen sarcoma. The indicator 
strip employs qualitative analysis methods that are simpler, easier, and quicker 
than an instrumental analysis. The indicator strip is made of a 
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) mixture using a reagent 
blending method with specific reagents of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), 
concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), or 10% sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Pigment 
red 53 detections with an indicator strip are based on the occurrence of a 
specific color change reaction between the reagent and pigment red 53 through 
sulfonation with concentrated H2SO4, neutralization with 10% NaOH, and reaction 
of pigment red 53's azo group with concentrated HCl. PMMA was made with a 
concentration of 5% (w/t), and mixtures of PS:PMMA 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 had 
solvent-to-specific reagent ratios of 60:40, 80:20, and 90:10. The best results 
were obtained for PMMA-H2SO4 (90:10), PMMA-HCl (80:20), and PMMA-NaOH (60:40), 
with the lowest detection limits equaling 20 ppm, 50 ppm, and 20 ppm, 
respectively. Meanwhile, the best PS:PMMA (1:4)-based indicator strips obtained 
were PS:PMMA-H2SO4 (90:10), PS:PMMA-HCl (80:20), and PS:PMMA-NaOH (60:40), with 
the lowest detection limits being 20 ppm, 10 ppm, and 20 ppm, respectively. All 
indicator strips are stable for at least 80 days. Indicator strips can be used 
as a simple and applicable method for detecting pigment red 53 in cosmetic 
products with a good performance."
1064,"Although citrus peel is a waste material, it contains a variety of bioactive 
components. As our preliminary findings showed that citrus peels fermented with 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae T1 contained increased levels of anti-obesity 
flavonoids, the objective of this study was to prepare fermented citrus peel and 
to investigate its effect on ameliorating obesity in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats 
fed with a high-fat diet (HFD). After fermentation, the amounts of limonene, 
nobiletin and 3-methoxynobiletin in citrus peel were markedly increased. SD rats 
were fed with an HFD for 10 weeks, followed by fermented citrus peel-containing 
HFD (0.3% or 0.9% w/w) for 6 weeks. Compared with those fed with an HFD alone, 
lower levels of body weight, visceral fat, body fat percentage, blood 
triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde and 
hepatic adipose accumulation were observed in rats fed with fermented citrus 
peel. In parallel, hepatic levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid 
synthase were diminished, and the level of hormone sensitivity lipase in 
visceral fat was elevated. These results reveal fermented citrus peel is a 
promising natural product with beneficial effects of alleviating HFD-induced 
obesity."
1065,"Ergothioneine, which is a naturally occurring metabolite, generally accumulates 
in tissues and cells subjected to oxidative stress, owing to its structural 
stability at physiological pH; therefore, it has been attracting attention in 
various biomedical fields. Ergothioneine has also been suggested as a potential 
forensic marker, but its applicability has not yet been quantitatively 
validated. In this study, quantitative analysis of ergothioneine in bloodstains 
was conducted to estimate the age of bloodstains and that of bloodstain donors. 
Blood from youth and elderly participants was used to generate bloodstains. 
After extracting metabolites from the bloodstains under prevalent age 
conditions, ergothioneine levels were quantified by mass spectrometry via 
multiple reaction monitoring. The concentration of ergothioneine in day 0 
bloodstains (fresh blood), was significantly higher in the elderly group than in 
the youth group, but it did not differ by sex. Statistically significant 
differences were observed between the samples from the two age groups on days 0, 
5 and 7, and on days 2 and 3 compared with day 0. The findings suggest that 
ergothioneine can be used to estimate the age of bloodstains and of the donor; 
it could be useful as a potential marker in reconstructing crime scenes."
1066,"Notoginseng and safflower are commonly used traditional Chinese medicines for 
benefiting qi and activating blood circulation. A previous study by our group 
showed that the compatibility of the effective components of total saponins of 
notoginseng (NS) and total flavonoids of safflower (SF), named NS-SF, had a 
preventive effect on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in 
rats. However, the therapeutic effect on MI and the synergistic mechanism of 
NS-SF are still unclear. Therefore, integrated metabolomics, combined with 
immunohistochemistry and other pharmacological methods, was used to 
systematically research the therapeutic effect of NS-SF on MI rats and the 
synergistic mechanism of NS and SF. Compared to NS and SF, the results 
demonstrated that NS-SF exhibited a significantly better role in ameliorating 
myocardial damage, apoptosis, easing oxidative stress and anti-inflammation. 
NS-SF showed a more significant regulatory effect on metabolites involved in 
sphingolipid metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, primary bile 
acid biosynthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle, 
such as sphingosine, lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0), 
lysophosphatidylethanolamine (22:5/0:0), chenodeoxycholic acid, L-valine, 
glycine, and succinate, than NS or SF alone, indicating that NS and SF produced 
a synergistic effect on the treatment of MI. This study will provide a 
theoretical basis for the clinical development of NS-SF."
1067,"Managing diabetes is challenging due to the complex physiology of the disease 
and the numerous complications associated with it. As part of the ongoing search 
for antidiabetic chemicals, marine algae have been demonstrated to be an 
excellent source due to their medicinal properties. In this study, Ulva 
reticulata extracts were investigated for their anti-diabetic effect by 
examining its inhibitory effects on α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and DPP-IV and 
antioxidant (DPPH) potential in vitro and its purified fraction using animal 
models. Among the various solvents used, the Methanolic extract of Ulva 
reticulata (MEUR) displayed the highest antidiabetic activity in both in vitro 
and in vivo; it showed no cytotoxicity and hence was subjected to 
bioassay-guided chromatographic separation. Among the seven isolated fractions 
(F1 to F7), the F4 (chloroform) fraction exhibited substantial total phenolic 
content (65.19 μg mL-1) and total flavonoid content (20.33 μg mL-1), which 
showed the promising inhibition against α-amylase (71.67%) and α-glucosidase 
(38.01%). Active fraction (F4) was further purified using column chromatography, 
subjected to thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and characterized by spectroscopy 
techniques. Upon structural elucidation, five distinct compounds, namely, 
Nonane, Hexadecanoic acid, 1-dodecanol, Cyclodecane methyl, and phenol, phenol, 
3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl) were identified. The antidiabetic mechanism of active 
fraction (F4) was further investigated using various in vitro and in vivo 
models. The results displayed that in in vitro both 1 and 24 h in vitro 
cultures, the active fraction (F4) at a concentration of 100 μg mL-1 
demonstrated maximum glucose-induced insulin secretion at 4 mM (0.357 and 0.582 
μg mL-1) and 20 mM (0.848 and 1.032 μg mL-1). The active fraction (F4) reduces 
blood glucose levels in normoglycaemic animals and produces effects similar to 
that of standard acarbose. Active fraction (F4) also demonstrated outstanding 
hypoglycaemic activity in hyperglycemic animals at a dose of 10 mg/kg B.wt. In 
the STZ-induced diabetic rat model, the active fraction (F4) showed a (61%) 
reduction in blood glucose level when compared to the standard drug 
glibenclamide (68%). The results indicate that the marine algae Ulva reticulata 
is a promising candidate for managing diabetes by inhibiting carbohydrate 
metabolizing enzymes and promoting insulin secretion."
1068,"This study was designed to isolate an anti-inflammatory activity oligopeptide 
from goose blood (GBP) for ameliorating LPS-mediated inflammation response and 
oxidative stress in RAW264.7 macrophages. In this study, GBP was isolated by 
tangential flow ultrafiltration system (TFUS) combined with size exclusion 
chromatography (SEC), ion exchange chromatography (IEC), and reversed-phase 
liquid chromatography (RP-LC), and then identified by liquid chromatography mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The experiment results indicated that the amino acid 
sequence of oligopeptide with the best anti-inflammatory activity was 
IIe-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg (IVYPWTQR), which had a molecular weight of 
1062.5720 Da, and was derived from haemoglobin subunit beta OS in goose blood. 
In addition, IVYPWTQR was confirmed to have satisfactory stability and 
maintained high anti-inflammatory activity in a simulated gastrointestinal 
digestion. The mechanism by which the IVYPWTQR protected against LPS-mediated 
inflammation response was attributed to downregulating the TLR4/NF-kB/iNOS 
pathway. Moreover, IVYPWTQR ameliorated oxidative stress damage in inflammatory 
state was attributed to activating antioxidant defence system, which was 
regulated by Keap-1/NRF2/HO-1 signalling pathway for decreasing the accumulation 
of reactive oxide species (ROS). In summary, these results indicated GBP could 
serve as a potential functional factor for prevention and improvement of 
inflammation mediated by LPS and provided an affordable dietary intervention 
strategy to prevent inflammation."
1069,"Endophytic fungi are a diverse group of microorganisms that colonize the inter- 
or intracellular spaces of plants and exhibit mutual benefits. Their 
interactions with the host plant and other microbiomes are multidimensional and 
play a crucial role in the production of secondary metabolites. We screened 
bioactive compounds present in the extracts of Aspergillus flavus, an endophytic 
fungus isolated from the roots of the medicinal grass Cynodon dactylon, for its 
anticancer potential. An in vitro analysis of the Ethyl acetate extract from A. 
flavus showed significant cytostatic effects (IC50: 16.25 μg/mL) against breast 
cancer cells (MCF-7). A morphological analysis of the cells and a flow cytometry 
of the cells with annexin V/Propidium Iodide suggested that the extract induced 
apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells. The extract of A. flavus increased reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) generation and caused a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential 
in MCF-7 cells. To identify the metabolites that might be responsible for the 
anticancer effect, the extract was subjected to a gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Interestingly, nine phytochemicals that induced 
cytotoxicity in the breast cancer cell line were found in the extract. The in 
silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed that 
two compounds, 2,4,7-trinitrofluorenone and 3α, 5 α-cyclo-ergosta-7,9(11), 
22t-triene-6beta-ol exhibited significant binding affinities (-9.20, and -9.50 
Kcal/mol, respectively) against Bcl-2, along with binding stability and 
intermolecular interactions of its ligand-Bcl-2 complexes. Overall, the study 
found that the endophytic A. flavus from C. dactylon contains plant-like 
bioactive compounds that have a promising effect in breast cancer."
1070,"The gut microbiota is increasingly important in the overall human health and as 
such, it is a target in the search of novel strategies for the management of 
metabolic disorders including blood pressure, and cardiovascular diseases. The 
link between microbiota and hypertension is complex and this review is intended 
to provide an overview of the mechanism including the production of postbiotics, 
mitigation of inflammation, and the integration of food biological molecules 
within this complex system. The focus is on hydrolyzed food proteins and 
peptides which are less commonly investigated for prebiotic properties. The 
analysis of available data showed that food peptides are multifunctional and can 
prevent gut dysbiosis by positively affecting the production of postbiotics or 
gut metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, polysaccharides, biogenic amines, bile 
acids). Peptides and the postbiotics then displayed antihypertensive effects via 
the renin-angiotensin system, the gut barrier, the endothelium, and reduction in 
inflammation and oxidative stress. Despite the promising antihypertensive effect 
of the food peptides via the modulation of the gut, there is a lack of human 
studies as most of the works have been conducted in animal models."
1071,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) cause damage to pancreatic β-cells and 
trigger oxidative stress and inflammation, which promotes the development and 
progression of diabetes and its complications. Therefore, it is important to 
inhibit the formation of AGEs as part of the treatment of diabetes. Allicin is a 
natural antimicrobial agent with abundant pharmacological activities, and recent 
studies have reported its therapeutic effects in diabetes; however, the 
mechanism of these therapeutic effects is still unclear. Thus, the purpose of 
this study was to further investigate the association between allicin treatment 
of diabetes and AGEs. First, we established a streptozocin (STZ)-induced 
diabetic rat model and treated the rats with allicin for six weeks. We measured 
glycolipid metabolism, AGE levels, receptor of advanced glycation end products 
(RAGE) levels, oxidative stress, and other related indicators. The results 
showed that allicin improved blood glucose and body weight, reduced lipid 
accumulation, and inhibited AGE formation in rats. Treatment with allicin also 
inhibited RAGEs and thereby prevented AGE activity, which, in turn, alleviated 
oxidative stress and promoted insulin secretion. To further verify the effect of 
allicin on AGEs, we also performed in vitro nonenzymatic glycation simulation 
experiments. These results showed that allicin inhibited the production of AGEs 
by suppressing the production of AGEs intermediates. Thus, our research suggests 
that allicin may alleviate diabetes by inhibiting the formation of AGEs and 
reducing RAGE levels to relieve oxidative stress and promote insulin secretion."
1072,"Anthocyanins are natural pigments that give a red, purple, and blue color to 
many plant, flower, fruit, and vegetable species. Their presence within the 
genus Citrus was first reported in 1916, and it is well-known that the red color 
of the flesh and rind of blood (red or pigmented) oranges (Citrus sinensis L. 
Osbeck) is due to the presence of anthocyanins. They are also present in the 
young shoots, flowers, and peel of lemon (Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f.), citron 
(Citrus medica L.), and other citrus species. Since then, the scientific 
community has expressed increasing interest in studying their profile and 
distribution, with many published studies focused on the quali-quantitative 
pattern in the different vegetative tissues belonging to the genus Citrus. 
Moreover, with the discovery of their relevant antioxidant activity, owing to 
their ability to capture free radicals, much research has been performed in the 
last two decades on their radical scavenging power, in vitro and in vivo 
biological properties, and anticarcinogenic capacity, also focusing attention on 
their bioavailability for humans. The present work is intended as a 
comprehensive review of the advances in scientific research on anthocyanin 
pigments naturally occurring within the genus Citrus, including their natural 
distribution, antioxidant capacity, bioavailability, and biological value and 
properties. The scientific evidence herein reported can be used to further 
increase the knowledge of this class of compounds and represents a valuable and 
comprehensive contribution to promoting anthocyanin-rich citrus fruit 
consumption as a healthy dietary habit."
1073,"Natural and synthetic coumarins are often considered privileged scaffolds for 
obtaining pharmacological agents with hypoglycemic activity. Chemical 
modification of coumarins often leads to antidiabetic agents with greater 
efficacy. In the present work, twenty monoterpene-substituted 7-hydroxycoumarins 
were synthesized. A new approach using the Mitsunobu reaction was shown to be 
effective for the synthesis of target compounds. All of the synthesized 
compounds were evaluated in an oral glucose tolerance test, and two of them 
containing geranyl and (-)-myrtenyl substituents showed in vivo hypoglycemic 
action. A possible mechanism of action of these compounds may include inhibition 
of DPP IV, which was proved in an in vitro test."
1074,"Conventional anticancer treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, have 
significantly improved cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the existing traditional 
anticancer treatments have been reported to cause serious side effects and 
resistance to cancer and even to severely affect the quality of life of cancer 
survivors, which indicates the utmost urgency to develop effective and safe 
anticancer treatments. As the primary focus of cancer nanotheranostics, 
nanomaterials with unique surface chemistry and shape have been investigated for 
integrating cancer diagnostics with treatment techniques, including guiding a 
prompt diagnosis, precise imaging, treatment with an effective dose, and 
real-time supervision of therapeutic efficacy. Several theranostic nanosystems 
have been explored for cancer diagnosis and treatment in the past decade. 
However, metal-based nanotheranostics continue to be the most common types of 
nonentities. Consequently, the present review covers the physical 
characteristics of effective metallic, functionalized, and hybrid 
nanotheranostic systems. The scope of coverage also includes the clinical 
advantages and limitations of cancer nanotheranostics. In light of these 
viewpoints, future research directions exploring the robustness and clinical 
viability of cancer nanotheranostics through various strategies to enhance the 
biocompatibility of theranostic nanoparticles are summarised."
1075,"Aging process is characterized by a progressive decline of several organic, 
physiological, and metabolic functions whose precise mechanism remains unclear. 
Metabolomics allows the identification of several metabolites and may contribute 
to clarifying the aging-regulated metabolic pathways. We aimed to investigate 
aging-related serum metabolic changes using a metabolomics approach. Fasting 
blood serum samples from 138 apparently healthy individuals (20-70 years old, 
56% men) were analyzed by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1H 
NMR) and Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and 
for clinical markers. Associations of the metabolic profile with age were 
explored via Correlations (r); Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis; Multiple 
Linear Regression; and Aging Metabolism Breakpoint. The age increase was 
positively correlated (0.212 ≤ r ≤ 0.370, p &lt; 0.05) with the clinical markers 
(total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, triacylglyceride, and glucose levels); 
negatively correlated (-0.285 ≤ r ≤ -0.214, p &lt; 0.05) with tryptophan, 
3-hydroxyisobutyrate, asparagine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine levels, but 
positively (0.237 ≤ r ≤ 0.269, p &lt; 0.05) with aspartate and ornithine levels. 
These metabolites resulted in three enriched pathways: valine, leucine, and 
isoleucine degradation, urea cycle, and ammonia recycling. Additionally, serum 
metabolic levels of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, isoleucine, aspartate, and ornithine 
explained 27.3% of the age variation, with the aging metabolism breakpoint 
occurring after the third decade of life. These results indicate that the aging 
process is potentially associated with reduced serum branched-chain amino acid 
levels (especially after the third decade of life) and progressively increased 
levels of serum metabolites indicative of the urea cycle."
1076,"Melatonin, a naturally biosynthesized molecule secreted by the pineal gland, 
exhibits antitumor activities against several different types of cancer. The 
mechanisms of action of melatonin against tumor progression involve cellular 
apoptosis, antimetastatic activity, antioxidant and mutagenic effects, 
antiangiogenic activity, and the restoration of cancer immune surveillance. 
Melatonin has anticancer activity when administered alone or in combination with 
standard chemotherapeutic agents, with measurable improvements seen in the 
clinical endpoints of tumor regression and patient survival. However, scant 
clinical evidence supports the use of melatonin in bladder cancer treatment. Our 
study has found that melatonin treatment suppresses the bladder cancer cell 
migratory ability by inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
process, which appears to be linked to melatonin-induced decreases in bladder 
cancer cell autophagy. Finally, an evaluation of in vivo melatonin-induced 
antitumor effects in an orthotopic animal model of bladder cancer indicated that 
melatonin treatment slightly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Our 
study offers novel insights into the use of melatonin in bladder cancer 
treatment."
1077,"BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging pathogen classified as a 
public health concern, that infects critically ill patients and has expressed 
resistance against antimicrobial therapy. The aim of this study was to examine 
the epidemiological pattern, resistance characteristics and clinical outcomes of 
S. maltophilia infections in hospitalized patients.
METHODS: The study included 393 S. maltophilia isolates from different clinical 
specimens as well as the clinical data of 209 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 
patients. The patients' data were obtained from medical and laboratory files. 
Descriptive statistics and a univariate analysis were used to report and compare 
the demographics, clinical data, and outcomes.
RESULTS: The S. maltophilia was mostly isolated from the respiratory specimens 
of ICU patients. The adult patients were more likely to develop serious 
infections and worse outcomes than were pediatric patients. The most common 
co-infecting pathogens were SARS-CoV2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The death rate 
was 44.5% and increased to 47.1% in the case of a respiratory infection. Septic 
shock was the most significant predictor of mortality. Older age and mechanical 
ventilation were independent and significant risk factors that worsened the 
outcomes in patients with respiratory infections.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of S. maltophilia as a threat highlights the 
importance of surveillance studies in this region."
1078,"Leishmania infantum, the sand fly-transmitted protozoan parasite responsible for 
leishmaniasis in humans, dogs, and cats, is endemic in the Iberian Peninsula. 
However, the impact of L. infantum infection on the conservation of the 
endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is unknown. Herein, we describe for the 
first time the occurrence of L. infantum infection among a population of 
reintroduced and wild-born L. pardinus living in the Portuguese Guadiana Valley 
Park. The presence of infection was addressed by molecular detection of 
Leishmania kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) in 35 lynxes, with further confirmation of L. 
infantum species performed by an internally transcribed spacer (ITS)-1 
sequencing. Eight blood samples were positive for kDNA, and ITS-1 sequencing 
confirmed the presence of L. infantum in two of those samples. Exposure to 
Leishmania was screened in a group of 36 lynxes using an immunofluorescence 
antibody test (IFAT) and a multi-antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA), using SPLA, rK39, and CPX as Leishmania-specific antigens. Four animals 
presented a positive IFAT at a dilution of 1:40. Eight samples were considered 
seropositive to all ELISA Leishmania-specific antigens. Agreement between PCR, 
IFAT, and all ELISA antigens was found for 1 in 27 samples. These results 
highlight the susceptibility of autochthonous L. pardinus to 
L.&amp;nbsp;infantum infection. Further investigation is required to assess the 
impact of L. infantum infection on this wild species conservation."
1079,"The present study reports on serosurvey on the tick-borne encephalitis virus 
European subtype (TBEV; genus Flavivirus), and the tick-borne Kemerovo (KEMV) 
and Tribeč (TRBV) orbivirus (genus Orbivirus) infections in tick-infested and 
non-infested birds. No virus RNA was detected in the blood clots. Birds were 
infested mostly by Ixodes ricinus, but Haemaphysalis concinna and I. frontalis 
were observed too. TBEV, KEMV and TRBV neutralising antibodies (NAb) were 
detected in the screening microtitration neutralisation test (μVNT). 
Seropositive samples were further examined in simultaneous μVNT to distinguish 
TBEV infection from WNV and USUV. KEMV and TRBV infections were also further 
examined by μVNT against each other. The demonstrated results point to increased 
TBEV and TRBV seroprevalence in birds over the past several years. This is the 
first study on KEMV infection in the Slovak bird population, and seropositive 
juvenile birds suggest its occurrence in a new geographic area. The results 
indicate the significance of tick infestation rates, seropositivity and specific 
NAb titre. The reservoir role of birds for TBEV, KEMV and TRBV remains unclear. 
However, targeted monitoring of birds and vectors is an effective measure of 
surveillance of arbovirus introduction into new geographic areas."
1080,"BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
pathogen, causing both community- and healthcare-associated infections. The 
resistance is due to the continuous accumulation of multiple 
antibiotic-resistance-genes (ARGs) through spontaneous genomic mutations and the 
acquisition of conjugative plasmids. This study presents antibiotics resistance 
genes, plasmids replicons, and virulence genes of K. pneumoniae isolates from 
clinical specimens in a tertiary hospital, Mwanza, Tanzania.
METHODS: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 34 K. pneumoniae was performed, using 
an Illumina NextSeq 500, followed by in silco analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 34 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae, 
isolated from blood samples from neonatal units were whole-genome sequenced. Of 
these, 28 (82.4%) had an identified sequence type (ST), with ST14 (39.3%, n = 
11) being frequently identified. Moreover, 18 (52.9%) of the bacteria harbored 
at least one plasmid, from which a total of 25 plasmid replicons were identified 
with a predominance of IncFIB(K) 48.0% (n = 12). Out of 34 sequenced K. 
pneumoniae, 32 (94.1%) were harboring acquired 
antibiotic/biocides-resistance-genes (ARGs) with a predominance of blaCTX-M-15 
(90.6%), followed by oqxB (87.5%), oqxA (84.4%), blaTEM-1B (84.4%) and sul2 
(84.4%). Interestingly, we observed the ColRNAI plasmid-replicon (n = 1) and 
qacE gene (n = 4) for the first time in this setting.
CONCLUSION: Global high-risk clones of K. pneumoniae isolates carry multiple 
ARGs in multiple plasmid-replicons. Findings from this study warrant 
genomic-based surveillance to monitor high-risk global clones, epidemic plasmids 
and ARGs in low- and middle-income countries."
1081,"The Anaplasmataceae family encompasses obligate intracellular α-proteobacteria 
of human and veterinary medicine importance. This study performed multi-locus 
sequencing to characterize Ehrlichia and Anaplasma in coati's blood samples in 
Midwestern Brazil. Twenty-five samples (25/165-15.1%) were positive in the 
screening PCR based on the dsb gene of Ehrlichia spp. and were characterized 
using 16S rRNA, sodB, groEL, and gltA genes and the 23S-5S intergenic space 
region (ITS). Phylogenetic analyses based on all six molecular markers 
positioned the sequences into a new clade, with a common origin of Ehrlichia 
ruminantium. Haplotype analyses of 16S RNA sequences revealed the presence of 
two distinct Ehrlichia genotypes. Six samples (6/165, 3.6%) were positive in the 
screening nPCR for the 16S rRNA gene of Anaplasma spp. and were submitted to an 
additional PCR targeting the ITS for molecular characterization. Phylogenetic 
analyses based on both 16S rRNA gene and ITS positioned the Anaplasma sp. 
detected in the present study in a large clade with other Anaplasma sp. 
previously detected in ticks and wild animals and in a clade with 'Candidatus 
Anaplasma brasiliensis', respectively. Based on distinct molecular markers, the 
present work described a putative novel Anaplasmataceae agent, namely 
'Candidatus Ehrlichia dumleri', and Anaplasma sp. closely related to the 
previously described 'Candidatus Anaplasma brasiliensis'."
1082,"Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (PfIEs) present P. falciparum 
erythrocyte membrane protein 1 proteins (PfEMP1s) on the cell surface, via which 
they cytoadhere to various endothelial cell receptors (ECRs) on the walls of 
human blood vessels. This prevents the parasite from passing through the spleen, 
which would lead to its elimination. Each P. falciparum isolate has about 60 
different PfEMP1s acting as ligands, and at least 24 ECRs have been identified 
as interaction partners. Interestingly, in every parasite genome sequenced to 
date, at least 75% of the encoded PfEMP1s have a binding domain for the 
scavenger receptor CD36 widely distributed on host endothelial cells and many 
other cell types. Here, we discuss why the interaction between PfIEs and CD36 is 
optimal to maintain a finely regulated equilibrium that allows the parasite to 
multiply and spread while causing minimal harm to the host in most infections."
1083,"The efficacy of pre-emptive therapy in the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
disease and the potential association of CMV infection with the occurrence of 
chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) was evaluated in 129 lung transplant 
recipients receiving pre-emptive therapy based on pp65-antigenemia or CMV-DNA in 
the blood and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Seventy-one (55%) patients received 
pre-emptive ganciclovir/valganciclovir (GCV/VGCV) for CMV infection for a median 
of 28 (9-191) days. Possible CMV disease occurred in six (5%) patients and was 
healed after the GCV/VGCV therapy. The cumulative incidence of CLAD was 38% and 
54% at 5 and 10 years. Acute rejection and CMV load in the blood (but not in the 
lung) were independent predictors of the occurrence of CLAD. Pre-emptive therapy 
is highly effective in preventing CMV disease in lung recipients and does not 
induce a superior incidence of CLAD compared to what reported for other cohorts 
of patients who received an extended antiviral prophylaxis."
1084,"The low-land tapir (Tapirus terrestris) is the largest wild terrestrial mammal 
found in Brazil. Although T. terrestris has been already reported as a host of 
hemoparasites, the occurrence and genetic identity of Piroplasmida agents in 
this species is still cloudy. Although it is reported that Theileria equi, an 
endemic equid-infective agent in Brazil, is occurring in lowland tapirs, these 
reports are probably misconceived diagnoses since they are solely based on small 
fragments of 18S rRNA that may not achieve accurate topologies on phylogenetic 
analyses. The present study aimed to detect and investigate the identity of 
Theileria spp. in tapirs from Pantanal and Cerrado biomes. Blood-DNA samples 
from tapirs were screened for a partial (~800 bp) 18S rRNA gene fragment from 
Piroplasmida and 64 (64/122; 52.46% CI: 43.66-61.11%) presented bands of 
expected size. Samples were submitted to different protocols for molecular 
characterization, including near-full length 18S rRNA gene (~1500 bp), and the 
ema-1 gene from T. equi. Eight sequences were obtained for extended fragments 
(1182-1473 bp) from the 18S rRNA gene. Moreover, three sequences from partial 
cox-1 and five from partial hsp70 gene were obtained. None of the samples 
presented amplifications for the ema-1 gene. Phylogenetic and distance analyses 
from the 18S rRNA sequences obtained demonstrated a clear separation from 
tapirs' Theileria spp. and T. equi. Phylogenetic analyses of cox-1 and hsp70 
sequences obtained herein also showed a unique clade formed by tapir's Theileria 
spp. Theileria terrestris sp. nov. is positioned apart from all other Theileria 
species in 18S rRNA, cox-1, and hps70 phylogenetic analyses. This novel proposed 
species represents a new Piroplasmida clade, yet to be characterized regarding 
biological features, vectors involved in the transmission cycles, additional 
vertebrate hosts, and pathogenicity."
1085,"The development of non-invasive optoelectronic technologies for human blood 
monitoring is one of the important research areas for medicine. A critical 
analysis of optoelectronic methods of blood research and the micromechanical

polarizing portable system for non-invasive monitoring of hematocrit as one of 
the basic homeostatic constants of the human body containing information about 
the microphysical parameters of blood cells has been substantiated. A physical 
model of polarized radiation conversion in a video information system of laser 
sensing of a biological research object has been formed. Visual and quantitative

have been revealed. A scheme of a multichannel imaging portable system, based on 
a smartphone using miniature optical and microelectronic components of 
information conversion for non-invasive monitoring of microphysical blood 
parameters, has been created. The system implements the principle of 
polarimetric blood photometry and a multiparametric analysis of the polarization 
properties of the laser radiation scattered by blood. The developed portable 
optoelectronic system, based on a smartphone, can be used for rapid blood 
diagnostics in disaster medicine and the presence of clinical contraindications 
to the formation of invasive tests. The proposed polarization-based approach is 
a promising automated alternative to traditional devices and systems for the 
research of microphysical blood parameters."
1086,"Recently, there has been increasing attention toward inhaled nanoparticles (NPs) 
to develop inhalation therapies for diseases associated with the pulmonary 
system and investigate the toxic effects of hazardous environmental particles on 
human lung health. Taking advantage of microfluidic technology for cell culture 
applications, lung-on-a-chip devices with great potential in replicating the 
lung air-blood barrier (ABB) have opened new research insights in preclinical 
pathology and therapeutic studies associated with aerosol NPs. However, the air 
interface in such devices has been largely disregarded, leaving a gap in 
understanding the NPs' dynamics in lung-on-a-chip devices. Here, we develop a 
numerical parametric study to provide insights into the dynamic behavior of the 
airborne NPs in a gas-liquid dual-channel lung-on-a-chip device with a porous 
membrane separating the channels. We develop a finite element multi-physics 
model to investigate particle tracing in both air and medium phases to replicate 
the in vivo conditions. Our model considers the impact of fluid flow and 
geometrical properties on the distribution, deposition, and translocation of NPs 
with diameters ranging from 10 nm to 900 nm. Our findings suggest that, compared 
to the aqueous solution of NPs, the aerosol injection of NPs offers more 
efficient deposition on the substrate of the air channel and higher 
translocation to the media channel. Comparative studies against accessible data, 
as well as an experimental study, verify the accuracy of the present numerical 
analysis. We propose a strategy to optimize the affecting parameters to control 
the injection and delivery of aerosol particles into the lung-on-chip device 
depending on the objectives of biomedical investigations and provide optimized 
values for some specific cases. Therefore, our study can assist scientists and 
researchers in complementing their experimental investigation in future 
preclinical studies on pulmonary pathology associated with inhaled hazardous and 
toxic environmental particles, as well as therapeutic studies for developing 
inhalation drug delivery."
1087,"Health monitoring and its associated technologies have gained enormous 
importance over the past few years. The electrocardiogram (ECG) has long been a 
popular tool for assessing and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Since 
the literature on ECG monitoring devices is growing at an exponential rate, it 
is becoming difficult for researchers and healthcare professionals to select, 
compare, and assess the systems that meet their demands while also meeting the 
monitoring standards. This emphasizes the necessity for a reliable reference to 
guide the design, categorization, and analysis of ECG monitoring systems, which 
will benefit both academics and practitioners. We present a complete ECG 
monitoring system in this work, describing the design stages and implementation 
of an end-to-end solution for capturing and displaying the patient's heart 
signals, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature. The data will be 
presented on an OLED display, a developed Android application as well as in 
MATLAB via serial communication. The Internet of Things (IoT) approaches have a 
clear advantage in tackling the problem of heart disease patient care as they 
can transform the service mode into a widespread one and alert the healthcare 
services based on the patient's physical condition. Keeping this in mind, there 
is also the addition of a web server for monitoring the patient's status via 
WiFi. The prototype, which is compliant with the electrical safety regulations 
and medical equipment design, was further benchmarked against a commercially 
available off-the-shelf device, and showed an excellent accuracy of 99.56%."
1088,"Diabetes remains a great threat to human beings' health and its world prevalence 
is projected to reach 9.9% by 2045. At present, the detection methods used are 
often invasive, cumbersome and time-consuming, thus increasing the burden on 
patients. In this paper, we propose a novel noninvasive and low-cost biosensor 
capable of detecting glucose in human sweat using enzyme-based electrodes for 
point-of-care uses. Specifically, an electrochemical method is applied for 
detection and the electrodes are covered with multilayered films including 
ferrocene-polyaniline (F-P), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and glucose 
oxidase (GOx) on Cu substrates (GOx/MWCNTs/F-P/Cu). The coated layers enhance 
the immobilization of GOx, increase the conductivity of the anode and improve 
the electrochemical properties of the electrode. Compared with the Cu electrode 
and the F-P/Cu electrode, a maximum peak current is obtained when the 
MWCNTs/F-P/Cu electrode is applied. We also study its current response by cyclic 
voltammetry (CV) at different concentrations (0-2.0 mM) of glucose solution. The 
best current response is obtained at 0.25 V using chronoamperometry. The 
effective working lifetime of an electrode is up to 8 days. Finally, to 
demonstrate the capability of the electrode, a portable, miniaturized and 
integrated detection device based on the GOx/MWCNTs/F-P/Cu electrode is 
developed. The results exhibit a short response time of 5 s and a correlation 
coefficient R2 of 0.9847 between the response current of sweat with blood 
glucose concentration. The LOD is of 0.081 mM and the reproducibility achieved 
in terms of RSD is 3.55%. The sweat glucose sensor is noninvasive and 
point-of-care, which shows great development potential in the health examination 
and monitoring field."
1089,"The potential use of nanomaterials in medicine offers opportunities for novel 
therapeutic approaches to treating complex disorders. For that reason, a new 
branch of science, named nanotoxicology, which aims to study the dangerous 
effects of nanomaterials on human health and on the environment, has recently 
emerged. However, the toxicity and risk associated with nanomaterials are 
unclear or not completely understood. The development of an adequate 
experimental strategy for assessing the toxicity of nanomaterials may include a 
rapid/express method that will reliably, quickly, and cheaply make an initial 
assessment. One possibility is the characterization of the hemocompatibility of 
nanomaterials, which includes their hemolytic activity as a marker. In this 
review, we consider various factors affecting the hemolytic activity of 
nanomaterials and draw the reader's attention to the fact that the formation of 
a protein corona around a nanoparticle can significantly change its interaction 
with the red cell. This leads us to suggest that the nanomaterial hemolytic 
activity in the buffer does not reflect the situation in the blood plasma. As a 
recommendation, we propose studying the hemocompatibility of nanomaterials under 
more physiologically relevant conditions, in the presence of plasma proteins in 
the medium and under mechanical stress."
1090,"Angiotensinogen (AGT) is one of the most significant enzymes of the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which is involved in the regulation 
and maintenance of blood pressure. AGT is involved in the production of 
angiotensin I which is then converted into angiotensin II that leads to renal 
homeostasis. However, various genetic polymorphisms in AGT have been discovered 
in recent times which have shown an association with various diseases. Genetic 
polymorphism increases the level of circulating AGT in blood which exaggerates 
the effects produced by AGT. The associated diseases occur due to various 
effects produced by increased AGT levels. Several cardiovascular diseases 
including myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, heart failure, 
hypertrophy, etc. are associated with AGT polymorphism. Other diseases such as 
depression, obesity, diabetic nephropathy, pre-eclampsia, and liver injury are 
also associated with some variants of AGT gene. The most common variants of AGT 
polymorphism are M235T and T174M. The two variants are associated with many 
diseases. Some other variants such as G-217A, A-6G, A-20C and G-152A, are also 
present but they are not as significant as that of M235T and T174M variants. 
These variants increase the level of circulating AGT and are associated with 
prevalence of different diseases. These diseases occur through various 
pathological pathways, but the initial reason remains the same, i.e., increased 
level of AGT in the blood. In this article, we have majorly focused on how 
genetic polymorphism of different variants of AGT gene is associated with the 
prevalence of different diseases."
1091,"To assess the efficacy of different modalities and frequencies of physical 
exercise on glycaemic control in adults with prediabetes. A two-phase, parallel, 
randomised, controlled clinical trial will be carried out, in 210 participants. 
In phase 1, 120 participants will be randomized into four arms: (1) aerobic 
exercise, (2) aerobic exercise combined with resistance, (3) high-intensity 
intervallic exercise and (4) control group. In phase 2, 90 new participants will 
be randomized into three arms, using the exercise modality that showed the best 
glycaemic control in phase 1 in the following manner: (1) frequency of 5 
days/week, (2) frequency of 3 days/week and (3) frequency of 2 days/week. The 
control group (n = 30) will be included in phase 1 to evaluate the effect of any 
type of intervention versus no intervention. Data collection will be performed 
at baseline and after 15 weeks of follow up. Sociodemographic data, medication, 
comorbidity, blood biochemical parameters, blood pressure, anthropometric 
measurements, body composition, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, diet, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, quality of life and sleep questionnaires will be 
collected. Physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep will be further 
determined with an accelerometer, and continuous glycaemia will be determined 
with a glycaemic monitor, both during seven days, at two time points. The main 
dependent variable will be the reduction in the mean amplitude of glycaemic 
excursions. The impact of these interventions on health will also be evaluated 
through gene expression analysis in peripheral blood cells. The results of this 
study will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the 
glucose response to physical exercise in a population with prediabetes as well 
as improve physical exercise prescriptions for diabetes prevention. Increasing 
glycaemic control in people with prediabetes through physical exercise offers an 
opportunity to prevent diabetes and reduce associated comorbidities and health 
costs."
1092,"Oxidative stress plays a leading role in the pathogenesis of diabetic 
nephropathy. However, many aspects of oxidative stress reactions in the initial 
stages of this disease are not fully understood. The men cohort is of particular 
interest because of the severe effects of diabetes on their urogenital system. 
The aim of this study is to assess the intensity of lipids, proteins, DNA 
oxidative damage, blood antioxidant defense enzymatic, and activity of 
non-enzymatic components in men with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in the 
early stages of diabetic nephropathy using receiver operator characteristic 
(ROC) analysis. This study included eighty-nine reproductive-age men in the 
initial stages of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and thirty-nine age- and sex-matched 
individuals not suffering from glycemic disorders. The DN patients were divided 
into two subgroups: stage 1 patients (urinary albumin &lt; 30 mg/day and 
albumin/creatinine ratio &lt; 3 mg/mmol (n = 45)) and stage 2 patients (urinary 
albumin 30-300 mg/day and albumin/creatinine ratio 3-30 mg/mmol (n = 44)). 
Levels of oxidative damage products (conjugated dienes (CDs), thiobarbituric 
acid reactants (TBARs), methylglyoxal (MGO), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 
(8-OHdG)) and antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione 
S-transferases π (GSTp), glutathione reductase (GR), copper and zinc-containing 
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1), total antioxidant status (TAS), α-tocopherol, 
retinol, reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidative glutathione (GSSG)) were 
estimated in plasma and erythrocytes. Oxidative damage to cellular structures 
(higher values of median CDs (1.68 µmol/L; p = 0.003), MGO (3.38 mg/L; p &lt; 
0.001) in the stage 1 group and CDs (2.28 µmol/L; p &lt; 0.0001), MGO (3.52 
mg/L; p &lt; 0.001), 8-OHdG (19.44 ng/mL; p = 0.010) in the stage 2 group) and 
changes in the antioxidant defense system (lower values of TAS (1.14 units; p = 
0.011), α-tocopherol (12.17 µmol/L; p = 0.009), GPx (1099 units; p = 0.0003) and 
elevated levels of retinol (1.35 µmol/L; p &lt; 0.001) in the group with stage 
1; lower values of α-tocopherol (12.65 µmol/L; p = 0.033), GPx (1029.7 units; p 
= 0.0001) and increased levels of GR (292.75 units; p &lt; 0.001), GSH (2.54 
mmol/L; p = 0.010), GSSG (2.31 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.0001), and retinol (0.81 µmol/L; 
p = 0.005) in the stage 2 group) were identified. The ROC analysis established 
that the following indicators have the highest diagnostic significance for stage 
1 diabetic nephropathy: CDs (AUC 0.755; p &lt; 0.0001), TBARs (AUC 0.748; p = 
0.0001), MGO (AUC 0.720; p = 0.0033), retinol (AUC 0.932; p &lt; 0.0001), GPx 
(AUC 0.741; p = 0.0004), α-tocopherol (AUC 0.683; p = 0.0071), and TAS (AUC 
0.686; p = 0.0052) and the following for stage 2 diabetic nephropathy: CDs (AUC 
0.714; p = 0.001), TBARs (AUC 0.708; p = 0.001), 8-OHdG (AUC 0.658; p = 0.0232), 
GSSG (AUC 0.714; p = 0.001), and GSH (AUC 0.667; p = 0.0108). We conclude that 
changes in indicators of damage to lipids, proteins, DNA, and the insufficiency 
of antioxidant defense factors already manifest in the first stage of diabetic 
nephropathy in men with T1DM. The ROC established which parameters have the 
greatest diagnostic significance for stages 1 and 2 of diabetic nephropathy, 
which may be utilized as additional criteria for defining men with T1DM as being 
in the risk group for the development of initial manifestations of the disease 
and thus allow for substantiating appropriate approaches to optimize preventive 
measures."
1093,"Atherosclerosis is the most common disease of the vascular system and the 
metabolic disorder is one of its important molecular mechanisms. SAP protein is 
found to be highly expressed in atherosclerotic blood vessels. Our previous 
study found that SAP deficiency can significantly inhibit the development of 
atherosclerosis. However, the regulatory effect of SAP deficiency on AS 
metabolism is unknown. Based on 1H-NMR metabonomics, this study investigated the 
serum metabolic changes in ApoE-/-;SAP-/- mice compared with ApoE-/- mice during 
the whole progression of atherosclerosis. The results showed that acetate, 
pyruvate, choline and VLDL + LDL were statistically regulated to the normal 
levels as in C57 mice by SAP deficiency in ApoE-/-;SAP-/- mice at 8 w (without 
obvious plaques). With the appearance and aggravation of atherosclerotic plaques 
(8 + 4 w and 8 + 8 w), the four metabolites of acetate, pyruvate, choline and 
VLDL + LDL were continuously regulated, which were denoted as the metabolic 
regulatory markers of SAP deficiency. We also found that the changes in these 
four metabolites had nothing to do with high-fat diet. Therefore, it was 
revealed that SAP deficiency regulated the metabolic disorders in ApoE-/- prior 
to the appearance of obvious atherosclerotic plaques, which is one of the 
important mechanisms leading to the inhibition of atherosclerosis, providing a 
new basis for the application of SAP in atherosclerosis."
1094,"Hyperlipidemia is a chronic disease that seriously affects human health. Due to 
the fact that traditional animal models cannot fully mimic hyperlipidemia in 
humans, new animal models are urgently needed for basic drug research on 
hyperlipidemia. Previous studies have demonstrated that the genomic diversity of 
the wild mice chromosome 1 substitution lines was significantly different from 
that of laboratory mice, suggesting that it might be accompanied by phenotypic 
diversity. We first screened the blood lipid-related phenotype of chromosome 1 
substitution lines. We found that the male HFD-fed B6-Chr1BLD mice showed more 
severe hyperlipidemia-related phenotypes in body weight, lipid metabolism and 
liver lesions. By RNA sequencing and whole-genome sequencing results of 
B6-Chr1BLD, we found that several differentially expressed single nucleotide 
polymorphism enriched genes were associated with lipid metabolism-related 
pathways. Lipid metabolism-related genes, mainly including Aida, Soat1, Scly and 
Ildr2, might play an initial and upstream role in the abnormal metabolic 
phenotype of male B6-Chr1BLD mice. Taken together, male B6-Chr1BLD mice could 
serve as a novel, polygenic interaction-based hyperlipidemia model. This study 
could provide a novel animal model for accurate clinical diagnosis and precise 
medicine of hyperlipidemia."
1095,"Hyperglycemia is seen in approximately 68 percent of patients admitted to a 
medical intensive care unit (ICU). In many acute circumstances, such as 
myocardial infarction, brain, injury and stroke, it is an independent predictor 
of mortality. Hyperglycemia is induced by a mix of genetic, environmental, and 
immunologic variables in people with type 1 diabetes. These factors cause 
pancreatic beta cell death and insulin insufficiency. Insulin resistance and 
irregular insulin production cause hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients. 
Hyperglycemia activates a number of complicated interconnected metabolic 
processes. Hyperglycemia is a major contributor to the onset and progression of 
diabetes' secondary complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, 
cataracts, periodontitis, and bone and joint issues. Studies on the health 
benefits of ginger and its constituent's impact on hyperglycemia and related 
disorders have been conducted and gingerol proved to be a potential 
pharmaceutically active constituent of ginger (Zingiber officinale) that has 
been shown to lower blood sugar levels, because it possesses antioxidant 
properties and it functions as an antioxidant in the complicated biochemical 
process that causes hyperglycemia to be activated. Gingerol not only helps in 
treating hyperglycemia but also shows effectivity against diseases related to 
it, such as cardiopathy, kidney failure, vision impairments, bone and joint 
problems, and teeth and gum infections. Moreover, fresh ginger has various 
gingerol analogues, with 6-gingerol being the most abundant. However, it is 
necessary to investigate the efficacy of its other analogues against 
hyperglycemia and associated disorders at various concentrations in order to 
determine the appropriate dose for treating these conditions."
1096,"Heart failure (HF) represents a cardiovascular disease with high mortality and 
morbidity. The latest evidence shows that changes in the composition of the gut 
microbiota might play a pivotal role in the prevention and management of HF. 
This systematic review aims at assessing the potential associations between the 
diet, gut microbiota, and derived metabolites with the outcomes of HF. A 
systematic literature search was performed up to July 2022 on the PubMed, Web of 
Science, and Scopus databases. The PRISMA guidelines were followed when 
possible. The risk of bias was assessed with the SYRCLE and ARRIVE tools. A 
total of nine pre-clinical studies on animal models, with considerable 
heterogeneity in dietary interventions, were included. High-fiber/prebiotic 
diets (n = 4) and a diet rich in polyphenols (n = 1) modified the gut microbiota 
composition and increased microbial metabolites' activities, linked with an 
improvement in HF outcomes, such as a reduction in systolic blood pressure, 
cardiac hypertrophy, and left ventricular thickness. A high-fat diet (n = 2) or 
a diet rich in choline (n = 2) induced an increase in TMAO and indole derivative 
production associated with a decrease in cardiac function, systemic endotoxemia, 
and inflammation and an increase in cardiac fibrosis and cardiac remodeling. 
Although results are retrieved from animal studies, this systematic review shows 
the key role of the diet-especially a high-fiber and prebiotic diet-on gut 
microbial metabolites in improving HF outcomes. Further studies on human cohorts 
are needed to identify personalized therapeutic dietary interventions to improve 
cardiometabolic health."
1097,"Occupational exposure is a significant source of metal contact; previous studies 
have been limited regarding the effect of occupational metal exposure on the 
development of hypertension. This study was conducted to assess the levels of 
exposure of certain metals (chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and nickel 
(Ni)) in hypertensive and non-hypertensive workers and to assess the 
relationship between the risk of hypertension and metal exposure level. Our 
study included 138 hypertensive patients as case groups and 138 non-hypertensive 
participants as controls. The exposure risk level was divided according to the 
limit value after collecting and testing the metal dust in the workshop. 
Considering the influence of single- and poly-metal, single factor analysis and 
conditional logistic regression analysis of poly-metal were carried out. The 
results of the model indicated that the incidence of hypertension increased with 
an increase in Cr exposure level, and the risk of hypertension was 1.85 times 
higher in the highest exposure than in the lowest exposure (95% CI: 1.20-2.86, p 
&lt; 0.05). Mn has the same effect as Cr. There was no significant correlation 
between Fe or Ni and hypertension. Our findings suggested that Cr and Mn 
exposure in the work environment might increase the risk of hypertension, while 
no effect of Fe and Ni on blood pressure was found. Prospective study designs in 
larger populations are needed to confirm our findings."
1098,"Many studies have documented that dental diseases were associated with an 
increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is a 
powerful predictor of cardiovascular diseases. However, whether the status of 
dental health is associated with AoAC is still unknown. 9463 participants over 
the age of 60 from Shenzhen community centers were included in the 
cross-sectional analysis. Physical examination data, blood biochemical tests, 
and AoAC scores calculated by chest radiography were collected and analyzed. 
Among them, 2630 participants were followed up for AoAC progression up to 36 
months. Participants with AoAC suffered more tooth loss than those without AoAC 
(77.62% vs. 72.91%; p &lt; 0.001). Association rule analysis suggested a strong 
association between dental diseases and AoAC. Tooth loss or decay increased the 
risk of AoAC progression (HR 1.459; 95%CI 1.284-1.658) after adjusting other 
risk factors including renal dysfunction. Dental diseases are potential 
predictors for AoAC in elderly people, which are independent of renal 
dysfunction."
1099,"This study evaluated the effects of gestational supplementation strategy on 
nitrogen isotopic signature in blood plasma of beef cows and their progeny. The 
study comprised 15 pregnant Nellore cows divided into three different 
supplementation protocols: NP) non-programmed group; PP) cows receiving 
protein-energy supplement in the last third of pregnancy; and FP) cows receiving 
protein-energy supplement throughout the gestational period. Blood plasma from 
cows was sampled at the beginning of gestation, in the prepartum, and postpartum 
periods as well as from their calves at 30 and 180 days of age, for the analysis 
of stable isotope ratios 15 N/14 N. At pre- and postpartum periods, cows fed PP 
and FP presented greater abundance of δ15 N compared to NP (p &lt; 0.05) at pre- 
and postpartum. All three groups showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in 
the postpartum period. The δ15 N values of calves at 30 days of age differed 
between the NP group and PP and FP groups (p &lt; 0.05), with no difference (p 
&gt; 0.05) at 180 days of age. The different gestational supplementation 
strategies influenced isotopic fractionation of nutrients of cows and their 
calves after birth, indicating effects on nutritional metabolism and cumulative 
behavior on isotope abundance related to consumption during gestation."
1100,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver 
diseases, along with steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and is 
associated with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Candidate gene and 
genome-wide association studies have validated the relationships between NAFLD, 
NASH, PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and HFE. The present study utilized five polymorphisms in 
three genes: PNPLA3 (I148M and K434E) TM6SF2 (E167K), and HFE (H63D and C282Y), 
based on undocumented case-control studies in the Saudi Arabian population. A 
total of 95 patients with NAFLD and 78 non-NAFLD subjects were recruited. 
Genomic DNA was isolated, and polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing 
were performed using specific primers for the I148M, K434E, E167K, H63D, and 
C282Y. NAFLD subjects were older when compared to controls and showed the 
significant association (p = 0.0001). Non-significant association was found 
between gender (p = 0.26). However, both weight and BMI were found to be 
associated. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis confirmed that H63D, I148M, and 
K434E polymorphisms were associated. Genotype analysis showed only K434E variant 
was associated with NAFLD and non-NAFLD (OR-2.16; 95% CI: 1.08-4.31; p = 0.02). 
However, other polymorphisms performed with NAFLD and NASH were not associated 
(p &gt; 0.05), and similar analysis was found when ANOVA was performed (p &gt; 
0.05). In conclusion, we confirmed that K434E polymorphism showed a positive 
association in the Saudi population."
1101,"Intravenous paracetamol is a commonly administered analgesic and antipyretic in 
inpatient settings. Paracetamol is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 
followed by conjugating enzymes to mainly glucuronide but to a lesser extent, 
sulphate metabolites, and oxidative metabolites. Single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in the CYP enzymes result in modified enzymatic activity. The present 
study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of SNPs related to paracetamol 
metabolism and principal metabolites in critically ill patients, and those with 
chronic kidney disease. The present study is a cross-sectional study carried out 
in adults (&gt;21 years) requiring intravenous paracetamol as part of their 
standard of care. Details regarding their demographics, and renal and liver 
function tests were collected. Blood was withdrawn for the analysis of 
paracetamol and their metabolites, and the SNPs of key CYP enzymes. 
Paracetamol/paracetamol glucuronide (P/PG), paracetamol/paracetamol sulphate 
(P/PS) and PG/PS were estimated. Acute liver injury (ALI) and renal dysfunction 
were defined using standard definitions. We observed a significant prevalence of 
SNPs in CYP1A2*1C, CYP3A4*3, CYP1A2*1K, CYP1A2*6, CYP2D6*10, and CYP2E1*2 
amongst the 150 study participants. Those with CYP1A2*6 (CC genotype) were 
observed with significantly lower PG and PS concentrations, and a higher P/PS 
ratio; CYP2D6*10 (1/1 genotype) with a significantly lower PG concentration and 
a higher P/PG ratio; and CYP1A2*1K (CC genotype) was observed with a 
significantly higher PG/PS ratio. Good predictive accuracies were observed for 
determining the SNPs with the cut-off concentration of 0.29 μM for PS in 
determining CYP1A2*1K, 0.39 μM for PG and 0.32 μM for PS in determining CYP1A2*6 
genotype, and 0.29 μM for PG in determining the CYP2D6*10 genotype. Patients 
with renal dysfunction were observed with significantly greater concentrations 
of paracetamol, PG and P/PS, and PG/PS ratios, with a lower concentration of PS. 
No significant differences were observed in any of the metabolites or metabolite 
ratios in patients with ALI. We have elucidated the prevalence of key CYP 
enzymes involved in acetaminophen metabolism in our population. Alterations in 
the metabolite concentrations and metabolic ratios were observed with SNPs, and 
in patients with renal dysfunction. Population toxicokinetic studies elucidating 
the dose-response relationship are essential to understand the optimized dose in 
this sub-population."
1102,"Over half of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are unable to achieve blood 
glucose targets despite therapeutic compliance, significantly increasing their 
risk of long-term complications. Discovering ways to identify and properly treat 
these individuals is a critical problem in the field. The arachidonic acid 
metabolite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), has shown great promise as a biomarker of 
β-cell dysfunction in T2D. PGE2 synthesis, secretion, and downstream signaling 
are all upregulated in pancreatic islets isolated from T2D mice and human organ 
donors. In these islets, preventing β-cell PGE2 signaling via a prostaglandin 
EP3 receptor antagonist significantly improves their glucose-stimulated and 
hormone-potentiated insulin secretion response. In this clinical cohort study, 
167 participants, 35 non-diabetic, and 132 with T2D, were recruited from the 
University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. At enrollment, a standard set of 
demographic, biometric, and clinical measurements were performed to quantify 
obesity status and glucose control. C reactive protein was measured to exclude 
acute inflammation/illness, and white cell count (WBC), erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR), and fasting triglycerides were used as markers of 
systemic inflammation. Finally, a plasma sample for research was used to 
determine circulating PGE2 metabolite (PGEM) levels. At baseline, PGEM levels 
were not correlated with WBC and triglycerides, only weakly correlated with ESR, 
and were the strongest predictor of T2D disease status. One year after 
enrollment, blood glucose management was assessed by chart review, with a 
clinically-relevant change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) defined as ≥0.5%. PGEM 
levels were strongly predictive of therapeutic response, independent of age, 
obesity, glucose control, and systemic inflammation at enrollment. Our results 
provide strong support for future research in this area."
1103,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by raised glucose levels 
in the blood, resulting in grave damage over time to various body organs, 
including the nerves, heart, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels. One of its 
therapeutic treatment approaches involves the inhibition of enzymes accountable 
for carbohydrate digestion and absorption. The present work is aimed at 
evaluating the potential of some reported metabolites from Garcinia mangostana 
(mangosteen, Guttiferae) as alpha-amylase inhibitors. Forty compounds were 
assessed for their capacity to inhibit alpha-amylase using in silico studies as 
well as in vitro assays. Molecular docking was carried out to analyze their 
binding capacities in the 3D structure of alpha-amylase (PDB ID: 4GQR). Among 
the tested compounds, 
6-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2,4,6,3',4',6'-hexahydroxybenzophenone (8), 
aromadendrin-8-C-glucoside (5), epicatechin (6), rhodanthenone (4), and 
garcixanthone D (40) had a high XP G.score and a Glide G.score of -12.425, 
-11.855, -11.135, and -11.048 Kcal/mol, respectively. Compound 8 possessed the 
XP and Glide docking score of -12.425 Kcal/mol compared to the reference 
compounds myricetin and acarbose which had an XP and Glide docking score of 
-12.319 and 11.201 Kcal/mol, respectively. It interacted through hydrogen bond 
formations between its hydroxyl groups and the residues His 101, Asp 197, Glu 
233, Asp 300, and His 305, in addition to water bridges and hydrophobic 
interactions. Molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) was 
used to calculate the binding free energy and molecular dynamic studies that 
indicated the stability of the alpha-amylase-compound 8 complex during the 100 
ns simulation in comparison with myricetin- and acarbose-alpha-amylase 
complexes. Additionally, the in vitro alpha-amylase inhibition assay findings 
validated the in silico study's findings. This could further validate the 
potential of G. mangostana as a candidate for diabetes management."
1104,"A known association exists between exposure to gestational diabetes mellitus 
(GDM) and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in GDM-exposed offspring compared to 
those without GDM exposure. This association has not been assessed previously in 
mothers with pregnancies complicated by GDM. A total of 137 mother-child dyads 
with an index pregnancy 4-10 years before study enrollment were included. 
Clinical data and whole blood samples were collected and quantified to obtain 
DNA methylation (DNAm) estimates using the Illumina MethylEPIC 850K array in 
mothers and offspring. DNAm age and age acceleration were evaluated using the 
Horvath and Hannum clocks. Multivariable linear regression models were performed 
to determine the association between EAA and leptin, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR. Mothers with 
a GDM and non-GDM pregnancy had strong correlations between chronological age 
and DNAm age (r &gt; 0.70). Offspring of GDM mothers had moderate to strong 
correlations, whereas offspring of non-GDM mothers had moderate correlations 
between chronological age and DNAm age. Association analyses revealed a 
significant association between EAA and fasting insulin in offspring (FDR &lt; 
0.05), while HDL-C was the only metabolic marker significantly associated with 
EAA in mothers (FDR &lt; 0.05). Mothers in the GDM group had a higher predicted 
epigenetic age and age acceleration than mothers in the non-GDM group. The 
association between EAA with elevated fasting insulin in offspring and elevated 
HDL-C in mothers suggests possible biomarkers that can better elucidate the 
effects of exposure to a GDM pregnancy and future cardiometabolic outcomes."
1105,"The interaction of malaria parasites with their human host is extensively 
studied, yet only few studies reported how P. falciparum infection affects 
urinary metabolite profiles and how this is associated with immunity. We present 
a longitudinal study of the urinary metabolic profiles of twenty healthy 
Africans with lifelong exposure to malaria and five malaria-naïve Europeans, who 
were all challenged with direct venous inoculation of live P. falciparum 
sporozoïtes (PfSPZ) and followed up until they developed symptoms or became 
thick blood smear positive (TBS). Urine samples were collected before and at 2, 
5, 9 and 11 days post challenge and were analysed. Upon infection, all Europeans 
became TBS positive, while Africans showed either a delay in time to 
parasitaemia or controlled infection. Our metabolic data showed that Europeans 
and Africans had distinct alterations in metabolite patterns, with changes 
mostly seen on days 5 and 9 post PfSPZ infection, and more prominently in 
Europeans. Within the African group, the levels of formate, urea, 
trimethylamine, threonine, choline, myo-inositol and acetate were significantly 
higher in TBS positive whereas the levels of pyruvate, 3-methylhistidine and 
dimethylglycine were significantly lower in individuals who remained TBS 
negative. Notably, before inoculation with PfSPZ, a group of metabolites 
including phenylacetylglutamine can potentially be used to predict parasitaemia 
control among Africans. Taken together, this study highlights the difference in 
urinary metabolic changes in response to malaria infection as a consequence of 
lifelong exposure to malaria and that change detectable before challenge might 
predict the control of parasitaemia in malaria-endemic areas."
1106,"The liver plays an important role in whole-body glucose homeostasis by taking up 
glucose from and releasing glucose into the blood circulation. In the 
postprandial state, excess glucose in the blood circulation is stored in 
hepatocytes as glycogen. In the postabsorptive state, the liver produces glucose 
by breaking down glycogen and from noncarbohydrate precursors such as lactate. 
In metabolic diseases such as diabetes, these processes are dysregulated, 
resulting in abnormal blood glucose levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are noninvasive techniques that give 
unique insight into different aspects of glucose metabolism, such as 
glycogenesis, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis, in the liver in vivo. Using 
these techniques, liver glucose metabolism has been studied in regard to a 
variety of interventions, such as fasting, meal intake, and exercise. Moreover, 
deviations from normal hepatic glucose metabolism have been investigated in both 
patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, as well as the effects of antidiabetic 
medications. This review provides an overview of current MR techniques to 
measure hepatic glucose metabolism and the insights obtained by the application 
of these techniques in the healthy and diabetic liver."
1107,"The quantitative level of steroid hormones (SHs) in some body fluids have been 
accepted for clinical diagnosis, whereas their distribution in aqueous humor 
(AH) is unknown yet. Herein, a profiling study was conducted with a total of 171 
AH and 107 plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC MS/MS). For the first time, six kinds of SHs in AH were 
quantitatively estimated, and their abundances were ranked at cortisol (F), 
corticosterone (COR), androstenedione (A2), and 11-deoxycortisol (11DOC). The 
corresponding abundance of all SHs in AH was significantly lower than those in 
plasma, while there was a lack of a proportional relationship with the abundance 
of plasma SHs. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, the most abundant plasma SH, was 
undetectable in AH, implying that the blood-aqueous barrier might specifically 
block its transferral. Axial myopia generally results from many factors 
throughout the entire eye from tissues and molecules; furthermore, the 
correlation of AH SHs and axial myopia was assessed to look for their indication 
in such myopia. The panel with five kinds of AH SHs (F, COR, CORT, ALD and A2) 
was functional as a discriminator for axial myopia and control. The abundance of 
SHs, therefore, has a specific distribution in AH and can potentially contribute 
to axial myopia."
1108,"This research focused on establishing a hierarchy concerning the influence of 
various biological markers and body composition parameters on preventing, 
diagnosing and managing Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). Our cross-sectional cohort 
study included 104 subjects without any atherosclerotic antecedent pathology, 
organized in two groups (with and without MetS). All participants underwent 
clinical and anthropometric measurements, DEXA investigation and blood tests for 
all MetS criteria, together with adiponectin, leptin, insulin, uric acid and 
CRP. Based on mathematical logic, we calculated a normalized sensitivity score 
to compare the predictive power of biomarkers and parameters associated with 
MetS, upon the prevalence of MetS. Patients with MetS report higher levels of 
uric acid (p = 0.02), CRP (p = 0.012) and lower levels of adiponectin (p = 
0.025) than patients without MetS. The top three biological markers with the 
highest predictive power of the prevalence of the disease are HDL, insulin, and 
adiponectin:leptin ratio, and the top three body composition parameters are 
trunk fat-free percentage, waist-height ratio and trunk fat percentage. Their 
high sensitivity scores differentiate them from all the other markers analysed 
in the study. Our findings report relevant scores for estimating the importance 
of cardiometabolic risks in the prevalence of MetS. The high rank of protective 
markers, HDL and trunk fat-free percentage, suggest that positive effects have a 
stronger association with the prevalence of MetS, than negative ones do. 
Therefore, this risk stratification study provides important support for 
prevention and management programs regarding MetS."
1109,"Melatonin rescues uterine blood flow and fetal body weight in a seasonal 
dependent manner within a nutrient restriction bovine model. We sought to 
identify the effects of nutrient restriction, melatonin, and sampling time on 
maternal and fetal amino acids, and placental nutrient transporters. Pregnant 
heifers received adequate or restricted nutrition, and 20 mg of melatonin or 
placebo from gestational days 160-240 over two seasons. On day 240 maternal and 
fetal blood, amnion, and placentomes were collected. Amino acid concentrations 
were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Caruncle and cotyledon 
tissues were assessed for nutrient transporter density by qPCR. Data were 
analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS for fixed effects. In fall, melatonin 
rescued effects of nutrient restriction on System N, Anion, and total maternal 
amino acids. Furthermore, melatonin rescued effects of nutrient restriction on 
Systems A, N, Br, Bo, and essential amnion amino acids. In summer, melatonin 
rescued effects of nutrient restriction in Systems Br and Bo maternal amino 
acids. Furthermore, melatonin rescued effects of nutrient restriction on 
caruncle SLC38A10 and SLC38A2. Melatonin rescued effects of nutrient restriction 
in a seasonal dependent manner. These data align with previous studies 
suggesting melatonin is a more effective therapeutic in summer months."
1110,"Synthetic cathinones are one important group amongst new psychoactive substances 
(NPS) and limited information is available regarding their toxicokinetics and 
-dynamics. Over the past few years, nontargeted toxicometabolomics has been 
increasingly used to study compound-related effects of NPS to identify important 
exogenous and endogenous biomarkers. In this study, the effects of the synthetic 
cathinone PCYP (2-cyclohexyl-1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-ethanone) on in vitro 
and in vivo metabolomes were investigated. Pooled human-liver microsomes and 
blood and urine of male Wistar rats were used to generate in vitro and in vivo 
data, respectively. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography and 
high-resolution mass spectrometry using an untargeted metabolomics workflow. 
Statistical evaluation was performed using univariate and multivariate 
statistics. In total, sixteen phase I and one phase II metabolite of PCYP could 
be identified as exogenous biomarkers. Five endogenous biomarkers (e.g., 
adenosine and metabolites of tryptophan metabolism) related to PCYP intake could 
be identified in rat samples. The present data on the exogenous biomarker of 
PCYP are crucial for setting up analytical screening procedures. The data on the 
endogenous biomarker are important for further studies to better understand the 
physiological changes associated with cathinone abuse but may also serve in the 
future as additional markers for an intake."
1111,"After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the molecular phenoreversion of the immunological 
response and its associated metabolic dysregulation are required for a full 
recovery of the patient. This process is patient-dependent due to the manifold 
possibilities induced by virus severity, its phylogenic evolution and the 
vaccination status of the population. We have here investigated the natural 
history of COVID-19 disease at the molecular level, characterizing the metabolic 
and immunological phenoreversion over time in large cohorts of hospitalized 
severe patients (n = 886) and non-hospitalized recovered patients that 
self-reported having passed the disease (n = 513). Non-hospitalized recovered 
patients do not show any metabolic fingerprint associated with the disease or 
immune alterations. Acute patients are characterized by the metabolic and 
lipidomic dysregulation that accompanies the exacerbated immunological response, 
resulting in a slow recovery time with a maximum probability of around 62 days. 
As a manifestation of the heterogeneity in the metabolic phenoreversion, age and 
severity become factors that modulate their normalization time which, in turn, 
correlates with changes in the atherogenesis-associated chemokine MCP-1. Our 
results are consistent with a model where the slow metabolic normalization in 
acute patients results in enhanced atherosclerotic risk, in line with the recent 
observation of an elevated number of cardiovascular episodes found in 
post-COVID-19 cohorts."
1112,"Previous studies have reported that different blood groups are associated with 
the risk of chronic degenerative diseases that mainly involve inflammation and 
neoplastic processes. We investigate the relationship between blood groups and 
the erythroprotective effect of extracts from Navicula incerta against oxidative 
damage as a proposal to develop drugs designed for people with a specific blood 
type related to chronic pathology. The study was carried out through the 
elucidation of the erythroprotective potential, anti-inflammatory and 
antiproliferative activity of Navicula incerta. Research suggests that the 
presence or absence of certain blood groups increases or decreases the abilities 
of certain phytochemicals to inhibit oxidative stress, which is related to the 
systemic inflammatory response involved in the development of different types of 
cancer. The pigment-rich extracts from Navicula incerta inhibit ROO•- induced 
oxidative stress in human erythrocytes on the A RhD+ve antigen without 
compromising the structure of the cell membrane. This result is very important, 
since the A antigen is related to the susceptibility of contracting prostate 
cancer. Similarly, it was possible to inhibit the proliferation of cervical 
(HeLa) and prostate (PC-3) carcinoma. The combinatorial analysis of different 
biological activities can help design phytochemicals as new candidates for 
preventive drugs treating the chronic degenerative diseases associated with a 
specific blood group."
1113,"Eicosanoids are lipid mediators generated from arachidonic acid with pro- and 
anti-inflammatory properties. Despite these lipid mediators being known for 
decades, quantitative determination in biological samples is still challenging 
due to low abundance, instability, the existence of regio- and stereoisomers, 
and a wide polarity range that hampers chromatographic separation. In this 
study, we developed a supercritical fluid chromatography mass spectrometry 
(SFC-MS) platform for the quantification of relevant eicosanoids. Application of 
a chiral amylose-based column and modifier combination of 
2-propanol/acetonitrile offered separation and sufficient resolution of 11 
eicosanoids (5-, 12-, 15-HETE, PGB1, LTB4, t-LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, PGE2, PGD2, 
PGF2α, TxB2) with baseline separation of isobaric analytes within 12 min. The 
method was validated in terms of range (78-2500 ng/mL), linearity, accuracy, 
precision, and recovery according to EMA guidelines. Finally, we confirmed the 
method's applicability by quantifying eicosanoid levels in human primary blood 
cells. In conclusion, we present a validated SFC-MS method for the determination 
of relevant eicosanoids in biological samples with a wide range of polarity 
while maintaining baseline separation of isobars, which allows coupling to a 
single quadrupole mass detector."
1114,"Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)-a microbial metabolite derived from the 
hepatic-gut axis-is linked to inflammation, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which is 
largely hepatically expressed, blocks low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor 
recycling, also leading to hyperlipidemia. The primary objective of this study 
was to investigate a previously hypothesized potential relationship between TMAO 
and PCSK9 in order to explore novel mechanisms linking TMAO and CVD risk. 
African American adults at risk of CVD living in the Washington DC area were 
recruited to participate in a cross-sectional community-based study (n = 60, 93% 
female, BMI = 33). Fasting levels of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., interleukin 
(IL)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-8), TMAO, and PCSK9 
were measured using Luminex and ELISA, respectively. Univariate and multivariate 
linear regression analyses and structural equation mediation analyses were 
conducted using STATA. All models were adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and 
atherosclerotic CVD risk score (ASCVD). A significant association between TMAO 
and PCSK9 was identified (β = 0.31, p = 0.02). Both TMAO and PCSK9 were 
significantly associated with IL-8 (TMAO: β = 0.45, p = 0.00; PCSK9: β = 0.23, p 
= 0.05) in adjusted models. Mediation analysis indicated that 34.77% of the 
relationship between TMAO and PCSK9 was explained by IL-8. Our findings indicate 
a potential PCSK9-involved pathway for TMAO and CVD risk, with potential 
mediation by IL-8."
1115,"This study aimed to evaluate whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms of 
ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) and solute carrier family 2 
member 9 (SLC2A9) affect individual blood uric acid levels using pyrosequencing. 
ABCG2 (rs2231142, rs72552713, rs2231137), SLC2A9 (rs3734553, rs3733591, 
rs16890979), and individual uric acid levels were prospectively analyzed in 250 
healthy young Korean male participants. Prominent differences in uric acid 
levels of the alleles were observed in the SLC2A9 rs3733591 polymorphism: 
wild-type (AA) vs. heterozygote (AG), 0.7 mg/dL (p &lt; 0.0001); AA vs. mutant 
type (GG), 1.32 mg/dL (p &lt; 0.0001); and AG vs. GG, 0.62 mg/dL (p &lt; 0.01). 
In ABCG2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the statistically significant 
differences in uric acid levels were only found in rs2231142 between CC vs. AA 
(1.06 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.001), and CC vs. CA (0.59 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.01). Serum uric 
acid levels based on the ABCG2 and SLC2A9 diplotype groups were also compared. 
The uric acid levels were the lowest in the CC/AA diplotype and highest in the 
AA/AG diplotype. In addition, the SNP SLC2A9 rs3733591 tended to increase the 
uric acid levels when the ABCG2 rs2231142 haplotypes were fixed. In conclusion, 
both the ABCG2 rs2231142 and SLC2A9 rs3733591 polymorphisms may additively 
elevate blood uric acid levels."
1116,"Background: In the US in 2021, 76,080 kidney cancers are expected and &gt;80% 
are renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Along with excess fat, metabolic dysfunction 
is implicated in RCC etiology. To identify RCC-associated metabolites, we 
conducted a 1:1 matched case-control study nested within the Prostate, Lung, 
Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Methods: We measured 522 
serum metabolites in 267 cases/control pairs. Cases were followed for a median 
7.1 years from blood draw to diagnosis. Using conditional logistic regression, 
we computed adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
comparing risk between 90th and 10th percentiles of log metabolite intensity, 
with the significance threshold at a false discovery rate &lt;0.20. Results: 
Four metabolites were inversely associated with risk of RCC during 
follow-up-C38:4 PI, C34:0 PC, C14:0 SM, and C16:1 SM (ORs ranging from 
0.33-0.44). Two were positively associated with RCC risk-C3-DC-CH3 carnitine and 
C5 carnitine (ORs = 2.84 and 2.83, respectively). These results were robust when 
further adjusted for metabolic risk factors (body mass index (BMI), physical 
activity, diabetes/hypertension history). Metabolites associated with RCC had 
weak correlations (|r| &lt; 0.2) with risk factors of BMI, physical activity, 
smoking, alcohol, and diabetes/hypertension history. In mutually adjusted 
models, three metabolites (C38:4 PI, C14:0 SM, and C3-DC-CH3 carnitine) were 
independently associated with RCC risk. Conclusions: Serum concentrations of six 
metabolites were associated with RCC risk, and three of these had independent 
associations from the mutually adjusted model. These metabolites may point 
toward new biological pathways of relevance to this malignancy."
1117,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance. Few 
randomized controlled trials (RCT) compared myoinositol (MI) with metformin 
(MET) regarding insulin resistance in PCOS. This was an open-label six-month RCT 
in women with PCOS (n = 45) with interventions MI 4 g/day or MET 2 g/day. 
Primary outcome was the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 
(HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes were fasting glucose, weight, cycle length, 
lipids, testosterone, adverse effects, quality of life, and depression scores. 
Median age was 26 years. Body mass was index was 34.4 kg/m2. HOMA-IR was 
unchanged during MI (p = 0.31) and MET (p = 0.11) (MI vs. MET, p = 0.09). Median 
fasting glucose changed +0.2 mmol/L during MI (p &lt; 0.001) and -0.1 mmol/L 
during MET (p = 0.04) (MI vs. MET p &lt; 0.001). Median weight changed -2.3 kg 
during MI (p = 0.98) and -6.1 kg during MET (p &lt; 0.001) (MI vs. MET, p = 
0.02). Median cycle length decreased nine days during MI (p = 0.03) and 13 days 
during MET (p = 0.03) (MI vs. MET, p = 0.93). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
changed +0.1 mmol/L during MET (p = 0.04) (MI vs. MET, p = 0.07). All other 
blood parameters and scores of quality of life and depression remained unchanged 
during MI and MET (all p &gt; 0.06) (MI vs. MET, all p &gt; 0.27). Adverse 
effects appeared in four women during MI and 16 women during MET (MI vs. MET, p 
= 0.001). In conclusion, there was no effect on the metabolic outcomes during 
MI, but positive effects on fasting blood glucose, weight, and HDL during MET. 
The effect on cycle length was comparable during MI and MET. Adverse effects 
were less frequent during MI."
1118,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine-metabolic disorder of unknown 
etiology. Hyperandrogenism (HA) is the main diagnostic criteria for PCOS, in 
addition to being a risk factor for developing several disorders throughout the 
patient's life, including pregnancy. However, the impact on offspring is little 
known. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of maternal HA 
on glucose metabolism and hepatic lipid accumulation in adult offspring. We used 
Balb/c mice treated with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for 20 consecutive days. 
The ovary of DHEA-treated mice showed hemorrhagic bodies, an increased number of 
atretic follicles, and greater expression of genes related to meiotic cell cycle 
and DNA repair. The DHEA offspring (O-DHEA) had low birth weight, and some pups 
showed malformations. However, O-DHEA individuals gained weight rapidly, and the 
differences between them and the control group became significantly greater in 
adulthood. Moreover, O-DHEA presented higher serum glucose after a 6 h fast and 
a larger area under glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance test curves. Oil 
Red O staining showed a more significant accumulation of fat in the liver but no 
changes in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels. In summary, our results 
show that HA, induced by DHEA, affects gene expression in oocyte, which in turn 
generates defects in embryonic development, insulin resistance, and alteration 
in hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism in O-DHEA, thereby increasing 
the risk of developing metabolic diseases."
1119,"The effects of spirulina consumption added in foods were investigated in two 
crossover clinical trials (n = 13 different healthy adults). In Trial-1 adults 
consumed cookies with-and-without spirulina (3.12 g per 100 g final product; 2.5 
g spirulina per 50 g available carbohydrates) according to glycemic index (GI) 
methodology. In Trial-2, adults consumed 4 g, 6 g, and 8 g spirulina as beverage 
diluted in 50 g D-glucose vs. 50 g plain D-glucose. Capillary blood glucose 
samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min and blood pressure 
(BP) was measured at beginning and end of each visit in both trials. Trial-1: 
both cookies with and without spirulina provided medium GI values (59 and 60, 
respectively, on glucose-scale), but no significant differences were found for 
BP. Trial-2: both 4 g and 8 g spirulina lowered postprandial glucose at 120 min 
(95% CI: -1.64 to -16.12 and -1.23 to -15.87, respectively). The results 
explained 29% of variation. Only 8 g spirulina decreased significantly 90-120 
min area under the curve (AUC) for glucose and systolic BP (-4%). No differences 
were found for fasting glucose. Adding spirulina to cookies did not affect 
glucose responses and BP. Only 8 g provided significantly lower 90-120 min-AUC 
for glucose and BP compared to 4 g, 6 g-and-D-glucose, indicating advantages to 
glycemic control and hypertension."
1120,"One of the most frequently consumed beverages by Korean adults is 3-in-1 coffee 
(mixed coffee) with sugar and creamer. Hence, understanding the effect of 
sugar-sweetened coffee (SSC) consumption on blood sugar levels in patients with 
diabetes mellitus (DM) is important. This study was conducted using the Korea 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2008 to 2020. In 
total, 5671 patients with DM were included in the analysis. Coffee consumption 
patterns were assessed using a 24 h recall. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were used to evaluate whether patients reached the 
glycemic control targets defined by the Korean Diabetes Association. In total, 
46.57% of patients with DM included in this analysis consumed SSC. Patients who 
frequently consumed SSC had significantly higher FBG and HbA1c levels than those 
who did not (both p for trend &lt;0.01). In a multivariate logistic regression 
model, the odds ratios of not achieving the target FBG and HbA1c levels were 
1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.48, p for trend = 0.01) and 1.29 (95% 
CI: 1.05-1.58, p for trend = 0.009), respectively. Frequent consumption of SSC 
can cause difficulty in FBG and HbA1c management in patients with DM."
1121,"Ovarian cancer (OC), and particularly epithelial OC (EOC), is an increasing 
challenge for women. Circulating lipids play different roles in the occurrence 
and development of OC, but no causal relationship has been confirmed. We used 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the genetic effects of 
circulating Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), Apolipoprotein B (APOB), high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and 
triglyc-erides (TG) on EOC risks based on summary data obtained from the UK 
Biobank and the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We used the 
inverse-variance weight as the main statistical method and the MR-Egger, 
weighted median, and MR-PRESSO for sensitivity analysis. A 1-SD increment in HDL 
gave odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of OR = 0.80 (95% CI: 
0.69-0.93), OR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.66-0.90), and OR = 0.76 (95% CI: 0.63-0.90) for 
low malignant potential OC (LMPOC), low-grade low malignant OC (LGLMSOC), and 
low malignant serous OC (LMSOC), respectively. Genetic liability due to TG was 
associated with an increased risk of LGLMSOC and LGSOC and a suggestive 
association with an increased risk of LMSOC (p = 0.001, p = 0.007, and p = 
0.027, respectively). Circulating HDL was negatively associated with the risk of 
LMPOC, LGLMSOC, and LMSOC, while elevated circulating TG levels genetically 
predicted an increased risk of LGLMSOC and LGSOC. Further research is needed to 
investigate the causal effects of lipids on EOC and potential intervention and 
therapeutic targets."
1122,"Sustained night shift work is associated with various adverse health risks, 
including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and 
susceptibility to infectious respiratory diseases. The extent of these adverse 
health effects, however, seems to greatly vary between night shift workers, yet 
the underlying reasons and the mechanisms underlying these interindividual 
differences remain poorly understood. Metabolomics assays in the blood have 
recently gained much attention as a minimally invasive biomarker platform 
capturing information predictive of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In 
this cross-sectional study, we explored and compared the metabolic profiles of 
1010 night shift workers and 1010 age- and sex-matched day workers (non-shift 
workers) from the Lifelines Cohort Study. The metabolic profiles were determined 
using the 1H-NMR Nightingale platform for the quantification of 250 parameters 
of metabolism, including routine lipids, extensive lipoprotein subclasses, fatty 
acid composition, and various low-molecular metabolites, including amino acids, 
ketone bodies, and gluconeogenesis-related metabolites. Night shift workers had 
an increased BMI (26.6 vs. 25.9 kg/m2) compared with day workers (non-shift 
workers) in both sexes, were slightly more likely to be ever smokers (only in 
males) (54% vs. 46%), worked on average 5.9 ± 3.7 night shifts per month, and 
had been working in night shifts for 18.3 ± 10.5 years on average. We observed 
changes in several metabolic markers in male night shift workers compared with 
non-shift workers, but no changes were observed in women. In men, we observed 
higher levels of glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), triglycerides, and fatty acids 
compared with non-shift workers. The changes were seen in the ratio of 
triglycerides and cholesterol(esters) to total lipids in different sizes of VLDL 
particles. Glycoprotein acetyls (GlycAs) are of particular interest as markers 
since they are known as biomarkers for low-grade chronic inflammation. When the 
analyses were adjusted for BMI, no significant associations were observed. 
Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between night 
shift work and metabolic profiles, particularly with respect to the role of sex 
and BMI in this relationship."
1123,"Blood pressure development plays a major role in both the etiology and 
prediction of gestational hypertensive disorders. Metabolomics might serve as a 
tool to identify underlying metabolic mechanisms in the etiology of hypertension 
in pregnancy and lead to the identification of novel metabolites useful for the 
prediction of gestational hypertensive disorders. In a population-based, 
prospective cohort study among 803 pregnant women, liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry was used to determine serum concentrations of amino-acids, 
non-esterified fatty acids, phospholipids and carnitines in early pregnancy. 
Blood pressure was measured in each trimester of pregnancy. Information on 
gestational hypertensive disorders was obtained from medical records. Higher 
individual metabolite concentrations of the diacyl-phosphatidylcholines and 
acyl-lysophosphatidylcholines group were associated with higher systolic blood 
pressure throughout pregnancy (Federal Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values 
&lt; 0.05). Higher concentrations of one non-esterified fatty acid were 
associated with higher diastolic blood pressure throughout pregnancy 
(FDR-adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05). Using penalized regression, we identified 12 
individual early-pregnancy amino-acids, non-esterified fatty acids, 
diacyl-phosphatidylcholines and acyl-carnitines and the glutamine/glutamic acid 
ratio, that were jointly associated with larger changes in systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure from first to third trimester. These metabolites did 
not improve the prediction of gestational hypertensive disorders in addition to 
clinical markers. In conclusion, altered early pregnancy serum metabolite 
profiles mainly characterized by changes in non-esterified fatty acids and 
phospholipids metabolites are associated with higher gestational blood pressure 
throughout pregnancy within the physiological ranges. These findings are 
important from an etiological perspective and, after further replication, might 
improve the early identification of women at increased risk of gestational 
hypertensive disorders."
1124,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become a leading cause of end-stage renal failure 
worldwide. The goal of the current study was to examine the protective effects 
of chitosan-loaded p-Coumaric acid nanoparticles (PCNPs) in nephrotoxicity 
induced by streptozotocin (STZ). Because of the antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, 
and antioxidant properties of PCNPs, the development of DN may be considerably 
decreased. In this study, the rats received a single intraperitoneal injection 
(i.p.) of STZ (45 mg/kg) to induce DN. PCNPs were given orally 80 mg/kg b.w to 
the rats for a duration of four weeks. Body weight, kidney weight, blood 
glucose, and insulin levels were measured at the end of the experiment. Serum 
and urine parameters were also examined, along with the histological, 
immunobiological, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
expression of the nephrotic rats. To comprehend the impact of PCNPs, the 
expression patterns of the kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) and glucose 
transporter-2 (GLUT-2) were evaluated. Administration of PCNPs significantly 
increased body weight, decreased kidney weight and also ameliorated blood 
glucose levels in the nephropathic rats. The administration of PCNPs also 
reverted the levels of urea, serum creatinine, urinary NAG, β-glucuronidase and 
albumin to near-normal levels. The administration of PCNPs also caused the 
levels of serum and urine parameters to return to near-normal levels. 
Additionally, the PCNP-treated rats had markedly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, and KIM-1 
expressions as well as enhanced GLUT-2 mRNA expression. Our findings clearly 
showed that PCNP administration prevents the onset of DN in rats by lowering 
hyperglycemia, decreasing inflammation, and improving the expression of GLUT-2 
mRNA in nephropathic rats."
1125,"(1) Background: This work aims to investigate the metabolomic changes in 
PIGinH11 pigs and investigate differential compounds as potential therapeutic 
targets for metabolic diseases. (2) Methods: PIGinH11 pigs were established with 
a CRISPR/Cas9 system. PNPLA3I148M, hIAPP, and GIPRdn were knocked in the H11 
locus of the pig genome. The differential metabolites between and within groups 
were compared at baseline and two months after high-fat-high-sucrose diet 
induction. (3) Results: 72.02% of the 815 detected metabolites were affected by 
the transgenic effect. Significantly increased metabolites included isoleucine, 
tyrosine, methionine, oxoglutaric acid, acylcarnitine, glucose, sphinganines, 
ceramides, and phosphatidylserines, while fatty acids and conjugates, 
phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and sphingomyelins were 
decreased. Lower expression of GPAT3 and higher expression of PNPLA3I148M 
decreased the synthesis of diacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholines. Accumulated 
ceramides that block Akt signaling and decrease hyocholic acid and 
lysophosphatidylcholines might be the main reason for increased blood glucose in 
PIGinH11 pigs, which was consistent with metabolomic changes in patients. (4) 
Conclusions: Through serum metabolomics and lipidomics studies, significant 
changes in obesity and diabetes-related biomarkers were detected in PIGinH11 
pigs. Excessive fatty acids β-oxidation interfered with glucose and amino acids 
catabolism and reduced phosphatidylcholines. Decreased hyocholic acid, 
lysophosphatidylcholine, and increased ceramides exacerbated insulin resistance 
and elevated blood glucose. Phosphatidylserines were also increased, which might 
promote chronic inflammation by activating macrophages."
1126,"Patients treated for traumatic brain injury (TBI) are in metabolic crises 
because of the trauma and underfeeding. We utilized fractional gluconeogenesis 
(fGNG) to assess nutritional adequacy in ad libitum-fed and 
calorically-restricted rats following TBI. Male Sprague-Dawley individually 
housed rats 49 days of age were randomly assigned into four groups: ad libitum 
(AL) fed control (AL-Con, sham), AL plus TBI (AL+TBI), caloric restriction (CR) 
control (CR-Con, sham), and CR plus TBI (CR+TBI). From days 1-7 animals were 
given AL access to food and water containing 6% deuterium oxide (D2O). On day 8, 
a pre-intervention blood sample was drawn from each animal, and TBI, sham 
injury, and CR protocols were initiated. On day 22, the animals were euthanized, 
and blood was collected to measure fGNG. Pre-intervention, there was no 
significant difference in fGNG among groups (p ≥ 0.05). There was a significant 
increase in fGNG due to caloric restriction, independent of TBI (p ≤ 0.05). In 
addition, fGNG may provide a real-time, personalized biomarker for assessing 
patient dietary caloric needs."
1127,"Organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), encoded by the solute 
carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 gene (SLCO1B1), is highly 
expressed in the liver and transports several endogenous metabolites into the 
liver, including statins. Previous studies have not investigated the association 
of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 variant with the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or 
determined the metabolite signature of the C allele of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 
(SLCO1B1 rs4149056-C allele) in a large randomly selected population. SLCO1B1 
rs4149056-C inhibits OATP1B1 transporter and is associated with increased levels 
of blood simvastatin concentrations. Our study is to first to show that SLCO1B1 
rs4149056 variant is not significantly associated with the risk of T2D, 
suggesting that simvastatin has a direct effect on the risk of T2D. 
Additionally, we investigated the effects of SLCO1B1 rs4149056-C on plasma 
metabolite concentrations in 1373 participants on simvastatin treatment and in 
1368 age- and body-mass index (BMI)-matched participants without any statin 
treatment. We found 31 novel metabolites significantly associated with SLCO1B1 
rs4149056-C in the participants on simvastatin treatment and in the participants 
without statin treatment. Simvastatin decreased concentrations of dicarboxylic 
acids, such as docosadioate and dodecanedioate, that may increase beta- and 
peroxisomal oxidation and increased the turnover of cholesterol into bile acids, 
resulting in a decrease in steroidogenesis due to limited availability of 
cholesterol for steroid synthesis. Our findings suggest that simvastatin exerts 
its effects on the lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
concentrations through several distinct pathways in the carriers of SLCO1B1 
rs4149056-C, including dicarboxylic acids, bile acids, steroids, and 
glycerophospholipids."
1128,"While green solvents are being implemented in the fabrication of polyvinylidene 
fluoride (PVDF) membranes, most are not compatible with the vapor-induced phase 
separation (VIPS) process for which relatively low dissolution temperatures are 
required. Additionally, preparing antifouling green membranes in one step by 
blending the polymer with an antifouling material before inducing phase 
separation remains extremely challenging due to the solubility issues. Here, the 
green solvent triethyl phosphate (TEP) was used to solubilize both PVDF and a 
copolymer (synthesized from styrene monomer and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl 
ether methacrylate). VIPS was then used, yielding symmetric bi-continuous 
microfiltration membranes. For a 2 wt% copolymer content in the casting 
solution, the corresponding membrane P2 showed a homogeneous and dense surface 
distribution of the copolymer, resulting in a high hydration capacity (&gt;900 
mg/cm3) and effective resistance to biofouling during the adsorption tests using 
bovine serum albumin, Escherichia coli or whole blood, with a measured fouling 
reduction of 80%, 89% and 90%, respectively. Cyclic filtration tests using 
bacteria highlighted the competitive antifouling properties of the membranes 
with a flux recovery ratio after two water/bacterial solution cycles higher than 
70%, a reversible flux decline ratio of about 62% and an irreversible flux 
decline ratio of 28%. Finally, these green antifouling membranes were shown to 
be stable despite several weeks of immersion in water."
1129,"Nanoparticles are explored as drug carriers with the promise for the treatment 
of diseases to increase the efficacy and also reduce side effects sometimes seen 
with conventional drugs. To accomplish this goal, drugs are encapsulated in or 
conjugated to the nanocarriers and selectively delivered to their targets. 
Potential applications include immunization, the delivery of anti-cancer drugs 
to tumours, antibiotics to infections, targeting resistant bacteria, and 
delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. Despite this great promise and 
potential, drug delivery systems have yet to be established, mainly due to their 
limitations in physical instability and rapid clearance by the host's immune 
response. Recent interest has been taken in using red blood cells (RBC) as drug 
carriers due to their naturally long circulation time, flexible structure, and 
direct access to many target sites. This includes coating of nanoparticles with 
the membrane of red blood cells, and the fabrication and manipulation of 
liposomes made of the red blood cells' cytoplasmic membrane. The properties of 
these erythrocyte liposomes, such as charge and elastic properties, can be tuned 
through the incorporation of synthetic lipids to optimize physical properties 
and the loading efficiency and retention of different drugs. Specificity can be 
established through the anchorage of antigens and antibodies in the liposomal 
membrane to achieve targeted delivery. Although still at an early stage, this 
erythrocyte-based platform shows first promising results in vitro and in animal 
studies. However, their full potential in terms of increased efficacy and side 
effect minimization still needs to be explored in vivo."
1130,"Loop and thiazide diuretics have been cornerstones of clinical management of 
hypertension and fluid overload conditions for more than five decades. The hunt 
for their molecular targets led to the discovery of cation-chloride 
cotransporters (CCCs) that catalyze electroneutral movement of Cl- together with 
Na+ and/or K+. CCCs consist of two 1 Na+-1 K+-2 Cl- (NKCC1-2), one 1 Na+-1 Cl- 
(NCC), and four 1 K+-1 Cl- (KCC1-4) transporters in human. CCCs are fundamental 
in trans-epithelia ion secretion and absorption, homeostasis of intracellular 
Cl- concentration and cell volume, and regulation of neuronal excitability. 
Malfunction of NKCC2 and NCC leads to abnormal salt and water retention in the 
kidney and, consequently, imbalance in electrolytes and blood pressure. 
Mutations in KCC2 and KCC3 are associated with brain disorders due to 
impairments in regulation of excitability and possibly cell volume of neurons. A 
recent surge of structures of CCCs have defined their dimeric architecture, 
their ion binding sites, their conformational changes associated with ion 
translocation, and the mechanisms of action of loop diuretics and small molecule 
inhibitors. These breakthroughs now set the stage to expand CCC pharmacology 
beyond loop and thiazide diuretics, developing the next generation of diuretics 
with improved potency and specificity. Beyond drugging renal-specific CCCs, 
brain-penetrable therapeutics are sorely needed to target CCCs in the nervous 
system for the treatment of neurological disorders and psychiatric conditions."
1131,"Background and Objectives: Diabetic foot (DF) development is driven by complex 
interactions of hyperglycemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress (OS). We aimed 
to investigate OS and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with DF and their 
potential to improve early diagnosis and management of DF. Materials and 
Methods: The prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
total oxidative status (TOS), total sulfhydryl groups (SHG), routine biochemical 
parameters, and complete blood count were determined in 42 patients with type-2 
DM, of which 23 patients had DF, while 19 patients were without DF 
complications. The neutrophils-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was evaluated as a 
biomarker of inflammation. Results: Patients with DF had significantly higher (p 
&lt; 0.05) PAB levels (170 ± 33.9 U/L) compared to those without DF 
complications (142 ± 31.3 U/L). In addition, patients with DF had significantly 
reduced SOD activities (p &lt; 0.01). NLR values were significantly higher in 
the DF group (median: 2.8; interquartile range: 2.0-4.3) than in the group 
without DF (median: 1.4; interquartile range: 1.4-2.1; p &lt; 0.01). A positive 
correlation was found between the PAB and NLR index (r = 0.449; p &lt; 0.05). 
The diagnostic accuracy of both PAB (AUC = 0.741; p &lt; 0.01) and NLR (AUC = 
0.760; p &lt; 0.01) was estimated as acceptable. Conclusions: In conclusion, the 
development of DF is associated with enhanced OS and inflammation processes. PAB 
and NLR could be useful non-invasive biomarkers of DF development."
1132,"Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the liver is a rare disease that is 
difficult to diagnose until the pathology is confirmed. The age of the patients 
generally ranges from 18 to 83 years. The pathogenesis of primary SCC of the 
liver remains unclear and therapeutic guidelines have not yet been established. 
The overall survival rate may be less than 1 year. The prognosis for patients 
without surgery is worse than that for patients who undergo surgery. Herein, we 
report a case of primary SCC of the liver that responded well to intravenous 
carboplatin and 5-flurouracil (5-FU) with the aim of providing an alternative 
therapeutic option. A 61-year-old woman with no history of alcohol use disorder, 
cirrhosis, exposure to hepatotoxic chemicals, or a remarkable family history 
presented to our hospital with a complaint of epigastric pain, poor appetite, 
and fatigue, which had occurred 3 days before presentation. Blood tests revealed 
levels of alpha-fetoprotein of &lt;2.0 ng/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen of 4.39 
ng/mL, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 of 1306.15 U/mL, CA 125 of 66.3 U/mL, CA 
153 of 19.7 U/mL, and SCC antigen of 8.5 ng/mL. Computed tomography scans of the 
abdomen showed a 5.8-cm lobulated soft-tissue mass with central necrosis in 
segment 6 of the liver, which caused compression of the common hepatic duct. 
Pathological examination of the masses revealed squamous cell carcinoma with 
focal glandular differentiation. The patient underwent palliative chemotherapy 
with intravenous carboplatin 150 mg (day 1) and 5-FU 1000 mg (days 1-4) instead 
of surgery. After two cycles of chemotherapy, jaundice and liver function 
improved. The patient was discharged in stable condition and was followed up in 
our outpatient department. Although the patient refused to undergo surgery, no 
tumor recurrence or distant metastasis was found during the 8-month follow-up 
period. This report highlights that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin 
and 5-FU can be considered for primary SCC of the liver before a liver 
resection."
1133,"Background and Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether there is a 
relationship between preoperative fasting time, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and 
postoperative emergence delirium (ED) in pediatric patients undergoing MRI under 
sedation. Materials and Methods: 110 pediatric patients were included in the 
study. Preoperative fasting (solid-fluid) time and FBG were recorded. The 
development of ED in the patients who underwent MRI under sedation was evaluated 
with the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) value for 30 min every 5 
min in the recovery room. PAED score of ≥10 was grouped as having ED, and a PAED 
score of &lt;10 as without ED at any time. The PAED scores were compared with 
other variables, ASA, age, weight, MRI examination time, and FBG level and 
fasting times. The risk factors affecting the occurrence of ED were examined. 
Results: Mean age was 3.94 ± 1.53 years, mean FBG was 106.97 ± 12.53 mg/dL, 
fasting time was 10.75 ± 2.61 h, solid food fasting time was 11.92 ± 2.33 h, and 
thirst time was 10.74 ± 2.58 h. FBG was never associated with PAED measurement 
at any time (p &gt; 0.05). There was a weak positive correlation between the 
fasting time and the 0th, 5th, and 10th minute PAED score (r = 0.225; p = 0.018, 
r = 0.195; p = 0.041, r = 0.195; p = 0.041). There was a weak positive 
correlation between the solid food fasting time and the PAED score at the 0th, 
5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th minutes (r = 0.382; p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.357; p &lt; 
0.001, r = 0.345; p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.360; p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.240; p &lt; 
0.001). There was a weak positive correlation between thirst time and the PAED 
score at the 0th, 5th, and 10th minutes (r = 0.222; p = 0.020. r = 0.192; p = 
0.045, r = 0.199; p = 0.037). The incidence of ED at any time was 34.5%. 
Conclusions: Prolonged fasting time, solid food fasting time and thirst time are 
risk factors for developing postoperative ED in children undergoing MRI under 
sedation."
1134,"Alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) is a disease with multiple complications and is 
associated with poor prognosis and significant mortality. Identifying risk 
factors associated with a poor outcome is important to ensure effective 
treatment and increase life expectancy. We aimed to evaluate the predictive 
values of complications regarding mortality in ALC. We retrospectively analyzed 
1429 patients with ALC hospitalized between January 2019 and April 2022 at the 
Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Iasi. The electronic medical 
records were interrogated to obtain information about demographic data, 
complications, comorbidities, and prognostic scores: MELD-Na (model for 
end-stage liver disease-sodium) and CTP (Child-Turcotte-Pugh). Based on uni- and 
multivariate analysis, independent predictors of mortality were identified. The 
mean age at diagnosis was 56.15 ± 11.49 years with a ratio of 2:1 in favor of 
males. There were 296 deaths (20.8%), most of them during the first 
hospitalization (208/14.6%). It was observed during the univariate analysis that 
complications of the disease negatively affected the survival rate, significant 
values being related to infections (sepsis; OR = 21.98; p &lt; 0.001; 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (OR = 11.94; p &lt; 0.001) and 
hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) (OR = 9.35; p &lt; 0.001). The independent 
predictors, confirmed by multivariate analysis, were the association of variceal 
bleeding, infections, and hepatic encephalopathy or ascites, each combination 
being responsible for two out of 10 of the deaths during the first admission. 
The prognosis of the disease was negatively influenced by the worsening of liver 
dysfunction and the appearance of complications. The main predictors of 
mortality were infections, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and 
hepatorenal syndrome. Improving compliance and strict application of specific 
follow-up and treatment strategies could contribute to a better prognosis of 
patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis."
1135,"Background and Objectives: Using 3D printed models in orthopaedics and 
traumatology contributes to a better understanding of injury patterns regarding 
surgical approaches, reduction techniques, and fracture fixation methods. The 
aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel technique 
implementing 3D printed models to facilitate the optimal preoperative planning 
of the surgical treatment of complex acetabular fractures. Materials and 
Methods: Patients with complex acetabular fractures were assigned to two groups: 
(1) conventional group (n = 12) and (2) 3D printed group (n = 10). Both groups 
included participants with either a posterior column plus posterior wall 
fracture, a transverse plus posterior wall fracture, or a both-column acetabular 
fracture. Datasets from CT scanning were segmented and converted to STL format, 
with separated bones and fragments for 3D printing in different colors. 
Comparison between the two groups was performed in terms of quality of fracture 
reduction (good: equal to, or less than 2 mm displacement, and fair: larger than 
2 mm displacement), functional assessment, operative time, blood loss, and 
number of intraoperative x-rays. Results: A significant decrease in operative 
time, blood loss, and number of intraoperative x-rays was registered in the 3D 
printed group versus the conventional one (p &lt; 0.01), with 80% of the 
patients in the former having good fracture reduction and 20% having fair 
reduction. In contrast, 50% of the patients in the conventional group had good 
reduction and 50% had fair reduction. The functional score at 18-month follow-up 
was better for patients in the 3D printed group. Conclusions: The 3D printing 
technique can be considered a highly efficient and patient-specific approach for 
management of complex acetabular fractures, helping to restore patient's 
individual anatomy after surgery."
1136,"Background and Objectives: Transaxillary access is a straightforward ""single 
incision-direct vision"" concept, based on a 5 cm skin incision in the right 
anterior axillary line. It is suitable for aortic, mitral and tricuspid surgery. 
The present study evaluates the hospital outcomes of the transaxillary access 
for isolated mitral valve surgery compared with full sternotomy. Patients and 
Methods: The final study group included 480 patients. A total of 160 consecutive 
transaxillary patients served as treatment group (MICS-MITRAL). Based on a 
multivariate logistic regression model including age, sex, body-mass-index, 
EuroScore II and LVEF, a 1:2 propensity matched control-group (n = 320) was 
generated out of 980 consecutive sternotomy patients. Redo surgeries, 
endocarditis or combined procedures were excluded. The mean age was 66.6 ± 10.6 
years, 48.6% (n = 234) were female. EuroSCORE II averaged 1.98 ± 1.4%. Results: 
MICS-MITRAL had longer perfusion (88.7 ± 26.6 min vs. 68.7 ± 32.7 min; p &lt; 
0.01) and cross-clamp (64.4 ± 22.3 min vs. 49.7 ± 22.4 min; p &lt; 0.01) times. 
This did not translate into longer procedure times (132 ± 31 min vs. 131 ± 46 
min; p = 0.76). Both groups showed low rates of failed repair (MICS-MITRAL: n = 
6/160; 3.75%; Sternotomy: n = 10/320; 3.1%; p = 0.31). MICS-MITRAL had lower 
transfusion rates (p ≤ 0.001), less re-exploration for bleeding (p = 0.04), 
shorter ventilation times (p = 0.02), shorter ICU-stay (p = 0.05), less 
postoperative hemofiltration (p &lt; 0.01) compared to sternotomy patients. No 
difference was seen in the incidence of stroke (p = 0.47) and postoperative 
delirium (p = 0.89). Hospital mortality was significantly lower in MICS-MITRAL 
patients (0.0% vs. 3.4%; p = 0.02). Conclusions: The transaxillary access for 
MICS-MITRAL provides superior cosmetics and excellent clinical outcomes. It can 
be performed at least as safely and in the same time frame as conventional 
mitral surgery by sternotomy."
1137,"Background and Objectives: A difficulty scoring system was previously developed 
to assess the difficulty of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for liver tumors; 
however, we need another system for hepatolithiasis. Therefore, we developed a 
novel difficulty scoring system (nDSS) and validated its use for predicting 
postoperative outcomes. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study. 
We used clinical data of 123 patients who underwent LLR for hepatolithiasis 
between 2003 and 2021. We analyzed the data to determine which indices were 
associated with operation time or estimated blood loss (EBL) to measure the 
surgical difficulty. We validated the nDSS in terms of its ability to predict 
postoperative outcomes, namely red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, postoperative 
hospital stay (POHS), and major complications defined as grade ≥IIIa according 
to the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC). Results: The nDSS included five 
significant indices (range: 5-17; median: 8). The RBC transfusion rate (p &lt; 
0.001), POHS (p = 0.002), and major complication rate (p = 0.002) increased with 
increasing nDSS score. We compared the two groups of patients divided by the 
median nDSS (low: 5-7; high: 8-17). The operation time (210.7 vs. 240.7 min; p 
&lt; 0.001), EBL (281.9 vs. 702.6 mL; p &lt; 0.001), RBC transfusion rate (5.3% 
vs. 37.9%; p &lt; 0.001), POHS (8.0 vs. 13.3 days; p = 0.001), and major 
complication rate (8.8% vs. 25.8%; p = 0.014) were greater in the high group. 
Conclusions: The nDSS can predict the surgical difficulty and outcomes of LLR 
for hepatolithiasis and may help select candidates for the procedure and 
surgical approach."
1138,"Background and Objectives: Previous studies have suggested that long-term 
β-blocker therapy before sepsis is associated with reduced mortality. 
Sepsis-associated coagulopathy (SAC) remains a common complication in patients 
with sepsis and is associated with increased mortality. Adrenergic pathways are 
involved in the regulation of the coagulation system. Pre-existing long-term 
β-blocker therapy may have potentially beneficial effects on SAC and has yet to 
be well characterized. We aimed to assess the potential association between 
pre-existing long-term β-blocker therapy and the outcomes of patients with SAC. 
Materials and Methods: This study retrospectively screened the clinical data of 
adult patients with SAC admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 
respiratory ICU between May 2020 and October 2022. Patients with SAC who took 
any β-blocker for at least one year were considered pre-existing long-term 
β-blocker therapy. All enrolled patients were followed up for 28 days or until 
death. Results: Among the 228 SAC patients, 48 received long-term β-blocker 
therapy before septic episodes. Pre-existing long-term β-blocker therapy was 
associated with reduced vasopressor requirements and a decreased 28-day 
mortality (log-rank test: p = 0.041). In particular, long-term β-blocker therapy 
was related to substantially lower D-dimer levels and a trend of improved 
activated partial thromboplastin time in patients with SAC during initial ICU 
admission. Multivariable regression analysis showed that long-term β-blocker 
therapy was significantly and independently associated with a 28-day mortality 
among patients with SAC (adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 
(0.32-0.94); p = 0.030). Conclusions: Pre-existing long-term β-blocker therapy 
might be associated with reduced vasopressor requirements and a decreased 28-day 
mortality among patients with SAC, providing evidence for the protective effect 
of β-blockers against SAC in managing sepsis."
1139,"Background and Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate platelet-rich 
plasma (PRP) as a method of pleurodesis in a rabbit model. Pleurodesis with PRP 
was compared against the gold-standard use of talc. The secondary evaluation 
assessed the ideal time for achieving pleurodesis. Materials and Methods: 25 
healthy New Zealand white rabbits were assigned to three groups, as follows: 12 
animals in the first and second groups, as well as one animal with no 
intervention in the final group, which was used as a control. The talc 
pleurodesis group (baseline) underwent pleurodesis with sterile talc, which is 
the gold-standard sclerosing agent used for pleurodesis. The PRP group underwent 
pleurodesis using autologous PRP. The last group had one rabbit with no 
intervention. A total of 12 rabbits (n = 6 for the talc pleurodesis group and n 
= 6 for the PRP group) were sacrificed 3 days (72 h) after the intervention, and 
12 rabbits (n = 6 for the talc pleurodesis group and n = 6 for the PRP group) 
were sacrificed 6 days (144 h) after the intervention. In both the talc and PRP 
group, FBC and CRP were measured before the intervention and in 3 or 6 days 
afterwards, respectively. The pleura and the lungs were evaluated 
histopathologically. Results: Macroscopically, there were no statistically 
significant differences between the two groups. In terms of microscopic 
findings, there were no statistically significant differences in inflammatory 
reactions provoked in the visceral and parietal pleura between the PRP and talc. 
In addition, with talc pleurodesis, a foreign-body reaction was observed in 
about 50% of the cases, which was not observed with PRP. In terms of 
inflammation between 3 and 6 days, there were no statistically significant 
differences with PRP, there was only a statistically significant difference 
between 3 and 6 days regarding the parietal pleura in the talc group. 
Conclusions: The instillation of autologous PRP in the pleural cavity shows 
promise in achieving pleurodesis. The efficacy of PRP as a pleurodesis agent 
should be examined further."
1140,"Background and Objectives: Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is the primary and 
secondary treatment for acute esophageal variceal bleeding. Post-banding ulcer 
bleeding (PBUB) may lead to bleeding episodes following EVL, increasing 
mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for PBUB and 
predict the 6-week mortality risk after PBUB. Materials and Methods: We 
retrospectively analyzed the data collected from cirrhotic patients with EVL 
from 2015 to 2017. The incidence of PBUB and the 6-week mortality rate were 
evaluated. Risk factors for PBUB and predictive factors for mortality after PBUB 
were analyzed. Results: A total of 713 patients were enrolled in this study. 
Among the studied subjects, the incidence of PBUB was 5.8% (N = 41). The 6-week 
mortality rate was 63.4% (26/41). In multivariate analysis, MELD score ≥20 (OR: 
3.77, 95% CI: 1.94-7.33, p &lt; 0.001), ALBI score of 3 (OR: 2.67, 95% CI: 
1.34-5.3, p = 0.005) and the presence of gastric varices (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 
1.06-4.16, p = 0.03) were associated with the development of PBUB. Patients with 
ALBI grade 3 (OR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.18-19.6, p = 0.029) and Child-Pugh scores B and 
C (OR: 16.67, 95% CI: 1.75-158.1, p = 0.014) were associated with 6-week 
mortality after PBUB. Conclusions: PBUB is a complication with low incidence but 
increased mortality following EVL. The ALBI grade is a useful score to predict 
not only the development of PBUB but also the 6-week mortality after PBUB."
1141,"Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary cancer syndrome 
characterized by multiple café-au-lait macules on the skin. Lymphoproliferative 
malignancies associated with NF1 are limited, although the most common are brain 
tumors. Case presentation: A 22-year-old woman with NF1 was admitted due to 
abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Her laboratory data exhibited macrocytic 
anemia and elevated IgA levels. Image studies showed diffuse increased wall 
thickening in the transverse and descending colon without lymphadenopathy and 
hepatosplenomegaly. A colonoscopy revealed a hemorrhagic ulcerated mass. 
Pathological analysis of the tumor tissues confirmed IgA-expressing 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma with histological 
transformation. Moreover, whole-exome sequencing in tumor tissues and peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells identified a somatic frameshift mutation of the A20 
gene, which represents the loss of function. The patient responded well to 
R-CHOP chemotherapy, but the disease relapsed after 1 year, resulting in a 
lethal outcome. Conclusions: MALT lymphoma in children and young adults is 
extremely rare and is possibly caused by acquired genetic changes. This case 
suggests a novel association between hereditary cancer syndrome and early-onset 
MALT lymphoma."
1142,"Background and Objectives: Visceral obesity is associated with chronic low-grade 
inflammation that predisposes to metabolic syndrome. Indeed, infiltration of 
adipose tissue with immune-inflammatory cells, including 'classical' 
inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory 'alternative' M2 macrophages, causes the 
release of a variety of bioactive molecules, resulting in the metabolic 
complications of obesity. This study examined the relative expression of 
macrophage phenotypic surface markers, cholesterol efflux proteins, scavenger 
receptors, and adenosine receptors in human circulating peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM), with the aim to phenotypically characterize and identify biomarkers for 
these ill-defined cells. Materials and Methodology: PBMCs were isolated from 
four groups of adults: Normal-weight non-diabetic, obese non-diabetic, newly 
diagnosed with T2DM, and T2DM on metformin. The mRNA expression levels of 
macrophage phenotypic surface markers (interleukin-12 (IL-12), C-X-C motif 
chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17), and C-C 
motif receptor 7 (CCR7)), cholesterol efflux proteins (ATP-binding cassette 
transporter-1 (ABCA1), ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), and 
sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A)), scavenger receptors (scavenger receptor-A 
(SR-A), C-X-C motif ligand 16 (CXCL16), and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 
(LOX-1)), and adenosine receptors (adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) and adenosine 
A3 receptor (A3R)) were measured using qRT-PCR. Results: In PBMCs from T2DM 
patients, the expression of IL-12, CCR7, ABCA1, and SR-A1 was increased, whereas 
the expression of CXCL10, CCL17, ABCG1,27-hydroxylase, LOX-1, A2AR and A3R was 
decreased. On the other hand, treatment with the antidiabetic drug, metformin, 
reduced the expression of IL-12 and increased the expression of 27-hydroxylase, 
LOX-1, CXCL16 and A2AR. Conclusions: PBMCs in the circulation of patients with 
T2DM express phenotypic markers that are different from those typically present 
in adipose tissue M1 and M2 macrophages and could be representative of 
metabolically activated macrophages (MMe)-like cells. Our findings suggest that 
metformin alters phenotypic markers of MMe-like cells in circulation."
1143,"Background and Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of bladder-prostatic muscle 
reconstruction and bladder neck eversion anastomosis in the recovery of urinary 
continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Materials and 
Methods: From January 2020 to May 2022, 69 patients who underwent RARP in our 
hospital were recruited. Thirty-seven patients underwent RARP with the Veil of 
Aphrodite technique (control group). On the basis of the control group, 32 
patients underwent bladder-prostatic muscle reconstruction and bladder neck 
eversion anastomosis during RARP (observation group). The recovery of urinary 
continence was followed up at 24 h and 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after catheter 
removal. Results: There were no significant differences in operative time 
(127.76 ± 21.23 min vs. 118.85 ± 24.71 min), blood loss (118.27 ± 16.75 mL vs. 
110.77 ± 19.63 mL), rate of leakage (3.13% vs. 2.70%), rate of positive surgical 
margin (6.25% vs. 10.81%), or postoperative Gleason score [7 (6-8) vs. 7 (7-8)] 
between the observation group and the control group (p &gt; 0.05). After 
catheter removal, the rates of urinary continence at 24 h, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 
weeks, and 24 weeks were 46.88%, 68.75%, 84.38%, 90.63%, and 93.75% in the 
observation group, respectively. Meanwhile, the rates of urinary continence in 
the control group were 21.62%, 37.84%, 62.16%, 86.49%, and 91.89%, respectively. 
There was a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.034), 
especially at 24 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks after catheter removal (p &lt; 0.05). 
Conclusions: Bladder-prostatic muscle reconstruction and bladder neck eversion 
anastomosis were beneficial to the recovery of urinary continence after RARP, 
especially early urinary continence."
1144,"Background and objectives: Combined peripheral neutrophil-platelet indexes 
reflecting the systemic inflammatory status have been reported to predict the 
clinical outcome in patients with various types of cancer. However, the 
prognostic value of combined neutrophil-platelet indexes in operable esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. The study introduced a novel 
combined neutrophil-meanplateletvolume-platelet ratio (NMPR) index and 
investigated its clinical and prognostic value in patients with operable ESCC 
receiving curative surgery. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 
the clinicopathologic data of 277 consecutive ESCC patients who received 
curative resection at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital in China between January 2007 and 
December 2010 was conducted (the training cohort). In addition, the 
clinicopathologic data of 101 resectable ESCC patients at Renmin Hospital of 
Hubei University of Medicine between December 2018 and June 2021 were collected 
(the external validation cohort). The optimal cutoff value of NMPR concerning 
overall survival (OS) in the training cohort was determined by X-tile software. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the 
prognostic value of NMPR along with other variables in the training cohort, 
which was further validated with the same cutoff value in the external 
validation cohort. Significant predictors of OS were used to construct the 
nomogram, of which the discrimination and calibration was evaluated by 
concordance index (C-index) and calibration plots. Results: With a cutoff value 
of 16.62, the results from both the training and external validation cohorts 
supported the association of high NMPR (&gt;16.62) with increased tumor length 
and advanced T stage but not with other variables. In the training cohort, a 
significant association between shorter OS and high NMPR (p = 0.04) as well as 
high CRP (p &lt; 0.001), poor tumor differentiation (p = 0.008), advanced T 
stage (p = 0.006), advanced N stage (p &lt; 0.001) and high CEA (p = 0.007) was 
revealed. Additionally, the high NMPR was verified to independently predict 
unfavorable OS (p = 0.049) in the external validation cohort. The C-index of the 
OS nomogram cooperating significant predictors in the training cohort was 0.71 
and the calibration plots of the OS nomogram fitted well. Conclusions: The 
present study demonstrates that high NMPR is an independent predictor of 
unfavorable OS in resectable ESCC patients without neoadjuvant therapy."
1145,"Following COVID-19 infection, a substantial proportion of patients suffer from 
persistent symptoms known as Long COVID. Among the main symptoms are fatigue, 
cognitive dysfunction, muscle weakness and orthostatic intolerance (OI). These 
symptoms also occur in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue (ME/CFS). OI is 
highly prevalent in ME/CFS and develops early during or after acute COVID-19 
infection. The causes for OI are unknown and autonomic dysfunction is 
hypothetically assumed to be the primary cause, presumably as a consequence of 
neuroinflammation. Here, we propose an alternative, primary vascular mechanism 
as the underlying cause of OI in Long COVID. We assume that the capacitance 
vessel system, which plays a key role in physiologic orthostatic regulation, 
becomes dysfunctional due to a disturbance of the microvessels and the vasa 
vasorum, which supply large parts of the wall of those large vessels. We assume 
that the known microcirculatory disturbance found after COVID-19 infection, 
resulting from endothelial dysfunction, microthrombus formation and rheological 
disturbances of blood cells (altered deformability), also affects the vasa 
vasorum to impair the function of the capacitance vessels. In an attempt to 
compensate for the vascular deficit, sympathetic activity overshoots to further 
worsen OI, resulting in a vicious circle that maintains OI. The resulting 
orthostatic stress, in turn, plays a key role in autonomic dysfunction and the 
pathophysiology of ME/CFS."
1146,"Background and objectives: Gastric cancer (GC) is often diagnosed in the 
metastatic stage. Palliative systemic therapy is still considered the gold 
standard, even for patients with resectable oligometastatic disease. The aim of 
the current study is to assess the potential benefit of up-front gastric and 
liver resection in patients with synchronous resectable liver-only metastases 
from GC (LMGC) in a Western population. Materials and Methods: All patients with 
GC and synchronous LMGC who underwent gastric resection with or without 
simultaneous resection of LMs between January 1997 and December 2016 were 
selected from the institutional records. Those with T4b primary tumors or with 
unresectable or more than three LMs were excluded from the analysis. All 
patients who underwent emergency surgery for hemorrhagic shock or gastric 
perforation were also excluded. Results: Out of 28 patients fulfilling the 
inclusion criteria, 16 underwent simultaneous gastric and liver resection (SR 
group), while 12 underwent palliative gastric resection (GR group). The median 
overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was of 18.81 months, with 1-, 3- and 
5-year OS rates of 71.4%, 17.9% and 14.3%, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year 
OS rates in SR group (75%, 31.3% and 25%, respectively) were significantly 
higher than those achieved in GR group (66.7%, 0% and 0%, respectively; p = 
0.004). Multivariate analysis of the entire cohort revealed that the only 
independent prognostic factor associated with better OS was liver resection (HR 
= 3.954, 95% CI: 1.542-10.139; p = 0.004). Conclusions: In a Western cohort, 
simultaneous resection of GC and LMGC significantly improved OS compared to 
patients who underwent palliative gastric resection."
1147,"Background and Objectives: Human umbilical-cord-blood-derived mesenchymal stem 
cells (hUCB-MSCs) have recently been used in clinical cartilage regeneration 
procedures with the expectation of improved regeneration capacity. However, the 
number of studies using hUCB-MSCs is still insufficient, and long-term follow-up 
results after use are insufficient, indicating the need for additional data and 
research. We have attempted to prove the efficacy and safety of hUCB-MSC 
treatment in a comprehensive analysis by including all subjects with knee 
articular cartilage defect or osteoarthritis who have undergone cartilage repair 
surgery using hUCB-MSCs. We conducted a meta-analysis and demonstrated efficacy 
and safety based on a systematic review. Materials and Methods: This systematic 
review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. For this study, we searched the 
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library literature 
databases up to June 2022. A total of seven studies were included, and quality 
assessment was performed for each included study using the Newcastle-Ottawa 
Quality Assessment Scale. Statistical analysis was performed on the extracted 
pooled clinical outcome data, and subgroup analyses were completed. Results: A 
total of 570 patients were included in the analysis. In pooled analysis, the 
final follow-up International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score showed a 
significant increase (mean difference (MD), -32.82; 95% confidence interval 
(CI), -38.32 to -27.32; p &lt; 0.00001) with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 
93%, p &lt; 0.00001) compared to the preoperative score. The Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores at final follow-up 
were significantly decreased (MD, 30.73; 95% CI, 24.10-37.36; p &lt; 0.00001) 
compared to the preoperative scores, with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 95%, p 
&lt; 0.00001). The visual analog scale (VAS) score at final follow-up was 
significantly decreased (MD, 4.81; 95% CI, 3.17-6.46; p &lt; 0.00001) compared 
to the preoperative score, with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 98%, p &lt; 
0.00001). Two studies evaluated the modified Magnetic Resonance Observation of 
Cartilage Repair Tissue (M-MOCART) score and confirmed sufficient improvement. 
In a study analyzing a group treated with bone marrow aspiration concentrate 
(BMAC), there was no significant difference in clinical outcome or M-MOCART 
score, and the post-treatment International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) 
grade increased. Conclusion: This analysis demonstrated the safety, efficacy, 
and quality of repaired cartilage following hUCB-MSC therapy. However, there was 
no clear difference in the comparison with BMAC. In the future, comparative 
studies with other stem cell therapies or cartilage repair procedures should be 
published to support the superior effect of hUCB-MSC therapy to improve 
treatment of cartilage defect or osteoarthritis."
1148,"Introduction: Essential thrombocythemia is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm 
associated with thrombo-hemorrhagic events and the progression to myelofibrosis 
or acute myeloid leukemia. The purpose of this article is to present real-world 
data on ET cases diagnosed and managed between 1998 and 2020 in the largest, 
tertiary hematology reference center in Romania and to evaluate the impact of 
thrombotic events on survival. Methods: A real-world, retrospective cohort-type 
study was conducted. We collected and statistically analyzed data from 168 
patients who met the 2016 WHO diagnostic criteria for ET and who were managed 
between 1998 and 2020 in our center. Results: The median age at diagnosis of ET 
was 51.8 years, with a female predominance (66.07%). The JAK2V617F mutation was 
detected in 60.71% of patients. Leukocytosis at diagnosis was associated with a 
higher risk of thrombosis, and JAK2V617F-positive cases exhibited a 1.5-fold 
higher risk of developing thrombotic events. The average survival in ET with 
major thrombosis was 14.5 years versus 20.6 years in ET cases without major 
thrombosis. Other predictors of survival were high-risk IPSET score and age 
&gt;60 years. Conclusions: Romanian patients diagnosed with ET are generally 
younger than 60 years and are predominantly female. The occurrence of thrombotic 
events was influenced by gender, leukocyte count at diagnosis and JAK2V617F 
positivity. Survival was impacted by age, the presence of JAK2V617F mutation, 
hypertension, major thrombotic complications and IPSET score. Notably, these 
findings warrant careful interpretation and further confirmation in the setting 
of prospective studies."
1149,"Background and objectives: This study aimed to analyze the morphological changes 
in the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in 
patients with diabetic retinopathy, with a particular focus on the presence or 
absence of comorbid diabetic macular ischemia (DMI), using optical coherence 
tomography angiography (OCTA). Materials and Methods: Treatment-naïve 25 eyes of 
16 patients who received PRP were examined in this retrospective case series. 
FAZ area, perimeter, and circularity were calculated on a 3 × 3-mm en-face OCTA 
image before PRP (baseline) and 1 and 3 months after PRP. The patients were 
divided into two groups according to coexisting DMI, and each group was 
statistically analyzed. Results: In patients with DMI (9 eyes), FAZ area 
significantly decreased from the baseline to 3 months after PRP (0.86 ± 0.56 to 
0.61 ± 0.31 mm2, p = 0.018), whereas FAZ perimeter and circularity remained 
unchanged following treatment (p = 0.569 and 0.971, respectively). In patients 
without DMI (16 eyes), FAZ parameters did not show statistically significant 
changes across the 3-month follow-up period. Conclusion: PRP significantly 
reduces FAZ area in patients with DMI."
1150,"Background and Objectives: The objective of this study is to examine the effect 
of the BNT162b2 vaccine on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) before and 
15 min after two doses that were given 21 days apart. Materials and Methods: 
This active surveillance study of vaccine safety was conducted on 15 and 16 
March (for the first dose) and 5 and 6 April (for the second dose) 2021 in an 
academic hospital. For both doses, SBP, DBP, MAP, and PP levels were measured 
before and 15 min after both doses were given to healthcare workers over the age 
of 18. The results of the study were based on measurements of the mean blood 
pressure (BP), the mean changes in BP, and the BP trends. Results: In total, 287 
individuals received the vaccine. After the first dose, 25% (n = 72) of 
individuals had a decrease in DBP of at least 10 mmHg (mean DBP decrease: 15 
mmHg, 95% CI: 14-17 mmHg), and after the second dose it was 12.5% (mean DBP 
decrease: 13 mmHg, 95% CI: 12-15 mmHg). After the first dose, 28.6% (n = 82) had 
a PP that was wider than 40 mmHg. After the first dose, 5.2% and 4.9% of the 
individuals experienced an increase or decrease in SBP, respectively, of more 
than 20 mmHg. After the second dose, the SBP of 11% (n = 32) decreased by at 
least 20 mmHg. Conclusions: Improved understanding of vaccine effects on BP may 
help address vaccine hesitancy in healthcare workers."
1151,"Background and Objectives: The aim was to evaluate the association of 
inflammatory biomarkers with resectability and overall survival in hilar 
cholangiocarcinoma. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort 
study over 72 consecutive surgical cases of Klatskin tumor over an 11-year 
period. The sample was divided into two groups: 42 surgical resection cases and 
30 unresectable tumors. Values of inflammatory ratios were compared according to 
the resectability. Log-rank test, univariate, and multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to evaluate the overall survival. Results: Subjects 
were between 42-87 years old (average age of 64.91 ± 9.15 years). According to 
the procedure: 58.33% benefited from resection (with a 30.95% R0 resection rate) 
and 41.66% had palliative surgery. Elevated NLR (neutrophil to lymphocyte 
ratio), PLR (platelet to lymphocyte ratio), and SII (systemic 
immune-inflammation index), and lower LMR (lymphocyte to monocyte ratio) at 
admission were associated with unresectable tumors (p &lt; 0.01). For the 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, increased absolute values of NLR, 
PLR, and SII were associated with lower survival; no differences were observed 
for LMR absolute value. The cut-off value of NLR ≥ 6 was associated with lower 
survival. The median survival time for all subjects was 442 days, with 774 days 
for the resection group and 147 days for the group with palliative surgery. 
Conclusions: In hilar cholangiocarcinoma, inflammatory ratios are associated 
with tumor resectability. Tumor excision conferred an important advantage in 
survival. Elevated NLR, PLR, and SII values at admission significantly increased 
the hazard ratio. LMR had no influence on survival."
1152,"Background and Objectives: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a kidney disease where the 
patient has a classic triad of signs and symptoms including 
hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria (&gt;3.5 g/24 h), and 
peripheral edema. In case of NS, the damaged nephrons (structural and functional 
unit of the kidney) filter unwanted blood contents to make urine. Thus, the 
urine contains unwanted proteins (proteinuria) and blood cells (hematuria), 
while the bloodstream lacks enough protein albumin (hypoalbuminemia). Nephrotic 
syndrome is divided into two types, primary NS, and secondary NS. Primary NS, 
also known as primary glomerulonephrosis, is the result of a glomerular disease 
that is limited to the kidney, while secondary NS is a condition that affects 
the kidney and other parts of the body. The main causes of primary NS are 
minimal change disease, membranous glomerulonephritis, and focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis. In the present study we recruited a family segregating 
primary NS with the aim to identify the underlying genetic etiology. Such type 
of study is important in children because it allows counseling of other family 
members who may be at risk of developing NS, predicts risk of recurrent disease 
phenotypes after kidney transplant, and predicts response to immunosuppressive 
therapy. Materials and Methods: All affected individuals were clinically 
evaluated. Clinical examination, results of laboratory tests, and biopsy 
investigations led us to the diagnosis. The next-generation sequencing technique 
(whole-exome sequencing) followed by Sanger sequencing identified a novel 
homozygous splice site variant (NM_173689.7: c.941-3C&gt;T) in the CRB2 gene. 
The variant was present in a homozygous state in the affected individuals, while 
in a heterozygous state in phenotypically normal parents. Results: The study 
expanded the spectrum of the mutations in the gene CRB2 responsible for causing 
NS. Conclusions: In addition, the study will also help in genetic counseling, 
carrier testing, and prenatal and/or postnatal early diagnosis of the disease in 
the affected family."
1153,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been established as a life-saving 
technique for patients with the most severe forms of respiratory or cardiac 
failure. It can, however, be associated with severe complications. 
Anticoagulation therapy is required to prevent ECMO circuit thrombosis. It is, 
however, associated with an increased risk of hemocoagulation disorders. Thus, 
safe anticoagulation is a cornerstone of ECMO therapy. The most frequently used 
anticoagulant is unfractionated heparin, which can, however, cause significant 
adverse effects. Novel drugs (e.g., argatroban and bivalirudin) may be superior 
to heparin in the better predictability of their effects, functioning 
independently of antithrombin, inhibiting thrombin bound to fibrin, and 
eliminating heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. It is also necessary to keep in 
mind that hemocoagulation tests are not specific, and their results, used for 
setting up the dosage, can be biased by many factors. The knowledge of the 
advantages and disadvantages of particular drugs, limitations of particular 
tests, and individualization are cornerstones of prevention against critical 
events, such as life-threatening bleeding or acute oxygenator failure followed 
by life-threatening hypoxemia and hemodynamic deterioration. This paper 
describes the effects of anticoagulant drugs used in ECMO and their monitoring, 
highlighting specific conditions and factors that might influence coagulation 
and anticoagulation measurements."
1154,"Background and Objectives: Albumin binding of the loop diuretic furosemide forms 
the basis for its transport to the kidney and subsequent tubular secretion, 
which is a prerequisite for its therapeutic effects. Accordingly, high albumin 
concentrations should result in higher efficacy of furosemide. However, study 
results on the combination of furosemide in conjunction with albumin, and on the 
efficacy of furosemide in hypoalbuminemia, did not confirm this hypothesis. The 
aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide not only in 
relation to albumin concentration, but also taking albumin function into 
account. Materials and Methods: In a prospective and non-interventional clinical 
observational trial, blood and urine samples from 50 intensive care patients 
receiving continuous intravenous furosemide therapy were evaluated. Albumin 
binding capacity (ABiC) determination allowed conclusions to be drawn about the 
binding site-specific loading state of albumin, by quantifying the unbound 
fraction of the fluorescent marker dansylsarcosine. In addition, assessment of 
the total concentration of furosemide in plasma and urine, as well as the 
concentration of free furosemide fraction in plasma, was performed by HPLC-MS. 
The efficacy of furosemide was evaluated by the ratio of urine excretion to 
fluid intake. Results: In patients with an ABiC ≥ 60% free furosemide fraction 
was significantly lower compared to patients with a lower ABiC (p &lt; 0.001), 
urinary furosemide concentration was higher (p = 0.136), and a significantly 
higher proportion of infused furosemide was excreted renally (p = 0.010). ABiC 
was positively correlated (r = 0.908, p = 0.017) with increase in the urine 
excretion to fluid input ratio after initiation of furosemide therapy. 
Conclusions: ABiC could serve as a marker for individual response to furosemide 
and could be used to generate patient-specific therapeutic regimens. In view of 
the relatively low number of patients in this study, the relationship between 
furosemide efficacy and albumin function should be investigated in larger 
studies in the future."
1155,"Charcot neuropathic arthropathy is a relatively rare, chronic disease that leads 
to joint destruction and reduced quality of life of patients. Early diagnosis of 
Charcot arthropathy is essential for a good outcome. However, the diagnosis is 
often based on the clinical course and longitudinal follow-up of patients is 
required. Charcot arthropathy is suspected in patients with suggestive symptoms 
and an underlying etiology. Failed spinal surgery is not a known cause of 
Charcot arthropathy. Herein we report a patient with ankle Charcot neuropathic 
arthropathy that developed after failed spinal surgery. A 58-year-old man 
presented to the emergency room due to painful swelling of the left ankle for 2 
weeks that developed spontaneously. He underwent spinal surgery 8 years ago that 
was associated with nerve damage, which led to weakness of great toe extension 
and ankle dorsiflexion, and sensory loss below the knee. CT and T2-weighted 
sagittal MRI showed a fine erosive lesion, subluxation, sclerosis, 
fragmentation, and large bone defects. Based on the patient's history and 
radiological findings, Charcot arthropathy was diagnosed. However, the abnormal 
blood parameters, positive blood cultures, and severe pain despite the decreased 
sensation suggested a diagnosis of septic arthritis. Therefore, diagnostic 
arthroscopy was performed. The ankle joint exhibited continued destruction after 
the initial surgery. Consequently, several repeat surgeries were performed over 
the next 2 years. Despite the early diagnosis and treatment of Charcot 
arthropathy, the destruction of the ankle joint continued. Given the chronic 
disease course and poor prognosis of Charcot arthropathy, it is essential to 
consider this diagnosis in patients with neuropathy."
1156,"Background and Objectives: In pre-eclampsia, restricted blood supply due to the 
lack of trophoblastic cell invasion and spiral artery remodeling is responsible 
for adverse pregnancies and maternal outcomes, which is added to by maternal 
undernutrition. This study was designed to observe the effect of multiple 
nutritional micronutrient supplements on the pregnancy outcomes of underweight 
pre-eclamptic women. To investigate the effects of lipid-based multiple micr 
supplementations (LNS-PLW) on pregnancy and maternal outcomes in underweight 
primigravida pre-eclamptic women. Materials and&amp;nbsp;Methods: A total of 60 
pre-eclamptic, underweight primigravida women from the antenatal units of 
tertiary care hospitals in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan, were 
randomly divided into two groups (Group 1 and Group 2). The participants of both 
groups were receiving routine treatment for pre-eclampsia: iron (60 mgs) and 
folic acid (400 ug) IFA daily. Group 2 was given an additional sachet of 75 gm 
LNS-PLW daily till delivery. The pregnancy outcomes of both groups were 
recorded. The clinical parameters, hemoglobin, platelet count, and proteinuria 
were measured at recruitment. Results: The percentage of live births in Group 2 
was 93% compared to 92% in Group 1. There were more normal vaginal deliveries 
(NVDs) in Group 2 compared to Group 1 (Group 2, 78% NVD; group 1, 69% NVD). In 
Group 1, 4% of the participants developed eclampsia. The frequency of cesarean 
sections was 8/26 (31%) in Group 1 and 6/28 (22%) in Group 2. The number of 
intrauterine deaths (IUDs) was only 1/28 (4%) in Group 2, while it was 2/26 (8%) 
in Group 1. The gestational age at delivery significantly improved with LNS-PLW 
supplementation (Group 2, 38.64 ± 0.78 weeks; Group 1, 36.88 ± 1.55 weeks, 
p-value 0.006). The Apgar score (Group 2, 9.3; Group 1, 8.4) and the birth 
weight of the babies improved with maternal supplementation with LNS-PLW (Group 
2, 38.64 ± 0.78 weeks: Group 1, 36.88 ± 1.55; p-value 0.003). There was no 
significant difference in systolic blood pressure, while diastolic blood 
pressure (Group 2, 89.57 ± 2.08 mmHg; Group 1, 92.17 ± 5.18 mmHg, p-value 0.025) 
showed significant improvement with LNS-PLW supplementation. The hemoglobin 
concentration increased with the LNS-PLW supplement consumed in Group 2 (Group 
2, 12.15 ± 0.78 g/dL; Group 1, 11.39 ± 0.48 g/dL, p-value &lt; 0.001). However, 
no significant difference among the platelet counts of the two groups was 
observed. Conclusions: The pregnancy and maternal outcomes of underweight 
pre-eclamptic women can be improved by the prenatal daily supplementation of 
LNS-PLW during pregnancy, along with IFA and regular antenatal care and 
follow-up."
1157,"Background and Objectives: To clinically validate the computed tomography 
(CT)-based three-dimension (3D) model for treatment planning and intraoperative 
navigation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) complicated with renal 
calculi. Materials and&amp;nbsp;Methods: We retrospectively collected the data 
of 26 patients with UPJO and renal calculi who were surgically treated in our 
institution from January 2019 to December 2021. Before surgery, 3D models based 
on preoperative CT scans were constructed in all patients. Additionally, the 
patients were divided into three groups according to the results of 3D models, 
distinguished by different treatment of renal calculi, that is, left untreated 
(1), pyelolithotomy (2), and endoscopic lithotomy (3). The quantitative analysis 
of renal calculi parameters, and perioperative and follow-up data were compared. 
Results: The mean number of involved renal calyces (p = 0.041), and the mean 
maximum cross-sectional area (p = 0.036) of renal stones were statistically 
different among the three groups. There were no significant differences among 
the three groups in the mean operative time, mean estimated blood loss, mean 
pararenal draining time, and mean hospital stay. The intraoperative stone 
clearance rates were 100% (11/11) and 77.8% (7/9) in group 2 and group 3, 
respectively. The trends of increased estimated glomerular filtration rate and 
decreased creatinine on the average levels after surgery were observed, although 
these changes were not statistically significant. At a mean follow-up of 19.4 ± 
6.4 months, the overall surgical success rate of the UPJO was 96.2% (25/26), and 
the overall success rate of renal calculi removal was 80.8% (21/26). Renal 
stones in 66.7% (4/6) of patients in group 1 spontaneously passed out. 
Conclusions: Preoperative 3D CT models have exact clinical value in the surgical 
planning and intraoperative navigation of UPJO patients complicated with renal 
calculi."
1158,"Background and Objectives: Cervical space infection could also extend to the 
mediastinum due to the anatomical vicinity. The mortality rate of descending 
necrotizing mediastinitis is 85% if untreated. The aim of this study was to 
identify risk factors for the progression of deep neck abscesses to descending 
necrotizing mediastinitis. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 
the medical records of patients undergoing surgical treatment of deep neck 
abscesses from August 2017 to July 2022. Computed tomography (CT) was performed 
in all patients. Before surgery, lab data including hemoglobulin (Hb), white 
blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and 
blood glucose were recorded. Patients' characteristics including gender, age, 
etiology, and presenting symptoms were collected. Hospitalization duration and 
bacterial cultures from the wound were also analyzed. Results: The C-reactive 
protein (CRP) level was higher in patients with a mediastinal abscess than in 
patients without a mediastinal abscess (340.9 ± 33.0 mg/L vs. 190.1 ± 72.7 mg/L) 
(p = 0.000). The submandibular space was more commonly affected in patients 
without a mediastinal abscess (p = 0.048). The retropharyngeal (p = 0.003) and 
anterior visceral (p = 0.006) spaces were more commonly affected in patients 
with a mediastinal abscess. Conclusions: Descending necrtotizing mediastinitis 
results in mortality and longer hospitalization times. Early detection of a 
mediastinal abscess on CT is crucial for treatment. Excluding abscesses of the 
anterior superior mediastinum for which transcervical drainage is sufficient, 
other mediastinal abscesses require multimodal treatment including ENT and 
thoracic surgery to achieve a good outcome."
1159,"Background and Objectives: After liver transplantation (LT), long-term 
immunosuppression (IS) is essential. IS is associated with de novo malignancies, 
and the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in LT patients. We 
assessed course of disease in patients with de novo CRC after LT with focus of 
IS and impact on survival in a retrospective, single-center study. Materials 
and&amp;nbsp;Methods: All patients diagnosed with CRC after LT between 1988 and 
2019 were included. The management of IS regimen following diagnosis and the 
oncological treatment approach were analyzed: Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as 
univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Results: A total of 33 out 
of 2744 patients were diagnosed with CRC after LT. Two groups were identified: 
patients with restrictive IS management undergoing dose reduction (RIM group, n 
= 20) and those with unaltered regimen (maintenance group, n = 13). The groups 
did not differ in clinical and oncological characteristics. Statistically 
significant improved survival was found in Kaplan-Meier analysis for patients in 
the RIM group with 83.46 (8.4-193.1) months in RIM and 24.8 (0.5-298.9) months 
in the maintenance group (log rank = 0.02) and showed a trend in multivariate 
cox regression (p = 0.054, HR = 14.3, CI = 0.96-213.67). Conclusions: 
Immunosuppressive therapy should be reduced further in patients suffering from 
CRC after LT in an individualized manner to enable optimal oncological therapy 
and enable improved survival."
1160,"The umbilical cord is a critical anatomical structure connecting the placenta 
with the foetus, fulfilling multiple functions during pregnancy and hence 
influencing foetal development, programming and survival. Histologically, the 
umbilical cord is composed of three blood vessels: two arteries and one vein, 
integrated in a mucous connective tissue (Wharton's jelly) upholstered by a 
layer of amniotic coating. Vascular alterations in the umbilical cord or damage 
in this tissue because of other vascular disorders during pregnancy are 
worryingly related with detrimental maternofoetal consequences. In the present 
work, we will describe the main vascular alterations presented in the umbilical 
cord, both in the arteries (Single umbilical artery, hypoplastic umbilical 
artery or aneurysms in umbilical arteries) and the vein (Vascular thrombosis, 
aneurysms or varicose veins in the umbilical vein), together with other possible 
complications (Velamentous insertion, vasa praevia, hypercoiled or hypocoiled 
cord, angiomyxoma and haematomas). Likewise, the effect of the main obstetric 
vascular disorders like hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (specially 
pre-eclampsia) and chronic venous disease on the umbilical cord will also be 
summarized herein."
1161,"Background and Objectives: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined as an acute 
inflammatory disorder of the pancreas and is a common gastrointestinal disease. 
Since currently used indicators lack specifics and cannot accurately reflect the 
phase of disease, better diagnostic approaches need to be explored. 
Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL-1) is a reactant in acute inflammatory diseases 
and is increased in the plasma of AP patients. In the current study, we aim to 
investigate the clinical benefits of FGL-1 in predicting the severity of AP and 
infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN), which can improve the diagnostic efficiency 
of AP. Materials and Methods: In this study, 63 patients diagnosed with AP from 
December 2018 to September 2019 were enrolled. Regarding the severity of AP, 
patients were separated into severe acute pancreatitis (SAP, n = 12) and No-SAP 
groups (n = 51). On the basis of infective conditions, patients were divided 
into IPN (n = 9) and No-IPN (n = 54) groups. The demographic data (sex and age) 
and blood parameters (WBC, HCT, glucose, calcium, FIB, APTT, PCT, CRP, and 
FGL-1) were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The plasma FGL-1 levels were 
increased in both SAP (p &lt; 0.01) and IPN (p &lt; 0.05) subgroups compared to 
the healthy control group. Multivariate analysis showed that elevated plasma 
FGL-1 (p &lt; 0.01) and PCT levels (p &lt; 0.05) within 72 h after the onset of 
AP were positively correlated with the severity of AP, while increased plasma 
FGL-1 (p &lt; 0.01) and CRP (p &lt; 0.05) levels were positively correlated with 
the occurrence of IPN. The combination of FGL-1 and PCT showed superiority to 
both individual markers in SAP prediction. However, the combination of FGL-1 and 
CRP showed no diagnostic advantage over CRP in IPN prediction. Conclusions: 
Plasma FGL-1 within 72 h after the onset could be used for the stratification of 
AP and its infectious complications. The combination of PCT and FGL-1 presents 
an enormous advantage for the early identification of SAP."
1162,"Background and Objectives: Previous studies regarding tranexamic acid (TXA) in 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA) investigated only symptomatic deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT), or did not include high risk patients. The incidence of DVT including 
both symptomatic and asymptomatic complications after applying topical TXA has 
not been evaluated using ultrasonography. Materials and Methods: The medical 
records of 510 patients who underwent primary unilateral TKA between July 2014 
and December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Because TXA was routinely 
applied through the topical route, those who had a history of venous 
thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, or cerebral vascular occlusive disease, 
were not excluded. Regardless of symptom manifestation, DVT was examined at 1 
week postoperatively for all patients using ultrasonography, and the 
postoperative transfusion rate was investigated. The study population was 
divided according to the use of topical TXA. After the two groups were matched 
based on the propensity scores, the incidence of DVT and the transfusion rate 
were compared between the groups. Results: Of the 510 patients, comprising 298 
patients in the TXA group and 212 patients in the control group, DVT was noted 
in 22 (4.3%) patients. Two patients had DVT proximal to the popliteal vein. 
After propensity score matching (PSM), 168 patients were allocated to each 
group. In all, 11 patients in the TXA group and seven patients in the control 
group were diagnosed with DVT, which did not show a significant difference (p = 
0.721). However, the two groups differ significantly in the transfusion rate (p 
&lt; 0.001, 50.0% in the TXA group, 91.7% in the control group). Conclusions: 
The incidence of DVT, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, was not affected by 
the use of topical TXA. The postoperative transfusion rate was reduced in the 
TXA group. Topical TXA could be applied safely even in patients who had been 
known to be at high risk."
1163,"Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the 
relationships between obesity-related factors including body mass index (BMI), 
diabetes or prediabetes, hyperlipidemia, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma 
insulin, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 
highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and Graves' orbitopathy (GO). 
Materials and Methods: Eighty-four patients with Graves' disease (GD) (42 
without GO and 42 with GO) were enrolled in this cross-sectional cohort study. 
Gender, age, GD treatment history, height, body weight, waist circumference, 
smoking status, co-morbidities, levels of free thyroxin, thyroid-stimulating 
hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies, fasting plasma 
glucose and insulin, and hs-CRP were recorded. The eye condition was evaluated 
using the consensus statement of the European Group of Graves' Orbitopathy 
(EUGOGO) and the NOSPECS classification. Results: In this study, multivariate 
regression analysis showed that BMI, fasting plasma insulin, and HOMA-IR were 
associated with the presence of GO after adjusting the age, gender, smoking, 
TSHR antibodies, and steroid usage (adjusted odd's ratio (aOR) 1.182, 95% 
confidence interval (95% CI), 1.003-1.393, p = 0.046; aOR 1.165, 95% CI, 
1.001-1.355, p = 0.048; and aOR 1.985, 95% CI, 1.046-3.764, p = 0.036, 
respectively). In addition, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, 
HOMA-IR, and hs-CRP levels were positively correlated with the severity of GO. 
Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that obesity-related factors, 
especially fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR, are related to GO. Our study 
highlighted the importance of obesity-related factors in GO. Obesity-related 
factors may cause the development of GO or occur simultaneously with GO."
1164,"Background and Objectives: To assess the current practice pattern in the 
management of pediatric acute appendicitis in Romania. Materials and Methods: A 
questionnaire was emailed to all the members of the Romanian Society of 
Pediatric Surgery between June-July 2022. Results: 118 answers were received, 
79.7% responses being from permanent staff members. In the diagnosis of 
appendicitis, complete blood count, C-reactive protein and abdominal ultrasound 
are the most commonly used diagnostic tools, while appendicitis scores are not 
widely used (25% of surgeons). In the case of simple appendicitis, 49.2% of 
surgeons prefer the conservative approach-oral/intravenous antibiotics. Those 
who choose the operative approach begin preoperative antibiotics in 56.7% of 
patients. In case of a stable patient, only 16.7% of surgeons will operate 
during the night. Laparoscopic approach is chosen by 51.7% of surgeons. In the 
case of a complicated appendicitis, 92.4% of surgeons will perform the 
appendectomy, prescribing preoperative antibiotics in 94% of the cases and 
continuing the therapy postoperatively in 98.2%. Laparoscopic approach is used 
by 28.8% of surgeons in case of complicated appendicitis. In presence of 
appendicular mass, 80% prefer a conservative approach with a delayed 
appendectomy within 6 months. Appendicular abscesses are managed operatively in 
82.2% of the cases. The appendix is sent for histological analysis by 95.8% of 
surgeons. If the peritoneal cavity is contaminated, 95% of the respondents will 
take a sample for microbiological analysis, 71% will always place a drainage and 
44% will always irrigate (71.9%-saline). Conclusions: Clearly, there seems to be 
a lack of consensus regarding several aspects of the management of acute 
appendicitis in children. In addition, minimally invasive surgery is not as 
widely used as reported, despite literature support."
1165,"Background and Objectives: Transfusion of red cell concentrates is a key 
component of medical therapy. To investigate the complex transfusion-associated 
biochemical and physiological processes as well as potential risks for human 
recipients, animal models are of particular importance. This scoping review 
summarizes existing large animal transfusion models for their ability to model 
the physiology associated with the storage of erythrocyte concentrates. 
Materials and Methods: The electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of 
Science were systematically searched for original studies providing information 
on the intravenous application of erythrocyte concentrates in porcine, ovine, 
and canine animal models. Results: A total of 36 studies were included in the 
analysis. The majority of porcine studies evaluated hemorrhagic shock 
conditions. Pig models showed high physiological similarities with regard to red 
cell physiology during early storage. Ovine and canine studies were found to 
model typical aspects of human red cell storage at 42 days. Only four studies 
provided data on 24 h in vivo survival of red cells. Conclusions: While ovine 
and canine models can mimic typical human erythrocyte storage for up to 42 days, 
porcine models stand out for reliably simulating double-hit pathologies such as 
hemorrhagic shock. Large animal models remain an important area of translational 
research since they have an impact on testing new pharmacological or biophysical 
interventions to attenuate storage-related adverse effects and allow, in a 
controlled environment, to study background and interventions in dynamic and 
severe disease conditions."
1166,"Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the expression 
of genes on transcriptomic levels involved in inflammatory immune responses and 
the development of fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Materials and 
Methods: Expression patterns of 84 selected genes were analyzed with real-time 
quantitative RT PCR arrays in the peripheral blood of treatment-naive patients 
with chronic hepatitis C and healthy controls. The panel included pro- and 
anti-fibrotic genes, genes coding for extracellular matrix (EMC) structural 
constituents and remodeling enzymes, cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory 
cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, signal transduction members of the 
transforming growth factor- beta (TGF-ß) superfamily, transcription factors, and 
genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Results: The expression 
of SMAD-6 coding for a signal transduction TGF-beta superfamily member as well 
as MMP-8 coding for an ECM protein were significantly increased in CHC patients 
compared with controls. Conclusions: Chronic hepatitis C was also characterized 
by a significant downregulation of a set of genes including CAV-1, CTGF, TIMP-3, 
MMP-1, ITGA-1, LOX, ITGA-2, PLG and CEBPB encoding various biological response 
modifiers and transcription factors. Our results suggest that chronic hepatitis 
C is associated with distinct patterns of gene expression modulation in pathways 
associated with the regulation of immune responses and development of fibrosis."
1167,"Background and Objectives: Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has become an 
accepted and widely performed therapy for patients with symptomatic (reporting 
at least two of the following symptoms: severe or prolonged menstrual bleeding, 
abdominal pain, tension in abdomen, problems with urination, constipation or 
anemia) uterine fibroids. Although in the majority of cases, bilateral occlusion 
is required to obtain a successful clinical outcome, there are patients in whom 
treatment of only one uterine artery could be attempted. There are several 
reasons for unilateral UAE: hemodynamic conditions, technical difficulties, 
anatomical variants and unilateral dominancy of blood supply to the fibroid. Our 
aim is to present our 10-year experience with unilateral UAE and evaluate the 
radiological and clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: Records of 369 
patients with fibroids who underwent UAE from 2010 to 2021 were analyzed. We 
identified 26 patients treated with unilateral uterine artery embolization and 
analyzed the data of these patients. All patients attended medical consultation, 
were assessed using a five-grade symptom scale and underwent MRI examination. 
Clinical response was evaluated at least 6 months after the procedure and was 
categorized to one of the following groups: complete improvement, partial 
improvement, no change and a worsening in symptoms. Results: Twenty-two patients 
(85%) reported at least partial improvement 6 months following the procedure. 
One patient required secondary embolization due to recanalization. The secondary 
procedure was successful, and complete improvement was achieved. One patient did 
not observe any clinical improvement, and in two cases, symptom recurrence was 
observed. All three patients were referred for surgical treatment. No major 
complications were noted. Overall, the success rate was 88%. Conclusions: The 
results of our study support the statement that elective unilateral embolization 
is an appropriate treatment in patients with a dominant uterine artery."
1168,"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a serious complication after 
allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), negatively 
affecting the morbidity and mortality of recipients. Skin involvement is the 
most common cGVHD manifestation with a wide range of pleomorphic features, from 
scleroderma to ulcerations and microangiopathic changes. Despite the access to 
many immunosuppressive drugs, therapy for cGVHD is challenging. Systemic 
steroids are recommended as the first-line treatment; but, in steroid-resistant 
patients, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) remains one of the subsequent 
therapeutic options. Here, we present a case report of a 31-year patient 
suffering from advanced steroid-refractory skin and oral mucosa cGVHD who was 
spectacularly treated with ECP. It was the first time we observed such 
""overnight"" resolution of the graft-versus-host disease syndrome. The present 
report proves the important role of ECP in the treatment of steroid-resistant 
cGVHD, especially when other immunosuppressive therapies have failed."
1169,"Background and objectives: Calcium phosphates have been widely used as bone 
substitutes, but their properties are limited to osteoconduction. The 
association of calcium phosphates with osteoinductive bioactive molecules has 
been used as a strategy in regenerative medicine. Melatonin has been studied due 
to its cell protection and antioxidant functions, reducing osteoclastic activity 
and stimulating newly formed bone. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 
topical application of melatonin associated with nanostructured carbonated 
hydroxyapatite microspheres in the alveolar bone repair of Wistar rats through 
histological and histomorphometric analysis. Materials and Methods: Thirty 
female Wistar rats (300 g) were used, divided randomly into three experimental 
groups (n = 10), G1: nanostructured carbonated hydroxyapatite microspheres 
associated with melatonin gel (CHA-M); G2: nanostructured carbonated 
hydroxyapatite (CHA); G3: blood clot (without alveolar filling). The animals 
were euthanized after 7 and 42 days of the postoperative period and processed 
for histological and histomorphometric evaluation. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's 
post-test were applied to investigate statistical differences between the groups 
at the same time point for new bone and connective tissue variables. 
Mann-Whitney was used to assess statistical differences between different time 
points and in the biomaterial variable. Results: Results showed a greater volume 
of residual biomaterial in the CHA-M than the CHA group (p = 0.007), and there 
were no significant differences in terms of newly formed bone and connective 
tissue between CHA and CHA-M after 42 days. Conclusions: This study concluded 
that both biomaterials improved alveolar bone repair from 7 to 42 days after 
surgery, and the association of CHA with melatonin gel reduced the biomaterial's 
biodegradation at the implanted site but did not improve the alveolar bone 
repair."
1170,"One of the essential regulators of arterial blood pressure, the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) seems to be one of the most complex 
mechanisms in the human body. Since the discovery of its key components and 
their actions, new substances and functions are still being unraveled. The main 
pathway begins with the secretion of renin in the kidney and culminates with the 
synthesis of angiotensin II (Ang II)-a strong vasoconstrictor-thanks to the 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Research conducted in 2000 identified 
another enzyme, named ACE2, that converts Ang II into Ang-(1-7), a heptapeptide 
with opposing effects to those of Ang II: vasodilation and anti-inflammatory 
properties. This particular enzyme became of paramount importance during the 
last two decades, as a result of the confrontation of the human race with 
life-threatening epidemics. Multiple studies have been performed in order to 
uncover the link between ACE2 and human coronaviruses, the results of which we 
systemized in order to create an overview of the pathogenic mechanism. Human 
coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, attach to ACE2 via their spike 
proteins (S), causing the destruction of the enzyme. Because ACE2 limits the 
production of Ang II (by converting it into Ang-(1-7)), its destruction leads to 
a dysregulated inflammatory response. The purpose of this review is to decipher 
the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the multiorgan 
complications (oral, cardiac, pulmonary, systemic) that appear as a result of 
the interaction of the SARS CoV-2 virus with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 
type 2."
1171,"Agents of platinum-based chemotherapy, such as cisplatin or carboplatin, are 
used in the treatment of a wide range of malignancies that affect children, such 
as brain tumors, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, and germ cell 
tumors (GCTs). The Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose (CED) calculator for 
reproductive risk does not take platinum-based chemotherapy into account, 
despite the fact that it accounts for the majority of chemotherapy medications 
that are typically administered for pediatric GCTs. As a result, exposure to 
platinum-based drugs throughout infancy can have predictable long-term effects 
such as infertility, as well as other rare encounters such as lipoma formation 
and lipomatosis. Lipomas are the most prevalent benign soft tissue tumor 
subtype. They may be either solitary entities or engaged in multiple 
lipomatosis, which may have a familial origin or be an acquired disorder. 
Chemotherapy is a possible cause of lipomatosis. Chemotherapy based on cisplatin 
has been linked to a variety of long-term consequences, including kidney damage, 
neurotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity, and may even create secondary cancers. 
However, lipoma development is known to occur in fewer than 1 in 100 
individuals, and only a few examples of multiple cutaneous lipomatosis triggered 
by this therapy have been documented. Here we present a very rare case of 
lipomatosis in a pediatric patient with GCT under cisplatin therapy, which might 
be the third report of this kind affecting children."
1172,"Background and Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently associated with 
pneumonia but has a broad tissue tropism also leading to systemic complications 
(hematologic, gastro-intestinal, cardiac, neurologic, etc.). In this study, we 
aim to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 infection on the liver and to identify 
the risk factors/predictors for liver injury at admission to the hospital. 
Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study on 249 
patients, divided into two Group A (157 patients with liver involvement) and 
Group B (92 patients without liver involvement). We recorded demographic and 
lifestyle parameters, anthropometric parameters, comorbidities, clinical 
parameters, inflammation markers, complete blood count, coagulation, and 
biochemical parameters. Lung parenchyma, liver dimensions, and morphology were 
evaluated by computer tomography (CT) scans. Results: Patients with liver 
involvement had higher heart and respiratory rates, lower oxygen saturation 
(SO2), and necessitated higher oxygen flow at admittance. We found higher serum 
levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin, creatine kinase, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), serum triglycerides, and lower values for serum albumin in 
Group A patients. The patients with liver involvement presented more extensive 
lung injury with higher percentages of alveolar, mixed, and interstitial 
lesions, an increase in liver dimensions, and lower density ranges for the liver 
parenchyma. The patients presented hepatocytolytic involvement in 26 cases 
(10.4% from the entire study population), cholestatic involvement in 63 cases 
(37.7% from the entire study population), and mixed liver involvement in 68 
cases (37.7% from the entire study population). Conclusions: Liver involvement 
in COVID-19 patients is frequent, usually mild, and occurs mostly in male 
patients over 50 years old. Cholestatic and mixed liver injuries are more 
frequent than hepatocytolytic injuries. The severity of lung injury evaluated by 
CT scan, increased values of inflammatory markers, LDH, and low values of SO2 
can be considered risk factors/predictors for liver injury at admission to the 
hospital."
1173,"The aim of this work was to obtain and characterize composite biomaterials 
containing two components, namely carbonated hydroxyapatite, which was 
substituted with Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions, and natural polymer-collagen protein. The 
following two different types of collagen were used: lyophilized powder of 
telocollagen from bovine Achilles tendon and atelocollagen solution from bovine 
dermis. The obtained 3D materials were used as potential matrices for the 
targeted delivery of tranexamic acid for potential use in wound healing after 
tooth extractions. Tranexamic acid (TXA) was introduced into composites by two 
different methods. The physicochemical analyses of the obtained composites 
included Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), inductively coupled 
plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), 
release kinetics tests, swelling test, and cytotoxicity assays. The studies 
showed that the proposed synthetic methods yielded biomaterials with favorable 
physicochemical properties, as well as the expected release profile of the drug 
and ions from the matrices."
1174,"Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the best known and widely studied conducting 
polymers with multiple applications and unique physicochemical properties. Due 
to its porous structure and relatively high surface area as well as the affinity 
toward many analytes related to the ability to establish different types of 
interactions, PANI has a great potential as a sorbent in sample pretreatment 
before instrumental analyses. This study provides an overview of the 
applications of polyaniline and polyaniline composites as sorbents in sample 
preparation techniques based on solid-phase extraction, including conventional 
solid-phase extraction (SPE) and its modifications, solid-phase microextraction 
(SPME), dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE), magnetic solid-phase 
extraction (MSPE) and stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE). The utility of 
PANI-based sorbents in chromatography was also summarized. It has been shown 
that polyaniline is willingly combined with other components and PANI-based 
materials may be formed in a variety of shapes. Polyaniline alone and PANI-based 
composites were successfully applied for sample preparation before determination 
of various analytes, both metal ions and organic compounds, in different 
matrices such as environmental samples, food, human plasma, urine, and blood."
1175,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder whose prevalence has continuously 
increased worldwide and is associated with dysfunction of the autonomic nervous 
system and, in particular, that of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The 
objective of this study was to analyze the interaction of DM and the SNS, 
building a model of sympathectomized diabetic rats to determine alterations in 
the content of CA (catecholamines) in different intra-abdominal organs. 
Sympathectomy was conducted with guanethidine (GNT). Additionally, DM was 
induced with STZ (Streptozotocin). Treatment with GNT decreased norepinephrine 
(NE) content in all analyzed tissues, with significant differences found in the 
paraganglia, liver, pancreas, duodenum, and heart compared to the control group. 
With respect to epinephrine (E), which was only found in the liver, pancreas, 
and heart, presenting significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in the heart, a 
decrease in its concentration was observed for all of the experimental groups 
with respect to the control. The decrease in dopamine (DA) content due to the 
GNT-STZ treatment was 30.1% in the heart with respect to the diabetic (STZ) 
group. The amount of CA in the adrenal medulla indicates the effect of 
sympathectomy on the GNT group where there was a significant reduction (p &lt; 
0.05) of DA. These findings suggest that the elimination of the sympathetic 
nervous system in diabetic organisms contributed to a decrease in blood glucose; 
likewise, an alteration in the levels of CA was observed in the different 
selected organs, possibly attributed to the severity, duration, and pathogenesis 
of the complications of acute and chronic DM."
1176,"Thromboembolic events such as acute ischemic strokes are frequently seen in 
patients with infective endocarditis (IE). It is generally recommended that the 
administration of intravenous thrombolytics is avoided in these patients as they 
might encounter a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhages. In this setting, 
particularly with a large vessel occlusion (LVO), a mechanical thrombectomy may 
be an alternative option. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed 
to investigate the outcomes and safety of mechanical thrombectomies for LVO 
stroke patients secondary to IE. A search strategy was developed and we searched 
PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Embase using the words ""infective 
endocarditis"", ""stroke"", and ""mechanical thrombectomy"". Including 6 studies and 
120 patients overall, this study showed that a mechanical thrombectomy might 
reduce the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), with a weighted 
mean difference of -3.06 and a 95% CI of -4.43 to -1.70. The pooled rate of 
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages and all-cause mortality were also 
determined to be 15% (95% CI: 4-47%) and 34% (95% CI:14-61%), respectively. The 
results of this study showed that a mechanical thrombectomy might be an 
effective and reasonably safe option for the treatment of LVO strokes caused by 
IE. However, more large-scale studies are needed to consolidate these results."
1177,"INTRODUCTION: The risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) in mega-prosthesis 
for malignancy is increased compared with non-tumor cases. While several studies 
describe PJI in tumor-related arthroplasty, prospective studies comparing 
infection characteristics among different joints are limited. The present study 
analyzes mega-arthroplasty for hip, knee, and shoulder malignancy and compares 
the epidemiology, diagnosis, microbe spectrum, treatments, and outcomes between 
the different entities.
METHODS: The retrospective inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 
mega-arthroplasty (2) in the hip, knee, or shoulder joint and a total femur 
arthroplasty (3) following a malignant bone tumor or metastasis (4) between 1996 
and 2019. All included patients were prospectively followed and invited for a 
renewed hospital examination, and their PJI characteristics (if identified) were 
analyzed using both retrospective as well as newly gained prospective data. A 
PJI was defined according to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) 
and re-infection was defined according to the modified Delphi Consensus 
criteria.
RESULTS: In total, 83 cases of tumor mega-arthroplasty at a mean follow-up of 
3.9 years could be included (32 knee, 30 hip, and 19 shoulder cases and 2 cases 
of total femur arthroplasty). In total, 14 PJIs were identified, with 
chondrosarcoma in 6 and osteosarcoma in 3 being the leading tumor entities. Knee 
arthroplasty demonstrated a significantly higher rate of PJI (p = 0.027) 
compared with hips (28.1% vs. 6.7%), while no significant difference could be 
found between the knee and shoulder (10.5%) (p = 0.134) or among shoulder and 
hip cases (p = 0.631). The average time of PJI following primary implantation 
was 141.4 months in knee patients, 64.6 in hip patients, and 8.2 months in 
shoulder patients. Age at the time of the primary PJI, as well as the time of 
the first PJI, did not show significant differences among the groups. Thirteen 
of the fourteen patients with PJI had a primary bone tumor. Statistical analysis 
showed a significant difference in the disadvantage of primary bone tumors (p = 
0.11). While the overall cancer-related mortality in the knee PJI group (10%) 
was low, it was 50% in the hip and 100% in the shoulder group.
CONCLUSION: The risk of PJI in knee tumor arthroplasty is significantly 
increased compared with hips, while cancer-related mortality is significantly 
higher in hip PJI cases. At the same time, mega-prostheses appear to be 
associated with a higher risk of infection due to a primary bone tumor compared 
with metastases. The study confirms existing knowledge concerning PJI in tumor 
arthroplasty, while, being one of the few studies to compare three different 
joints concerning PJI characteristics."
1178,"Toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus strains posing a potential risk for public 
health have long been a topic of scientific research. Effects of 
Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) on tissue destruction mechanisms and 
activities of inflammatory cells were presented in animal models of pneumonia 
and skin infections induced by PVL-producing S. aureus strains. This study aimed 
to demonstrate the in vivo pathogenicity of PVL-producing S. aureus strains 
isolated from some foodstuffs, which can be a potential risk to public health. 
PVL-positive methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains M1 and YF1B-b 
isolated from different foodstuffs and a PVL-positive MSSA strain HT480 
(positive control) were administered to New Zealand rabbits. Blood samples were 
harvested three and six hours after the intratracheal inoculation. Lung tissue 
samples were collected for gross and microscopic exams and immunohistochemical 
(IHC) demonstration of IL-6, IL8, IL-10, and TNF-α expressions. Serum cytokine 
levels were also measured by ELISA. The strains isolated from lung tissue 
samples were confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The development of 
acute necrotising pneumonia and a significant elevation in IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, 
and TNF-α expressions demonstrated the significance of foodborne PVL-positive 
MSSA strains in public health for the first time."
1179,"Diabetes is a leading non-communicable disease and a risk factor for relapsing 
infections. The current study was aimed at investigating the prevalence and 
antibiotic susceptibility of carbapenem-resistant (CR) uropathogens of the 
family Enterobacteriaceae in diabetic patients. The data of 910 bacterial 
isolates was collected from diagnostic laboratories during January 2018 to 
December 2018. The bacterial isolates were identified using traditional methods 
including colonial characteristics, biochemical tests, and API (20E). 
Antimicrobial susceptibility and phenotypic characterization of ESBL, MBLs, and 
KPC was determined by utilizing CLSI recommended methods. The phenotypically 
positive isolates were further analyzed for resistance-encoding genes by manual 
PCR and Check-MDR CT103XL microarray. Susceptibility to colistin and cefiderocol 
was tested in accordance with CLSI guidelines. The data revealed that most of 
the patients were suffering from type 2 diabetes for a duration of more than a 
year and with uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae were the most frequently encountered pathogens, followed by 
Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. More than 50% of the isolates showed 
resistance to 22 antibiotics, with the highest resistance (&gt;80%) against 
tetracycline, ampicillin, and cefazolin. The uropathogens showed less resistance 
to non-β-lactam antibiotics, including amikacin, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. 
In the phenotypic assays, 495 (54.3%) isolates were found to be ESBL producers, 
while ESBL-TEM and -PER were the most prevalent ESBL types. The resistance to 
carbapenems was slightly less (250; 27.5%) than ESBL producers, yet more common 
amongst E. coli isolates. MBL production was a common feature in 
carbapenem-resistant isolates (71.2%); genotypic characterization also validated 
this trend. The isolates were found to be sensitive against the new drugs, 
cefiderocol and eravacycline. with 7-28% resistance, except for P. mirabilis 
which had 100% resistance against eravacycline. This study concludes that a few 
types of ESBL and carbapenemases are common in the uropathogens isolated from 
the diabetic patients, and antibiotic stewardship programs need to be revisited, 
particularly to cure UTIs in diabetic patients."
1180,"We investigated the magnitude of exercise-induced changes in muscular 
bioenergetics, redox balance, mitochondrial function, and gene expression within 
24 h after the exercise bouts performed with different intensities, durations, 
and execution modes (continuous or with intervals). Sixty-five male Swiss mice 
were divided into four groups: one control (n = 5) and three experimental groups 
(20 animals/group), submitted to a forced swimming bout with an additional load 
(% of animal weight): low-intensity continuous (LIC), high-intensity continuous 
(HIC), and high-intensity interval (HII). Five animals from each group were 
euthanized at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h postexercise. Gastrocnemius muscle was 
removed to analyze the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis 
(Ppargc1a), fusion (Mfn2), fission (Dnm1L), and mitophagy (Park2), as well as 
inflammation (Nos2) and antioxidant defense (Nfe2l2, GPx1). Lipid peroxidation 
(TBARS), total peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and citrate synthase 
(CS) activity were also measured. Lactacidemia was measured from a blood sample 
obtained immediately postexercise. Lactacidemia was higher the higher the 
exercise intensity (LIC &lt; HIC &lt; HII), while the inverse was observed for 
TBARS levels. The CS activity was higher in the HII group than the other groups. 
The antioxidant activity was higher 24 h postexercise in all groups compared to 
the control and greater in the HII group than the LIC and HIC groups. The gene 
expression profile exhibited a particular profile for each exercise protocol, 
but with some similarities between the LIC and HII groups. Taken together, these 
results suggest that the intervals applied to high-intensity exercise seem to 
minimize the signs of oxidative damage and drive the mitochondrial dynamics to 
maintain the mitochondrial network, similar to low-intensity continuous 
exercise."
1181,"Atherosclerosis is the main cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The 
progression of coronary atherosclerosis leads to coronary artery disease, with 
impaired blood flow to the myocardium and subsequent development of myocardial 
ischemia. Acute coronary syndromes and post-myocardial infarction heart failure 
are two of the most common complications of coronary artery disease and are 
associated with worse outcomes. In order to improve the management of patients 
with coronary artery disease and avoid major cardiovascular events, several risk 
assessment tools have been developed. Blood and imaging biomarkers, as well as 
clinical risk scores, are now available and validated for clinical practice, but 
research continues. The purpose of the current paper is to provide a review of 
recent findings regarding the use of humoral biomarkers for risk assessment in 
patients with heart disease."
1182,"The application of traditional medicines for the treatment of diseases, 
including diabetic neuropathy (DN), has received great attention. The aim of 
this study was to investigate the ameliorative potential of naringin, a 
flavanone, to treat streptozotocin-induced DN in rat models. After the 
successful induction of diabetes, DN complications were measured by various 
behavioral tests after 4 weeks of post-induction of diabetes with or without 
treatment with naringin. Serum biochemical assays such as fasting blood glucose, 
HbA1c%, insulin, lipid profile, and oxidative stress parameters were determined. 
Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, and neuron-specific markers 
such as BDNF and NGF, were also assessed. In addition, pancreatic and brain 
tissues were subjected to histopathology to analyze structural alterations. The 
diabetic rats exhibited increased paw withdrawal frequencies for the acetone 
drop test and decreased frequencies for the plantar test, hot plate test, and 
tail flick test. The diabetic rats also showed an altered level of 
proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress parameters, as well as altered 
levels of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress parameters. Naringin 
treatment significantly improved these parameters and helped in restoring the 
normal architecture of the brain and pancreatic tissues. The findings show that 
naringin's neuroprotective properties may be linked to its ability to suppress 
the overactivation of inflammatory molecules and mediators of oxidative stress."
1183,"Lung cancer, of which non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents about 80% of 
all cases, is the second most common cancer diagnosed in the general population 
and one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Overall, the 
outcomes of patients with advanced NSCLC are still disappointing despite 
advances in diagnosis and treatment. In recent years immune-checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs), administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have 
revolutionized the treatment landscape of patients with advanced non-small-cell 
lung cancer. However, until now, tissue expression of PD-L1 and tumor mutation 
burden represent the only available biomarkers for NSCLC patients treated with 
ICIs. A growing body of evidence showed that tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) have 
the PD-L1 protein on their surface and that they are involved in angiogenesis, 
tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and immune escape. This review focused on the 
potential clinical applications of TDEs in NSCLC, including their possible role 
as a biomarker for prognosis and disease monitoring in patients undergoing 
immunotherapy."
1184,"Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common pediatric malignant bone tumor. Although 
surgery together with neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy has improved survival 
for localized OSA, most patients develop recurrent/metastatic disease with a 
dismally poor outcome. Therapeutic options have not improved for these OSA 
patients in recent decades. As OSA is a rare and ""orphan"" tumor, with no 
distinct targetable driver antigens, the development of new efficient therapies 
is still an unmet and challenging clinical need. Appropriate animal models are 
therefore critical for advancement in the field. Despite the undoubted relevance 
of pre-clinical mouse models in cancer research, they present some intrinsic 
limitations that may be responsible for the low translational success of novel 
therapies from the pre-clinical setting to the clinic. From this context emerges 
the concept of comparative oncology, which has spurred the study of pet dogs as 
a uniquely valuable model of spontaneous OSA that develops in an 
immune-competent system with high biological and clinical similarities to 
corresponding human tumors, including in its metastatic behavior and resistance 
to conventional therapies. For these reasons, the translational power of studies 
conducted on OSA-bearing dogs has seen increasing recognition. The most recent 
and relevant veterinary investigations of novel combinatorial approaches, with a 
focus on immune-based strategies, that can most likely benefit both canine and 
human OSA patients have been summarized in this commentary."
1185,"(1) Background: Two Caucasian blueberries Vaccinium myrtillus L. and Vaccinium 
arctostaphylos L. are famous berry bushes growing in the Caucasus region and 
used to treat neurological diseases, but the chemistry and bioactivity of leaf 
extracts are still poorly studied. (2) Methods: Phenolic compounds of V. 
myrtillus and V. arctostaphylos leaf extracts were profiled and quantified by 
HPLC-PDA-ESI-tQ-MS. The neurotropic potential of Vaccinium extracts was studied 
using the model of middle cerebral artery permanent occlusion to determine 
cerebral blood flow, the area of the brain tissue necrosis, and antioxidant 
enzyme activity (including superoxide dismutase, succinate dehydrogenase, and 
cytochrome C oxidase), as well as the concentration of TBARS. (3) Results: 
Hydroxycinnamates and flavonoids were identified in the leaves of V. myrtillus 
and V. arctostaphylos, and the dominant metabolite of both extracts was 
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid in the amount of 105-226 mg/g. The studied extracts 
enhanced the cerebral hemodynamics and decreased the frequency of necrotic and 
lipooxidative processes in the brain tissue, accompanied by an increase in the 
activity of antioxidant enzymes. The positive effect of V. arctostaphylos was 
stronger and exceeded the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba standardized extract. 
(4) Conclusion: The leaf extracts of Caucasian blueberries V. myrtillus and V. 
arctostaphylos as a new source of hydroxycinnamates demonstrated a protective 
effect of the brain ischemia pathology and can be used as therapeutic agents to 
treat neurological diseases."
1186,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder of carbohydrates, lipids, 
and proteins due to a deficiency of insulin secretion or failure to respond to 
insulin secreted from pancreatic cells, which leads to high blood glucose 
levels. DM is one of the top four noncommunicable diseases and causes of death 
worldwide. Even though great achievements were made in the management and 
treatment of DM, there are still certain limitations, mainly related to the 
early diagnosis, and lack of appropriate delivery of insulin and other 
anti-diabetic agents. Nanotechnology is an emerging field in the area of 
nanomedicine and NP based anti-diabetic agent delivery is reported to enhance 
efficacy by increasing bioavailability and target site accumulation. Moreover, 
theranostic NPs can be used as diagnostic tools for the early detection and 
prevention of diseases owing to their unique biological, physiochemical, and 
magnetic properties. NPs have been synthesized from a variety of organic and 
inorganic materials including polysaccharides, dendrimers, proteins, lipids, 
DNA, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, and mesoporous materials within the 
nanoscale size. This review focuses on the role of NPs, derived from organic and 
inorganic materials, in the diagnosis and treatment of DM."
1187,"There are limited data on the performance of laboratory-derived biomarkers in 
kidney transplant recipients (KTR) with COVID-19. This observational study 
enrolled 65 KTR with COVID-19 who were treated at the University Hospital of 
Split up to March 2022. Laboratory-derived biomarkers (neutrophile-to-lymphocyte 
(NLR) ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, De 
Ritis ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP)-to-albumin ratio, lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH)-to-hemoglobin ratio, CRP-to-lymphocyte ratio, red cell distribution 
width-to-albumin ratio, platelet-to-albumin ratio, D-Dimer-to-albumin ratio, 
D-Dimer-to-NLR ratio, LDH-to-albumin ratio, and LDH-to-white blood cell (WBC) 
ratio) were calculated, and their performance with regard to 30-day mortality 
was determined. Mortality events occurred in 12 patients (18.5%), which was 
significantly associated with increased De Ritis (HR 3.83, 95% CI 1.57-9.35, p = 
0.003), CRP-to-albumin (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.13-1.64, p = 0.001), LDH-to-hemoglobin 
(HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.07-1.92, p = 0.015), CRP-to-lymphocyte (HR 1.03, 95% CI 
1.01-1.07, p = 0.003), D-dimer-to-albumin (HR 4.94, 95% CI 1.38-7.24, p = 
0.038), LDH-to-albumin (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.36, p = 0.008), and LDH-to-WBC 
(HR 1.03 95% CI 1.01-1.05, p = 0.024) ratios. Out of these, the best 
area-under-the-curve (AUC) values were achieved with De Ritis (AUC 0.691), 
CRP-to-albumin (AUC 0.764), LDH-to-hemoglobin (AUC 0.877), CRP-to-lymphocyte 
(AUC 0.739), and LDH-to-albumin (AUC 0.827) ratios, while the best 
discrimination displayed LDH-to-hemoglobin ratio (Harrell's C 0.808 and Somers' 
D 0.616). The overall calibration was satisfactory for all models. Derived 
laboratory biomarkers such as the de Ritis, CRP-to-albumin, LDH-to-hemoglobin, 
CRP-to-lymphocyte, and LDH-to-albumin ratios show significant association and 
discrimination with all-cause mortality in KTR with COVID-19, suggesting its 
potential risk stratification role."
1188,"(1) Background: Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors constitute a 
novel drug class with remarkable cardiovascular benefits for patients with 
chronic heart failure (HF). Recently, this class has been utilized in acute HF 
as an additional treatment option to classic diuretics, which remain the 
cornerstone of treatment. (2) Methods: We attempted to identify those 
pathophysiologic mechanisms targeted by SGLT-2 inhibitors, which could be of 
benefit to patients with acute HF. We then conducted a comprehensive review of 
the literature within the PubMed database in order to identify relevant studies, 
both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, assessing 
the safety and efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors in acute HF. (3) Results: SGLT-2 
inhibitors induce significant osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, decrease 
interstitial fluid volume and blood pressure, improve left ventricular (LV) 
function, ameliorate LV remodeling and prevent atrial arrhythmia occurrence, 
mechanisms that seem to be beneficial in acute HF. However, currently available 
studies, including six RCTs and two real-world studies, provide conflicting 
results concerning the true efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors, including ""hard"" 
surrogate endpoints. (4) Conclusions: Current evidence appears insufficient to 
substantiate the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in acute HF. Further trials are 
required to shed more light on this issue."
1189,"Lower cord blood leptin levels have been associated with lower and higher 
adiposity in childhood and associations seem to differ according to the child's 
age, methods of adiposity assessment and sex. Our aim was to investigate 
sex-specific associations of cord blood leptinemia with childhood adiposity at 
birth, 3 and 5 years of age. We measured cord blood leptin using Luminex 
immunoassays in 520 offspring from the Gen3G cohort. We tested associations 
between cord blood leptin and body mass index (BMI) z-score, skinfolds 
thicknesses (SFT), and body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, 
adjusted for confounders. At birth, girls had almost twice as much leptin in 
cord blood as boys (15.5 [8.9; 25.6] vs. 8.6 [4.9; 15.0] ng/mL; p &lt; 0.0001) 
as well as significantly greater adiposity. Lower levels of cord blood leptin 
were associated with higher sum of SFT (β = -0.05 ± 0.02; p = 0.03) and higher 
BMI z-score (β= -0.22 ± 0.08; p = 0.01) in 3-year-old boys only. We did not 
observe these associations at age 5, or in girls. Our results suggest a sexual 
dimorphism in the programming of leptin sensitivity and childhood adiposity, but 
further observational and functional studies are needed to better understand the 
role of leptin in early life."
1190,"Oxidative stress and multiple erythrocyte abnormalities have been observed in 
hypertension. We focused on the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) inhibition by MLN-4760 inhibitor on angiotensin peptides, oxidative 
stress parameters, and selected erythrocyte quality markers in spontaneously 
hypertensive rats (SHR). We also investigated the potential effects of 
polyphenolic antioxidant taxifolin when applied in vivo and in vitro following 
its incubation with erythrocytes. SHRs were divided into four groups: control, 
taxifolin-treated, MLN-4760-treated, and MLN-4760 with taxifolin. MLN-4760 
administration increased the blood pressure rise independent of taxifolin 
treatment, whereas taxifolin decreased it in control SHRs. Body weight gain was 
also higher in ACE2-inhibited animals and normalized after taxifolin treatment. 
However, taxifolin did not induce any change in angiotensin peptide 
concentrations nor a clear antioxidant effect. We documented an increase in 
Na,K-ATPase enzyme activity in erythrocyte membranes of ACE2-inhibited SHRs 
after taxifolin treatment. In conclusion, ACE2 inhibition deteriorated some 
selected RBC properties in SHRs. Although taxifolin treatment did not improve 
oxidative stress markers, our data confirmed the blood pressure-lowering 
potential, anti-obesogenic effect, and some ""erythroprotective"" effects of this 
compound in both control and ACE2-inhibited SHRs. In vitro investigations 
documenting different effects of taxifolin on erythrocyte properties from 
control and ACE2-inhibited SHRs accentuated the irreplaceability of in vivo 
studies."
1191,"Non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease is a newly emerging disease that represents 
an important risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer. Obesity is a 
risk factor for pancreatic diseases, including pancreatitis and pancreatic 
cancer. On the other hand, the development of healthy aspects-based food 
products is a recent trend. Lactoferrin is a component of the body's immune 
system, which interacts with DNA, RNA, polysaccharides, and heparin, and it has 
many biological functions and many important immunomodulatory properties. Thus, 
this study aims to investigate the enhancement effect of supplementation of 
lactoferrin with stirred yogurt on weight gain, lipid profile, glucose level, 
and pancreatic enzymes in animals fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Forty-eight female 
albino rats were divided into 6 groups treated orally for 45 days as follows: 
negative control (basal diet), positive control (add 1% cholesterol), stirred 
yogurt (SY), Lactoferrin LF (100 mg/kg bw), supplementation of lactoferrin with 
stirred yogurt SY-LF at two concentrations LF1 (50 mg/kg bw) and LF2 (100 mg/kg 
bw). Blood and pancreas samples were collected for different analyses. Animals 
fed with a HFD showed a significant increase in body weight, total cholesterol, 
triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glucose level, amylase, and Lipase 
enzymes (44.72%, 151.33 mg/dL, 142.67 mg/dL, 85.37 mg/dL, 141.33 mg/dL, 39.33 
U/mL, 23.43 U/mL). Moreover, it observed a significant decrease in high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL, 37.33 mg/dL); meanwhile, SY fortified with lactoferrin was 
useful in losing weight gain and improving lipid profile, pancreas function, and 
histological change in the pancreas. The supplementation of lactoferrin at 100 
mg/Kg bw with LB. Acidophilus as a probiotic was more effective for pancreas 
functions. This application is a natural protective alternative to manufactured 
medicines for children and the elderly as a natural product."
1192,"The aim of this study was to explore the effects of pre-pregnancy 
overweight/obesity on the pattern of association of hypertension susceptibility 
genes with preeclampsia (PE). Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the 
10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS)-significant hypertension/blood 
pressure (BP) candidate genes were genotyped in 950 pregnant women divided into 
two cohorts according to their pre-pregnancy body mass index (preBMI): preBMI ≥ 
25 (162 with PE and 159 control) and preBMI &lt; 25 (290 with PE and 339 
control). The PLINK software package was utilized to study the association 
(analyzed four genetic models using logistic regression). The functionality of 
PE-correlated loci was analyzed by performing an in silico database analysis. 
Two SNP hypertension/BP genes, rs805303 BAG6 (OR: 0.36-0.66) and rs167479 RGL3 
(OR: 1.86), in subjects with preBMI ≥ 25 were associated with PE. No association 
between the studied SNPs and PE in the preBMI &lt; 25 group was determined. 
Further analysis showed that two PE-associated SNPs are functional (have weighty 
eQTL, sQTL, regulatory, and missense values) and could be potentially implicated 
in PE development. In conclusion, this study was the first to discover the 
modifying influence of overweight/obesity on the pattern of association of 
GWAS-significant hypertension/BP susceptibility genes with PE: these genes are 
linked with PE in preBMI ≥ 25 pregnant women and are not PE-involved in the 
preBMI &lt; 25 group."
1193,"Recent studies have attempted to develop molecular signatures of epithelial 
ovarian cancer (EOC) based on the quantitation of protein-coding and non-coding 
RNAs to predict disease prognosis. Due to the heterogeneity of EOC, none of the 
developed prognostic signatures were directly applied in clinical practice. Our 
work focuses on high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) due to the highest 
mortality rate relative to other types of EOC. Using deep sequencing of small 
non-coding RNAs in combination with quantitative real-time PCR, we confirm the 
dualistic classification of epithelial ovarian cancers based on the miRNA 
signature of HGSOC (type 2), which differs from benign cystadenoma and 
borderline cystadenoma-precursors of low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (type 
1)-and identified two subtypes of HGSOC, which significantly differ in the level 
of expression of the progesterone receptor in the tumor tissue, the secretion of 
miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-20a-5p, the level of serum CA125, tumor 
size, surgical outcome (optimal or suboptimal cytoreduction), and response to 
chemotherapy. It was found that the combined determination of the level of 
miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, and miR-93-5p circulating in blood plasma of 
patients with primary HGSOC tumors makes it possible to predict optimal 
cytoreduction with 80.1% sensitivity and 70% specificity (p = 0.022, TPR = 0.8, 
FPR = 0.3), as well as complete response to adjuvant chemotherapy with 77.8% 
sensitivity and 90.9% specificity (p = 0.001, TPR = 0.78, FPR = 0.09). After the 
additional verification of the obtained data in a larger HGSOC patient cohort, 
the combined quantification of these four miRNAs is proposed to be used as a 
criterion for selecting patients either for primary cytoreduction or neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreduction."
1194,"Defects in signaling pathways are the root cause of many disorders. These 
malformations come in a wide variety of types, and their causes are also very 
diverse. Some of these flaws can be brought on by pathogenic organisms and 
viruses, many of which can obstruct signaling processes. Other illnesses are 
linked to malfunctions in the way that cell signaling pathways work. When 
thinking about how errors in signaling pathways might cause disease, the idea of 
signalosome remodeling is helpful. The signalosome may be conveniently divided 
into two types of defects: phenotypic remodeling and genotypic remodeling. The 
majority of significant illnesses that affect people, including high blood 
pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and many types of mental illness, appear to 
be caused by minute phenotypic changes in signaling pathways. Such phenotypic 
remodeling modifies cell behavior and subverts normal cellular processes, 
resulting in illness. There has not been much progress in creating efficient 
therapies since it has been challenging to definitively confirm this connection 
between signalosome remodeling and illness. The considerable redundancy included 
into cell signaling systems presents several potential for developing novel 
treatments for various disease conditions. One of the most important pathways, 
NF-κB, controls several aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses, is a 
key modulator of inflammatory reactions, and has been widely studied both from 
experimental and theoretical perspectives. NF-κB contributes to the control of 
inflammasomes and stimulates the expression of a number of pro-inflammatory 
genes, including those that produce cytokines and chemokines. Additionally, 
NF-κB is essential for controlling innate immune cells and inflammatory T cells' 
survival, activation, and differentiation. As a result, aberrant NF-κB 
activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory illnesses. 
The activation and function of NF-κB in relation to inflammatory illnesses was 
covered here, and the advancement of treatment approaches based on NF-κB 
inhibition will be highlighted. This review presents the temporal behavior of 
NF-κB and its potential relevance in different human diseases which will be 
helpful not only for theoretical but also for experimental perspectives."
1195,"Formyl peptide receptors, abbreviated as FPRs in humans, are G-protein coupled 
receptors (GPCRs) mainly found in mammalian leukocytes. However, they are also 
expressed in cell types crucial for homeostatic brain regulation, including 
microglia and blood-brain barrier endothelial cells. Thus, the roles of these 
immune-associated receptors are extensive, from governing cellular adhesion and 
directed migration through chemotaxis, to granule release and superoxide 
formation, to phagocytosis and efferocytosis. In this review, we will describe 
the similarities and differences between the two principal pro-inflammatory and 
anti-inflammatory FPRs, FPR1 and FPR2, and the evidence for their importance in 
the development of neuroinflammatory disease, alongside their potential as 
therapeutic targets."
1196,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation with 
bee pollen (BP) and propolis (PRO) on productive performance, Eimeria oocyst 
counts in feces, blood metabolites, and the meat quality of growing rabbits. A 
total of 160 hybrid rabbits (California × New Zealand) of 30 days of age and 643 
± 8.0 g body weight (BW) were assigned to four treatments with 10 replicates 
each (four rabbits/replicate). The treatments were as follows: (1) CON: rabbits 
fed basal diet and not supplemented with BP or PRO; (2) BP500: CON + BP (500 
mg/kg BW); (3) PRO50: CON + PRO (50 µL/kg BW); and (4) BP + PRO: CON + BP (500 
mg/kg BW) + PRO (50 µL/kg BW). Higher daily weight gain (p = 0.04) and lower 
feed conversion rate (p = 0.03) were observed in rabbits supplemented with 
PRO50. In addition, supplementation with PRO50 and BP + PRO reduced the amount 
of Eimeria oocysts per gram of feces (p &lt; 0.05). Most hematological and serum 
biochemical parameters were similar in rabbits of all treatments. Protein 
content, collagen, and meat color were similar between treatments. In 
conclusion, propolis supplementation (50 µL/kg BW) can prevent coccidiosis and 
act as a natural growth promoter in rabbits without affecting animal health and 
meat quality."
1197,"Individuals with the SARS-CoV-2 infection may experience a wide range of 
symptoms, from being asymptomatic to having a mild fever and cough to a severe 
respiratory impairment that results in death. MicroRNA (miRNA), which plays a 
role in the antiviral effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, has the potential to be 
used as a novel marker to distinguish between patients who have various COVID-19 
clinical severities. In the current study, the existing blood expression 
profiles reported in two previous studies were combined for deep analyses. The 
final profiles contained 1444 miRNAs in 375 patients from six categories, which 
were as follows: 30 patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, 81 patients with 
moderate COVID-19 symptoms, 30 non-COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms, 137 
patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms, 31 non-COVID-19 patients with severe 
symptoms, and 66 healthy controls. An efficient computational framework 
containing four feature selection methods (LASSO, LightGBM, MCFS, and mRMR) and 
four classification algorithms (DT, KNN, RF, and SVM) was designed to screen 
clinical miRNA markers, and a high-precision RF model with a 0.780 weighted F1 
was constructed. Some miRNAs, including miR-24-3p, whose differential expression 
was discovered in patients with acute lung injury complications brought on by 
severe COVID-19, and miR-148a-3p, differentially expressed against SARS-CoV-2 
structural proteins, were identified, thereby suggesting the effectiveness and 
accuracy of our framework. Meanwhile, we extracted classification rules based on 
the DT model for the quantitative representation of the role of miRNA expression 
in differentiating COVID-19 patients with different severities. The search for 
novel biomarkers that could predict the severity of the disease could aid in the 
clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and in exploring the specific mechanisms of the 
complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, new therapeutic targets 
for the disease may be found."
1198,"Laser acupuncture (LA) has been more applicated in the clinical practice with 
good responses, but the dosage and parameter settings are still inconsistent 
with the arguments. This study is focused on the effect of LA on heart rate 
variability (HRV) with different energy density (ED). Based on the Arndt-Schulz 
law, we hypothesized that the effective range should fall within 0.01 to 10 
J/cm2 of ED, and settings above 10 J/cm2 would perform opposite or inhibitory 
results. We recruited healthy adults in both sexes as subjects and choose 
bilateral PC6 (Neiguan) as the intervention points to observe the HRV indexes 
changes by an external wrist autonomic nerve system (ANS) watch on the left 
forearm. The data from the ANS watch, including heart rate, blood pressure, and 
ANS activity indexes, such as low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), LF%, HF%, 
LF/HF ratio, and so on, were analyzed by the one-way ANOVA method to test the 
possible effect. In this study, every subject received all three different EDs 
of LA in a randomized order. After analyzing the data of 20 subjects, the index 
of HF% was upward and LF/HF ratio was downward when the ED was 7.96 J/cm2. 
Otherwise, the strongest ED 23.87 J/cm2 performed the opposite reaction. 
Appropriately, LA intervention could affect the ANS activities, with the 
tendency to increase the ratio of parasympathetic and decrease the ratio of 
sympathetic nerve system activities with statistically significant results, and 
different ED interventions are consistent with Arndt-Schulz law with opposite 
performance below and above 10 J/cm2."
1199,"(1) Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) represents the third most important 
cardiovascular cause of death after myocardial infarction and stroke. The proper 
management of this condition is dependent on adequate risk stratification, due 
to the life-threatening complications of more aggressive therapies such as 
thrombolysis. Copeptin is a surrogate marker of vasopressin which is found 
increased in several cardiovascular conditions. The Mastora score is an 
imagistic evaluation of the degree of pulmonary arteries thrombotic burden based 
on computed tomography angiography. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the 
diagnostic and prognostic role of copeptin in patients with acute PE. 
Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between copeptin and Mastora score and 
their role in PE risk profiling. (2) Methods: We conducted a single center 
prospective study that included 112 patients with PE and 53 healthy volunteers. 
Clinical and paraclinical parameters, together with plasma levels of copeptin 
and the Mastora score, were evaluated in all patients after admission. (3) 
Results: Copeptin levels were significantly increased in PE patients compared 
with the general population (26.05 vs. 9.5 pmol/L, p &lt; 0.001), while receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an AUC of 0.800 (95% CI 
0.728-0.873, p &lt; 0.001). Copeptin directly correlated with the Mastora score 
(r = 0.535, p = 0.011) and both parameters were strong predictors for adverse 
clinical events and death. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for 
death within 30 days revealed a copeptin cut-off of 38.36 pmol/L, which 
presented a specificity of 79.6% and a sensitivity of 88.9%, and a Mastora score 
cut-off of 82 points, which presented a specificity of 74.8% and a sensitivity 
of 77.8%. (4) Conclusions: Our results showed that copeptin and the Mastora 
score are both correlated with adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in PE 
patients, and this may pave the way for their use in clinical practice, helping 
physicians to select the best therapeutical management."
1200,"Background: Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) takes up a substantial fraction of 
dermatological and plastic surgical outpatient visits and surgeries. NMSC 
develops as an accumulated exposure to UV light with the face most frequently 
diagnosed. Method: This retrospective study investigated the risk of 
complications in relation to full-thickness skin grafts (FTSG) or local flaps in 
607 patients who underwent facial surgery and reconstruction at a high-volume 
center for facial cancer surgery at a tertiary university hospital. Results: 
Between 01.12.2017 and 30.11.2020, 304 patients received reconstructive flap 
surgery and 303 received FTSG following skin cancer removal in the face. Flap 
reconstruction was predominantly performed in the nasal region (78%, n = 237), 
whereas FTSG reconstruction was performed in the nasal (41,6%, n = 126), frontal 
(19.8%, n = 60), and temporal areas (19.8%, n = 60), respectively. Patients 
undergoing FTSGs had a significantly higher risk of hematoma (p = 0.003), 
partial necroses (p &lt; 0.001), and total necroses (p &lt; 0.001) compared to 
flap reconstruction. Age and sex increased the risk of major complications 
(hematoma, partial or total necrosis, wound dehiscence, or infection) for FTSG, 
revealing that men exhibited 3.72 times increased risk of major complications 
compared to women reconstructed with FTSG. A tumor size above 15 mm increased 
the risk of hematoma and necrosis significantly. In summary, local flaps for 
facial reconstruction after skin cancer provide lower complication rate compared 
with FTSGs, especially in elderly and/or male patients. The indication for FTSG 
should be considered critically if the patient's tumor size and location allow 
for both procedures."
1201,"We report a particular case of a spontaneously occurring pregnancy in a 
long-term amenorrheic patient due to a prolactinoma with high serum prolactin 
(PRL) following the failure of dopamine agonist therapy (DA) for infertility. 
Initially, clinical, laboratory, and genital ultrasounds were normal, but the 
serum PRL was 10,074 μIU/mL (n.v.: 127-637 μIU/mL), the PEG fraction was 71% 
(laboratory cut-off &gt; 60%), and luteinizing hormone (LH) was significantly 
lower. An MRI revealed a pituitary tumor of 12.8/10 mm with a subacute 
intratumoral hemorrhage. DA was initiated, and menstrual bleeding reappeared 
with a reduction in the tumor's volume to 1.9/2.2 mm at 12 months. Two years 
later, the patient renounced DA and follow-ups. After another 2 years, she 
became spontaneously pregnant. Serum PRL was 18,325 μIU/mL, and an MRI revealed 
a microprolactinoma of 2.1/2 mm. The patient gave birth to a normal baby at 
term, and she breastfed for six months, after which she asked for ablactation, 
and DA was administered. This case highlights the possibility of the occurrence 
of a normal pregnancy during a long period of amenorrhea induced by a 
microprolactinoma with a high level of serum PRL, even if DA fails to correct 
infertility. There was no compulsory relationship between the tumoral volume's 
evolution and the evolution of its lactophore activity. The hypogonadotrophic 
hypogonadism induced by high PRL was mainly manifested by low LH, and in this 
situation, normal levels of FSH and estradiol do not always induce follicle 
recruitment and development without abnormalities in the ovary ultrasound."
1202,"The aim of this systematic review was to report the evidence on optimal prandial 
timing of insulin bolus in youths with type 1 diabetes. A systematic search was 
performed including studies published in the last 20 years (2002-2022). A PICOS 
framework was used in the selection process and evidence was assessed using the 
GRADE system. Up to one third of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes 
injected rapid-acting insulin analogues after a meal. Moderate-high level 
quality studies showed that a pre-meal bolus compared with a bolus given at the 
start or after the meal was associated with a lower peak blood glucose after one 
to two hours, particularly after breakfast, as well as with reduced HbA1c, 
without any difference in the frequency of hypoglycemia. There were no 
differences related to the timing of bolus in total daily insulin and BMI, 
although these results were based on a single study. Data on individuals' 
treatment satisfaction were limited but did not show any effect of timing of 
bolus on quality of life. In addition, post-prandial administration of 
fast-acting analogues was superior to rapid-acting analogues on post-prandial 
glycemia. There was no evidence for any difference in outcomes related to the 
timing of insulin bolus across age groups in the two studies. In conclusion, 
prandial insulin injected before a meal, particularly at breakfast, provides 
better post-prandial glycemia and HbA1c without increasing the risk of 
hypoglycemia, and without affecting total daily insulin dose and BMI. For young 
children who often have variable eating behaviors, fast-acting analogues 
administered at mealtime or post-meal could provide an additional advantage."
1203,"Hemorrhagic complication (HC) is the most severe complication of intravenous 
thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This study 
aimed to build a machine learning (ML) prediction model and an application 
system for a personalized analysis of the risk of HC in patients undergoing IVT 
therapy. We included patients from Chongqing, Hainan and other centers, 
including Computed Tomography (CT) images, demographics, and other data, before 
the occurrence of HC. After feature engineering, a better feature subset was 
obtained, which was used to build a machine learning (ML) prediction model 
(Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)), and then evaluated with relevant indicators. 
Finally, a prediction model with better performance was obtained. Based on this, 
an application system was built using the Flask framework. A total of 517 
patients were included, of which 332 were in the training cohort, 83 were in the 
internal validation cohort, and 102 were in the external validation cohort. 
After evaluation, the performance of the XGB model is better, with an AUC of 
0.9454 and ACC of 0.8554 on the internal validation cohort, and 0.9142 and ACC 
of 0.8431 on the external validation cohort. A total of 18 features were used to 
construct the model, including hemoglobin and fasting blood sugar. Furthermore, 
the validity of the model is demonstrated through decision curves. Subsequently, 
a system prototype is developed to verify the test prediction effect. The 
clinical decision support system (CDSS) embedded with the XGB model based on 
clinical data and image features can better carry out personalized analysis of 
the risk of HC in intravenous injection patients."
1204,"Hysterectomy is commonly performed for benign gynecological diseases. Minimally 
invasive surgical approaches offer several advantages. Unfortunately, few 
studies have compared the outcomes of different types of minimally invasive 
surgeries. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes of 
robotic hysterectomy (RH) and conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy (CLH) in 
benign gynecologic diseases. We performed a retrospective cohort study at a 
single center between January 2014 and July 2022. A total of 397 patients (RH: 
197 and CLH: 200) who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy for benign 
diseases with uterine size exceeding 250 g were enrolled, and factors related to 
the surgical outcomes were compared. The median age was 46 (range, 35-74) years, 
and the median uterine weight was 400 (range, 250-2720) g. There were no 
significant differences between the two groups regarding age, body mass index, 
uterine weight, hospital stay, estimated blood loss, or operating time. 
Intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were not significantly 
different between the two groups. RH was not inferior to CLH in terms of 
perioperative and immediate postoperative outcomes in our study."
1205,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put a constant strain on hospital 
resources, so there is a dire need for investigation methods that are widely 
available and that can predict mortality and the need for critical care. 
Hematological indices, which can be easily calculated from a complete blood 
count (CBC), are useful in determining a patient's inflammatory response to 
infectious diseases.
AIM: This was a prospective cohort study that aimed to assess the prognostic 
value of scores based on CBCs in hospitalized patients with mild or moderate 
COVID-19 and medical comorbidities regarding the need for intensive care unit 
(ICU) therapy and short-term mortality.
METHODS: We included 607 patients with confirmed COVID-19, followed up for the 
need for ICU admission (15.5%) and 30 day mortality post-discharge (21.7%). 
CBC-derived scores were tested upon emergency department (ED) admission and 
after a median of 8 days.
RESULTS: In a multivariate model, elevated followed-up neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR) predicted increased odds for ICU admission (OR: 1.14 [95%CI: 
1.06-1.22], p &lt; 0.001) and short-term mortality (OR: 1.30 [95%CI: 1.09-1.57], 
p = 0.005). Monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) predicted 2.5-fold increased odds 
for ICU admission and 2.2-fold increased odds for mortality.
CONCLUSION: NLR and MLR followed up 8 days post-admission are predictive for 
adverse outcomes in mild or moderate COVID-19 patients."
1206,"Potential pitfalls of fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements are well-known 
drawbacks of invasive physiology measurement, e.g., significant drift of the 
distal pressure trace may lead to the misclassification of stenoses. Thus, a 
simultaneous waveform analysis of the pressure traces may be of help in the 
quality control of these measurements by online detection of such artefacts as 
the drift or the wedging of the catheter. In the current study, we analysed the 
intracoronary pressure waveform with a dedicated program. In 130 patients, 232 
FFR measurements were performed and derivative pressure curves were calculated. 
Local amplitude around the dicrotic notch was calculated from the distal 
intracoronary pressure traces (δdPn/dt). A unidimensional arterial network model 
of blood flow was employed to simulate the intracoronary pressure traces at 
different flow rates. There was a strong correlation between δdPn/dt values 
measured during hyperaemia and FFR (r = 0.88). Diagnostic performance of distal 
δdPn/dt ≤ 3.52 for the prediction of FFR ≤ 0.80 was 91%. The correlation between 
the pressure gradient and the corresponding δdPn/dt values obtained from all 
measurements independently of the physiological phase was also significant (r = 
0.80). During simulation, the effect of flow rate on δdPn/dt further supported 
the close correlation between the pressure ratios and δdPn/dt. Discordance 
between the FFR and the δdPn/dt can be used as an indicator of possible 
technical problems of FFR measurements. Hence, an online calculation of the 
δdPn/dt may be helpful in avoiding some pitfalls of FFR evaluation."
1207,"Nosocomial infection caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP) 
infection has become a global public health problem. Human NK and NKT cells in 
peripheral immune responses are recognized as occupying a critical role in 
anti-bacterial immunity. Through performed scRNA-seq on serial peripheral blood 
samples from 3 patients with CRKP undergoing colonization, infection, and 
recovery conditions, we were able to described the immune responses of NK and 
NKT cells during CRKP infection and identified a mechanism that could contribute 
to CRKP clearance. The central player of CRKP infection process appears to be 
the NKT subset and CD56hiNKT subset which maintained immune competence during 
CRKP colonization. With time, CRKP leads to the loss of NK and CD160hiNKT cells 
in peripheral blood, resulting in suppressed immune responses and increased 
susceptibility to opportunistic infection. In summary, our study identified a 
possible mechanism for the CRKP invasion and to decipher the clues behind the 
host immune response that influences CRKP infection pathogenesis."
1208,"Background: This study sought to elucidate whether COVID-19 vaccination, during 
gestation or before conception, entails a decreased incidence of severe COVID-19 
disease during pregnancy. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all 
pregnant women that were followed up at a tertiary University Hospital with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed between 1 March 2020 and 30 July 2022. The 
primary outcome of the study was to compare maternal and perinatal outcomes in 
unvaccinated and vaccinated pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Results: A total of 487 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. 
SARS-CoV-2 infection during the third trimester of pregnancy was associated with 
an 89% lower probability of positive cord-blood SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (OR 
0.112; 95% CI 0.039-0.316), compared with infection during the first or the 
second trimester. Vaccinated pregnant women (201 (41.27%)) with COVID-19 had an 
80% lower risk for developing pneumonia and requiring hospital admission due to 
COVID-19 than unvaccinated patients (aOR 0.209; 95% CI 0.044-0.985). Noticeably, 
pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with at least two doses of the 
COVID-19 vaccine did not develop severe COVID-19. Conclusion: Vaccinated women 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy are associated with decreased 
hospital admission due to COVID-19 as well as reduced progression to severe 
COVID-19."
1209,"Several authors reported an increased risk of cancer in SSc patients, including 
breast cancer (BC). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying this association 
have not yet been clarified. SSc and BC share several molecular pathways, which 
seem to play a common etiopathogenetic role. The previously published 
Sclero-Breast study demonstrated the development of BC with a good prognosis 
among these patients, which could be explained by an autoimmune background as a 
possible mechanism for limiting tumor extension. Here, we report the results of 
an IHC analysis of molecular pathways known to be common drivers for both 
diseases, with the aim to better define the mechanisms underlying a good 
prognosis of BC in patients affected by SSc. The analysis demonstrated higher 
TILs rates in all BC subgroups, with a high rate of PD-L1 expression especially 
in TNBC and HER2-positive BC, suggesting a less aggressive behavior in these 
patients compared to the general population. These results support a possible 
de-escalation strategy of cancer therapies in these fragile patients. These data 
could represent a starting point for future prospective studies based on the 
clinical application of these biomarkers with a larger sample size to promote a 
personalized and targeted oncological treatment for this specific subset of 
patients."

1211,"Functional construction of tissue-engineered vessels as an alternative to 
autologous vascular grafts has been shown to be feasible, however the 
proliferation of seeded smooth-muscle cells remains a limiting factor. We 
employed a rotating bioreactor system to improve myoblast cell differentiation 
on a spider silk scaffold for tissue-engineered vessel construction. C2C12 
myofibroblast cells were seeded on the surface of spider silk scaffold 
constructs and cultivated in a rotating bioreactor system with a continuous 
rotation speed (1 rpm). Cell function, cell growth and morphological structure 
and expression of biomarkers were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, 
the LIVE/DEAD® assay, Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR analyses. A 
dense myofibroblast cell sheet could be developed which resembled native blood 
vessel muscular tissue in morphological structure and in function. Bioreactor 
perfusion positively affected cell morphology, and increased cell viability and 
cell differentiation. The expression of desmin, MYF5 and MEF2D surged as an 
indication of myoblast differentiation. Cell-seeded scaffolds showed a tear-down 
at 18 N when strained at a set speed (20 mm min-1). Spider silk scaffolds appear 
to offer a reliable basis for engineered vascular constructs and rotating 
bioreactor cultivation may be considered an effective alternative to complex 
bioreactor setups to improve cell viability and biology."
1212,"Statin therapy has been extensively evaluated and shown to reduce the incidence 
of new or recurrent vascular events, ischemic stroke included. As a consequence, 
each published guideline pushes for lower low-density cholesterol levels in the 
population at large, recommending increased statin doses and/or adding new 
cholesterol-lowering molecules. Neurologists find it sometimes difficult to 
apply these guidelines, having to confront situations such as (1) ischemic 
strokes, mainly cardioembolic ones, in patients with already low LDL-cholesterol 
levels; (2) myasthenic patients, whose lifespan has been extended by available 
treatment, and whose age and cholesterol levels put them at risk for ischemic 
stroke; (3) patients with myotonic dystrophy, whose disease often associates 
diabetes mellitus and heart conduction defects, and in whom blood cholesterol 
management is also not settled. As such, further trials are needed to address 
these issues."
1213,"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's Disease (PD), are a group of heterogeneous diseases that mainly 
affect central nervous system (CNS) functions. A subset of NDDs exhibit CNS 
dysfunction and muscle degeneration, as observed in Gangliosidosis 1 (GM1) and 
late stages of PD. Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are a group of diseases in 
which patients show primary progressive muscle weaknesses, including Duchenne 
Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Pompe disease, and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). NDDs 
and NMDs typically have a genetic component, which affects the physiological 
functioning of critical cellular processes, leading to pathogenesis. Currently, 
there is no cure or efficient treatment for most of these diseases. More than 
200 clinical trials have been completed or are currently underway in order to 
establish safety, tolerability, and efficacy of promising gene therapy 
approaches. Thus, gene therapy-based therapeutics, including viral or non-viral 
delivery, are very appealing for the treatment of NDDs and NMDs. In particular, 
adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are an attractive option for gene therapy 
for NDDs and NMDs. However, limitations have been identified after systemic 
delivery, including the suboptimal capacity of these therapies to traverse the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB), degradation of the particles during the delivery, 
high reactivity of the patient's immune system during the treatment, and the 
potential need for redosing. To circumvent these limitations, several 
preclinical and clinical studies have suggested intrathecal (IT) delivery to 
target the CNS and peripheral organs via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF 
administration can vastly improve the delivery of small molecules and drugs to 
the brain and spinal cord as compared to systemic delivery. Here, we review AAV 
biology and vector design elements, different therapeutic routes of 
administration, and highlight CSF delivery as an attractive route of 
administration. We discuss the different aspects of neuromuscular and 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as pathogenesis, the landscape of mutations, 
and the biological processes associated with the disease. We also describe the 
hallmarks of NDDs and NMDs as well as discuss current therapeutic approaches and 
clinical progress in viral and non-viral gene therapy and enzyme replacement 
strategies for those diseases."
1214,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of minimally 
invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) and traditional open 
transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (OPEN-TLIF) in the treatment of two-level 
lumbar degenerative diseases.
METHODS: The clinical data of 112 patients were retrospectively analyzed, and 
were divided into an MIS-TLIF group and OPEN-TLIF group. The operative time, 
intraoperative fluoroscopy, blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, bed rest 
time, the content of creatine kinase(CK) and complications, were recorded. VAS 
score and ODI index were used to evaluate clinical efficacy. Bridwell grading 
was used to evaluate postoperative interbody fusion. Screw position was 
evaluated by Rao grading.
RESULTS: Compared with the OPEN-TLIF group, the MIS-TLIF group had longer 
operation times, more intraoperative fluoroscopy times, but shorter 
postoperative bed times (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in 
blood loss, postoperative drainage and postoperative CK content between the two 
groups (p &gt; 0.05). There was no difference in VAS score and ODI index during 
the follow-up (p &gt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the 
interbody fusion rate between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). There was no 
significant difference in the distribution of type A screws, but the type B 
screw in the MIS-TLIF group was higher (p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference in 
the incidence of complications between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The postoperative quality of life score and radiological outcomes of 
the two types of surgery in two-level lumbar degenerative diseases was similar, 
and there was no significant difference in muscle injury and complications, but 
the operation time and intraoperative radiation exposurewere higher than in the 
OPEN-TLIF group, and the pedicle screws were more likely to deviate laterally 
out of the vertebral body. Therefore, OPEN-TLIF is recommended for patients with 
lumbar degenerative diseases of two segments."
1215,"Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is associated with high 
morbidity and mortality. Hemodynamic dysfunction plays a significant role in the 
incidence and mortality of SAE. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the 
relationship between hemodynamic indicators and SAE. Methods: 9033 patients with 
sepsis 3.0 were selected in a prospective study cohort. The LASSO regression 
model was used to select characteristic variables and remove the collinearity 
between them. In addition, a generalized additive model was used to find the 
optimal hemodynamic index value for patients with SAE. Multivariate logistic 
regression models, propensity matching scores, inverse probability weighting, 
and doubly robust estimation confirmed the reliability of the study results 
(i.e., the optimal hemodynamic indicators targeting patients with SAE). Results: 
A mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, and 
lactate levels ≤ 3.5 mmol/L decrease the incidence of SAE, whereas a mean 
arterial pressure ≥ 59 mmHg and lactate levels ≤ 4.5 mmol/L decrease the 28-day 
mortality in patients with SAE. Conclusions: The hemodynamic indices of patients 
with SAE should be maintained at certain levels to reduce the incidence and 
mortality in patients with SAE, such that the mean arterial pressure is ≥65 
mmHg, lactate levels are ≤3.5 mmol/L, and systolic blood pressure is ≥90 mmHg. 
These hemodynamic indicators should be targeted in patients with SAE."
1216,"Isolated elevation of γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), a microsomal membrane-bound 
protein, is commonly observed in non-obese Koreans without diabetes, and its 
clinical implications are not well-known. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the 
longitudinal effect of isolated GGT on the incidence of ischemic heart disease 
(IHD) risk in a large cohort of lean non-diabetic Koreans. Data were obtained 
from the Health Risk Assessment Study (HERAS) and Korea Health Insurance Review 
and Assessment (HIRA) datasets. The participants were divided into four groups 
according to the GGT quartile after the exclusion of those participants with 
diabetes, a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 
40 IU/L, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT &gt; 1.5, as well as those 
positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody. We 
prospectively assessed the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for IHD using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models over 
a 50-month period. During the follow-up period, 183 individuals (1.85%) 
developed IHD. After setting the lowest GGT quartile as a reference group, the 
HRs of IHD for GGT quartiles 2-4 were 1.66 (95% CI 0.95-2.89), 1.82 (95% CI 
1.05-3.16), and 1.98 (95% CI 1.12-3.50), respectively, after adjusting for age, 
sex, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, 
mean arterial blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and dyslipidemia. An 
isolated high GGT may be an additional measure for assessing and managing future 
IHD risks among lean Koreans without diabetes."
1217,"In 1979, development of the first polymer drug SMANCS [styrene-co-maleic acid 
(SMA) copolymer conjugated to neocarzinostatin (NCS)] by Maeda and colleagues 
was a breakthrough in the cancer field. When SMANCS was administered to mice, 
drug accumulation in tumors was markedly increased compared with accumulation of 
the parental drug NCS. This momentous result led to discovery of the enhanced 
permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) in 1986. Later, the EPR effect 
became known worldwide, especially in nanomedicine, and is still believed to be 
a universal mechanism for tumor-selective accumulation of nanomedicines. Some 
research groups recently characterized the EPR effect as a controversial concept 
and stated that it has not been fully demonstrated in clinical settings, but 
this erroneous belief is due to non-standard drug design and use of 
inappropriate tumor models in investigations. Many research groups recently 
provided solid evidence of the EPR effect in human cancers (e.g., renal and 
breast), with significant diversity and heterogeneity in various patients. In 
this review, we focus on the dynamics of the EPR effect and restoring tumor 
blood flow by using EPR effect enhancers. We also discuss new applications of 
EPR-based nanomedicine in boron neutron capture therapy and photodynamic therapy 
for solid tumors."
1218,"Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by organ and 
tissue fibrosis in which the incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular 
events is increased, although the exact underlying mechanism remains unclear. 
Arterial stiffness is a marker of vascular damage that can predict 
cardiovascular events; therefore, this study aimed to assess the augmentation 
index (AIx) and pulse wave velocity (PWV), markers of stiffness, in a Systemic 
Sclerosis population and to detect potentially associated variables. Fourteen 
female Systemic Sclerosis patients and 14 age- and sex-matched controls were 
enrolled. Demographic, anthropometric, sero-hematological parameters and disease 
characteristics were collected for each participant. Arterial stiffness was 
evaluated using an applanation tonometry system. No differences were found 
between groups, except for BMI, fasting blood glucose, red blood cells count, 
hemoglobin, and treatment. Patients had increased augmentation index than the 
controls (p = 0.008). PWV was significantly decreased in SSc patients compared 
with the controls (p = 0.007). PWV was correlated with age (r = 0.462; p = 
0.048) and BMI (r = 0.458; p = 0.050). Finally, patients with no specific 
auto-antibody pattern had greater AIx than those expressing anticentromere 
antibodies. Our study demonstrated that SSc patients had greater AIx, but lower 
PWV than the controls. In addition, few variables were correlated to arterial 
stiffness. Further studies are necessary to validate these findings and to 
establish medication's role in modifying cardiovascular risk."
1219,"We have previously surveyed a panel of 508 physicians from around the world 
about which biomarkers would be relevant if obtained in a very short time frame, 
corresponding to emergency situations (life-threatening or not). The biomarkers 
that emerged from this study were markers of cardiovascular disease: troponin, 
D-dimers, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Cardiovascular disease is a group 
of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels. At the intersection of 
medicine, basic research and engineering, biosensors that address the need for 
rapid biological analysis could find a place of choice in the hospital or 
primary care ecosystem. Rapid, reliable, and inexpensive analysis with a 
multi-marker approach, including machine learning analysis for patient risk 
analysis, could meet the demand of medical teams. The objective of this opinion 
review, proposed by a multidisciplinary team of experts (physicians, biologists, 
market access experts, and engineers), is to present cases where a rapid 
biological response is indeed valuable, to provide a short overview of current 
biosensor technologies for cardiac biomarkers designed for a short result time, 
and to discuss existing market access issues."
1220,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a serious complication 
occurring as a consequence of immunosuppression in the setting of allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) or solid organ 
transplantation (SOT). The majority of PTLD arises from B-cells, and 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is present in 60-80% of the cases, revealing 
the central role played by the latent infection in the pathogenesis of the 
disease. Therefore, EBV serological status is considered the most important risk 
factor associated with PTLDs, together with the depth of T-cell 
immunosuppression pre- and post-transplant. However, despite the advances in 
pathogenesis understanding and the introduction of novel treatment options, PTLD 
arising after alloHSCT remains a particularly challenging disease, and there is 
a need for consensus on how to treat rituximab-refractory cases. This review 
aims to explore the pathogenesis, risk factors, and treatment options of PTLD in 
the alloHSCT setting, finally focusing on adoptive immunotherapy options, namely 
EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (EBV-CTL) and chimeric antigen receptor 
T-cells (CAR T)."
1221,"BACKGROUND: To investigate changes over the last decades in the management of 
postoperative complications following pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) with special 
emphasis on reoperations, their indications, and outcomes.
METHODS: 409 patients who underwent PD between 2008 and 2021 were 
retrospectively analyzed with respect to their need for reoperations 
(reoperation, n = 81, 19.8% vs. no reoperation, n = 328, 80.2%). The cohort was 
then compared to a second cohort comprising patients who underwent PD between 
1989 and 2007 (n = 285).
RESULTS: 81 patients (19.8%) underwent reoperation. The main cause of 
reoperation was the dehiscence of pancreatogastrostomy (22.2%). Reoperation was 
associated with a longer duration of the index operation, more blood loss, and 
more erythrocyte concentrates being transfused. Patients who underwent 
reoperation showed more postoperative complications and a higher mortality rate 
(25% vs. 2%, p &lt; 0.001). Compared to the earlier cohort, the observed 
increase in reoperations did not lead to increased mortality (5% vs. 6%, p = 
353).
CONCLUSIONS: The main cause for reoperation has changed over the last decades 
and was the dehiscence of pancreatogastrostomy. Associated with a leakage of 
pancreatic fluid and clinically relevant PF, it remains the most devastating 
complication following PD. Strategies for prevention and treatment, e.g., by 
endoscopic vacuum-assisted-closure therapy are of utmost importance."
1222,"There is limited evidence of a natural course of an upper gastrointestinal 
(UGI)-subepithelial lesion (SEL) of 2 cm or less in size. This study aims to 
determine the natural course of UGI-SELs and find the risk factors of the 
endoscopic and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) findings associated with an 
increase in size. The medical records of 2539 patients with UGI-SELs between 
2004 and 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. A total of 672 SELs of 2 cm or less 
in size were analyzed through EUS and followed up for at least 36 months. The 
mean follow-up duration was 68 months (range: 36-190 months), and 97 SELs 
(14.4%) showed an increase in size with a mean increase rate of 1.2 mm/year. 
Initial size (aOR 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.06), an endoscopic 
finding of a hemorrhagic spot (aOR 3.13, 95% CI 1.14-8.60), and an EUS finding 
of a lesion in the fourth layer (aOR 1.87, 95% CI (1.21-2.88) were related to an 
increase in size. An endoscopic finding of translucidity (aOR 0.28, 95% CI 
(0.10-0.76) and an EUS finding of calcification (aOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09-0.95) 
were inversely related to an increase in size. There was no death related to 
UGI-SELs during the follow-up. While most UGI-SELs of 2 cm or less in size 
showed no significant size change and favorable prognosis, an individualized 
follow-up strategy needs to be considered in case of the presence of hemorrhagic 
spots and lesions in the fourth layer."
1223,"Current therapeutic strategies for acute heart failure (AHF) are based on 
traditional inotropic agents that are often associated with untoward effects; 
therefore, finding new effective approaches with a safer profile is dramatically 
needed. Istaroxime is a novel compound, chemically unrelated to cardiac 
glycosides, that is currently being studied for the treatment of AHF. Its 
effects are essentially related to its inotropic and lusitropic positive 
properties exerted through a dual mechanism of action: activation of the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase isoform 2a (SERCA2a) and inhibition of the 
Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity. The advantages of istaroxime over the available 
inotropic agents include its lower arrhythmogenic action combined with its 
capability of increasing systolic blood pressure without augmenting heart rate. 
However, it has a limited half-life (1 hour) and is associated with adverse 
effects including pain at the injection site and gastrointestinal issues. 
Herein, we describe the main mechanism of action of istaroxime and we present a 
systematic overview of both clinical and preclinical trials testing this drug, 
underlining the latest insights regarding its adoption in clinical practice for 
AHF."
1224,"This study aimed to identify factors predicting the probability of serious fetal 
acidemia at delivery in placental abruption. We identified 5769 women who 
delivered at &gt;22 weeks' gestation at two institutions in a tertiary referral 
unit specializing in neonatal infant care between January 2007 and December 
2011. Ninety-one abruption cases were identified based on clinical and 
histological diagnoses. Serious fetal acidemia was defined as a pH &lt; 7.0 in 
the umbilical arterial blood at delivery. Using a linear discriminant function, 
we calculated the score to determine the probability of serious fetal acidemia. 
Serious fetal acidemia was observed in 34 patients (37.4%). A logistic 
regression model showed that abnormal fetal heart rate patterns (bradycardia and 
late decelerations), uterine spasm, and maternal plasma concentration of 
fibrinogen less than 288 ng/dL were significantly associated with the occurrence 
of serious fetal acidemia. We suggest that the implementation of maternal 
fibrinogen in patients with placental abruption is a prognostic factor for 
serious fetal acidemia at delivery."
1225,"The main goal of our study was to evaluate the surgical technique, the 
feasibility and patient's satisfaction of multiple surgeries: Risk-reducing 
salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) combined with mastectomy in patients with BRCA 1-2 
mutation carriers. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with BRCA 
1-2 variants who underwent RRSO combined with risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy 
(RRBM) or surgeries for breast cancer from January-2015 to December-2021. We 
collected data about surgeries, complications, and patients' satisfaction using 
a questionnaire submitted 30 days after surgery. We included 54 patients. 
Forty-eight patients underwent RRSO, and six patients underwent RRSO + Total 
laparoscopic hysterectomy (LTH). The minor postoperative complications within 30 
days were four: one breast seromas aspiration (1.9%), one infectious 
reconstructive complication treated with antibiotics therapy (1.9%), one 
Red-Breast-Syndrome (1.9%) and one trocar abdominal hematoma (1.9%) associated 
with RRSO. The major postoperative complications within 30 days were five: two 
evacuations of a breast hematoma (3.7%) and three infectious reconstructive 
complications treated with removal expander/implant (5.6%). No postoperative 
complications after 30 days were observed. According to the satisfaction 
questionnaire, more than 90% of patients were satisfied and would have combined 
surgery again. In conclusion, the multiple surgeries seem feasible and safety 
with a single anesthesia, a single surgical time, a single postoperative 
recovery, and a high patients' satisfactions without increasing morbidity."
1226,"This study aimed to explore the effect of repeated low-level red light (RLRL) on 
axial length (AL), choroid blood flow, and anterior segment components in myopic 
adults. Ninety-eight myopic adults were randomly divided into the RLRL group (n 
= 52) and the control group (n = 46). Subjects in the RLRL group completed a 
4-week treatment composed of a 3-min RLRL treatment session twice daily, with an 
interval of at least 4 h. Visits were scheduled before and on 7, 14, 21, and 28 
days after the treatment. AL, subfoveal choroidal thickness (SChT), choroidal 
vascularity index (CVI), and anterior segment parameters were measured at each 
visit. A linear mixed-effects model showed that the AL of the subjects in RLRL 
decreased from 24.63 ± 1.04 mm to 24.57 ± 1.04 mm, and the SChT thickened by 
18.34 μm. CVI had a slight but significant increase in the 0-6 zone. However, 
all the anterior segment parameters did not change after RLRL treatment. Our 
study showed that the choroid's thickening is insufficient to explain the axial 
length shortening. The unchanged anterior segment and improved choroid blood 
flow suggest that the AL shortening in this study is mainly related to changes 
in the posterior segment."
1227,"Certain blood biomarkers are associated with neural protection and neural 
plasticity in healthy people and individuals with prior brain injury. To date, 
no studies have evaluated the effects chiropractic care on serum brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) and glial 
cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in people with stroke. This manuscript 
reports pre-specified, exploratory, secondary outcomes from a previously 
completed parallel group randomized controlled trial. We evaluated differences 
between four weeks of chiropractic spinal adjustments combined with the usual 
physical therapy (chiro + PT) and sham chiropractic with physical therapy (sham 
+ PT) on resting serum BDNF, IGF-II and GDNF in 63 adults with chronic stroke. 
Blood samples were assessed at baseline, four weeks (post-intervention), and 
eight weeks (follow-up). Data were analyzed using a linear multivariate mixed 
effects model. Within both groups there was a significant decrease in the mean 
log-concentration of BDNF and IGF-II at each follow-up, and significant increase 
log-concentration of GDNF at eight-weeks' follow-up. However, no significant 
between-group differences in any of the blood biomarkers at each time-point were 
found. Further research is required to explore which factors influence changes 
in serum BDNF, IGF-II and GDNF following chiropractic spinal adjustments and 
physical therapy."
1228,"A radiosynovectomy (RS) should be indicated when recurrent articular bleeds 
related to chronic hemophilia synovitis (CHS) exist, established by clinical 
examination, and confirmed by imaging techniques that cannot be constrained with 
hematological prophylaxis. RS can be performed at any point in life, mainly in 
adolescents (&gt;13-14 years) and adults. Intraarticular injection (IAI) of a 
radioactive material in children might be arduous since we need child 
collaboration which might include general anesthesia. RS is our initial option 
for management of CHS. For the knee joint we prescribe Yttrium-90, while for the 
elbow and ankle we prescribe Rhenium-186 (1 to 3 IAIs every 6 months). The 
procedure is greatly cost efficient when compared to surgical synovectomy. 
Chemical synovectomy with rifampicin has been reported to be efficacious, 
inexpensive, simple, and especially practical in developing countries where 
radioactive materials are not easily available. Rifampicin seems to be more 
efficacious when it is utilized in small joints (elbows and ankles), than when 
utilized in bigger ones (knees). When RS and/or chemical synovectomy fail, 
arthroscopic synovectomy (or open synovectomy in some cases) should be 
indicated. For us, surgery must be performed after the failure of 3 RSs with 
6-month interims. RS is an effective and minimally invasive intervention for 
treatment of repeated articular bleeds due to CHS. Although it has been 
published that the risk of cancer does not increase, and that the amount of 
radioactive material used in RS is insignificant, the issue of chromosomal 
and/or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) changes remains a concern and continued 
surveillance is critical. As child and adulthood prophylaxis becomes more 
global, RS might become obsolete in the long-term."
1229,"BACKGROUND: Perioperative hemodynamic instability is one of the most common 
adverse events in patients undergoing adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma. The 
aim of this study was to analyze the impact of perioperative severe hemodynamic 
instability.
METHODS: We present a retrospective, single-center analysis in a major tertiary 
hospital of all consecutive patients undergoing elective adrenalectomy from 2005 
to 2019 for pheochromocytoma. Severe perioperative hypertension and hypotension 
were evaluated, defined as changes in blood pressure larger than 30% of the 
preoperative patient-specific mean arterial pressure (MAP).
RESULTS: Unilateral adrenalectomy was performed in 67 patients. Intraoperative 
episodes of hemodynamic instability occurred in 97% of all patients (n = 65), 
severe hypertension occurred in 24 patients (36%), and severe hypotensive 
episodes occurred in 62 patients (93%). Patients with more than five severe 
hypotensive episodes (n = 29) received higher preoperative alpha-adrenergic 
blockades (phenoxybenzamine 51 ± 50 mg d-1 vs. 29 ± 27 mg d-1; p = 0.023) and 
had a longer mean ICU stay (39.6 ± 41.5 h vs. 20.6 ± 19.1 h, p = 0.015).
CONCLUSION: Intraoperative hypotensive, rather than hypertensive, episodes 
occurred during adrenalectomy. The occurrence of more than five hypotensive 
episodes correlated well with a significantly longer hospital stay and ICU time."
1230,"The survival rate of preterm infants is increasing as a result of technological 
advances. The incidence of intraventricular hemorrhages (IVH) in preterm infants 
ranges from 25% to 30%, of which 30% to 50% are severe IVH (Volpe III-IV, Volpe 
III is defined as intraventricular bleeding occupying more than 50% of the 
ventricular width and acute lateral ventricle dilatation, Volpe IV is defined as 
intraventricular hemorrhage combined with venous infarction) and probably lead 
to posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD). Severe IVH and subsequent PHVD 
have become the leading causes of brain injury and neurodevelopmental dysplasia 
in preterm infants. This review aims to review the literature on the diagnosis 
and therapeutic strategies for PHVD and provide some recommendations for 
management to improve the neurological outcomes."
1231,"Smoking habit is still fairly common among asthmatics. So far, the impact of 
smoke on severe asthma burden has not been specifically investigated. We aimed 
to estimate the frequency of smoking habit among severe asthma patients, their 
clinical features, and the impact of smoke on asthma outcomes. The Severe Asthma 
Network in Italy (SANI) registry was analyzed. Demographic, clinical, and 
functional features of smokers, never and former smokers were compared. Data 
from 1194 patients were explored. Smokers were younger, with a lower asthma 
onset age. Atopy, BMI and respiratory/systemic comorbidities were equally 
distributed. In former smokers pre- and post-FEV1/FVC was significantly lower; 
no other significant differences were detected. Similar findings were confirmed 
when stratifying the former smokers by pack-years and length of smoking 
cessation. Among former smokers, lymphocytes and neutrophils were higher in the 
&lt;15 years of smoking cessation group. Blood eosinophils were comparable in 
never and former smokers. When clustering the population by blood eosinophils, 
no significant differences in pulmonary function and exacerbations were 
observed. Our data suggest that a personal smoking history has a relatively low 
impact on disease burden. It remarks the importance of smoking cessation as a 
main intervention, particularly in severe asthma."
1232,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used in patients with sickle cell disease 
(SCD) to detect silent cerebral infarcts. MR angiography (MRA) can identify 
arterial stenoses and intracranial aneurysms (ICANs) associated with SCD. In 
this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of ICANs in asymptomatic adult 
patients with SCD referred from the SCD clinic for routine screening by MRI/MRA 
using a 3T-MRI scanner. Findings were independently reviewed by two 
neuroradiologists. Between 2016 and 2020, 245 asymptomatic adults with SCD were 
stratified according to genotype (SS/S-β0thalassemia and SC/Sβ+). ICANs were 
found in 27 patients (11%; 0.95 CI: 8-16%). ICANs were more frequent in 
SS/S-β0thalassemia patients (20/118 or 17%; 0.95 CI: 11-25%) than in SC/βb+ 
patients (7/127 or 6%; 0.95 CI: 2-11%; p = 0.007). Individuals with SCD 
(particularly SS/S-β0thalassemia) have a higher prevalence of ICANs than the 
general population. We believe that MRA should be considered in the current 
American Society of Hematology guidelines, which already contain a 
recommendation for MRI at least once in adult SCD patients. However, the 
clinical significance of preventive treatment of unruptured aneurysms remains 
controversial."
1233,"BACKGROUND: A flow limitation in the iliac arteries (FLIA) in endurance athletes 
is notoriously difficult to diagnose with the currently available diagnostic 
tools. At present, a commonly used diagnostic measure is a decrease in ankle 
brachial index with flex hips (ABIFlexed) following a maximal effort exercise 
test. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique that 
measures skeletal muscle oxygenation as reflected by the balance of O2 delivery 
from microvascular blood flow and O2 uptake by metabolic activity. Therefore, 
NIRS potentially serves as a novel technique for diagnosing FLIA. The purpose of 
this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of NIRS-derived absolute, 
amplitude, and kinetic variables in legs during and after a maximal exercise 
test with ABIFlexed.
METHODS: ABIFlexed and NIRS were studied in 33 healthy subjects and 201 patients 
with FLIA diagnosed with echo-Doppler.
RESULTS: After maximal exercise, NIRS kinetic variables, such as the half value 
time and mean response time, resulted in a range of 0.921 to 0.939 AUC for the 
diagnosis of FLIA when combined with ABIFlexed. Conversely, ABIFlexed 
measurements alone conferred significantly worse test characteristics (AUC 
0.717, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: NIRS may serve as a diagnostic adjunct in patients with possible 
FLIA."
1234,"This study was performed to evaluate the systemic oxidative stress balance in 
women with either ovarian or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) and any 
alterations of the same during hormone therapy. Free oxygen radicals (FORT) and 
free oxidant radical defense (FORD) were measured in the capillary blood of 24 
women without endometriosis, 26 women with endometrioma, and 26 women with DIE 
with or without endometrioma. Endometriosis was diagnosed by clinical and 
ultrasound assessment. Dietary factors, lifestyle habits, and intake of any 
substances interfering with the oxidative status were recorded. Women were 
prescribed contraceptive hormones, and the baseline assessments were repeated at 
the 3rd month of use, revealing a higher oxidative stress balance (FORT/FORD) in 
women with endometriosis than in controls (4.75 ± 4.4 vs. 2.79 ± 2.2; p = 0.05). 
The highest values were found in women with DIE (5.34 ± 4.6; p = 0.028 vs. 
controls). Regression analysis revealed an independent link between FORT/FORD 
and endometrioma (b 2.874, 95% CI 0.345, 5.403; p = 0.027) and DIE (b 4.419, 95% 
CI 1.775, 7.064; p = 0.001) but a negative correlation with HDL-cholesterol (b 
-0.063, 95% CI -0.125, -0.002; p = 0.043). In controls, the hormone therapy 
increased FORT (p = 0.003), but also FORD (p = 0.012), with the FORT/FORD 
balance remaining stable (2.72 ± 2.2 vs. 2.73 ± 1.8; p = 0.810). In women with 
endometriosis, FORT remained unchanged, but FORD increased (p = 0.004), and the 
FORT/FORD ratio significantly decreased (4.75 ± 4.4 vs. 2.57 ± 1.76; p = 0.002) 
to values similar to the control levels. These data indicate that systemic 
oxidative stress balance increased in women with endometriosis, particularly in 
those with DIE. The hormonal therapy did not change the oxidative stress balance 
in control women but significantly improved it in women with endometriosis, 
particularly those suffering from DIE."
1235,"Background: The guidelines recommend intensive blood pressure control. 
Randomized trials have focused on the relevance of the systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) lowering, leaving the safety of the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
reduction unresolved. There are data available which show that low DBP should 
not stop clinicians from achieving SBP targets; however, registries and analyses 
of randomized trials present conflicting results. The purpose of the study was 
to apply machine learning (ML) algorithms to determine, whether DBP is an 
important risk factor to predict stroke, heart failure (HF), myocardial 
infarction (MI), and primary outcome in the SPRINT trial database. Methods: ML 
experiments were performed using decision tree, random forest, k-nearest 
neighbor, naive Bayesian, multi-layer perceptron, and logistic regression 
algorithms, including and excluding DBP as the risk factor in an unselected and 
selected (DBP &lt; 70 mmHg) study population. Results: Including DBP as the risk 
factor did not change the performance of the machine learning models evaluated 
using accuracy, AUC, mean, and weighted F-measure, and was not required to make 
proper predictions of stroke, MI, HF, and primary outcome. Conclusions: Analyses 
of the SPRINT trial data using ML algorithms imply that DBP should not be 
treated as an independent risk factor when intensifying blood pressure control."
1236,"Early therapies to prevent severe COVID-19 have an unclear impact on patients 
with hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to assess their 
efficacy in this group of high-risk patients with COVID-19 in preventing 
hospitalizations and reducing the SARS-CoV-2 shedding. This was a single-center, 
retrospective, observational study conducted in the Fondazione IRCSS Policlinico 
San Matteo of Pavia, Northern Italy. We extracted the data of patients with 
hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 who received and did not receive early 
COVID-19 treatment between 23 December 2021, and May 2022. We used a Cox 
proportional hazard model to assess whether receiving any early treatment was 
associated with lower rates of hospitalization and reduced viral shedding. Data 
from 88 patients with hematologic malignancies were extracted. Among the 
patients, 55 (62%) received any early treatment, whereas 33 (38%) did not. 
Receiving any early therapy did not significantly reduce the hospitalization 
rate in patients with hematologic malignancies (HR 0.51; SE 0.63; p-value = 
0.28), except in the vaccinated non-responders subgroup of patients with 
negative anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the time of infection, who benefited from 
early therapies against SARS-CoV-2 (HR 0.07; SE 1.04; p-value = 0.001). 
Moreover, no difference on viral load decay was observed. In our cohort of 
patients with hematologic malignancies infected with SARS-CoV-2, early treatment 
were not effective in reducing the hospitalization rate due to COVID-19, neither 
in reducing its viral shedding."
1237,"PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate predictors of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage 
(sICH) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients following thrombectomy due to 
anterior large vessel occlusion (LVO).
METHODS: Data on stroke patients from January 2018 to December 2020 in a 
tertiary care centre were retrospectively analysed. sICH was defined as 
intracranial hemorrhage associated with a deterioration of at least four points 
in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or hemorrhage 
leading to death. A smoothed ridge regression model was run to analyse the 
impact of 15 variables on their association with sICH.
RESULTS: Of the 174 patients (median age 77, 41.4% male), sICH was present in 18 
patients. Short procedure time from groin puncture to reperfusion (per 10 min OR 
1.24; 95% CI 1.071-1.435; p = 0.004) and complete reperfusion (TICI 3) (OR 
0.035; 95% CI 0.003-0.378; p = 0.005) were significantly associated with a lower 
risk of sICH. On the contrary, successful reperfusion (TICI 3 and TICI 2b) was 
not associated with a lower risk of sICH (OR 0.508; 95% CI 0.131-1.975, p = 
0.325). Neither the total time from symptom onset to reperfusion nor the 
intravenous thrombolysis was a predictor of sICH (per 10 min OR 1.0; 95% CI 
0.998-1.001, p = 0.745) (OR 1.305; 95% CI 0.338-5.041, p = 0.697).
CONCLUSION: Our findings addressed the paramount importance of short procedure 
time and complete reperfusion to minimize sICH risk. The total ischemic time 
from onset to reperfusion was not a predictor of sICH."
1238,"Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare immune-mediated 
vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). 
Having systemic and possibly severe involvement, a prompt recognition of its 
clinical features is crucial to achieve favorable patient outcomes. Although 
cutaneous manifestations represent key elements, these still remain poorly 
characterized. We report a case of ANCA-positive EGPA presenting with palpable 
purpura, livedo reticularis, and pemphigoid-like lesions that was successfully 
treated with glucocorticoid therapy and rituximab. This report portrays the 
evolution of cutaneous lesions in ANCA-positive EGPA and demonstrates how 
dermatologic signs may represent indicators of active disease, allowing for 
timely diagnosis and for the monitoring of disease activity during treatment."
1239,"Kidney transplantation is the preferred method for selected patients with kidney 
failure. Despite major improvements over the last decades, a significant 
proportion of organs are still lost every year. Causes of graft loss and 
impaired graft function are incompletely understood and prognostic tools are 
lacking. Here, we describe baseline characteristics and outcomes of the 
non-interventional Transplant Outcome Prediction Validation Study (TOPVAS). A 
total of 241 patients receiving a non-living kidney transplant were recruited in 
three Austrian transplantation centres and treated according to local practices. 
Clinical information as well as blood and urine samples were obtained at 
baseline and consecutive follow-ups up to 24 months. Out of the overall 16 graft 
losses, 11 occurred in the first year. The patient survival rate was 96.7% (95% 
CI: 94.3-99.1%) in the first year and 94.3% (95% CI: 91.1-97.7%) in the second 
year. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) improved from 37.1 ± 14.0 
mL/min/1.73 m2 at hospital discharge to 45.0 ± 14.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 24 months. 
The TOPVAS study provides information on current kidney graft and patient 
survival, eGFR trajectories, and rejection rates, as well as infectious and 
surgical complication rates under different immunosuppressive drug regimens. 
More importantly, it provides an extensive and well-characterized biobank for 
the future discovery and validation of prognostic methods."
1240,"The wide use of ruxolitinib, approved for treating primary and secondary 
myelofibrosis (MF), has revolutionized the landscape of these diseases. This 
molecule can reduce spleen volume and constitutional symptoms, guaranteeing 
patients a better quality of life and survival or even a valid bridge to bone 
marrow transplantation. Despite a rapid response within the first 3 to 6 months 
of treatment, some patients fail to achieve a significant benefit or lose early 
response. After ruxolitinib failure, new drugs are available to provide an 
additional therapeutic option for these patients. However, the correct timing 
point for deciding on a therapy shift is still an open challenge. Recently, a 
clinical prognostic score named RR6 (Response to Ruxolitinib after 6 months) was 
proposed to determine survival after 6 months of treatment with ruxolitinib in 
patients affected by MF. We applied this model to a cohort of consecutive 
patients treated at our center to validate the results obtained in terms of 
median overall survival (mOS): for the low-risk class, mOS was not reached (as 
in the training cohort); for the intermediate-risk, mOS was 52 months (95% CI 
39-106); for the high-risk, it was 33 (95% 8.5-59). Moreover, in addition to the 
other studies present in the literature, we evaluated how the new RR6 score 
could better identify primary MF patients at high risk, with a slight or no 
agreement compared to DIPSS, contrary to what occurs in secondary MF. Thus, we 
were able to confirm the predictive power of the RR6 model in our series, which 
might be of help in guiding future therapeutic choices."
1241,"The aim of this retrospective study has been to compare the surgical outcomes of 
patients undergoing superficial parotidectomy with three different instruments: 
bipolar electrocautery, ultrasound, and mixed energy instruments. The clinical 
records of 102 patients who had undergone superficial parotidectomy for benign 
tumors between January 2016 and April 2022 were considered. Based on the tool 
used during the surgery, the patients were divided into three study groups: 
classic electrocautery hemostasis group (CH group), ultrasonic instrument group 
(HA group), and combined energy instrument group (TB group). The duration of 
surgery, the total post-operative drainage volume, and the intra-operative blood 
loss were significantly higher in the CH group compared to the HA and the TB 
group, while the differences were not significant between the latter two groups. 
Facial nerve weakness was detected in 45.9% of the CH group, 12.5% of the HA 
group, and 21.2% of the TB group. The rate of facial nerve dysfunction in the CH 
group was significantly higher than in the HA group (0.011). In the patients who 
experienced post-operative facial nerve dysfunction, the recovery time was 
significantly shorter in the HA group compared to the CH and the TB group. The 
HA and TB groups have demonstrated comparable and significantly better surgical 
outcomes than bipolar electrocautery. Ultrasound instruments have been shown to 
cause, in comparison with the other techniques, a lower rate of temporary facial 
nerve dysfunction and, if this is present, lead to a faster spontaneous recovery 
time."
1242,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) represented 
a significant challenge for the medical community. The first aim of this study 
was to examine the COVID-19 impact on the follow-up of patients with dilated 
cardiomyopathy (DCM) and to establish the advantages of multiparametric home 
monitoring. Also, we tried to establish the main prognostic predictors at 
2-years follow-up and the value of LV diastolic filling pattern (LVDFP) in 
increasing mortality and morbidity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 142 patients with DCM 
assessed by in-patient visit in the pre-pandemic period and hybrid 
(face-to-face, online consultation and telemedicine home monitoring with a 
dedicated application) during the pandemic period. The statistical analysis 
compared the strategy used in the pre-pandemic with management during the 
pandemic, in terms of clinical assessment, hospitalizations/emergency room 
visits due to HF exacerbation and total mortality.
RESULTS: We did not observe significant changes in blood pressure (BP), heart 
rate (FC), weight and symptoms or an increased rate of adverse drug events 
between the two periods. We successfully titrated HF medications with close 
monitoring of HF decompensations, which were similar in number, but were mostly 
managed at home during the pandemic. There was also no statistically significant 
difference in emergency room visits due to severe decompensated HF. Mortality in 
the first and second year of follow-up was between 12.0 and 13%, similar in the 
pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, but significantly higher in patients with 
restrictive LVDFP. Clinical improvement or stability after 2 years was more 
frequent in patients with nonrestrictive LVDFP. The main prognostic predictors 
at 1 and 2-years follow-up were: the restrictive LVDFP, significantly dilated 
LV, comorbidities (DM, COPD), older age, associated severe mitral regurgitation 
and pulmonary hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic restrictions determined a marked decrease of the 
healthcare use, but no significant change in the clinical status of DCM patients 
under multiparametric home monitoring. At 2-years follow-up, the presence of the 
restrictive LVDFP was associated with an increased risk of death and with a 
worse clinical status in DCM patients."
1243,"Acute cerebral stroke is a leading cause of disability and death, which could be 
reduced with a prompt diagnosis during patient transportation to the hospital. A 
portable retina imaging system could enable this by measuring vascular 
information and blood perfusion in the retina and, due to the homology between 
retinal and cerebral vessels, infer if a cerebral stroke is underway. However, 
the feasibility of this strategy, the imaging features, and retina imaging 
modalities to do this are not clear. In this work, we show initial evidence of 
the feasibility of this approach by training machine learning models using 
feature engineering and self-supervised learning retina features extracted from 
OCT-A and fundus images to classify controls and acute stroke patients. Models 
based on macular microvasculature density features achieved an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.87-0.88. Self-supervised deep 
learning models were able to generate features resulting in AUCs ranging from 
0.66 to 0.81. While further work is needed for the final proof for a diagnostic 
system, these results indicate that microvasculature density features from OCT-A 
images have the potential to be used to diagnose acute cerebral stroke from the 
retina."
1244,"BACKGROUND: Platelets play a role in venous thromboembolism (VTE) and in 
mediating colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Still, platelets' role in 
hypercoagulability after surgical intervention for metastatic bone disease (MBD) 
is ill-defined.
METHODS: In this quantitative observational study, we utilized a high-resolution 
imaging approach to temporally examine platelet procoagulant membrane dynamics 
(PMD) in four patients with MBD from primary CRC (CRC/MBD), before and after 
surgical intervention, over a 6-month period. We coupled this investigation with 
thrombelastography, quantitative plasma shotgun proteomics, and biochemical 
analysis.
RESULTS: The plasma of CRC/MBD patients was enriched in ADAM1a, ADAMTS7, and 
physiological ligands for platelet glycoprotein-VI/spleen tyrosine kinase 
(GPVI/Syk) activation. Thromboprophylaxis attenuated procoagulation upon its 
initial prescription (post-operative day one, POD1); however, all patients 
experienced rebound procoagulation between POD3 and POD14, which was associated 
with Syk activation (Y525/Y526) in all patients, and a VTE event in two 
patients. Plasma levels of DNA-histone complexes increased steadily after 
surgery and remained elevated throughout the study period. Additionally, we 
increasingly sighted both homotypic and heterotypic platelet microaggregates 
after surgery in CRC/MBD patients, but not in healthy control participants' 
plasma.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data elucidates the cell biology of a prothrombo-inflammatory 
state caused by disease and vascular injury, and recalcitrant to 
thromboprophylaxis. New mechanistic insights into hypercoagulability in CRC/MBD 
patients may identify novel drug targets for effective thromboprophylaxis type 
and duration after orthopaedic surgery."
1245,"Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (CSP) is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy, and 
treatment of CSP with uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a novel approach. 
With increasing numbers of cesarean sections being performed annually, the 
incidence of this condition is likely to increase. The authors became aware of 
an unusually high number of published studies originating in mainland China 
regarding this unusual treatment and sought to perform a meta-analysis to 
provide comprehensive evidence on this novel practice.
METHODS: We performed a thorough search and included all forms of quality 
studies on this topic that reported UAE as a part of first-line management of 
CSP. We included only studies originating in China. Ultimately, 37 studies were 
included for qualitative and quantitative synthesis of evidence. After screening 
retrieved records and extracting data from eligible studies, we pooled 
continuous data as a mean estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI), and 
dichotomous data as proportion and 95% CI.
RESULTS: CSP patients treated with protocols including UAE had a mean time of 30 
days for serum β-hCG normalization, 95% CI [26.816, 33.881]. They had a mean 
estimated intraprocedural blood loss of 4.19 ± 3.76 mL, a mean hospital stay of 
nine days, 95%CI [7.914, 9.876], and a success rate of 93.4%, 95%CI [0.918, 
0.951]. The severe complication rate was 1.2%, 95%CI [0.008, 0.017].
CONCLUSION: UAE, in combination with other procedures is being used effectively 
for the treatment of CSP in China. Protocols including UAE have a success rate 
of approximately 93.4%, and a severe complication rate of approximately 1.2%. 
This data's utility is limited by vast differences in the studied protocols and 
questionable feasibility outside of China."
1246,"BACKGROUND: There is clinical interest in determining the effects of low-load 
blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) resistance training on muscle strength and 
hypertrophy compared with traditional high- and low-load (HL and LL) resistance 
training in healthy older adults and the influence of LL-BFR training 
cuff-pressure on these outcomes.
METHODS: A search was performed on the MEDLINE, PEDro, CINHAL, Web of Science, 
Science Direct, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases.
RESULTS: The analysis included 14 studies. HL resistance training produces a 
small increase in muscle strength (eight studies; SMD, -0.23 [-0.41; -0.05]) but 
not in muscle hypertrophy (six studies; (SMD, 0.08 [-0.22; 0.38]) when compared 
with LL-BFR resistance training. Compared with traditional LL resistance 
training, LL-BFR resistance training produces small-moderate increases in muscle 
strength (seven studies; SMD, 0.44 [0.28; 0.60]) and hypertrophy (two studies; 
SMD, 0.51 [0.06; 0.96]). There were greater improvements in muscle strength when 
higher cuff pressures were applied versus traditional LL resistance training but 
not versus HL resistance training.
CONCLUSIONS: LL-BFR resistance training results in lower muscle strength gains 
than HL resistance training and greater than traditional LL resistance training 
in healthy adults older than 60 years. LL-BFR resistance training promotes a 
similar muscle hypertrophy to HL resistance training but is greater than that of 
traditional LL resistance training. Applying cuff pressures above the limb 
occlusion pressure could enhance the increases in muscle strength compared with 
traditional LL resistance training."
1247,"(1) Background: There are no reliable and widely available markers of functional 
iron deficiency (FID) in cancer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role 
of transferrin (Tf) as a marker of cancer of the ovary (CrO) and related FID. 
(2) Methods: The study groups consisted of 118 patients with CrO and 69 control 
females. Blood serum iron status was determined on a Beckman Coulter AU (USA) 
analyzer. Tf quantification was performed by immunoturbidimetry. The relative 
contents of apo- and holo-Tf (iron-free and iron-saturated Tf, respectively) 
were determined in eight patients and a control female by immunochromatographic 
analysis based on the use of monoclonal single-domain antibodies (nanobodies). 
(3) Results: Four groups of patients with different iron statuses were selected 
according to ferritin and transferrin saturation values: absolute iron 
deficiency (AID) (n = 42), FID (n = 70), iron overload (n = 4), normal iron 
status (n = 2). The groups differed significantly in Tf values (p &lt; 0.0001). 
Lower values of Tf were associated with FID. Furthermore, FID is already found 
in the initial stages of CrO (26%). Immunosorbents based on nanobodies revealed 
the accumulation of apo-Tf and the decrease in holo-Tf in patients with CrO. (4) 
Conclusions: Tf may be a promising tool for diagnosing both CrO and associated 
FID."
1248,"Klotho is an anti-aging gene. Studies have revealed its association with insulin 
resistance. Visceral fat is related to insulin resistance, and the sagittal 
abdominal diameter (SAD) can serve as a biomarker for visceral fat (VF). This 
study investigated the association between SAD and serum Klotho concentration 
(SKC). We enrolled 2301 participants from the 2011-2012 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, and 49.2% of the enrolled 
individuals were male. Qualified participants were separated into four quartiles 
according to the SAD value. SKC values were obtained by ELISA. Demographic 
characteristics, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, and 
biochemistry parameters with significance were analyzed using multivariate 
linear regression models. The mean age of the study participants was 57.22 ± 
10.53 years. The fully adjusted regression model showed a negative association 
between SAD and SKC (p &lt; 0.05), with a β-coefficient of -12.02. We also 
analyzed subgroups of participants according to age and BMI. Participants with 
an age ≥65 and &lt;65 years old were each negatively associated with SKC, and 
this association was significant for participants with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (p = 
0.001, β-coefficient: -18.83). We also found a concentration-dependent 
relationship between SAD and SKC. In conclusion, VF and SKC are associated, and 
SAD can serve as a surrogate of VF and an indicator of SKC."
1249,"INTRODUCTION: With the invention and improvement of the carbon monoxide (CO) 
breath test, the role of shortened red blood cell life span (RBCLS) in renal 
anemia, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events in patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD), is gradually attracting attention. Considering 
that heart failure is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients 
with CKD, this study investigated the correlation between the RBCLS and the 
cardiac structure and function in non-dialysis patients with CKD stages 3-5, 
aiming to provide new ideas to improve the long-term prognosis of CKD patients.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-three non-dialysis patients with CKD stages 3-5 were 
tested for RBCLS. We compared the serological data, cardiac ultrasound results, 
and follow-up prognosis of patients with different RBCLS.
RESULTS: As the RBCLS shortened, the patients' blood pressure, BNP, and CRP 
gradually increased, most significantly in patients with an RBCLS &lt; 50 d. 
Patients with an RBCLS &lt; 50 d had substantially lower hemoglobin (Hb), 
hematocrit, and albumin levels than those with an RBCLS ≥ 50 d. The cardiac 
ultrasound results show that patients with an RBCLS &lt; 50 d had significantly 
larger atrial diameters than those with an RBCLS ≥ 50 d and were associated with 
more severe diastolic dysfunction. Patients with an RBCLS &lt; 50 d had a 3.06 
times greater risk of combined heart failure at baseline than those with an 
RBCLS ≥ 70 d and a higher risk of heart failure at follow-up. CKD stage 5 
patients with an RBCLS &lt; 50 d were more likely to develop heart failure and 
require renal replacement therapy earlier than patients with an RBCLS ≥ 50 d.
CONCLUSIONS: In non-dialysis patients with CKD stages 3-5, there is a 
correlation between the red blood cell life span and cardiac structure and 
function. The RBCLS may also impact the renal prognosis of CKD patients."
1250,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic disorder of the upper 
airway. OSA surgery has oftentimes been researched based on the outcomes of 
single-institutional facilities. We retrospectively analyzed a 
multi-institutional national database to investigate the outcomes of OSA surgery 
and identify risk factors for complications.
METHODS: We reviewed the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program (NSQIP) database (2008-2020) to identify patients who 
underwent OSA surgery. The postoperative outcomes of interest included 30-day 
surgical and medical complications, reoperation, readmission, and mortality. 
Additionally, we assessed risk-associated factors for complications, including 
comorbidities and preoperative blood values.
RESULTS: The study population included 4662 patients. Obesity (n = 2909; 63%) 
and hypertension (n = 1435; 31%) were the most frequent comorbidities. While two 
(0.04%) deaths were reported within the 30-day postoperative period, the total 
complication rate was 6.3% (n = 292). Increased BMI (p = 0.01), male sex (p = 
0.03), history of diabetes (p = 0.002), hypertension requiring treatment (p = 
0.03), inpatient setting (p &lt; 0.0001), and American Society of Anesthesiology 
(ASA) physical status classification scores ≥ 4 (p &lt; 0.0001) were identified 
as risk-associated factors for any postoperative complications. Increased 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was identified as a risk-associated factor for the 
occurrence of any complications (p = 0.02) and medical complications (p = 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: OSA surgery outcomes were analyzed at the national level, with 
complications shown to depend on AP levels, male gender, extreme BMI, and 
diabetes mellitus. While OSA surgery has demonstrated an overall positive safety 
profile, the implementation of these novel risk-associated variables into the 
perioperative workflow may further enhance patient care."
1251,"Poor patient outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is due to a 
multifactorial process. Delayed cerebral vasospasm, ischemic neurological 
deficits, and infarction are the most feared acute sequelae triggered by 
enhanced synthesis of serotonin and endothelin-1 (ET-1). During the past 
decades, multiple drugs have been analysed for protective effects without 
resounding success. Therefore, the authors wanted to analyse the potential 
beneficial role of Losartan (LOS). Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomised into 
either a group receiving two injections of blood into the cisterna magna (SAH 
group) or a group receiving two injections of isotonic sodium chloride (sham 
group). The animals were culled on day five and basilar artery ring segments 
were used for in vitro tension studies. Sarafotoxin S6c caused a dose-dependent 
vasorelaxation in sham and SAH segments, which was more pronounced in sham 
segments. LOS, applied in a concentration of 10-3 M, was able to significantly 
reduce serotonin- (p &lt; 0.01) and ET-1- (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01) mediated 
vasoconstriction in sham segments. These findings, along with the well-known 
beneficial effects of LOS on restoring the impaired endothelin-B1-receptor 
function after SAH, as well as on the neuroprotectional and antiepileptogenic 
aspects, might be implemented in advancing tailored concepts to sufficiently 
ameliorate patients' functional outcome after SAH."
1252,"BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are considered at higher 
risk of severe COVID-19 infection. However, morbidity and mortality rates are 
variable among countries. To date, there are no published reports that document 
outcomes of SCD patients with COVID-19 in Canada.
METHODS: A web-based registry was implemented in June 2020 capturing outcomes of 
SCD patients with COVID-19 from March 2020 to April 2022 and comparing them to 
the general population of Quebec, Canada.
RESULTS: After 24 months of the pandemic, 185 SCD patients with confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the registry. Overall, the population was 
young (median age 12 years old) and had few comorbidities. No deaths were 
reported. Risk of hospitalization and admission to intensive care unit (ICU) 
because of COVID-19 was higher in patients with SCD than in the general 
population (relative risks (RR) 5.15 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
3.84-6.91), p ˂ 0.001 and 4.56 (95% CI 2.09-9.93) p ˂ 0.001). A history of 
arterial hypertension or acute chest syndrome in the past 12 months was 
associated with a higher risk of severe disease (RR = 3.06 (95% CI 1.85-5.06) p 
= 0.008 and 2.27 (95% CI 1.35-3.83) p = 0.01). Hospitalized patients had lower 
hemoglobin F than non-hospitalized patients (12% vs. 17%, p = 0.02). For those 
who had access to vaccination at the time of infection, 25 out of 26 patients 
were adequately vaccinated and had mild disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The SCD population is at higher risk of severe disease than the 
general population. However, we report favorable outcomes as no deaths occurred. 
Registries will continue to be critical to document the impact of novel COVID-19 
specific therapy and vaccines for the SCD population."
1253,"OBJECTIVE: There are limited data for estimating the risk of early discharge 
following thoracoscopic lobectomy. The objective was to identify the factors 
associated with a short length of stay and verify the influence of these 
variables in uncomplicated patients.
METHODS: We reviewed all lobectomies reported to the Italian VATS Group between 
January 2014 and January 2020. Patients and perioperative characteristics were 
divided into two subgroups based on whether or not they met the target duration 
of stay (≤ or &gt;4 days). The association between preoperative and 
intraoperative variables and postoperative length of stay (LOS) ≤4 days was 
assessed using a stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify 
factors independently associated with LOS and factors related to LOS in 
uncomplicated cases.
RESULTS: Among 10,240 cases who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy, 37.6% had a 
hospital stay ≤4 days. Variables associated with LOS included age, hospital 
surgical volume, Diffusion Lung CO % (81 [69-94] vs. 85 [73-98]), Forced 
Expiratory Volume (FEV1) % (92 [79-106] vs. 96 [82-109]), operative time (180 
[141-230] vs. 160 [125-195]), uniportal approach (571 [9%] vs. 713 [18.5%]), 
bioenergy sealer use, and pain control through intercostal block or opioids (p 
&lt; 0.001). Except for FEV1 and blood loss, all other factors emerged 
significantly associated with LOS when the analysis was limited to uncomplicated 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, clinical, and surgical variables are associated with 
early discharge after thoracoscopic lobectomy. This study indicates that these 
characteristics are associated with early discharge. This result can be used in 
association with clinical judgment to identify appropriate patients for 
fast-track protocols."

of mortality and morbidity in the modern world [...]."
1255,"Many epidemiological studies and meta-analyses show that persistent Helicobacter 
pylori infection in the gastric mucosa can lead to iron deficiency or iron 
deficiency anemia (IDA), particularly in certain populations of children and 
adolescents. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that H. pylori infection can 
lead to and be closely associated with recurrent and/or refractory iron 
deficiency and IDA. However, the pathogenesis and specific risk factors leading 
to this clinical outcome in H. pylori-infected children remain poorly 
understood. In general, most of pediatric patients with H. pylori-associated IDA 
do not show evidence of overt blood loss due to gastrointestinal hemorrhagic 
lesions. In adult populations, H. pylori atrophic gastritis is reported to cause 
impaired iron absorption due to impaired gastric acid secretion, which, 
subsequently, results in IDA. However, significant gastric atrophy, and the 
resultant substantial reduction in gastric acid secretion, has not been shown in 
H. pylori-infected children. Recently, it has been hypothesized that competition 
between H. pylori and humans for iron availability in the upper gastrointestinal 
tract could lead to IDA. Many genes, including those encoding major outer 
membrane proteins (OMPs), are known to be involved in iron-uptake mechanisms in 
H. pylori. Recent studies have been published that describe H. pylori virulence 
factors, including specific OMP genes that may be associated with the 
pathogenesis of IDA. Daily iron demand substantively increases in children as 
they begin pubertal development starting with the associated growth spurt, and 
this important physiological mechanism may play a synergistic role for the 
microorganisms as a host pathogenetic factor of IDA. Like in the most recent 
pediatric guidelines, a test-and-treat strategy in H. pylori infection should be 
considered, especially for children and adolescents in whom IDA is recurrent or 
refractory to iron supplementation and other definitive causes have not been 
identified. This review will focus on providing the evidence that supports a 
clear biological plausibility for H. pylori infection and iron deficiency, as 
well as IDA."
1256,"The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a marker for systemic inflammation. 
Since inflammation plays a relevant role in vascular aging, the aim of this 
study was to investigate whether NLR is associated with blood pressure profiles 
in older adults. This study was performed within the framework of the SCOPE 
study including 2461 outpatients aged 75 years and over. Mean blood pressure 
values, namely systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and 
pulse pressure (PP) were investigated across tertiles of NLR. Change in blood 
pressure levels in 2 years of follow-up were compared across categories of 
baseline NLR. Data of 2397 individuals were used, of which 1854 individuals had 
hypertension. Mean values of blood pressure did not differ across categories of 
baseline NLR in individuals without hypertension. Individuals with hypertension 
with a high-range NLR had lower SBP and PP when compared to those in low-range 
NLR (mean difference SBP -2.94 mmHg, p = 0.032 and PP -2.55 mmHg, p = 0.030). 
Mean change in blood pressure in 2 years did only slightly differ in 
non-clinically relevant ranges, when compared across tertiles of baseline NLR. 
NLR as a marker of inflammaging was not associated with unfavorable blood 
pressure profiles in older individuals with or without hypertension."
1257,"BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a chronic degenerative pathology that 
is associated with multiple risk factors such as age, sex, obesity, or metabolic 
syndrome (MetS). The present clinical trial aimed to investigate the influence 
of the environment of origin, body mass index (BMI), and MetS parameters on the 
KOA differentiated degrees.
METHODS: 85 patients were admitted for the clinical study. The KOA presence was 
investigated using X-rays analysis. The Kellgren-Lawrence classification (KL) of 
the KOA severity and the MetS characteristic parameters using freshly collected 
blood were performed for each patient. All data collected were used for ANOVA 
statistic interpretation.
RESULTS: The total cholesterol and glycemia were found to be statistically 
significant (p &lt; 0.028, and p &lt; 0.03, respectively), with a high level in 
patients with severe KOA compared to healthy ones. Patients from rural regions 
are 5.18 times more prone to develop severe KOA when compared to ones from urban 
areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the statistical analysis confirmed the correlation 
between the incidence and severity of KOA and the influence of increased values 
of BMI, glycemia, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. The investigations 
revealed a statistically significant influence of the environment of origin on 
the KOA degree of the patients."
1258,"As our ""hidden organ"", microbes widely co-exist at various sites on the human 
body. These microbes are collectively referred to as the microbiome. A 
considerable number of studies have already proven that the microbiome has 
significant impacts on human health and disease progression, including cancers. 
The recent discovery of cancer-specific microbiomes renders these 
cancer-associated microbes as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. 
While at low biomass levels, the lung microbiome still dramatically influences 
the initiation, progression and treatment of lung cancers. However, research on 
lung cancer-associated microbiomes is emerging, and most profiling studies are 
performed within three years. Unfortunately, there are substantial 
inconsistencies across these studies. Variations in microbial diversity were 
observed, and different microbial biomarkers for lung cancer have been proposed. 
In this review, we summarized the current findings of lung cancer microbiome 
studies and attempt to explain the potential reasons for the dissimilarities. 
Other than lung microbiomes, oral and airway microbiomes are highly related to 
lung microbiomes and are therefore included as well. In addition, several lung 
cancer-associated bacterial genera have been detected by different independent 
studies. These bacterial genera may not be perfect biomarkers, but they still 
serve as promising risk factors for lung cancers and show great prognostic 
value."
1259,"BACKGROUND: Pituitary apoplexy (PA) can be symptomatic, namely acute apoplexy 
(APA), or asymptomatic or subclinical (SPA).
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and evolution of the 
patients with APA compared to SPA Patients and methods: Retrospective, 
longitudinal database analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 58 patients with PA, and 37 accomplished the inclusion 
criteria (17 men, median age 47.7 years). A total of 29 (78.4%) had APA (17 
underwent surgery, and 12 were conservatively managed), and 8 (21.6%) had SPA. 
The presence of non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) odds ratio (OR): 29.36 
(95% confidence interval (CI): 1.86-462.36) and the largest size OR 1.10 (95% 
CI: 1.01-1.2) elevated the risk of having surgery. Hypopituitarism developed in 
35.1% without significant differences between APA and SPA. In non-surgical 
patients, adenoma volume shrunk spontaneously at one year magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), without statistical differences between the conservatively 
treated and SPA group.
CONCLUSIONS: APA is more frequent in larger NFPAs, and this subset of patients 
has a higher risk of surgery. Hypopituitarism is quite frequent even in patients 
with SPA, and, therefore, long-term follow-up is mandatory. In the non-surgical 
group, the pituitary tumour shrinkage is clinically relevant after one year of 
PA. Consequently, surgery indication in NFPA should be delayed and reassessed if 
patients remain asymptomatic."
1260,"Background: Inflammation is important in the development of atherosclerosis. 
Research suggested sex-dependent differences for the value of inflammatory 
markers for risk stratification of stroke patients with internal carotid artery 
stenosis (ICAS). We investigated whether leukocytes and thrombocytes were 
associated with ≥50% ICAS in acute stroke and whether this was sex-dependent. 
Patients included in the Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS) were 
used. PASS is a randomized controlled trial that randomized between four days of 
preventive ceftriaxone intravenously or standard stroke care alone. It 
investigated whether ceftriaxone could improve functional outcome at three 
months after stroke. Methods: Patients included in PASS were evaluated for the 
predictive value of leukocytes and thrombocytes for ICAS. Ischemic stroke and 
TIA patients were selected out of PASS patients. Logistic regression analysis 
was performed adjusting for NIHSS and other covariates. Results: 2550 patients 
were included in PASS. 1413 of 2550 patients (55%) were evaluated in this sub 
study. Female patients showed a mean of 8.55 × 109/L for leukocytes and 259 × 
109/L for thrombocytes. Men showed a mean of 8.29 × 109/L for leukocytes and 224 
× 109/L for thrombocytes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
leukocytes were independently associated with ICAS ≥ 50% in male patients (OR 
1.094, p = 0.008), but not in female patients (OR 1.041, p = 0.360). 
Thrombocytes were not associated with ICAS. Conclusions: We conclude that blood 
leukocyte count independently predicts ICAS in men after acute stroke, but not 
in women. Clinical Trial unique identifier: ISRCTN66140176."
1261,"BACKGROUND: The growing cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemic calls for further 
research to identify novel biomarkers for earlier detection and as potential 
therapeutic targets. Biomarkers Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed 
and Secreted (RANTES), extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), 
and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, and MMP-9) are linked to proatherogenic 
and proinflammatory pathways of CVD development, the majority of which are 
coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke. We evaluated potential factors 
affecting these four biomarkers and established their association with CVD.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis using a nested case-control design 
involving 580 participants aged 21-75 years from the prospective multi-ethnic 
cohort study. A total of 290 CVD cases and 290 age-and sex-matched controls were 
identified. All participants underwent interviews, health screenings, and 
provided blood samples, including biomarkers RANTES, EMMPRIN, and MMPs. CVD was 
defined based on previous medical history.
RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 55.7(SD = 10.3) years of age, 
and 34.6% were female. Arrhythmia history and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
levels were significant factors of logEMMPRIN (β = -0.124 [-0.245, -0.003] and β 
= 0.111 [0.0, 0.191], respectively). Only female sex (β = 0.189 [0.078, 0.300]) 
for logRANTES and age (β = 0.033 [0.010, 0.055]) for logMMP-2 and logMMP-9 were 
significant. The Indian ethnicity (β = 0.192 [0.048, 0.335]) and highly 
sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels (β = 0.063 [0.011, 0.116]) were 
statistically significant for logMMP-9. No association was detected between 
biomarkers and CVD.
CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-ethnic study cohort, RANTES was associated with sex, 
EMMPRIN was associated with a history of arrhythmia and LDL levels, MMP-2 with 
age, and MMP-9 with ethnicity and hs-CRP levels. The biomarker serum levels were 
not associated with CVD."
1262,"Schlemm's canal (SC) targeted procedures constitute a promising therapy for open 
angle glaucoma (POAG), safer and less invasive. However, little attention was 
paid to the intraocular pressure (IOP) variation in patients receiving these 
procedures, which is the risk factor for POAG progression. This study is to 
evaluate the IOP variation in eyes with POAG after modified canaloplasty (MC) 
and microcatheter assisted trabeculotomy (MAT). (2) Methods: POAG with good IOP 
in office hours after MC or MAT and age-matched normal subjects were recruited 
in this prospective coherent study. IOP in sitting and supine positions and 24-h 
IOP was measured. Aqueous vein and blood reflux into the SC were examined. (3) 
Results: Among 20 normal subjects, 25 eyes with MC eyes and 30 eyes with MAT 
were recruited in this study. Aqueous veins are frequently located in the 
inferior nasal quadrants in all groups. No pulsatile signs were observed in an 
aqueous vein in the MAT group but they were observed in 68% of the MC group. 
Blood reflux in the SC could be seen in all the operated eyes. The IOP in the 
sitting position was not significant different among groups (p = 0.419). 
Compared to normal, the IOP increased dramatically after lying down for 5 min in 
the MC and MAT groups (PMC vs. normal = 0.003, PMAT vs. normal = 0.004), which 
is similar for IOP change after lying down for 60 min (PMC vs. normal &lt; 
0.001, PMAT vs. normal &lt; 0.001). In terms of diurnal IOP, subjects were 
stable in the MAT group (p &lt; 0.01), variable in the normal group (p = 0.002), 
and most fluctuant in MC group (p &lt; 0.001). (4) Conclusions: MC and MAT 
reduce the IOP but present aberrant short-term IOP regulation, which should be 
paid attention to in clinical settings."
1263,"BACKGROUND: At the dawn of the pandemic, severe forms of COVID-19 were often 
complicated by thromboembolisms. However, routine laboratory tests cannot be 
used to predict thromboembolic events. The objective of this study was to 
investigate the potential value of the thrombin generation test (TGT) in 
predicting hypercoagulability and thrombotic risk in the aforementioned set of 
patients.
METHODS: The study panel comprised 52 patients divided into two groups (26 
COVID-19 positive and 26 COVID-19 negative); COVID-19-positive patients were 
further grouped in ""severe"" (n = 11) and ""non-severe"" (n = 15) categories based 
on clinical criteria. The routine blood tests and TGT of these patients were 
retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: All 26 COVID-19-positive patients showed decreased lymphocyte, monocyte 
and basophil counts and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) compared with control 
patients. Conversely, we did not observe statistically significant differences 
between severe and non-severe patients despite anecdotal variations in the 
distribution patterns. TGT without thrombomodulin (TM) addition showed 
statistically significant differences in the thrombin peak heights between 
COVID-19-positive and negative patients. After addition of TM, peak height, 
Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) and velocity index were increased in all 
COVID-19-positive patients while the percentage of inhibition of ETP was 
reduced. These trends correlated with the severity of disease, showing a greater 
increase in peak height, ETP, velocity index and a drastic reduction in the 
percentage of ETP inhibition in more severely affected patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that all COVID-19 patients harbor a 
hypercoagulable TGT profile and that this is further pronounced in severely 
affected patients."
1264,"BACKGROUND: The nuclear factor-κB transcription factors 1 and 2 (NFKB1 and 
NFKB2) are key components of the NF-κB pathway, which responds to inflammatory 
signals. Since the NFKB1/2 factors are activated via different inflammatory 
molecules, we aimed to check their expression levels in penile cancer (PC), 
penile dermatoses: lichen sclerosus (PLS) and zoon balanitis (ZB).
METHODS: Skin biopsies from altered and healthy looking foreskin were obtained 
from 59 (49 LS; early PLS: 13, moderate PLS: 32, severe PLS: 4; 6 PC; 4 ZB) and 
unchanged foreskin from 13 healthy control adult males undergoing circumcision. 
NFKB1/2 mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR.
RESULTS: The highest levels of NFKB1 and NFKB2 were observed in PC, ca. 22 and 
3.5 times higher than in control, respectively. NFKB1 expression was correlated 
with PLS progression (rs = 0.667) and was ca. 20 times higher in advanced PLS 
than in controls and early PLS. Occurrence of micro-incontinence was associated 
with elevated NFKB1 levels in PLS.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study regarding gene profiles of NFKB1/2 in PC and 
penile dermatoses. New drugs targeting modulation of canonical-activated NF-κB 
pathway should be studied and introduced to the treatment of PLS and PC apart 
from other treatments."
1265,"Both fasting and non-fasting hypertriglyceridemia have emerged as residual risk 
factors for atherosclerotic disease. However, it is unclear whether 
hypertriglyceridemia increases the risks of the progression of carotid artery 
stenosis. Statins are well known to prevent carotid plaque progression and 
improve carotid plaque instability. In addition, statin therapy is also known to 
reduce cerebrovascular events in patients with carotid artery stenosis and to 
improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing revascularization procedures. 
On the other hand, there have been no randomized controlled trials showing that 
the combination of non-statin lipid-lowering drugs with statins has additional 
beneficial effects over statin monotherapy to prevent cerebrovascular events and 
stenosis progression in patients with carotid artery stenosis. In this article, 
the authors demonstrate the mechanisms of atherosclerosis formation associated 
with hypertriglyceridemia and the potential role of lipid-lowering drugs on 
carotid artery stenosis. The authors also review the articles reporting the 
relationships between hypertriglyceridemia and carotid artery stenosis."
1266,"Radiation-Induced CardioVascular Disease (RICVD) is an important concern in 
thoracic radiotherapy with complex underlying pathophysiology. Recently, we 
proposed DNA methylation as a possible mechanism contributing to RICVD. The 
current study investigates DNA methylation in heart-irradiated rats and 
radiotherapy-treated breast cancer (BC) patients. Rats received fractionated 
whole heart X-irradiation (0, 0.92, 6.9 and 27.6 Gy total doses) and blood was 
collected after 1.5, 3, 7 and 12 months. Global and gene-specific methylation of 
the samples were evaluated; and gene expression of selected differentially 
methylated regions (DMRs) was validated in rat and BC patient blood. In rats 
receiving an absorbed dose of 27.6 Gy, DNA methylation alterations were detected 
up to 7 months with differential expression of cardiac-relevant DMRs. Of those, 
SLMAP showed increased expression at 1.5 months, which correlated with 
hypomethylation. Furthermore, E2F6 inversely correlated with a decreased global 
longitudinal strain. In BC patients, E2F6 and SLMAP exhibited differential 
expression directly and 6 months after radiotherapy, respectively. This study 
describes a systemic radiation fingerprint at the DNA methylation level, 
elucidating a possible association of DNA methylation to RICVD pathophysiology, 
to be validated in future mechanistic studies."
1267,"Uncovering the risk factors for acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2019 
(COVID-19) severity may help to provide a valuable tool for early patient 
stratification and proper treatment implementation, improving the patient 
outcome and lowering the burden on the healthcare system. Here we report the 
results of a single-center retrospective cohort study on 151 severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected symptomatic 
hospitalized adult patients. We assessed the association of several blood test 
measurements, soluble urokinase receptor (uPAR) serum level and specific single 
nucleotide polymorphisms of ACE (I/D), NOS3 (rs2070744, rs1799983), SERPINE1 
(rs1799768), PLAU (rs2227564) and PLAUR (rs344781, rs2302524) genes, with the 
disease severity classified by the percentage of lung involvement on 
computerized tomography scans. Our findings reveal that the T/C genotype of 
PLAUR rs2302524 was independently associated with a less severe lung damage 
(odds ratio 0.258 [0.071-0.811]). Along with high C-reactive protein, fibrinogen 
and soluble uPAR serum levels turned out to be independently associated with 
more severe lung damage in COVID-19 patients. The identified factors may be 
further employed as predictors of a possibly severe COVID-19 clinical course."
1268,"Fracture healing is characterized by an inflammatory phase directly after 
fracture which has a strong impact on the healing outcome. Neutrophils are 
strong contributors here and can release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). 
NETs are found after trauma, originally thought to capture pathogens. However, 
they can lead to tissue damage and impede wound healing processes. Their role in 
fracture healing remains unclear. In this study, the effect of isolated NETs on 
the function of bone-forming mesenchymal stem cells (SCP-1 cells) was examined. 
NETs were isolated from stimulated healthy neutrophils and viability, migration, 
and differentiation of SCP-1 cells were analyzed after the addition of NETs. 
NETs severely impaired the viability of SCP-1 cells, induced necrosis and 
already nontoxic concentrations reduced migration significantly. Short-term 
incubation with NETs had a persistent negative effect on osteogenic 
differentiation, as measured by AP activity and matrix formation. The addition 
of DNase or protease inhibitors failed to reverse the negative effect of NETs, 
whereas a short febrile-range temperature treatment successfully reduced the 
toxicity and membrane destruction. Thus, the possible modification of the 
negative effects of NETs in fracture hematomas could be an interesting new 
target to improve bone healing, particularly in patients with chronic diseases 
such as diabetes."
1269,"In recent years, the application of (In, Al, Ga)N materials in photovoltaic 
devices has attracted much attention. Like InGaN, it is a direct band gap 
material with high absorption at the band edge, suitable for high efficiency 
photovoltaic devices. Nonetheless, it is important to deposit high-quality GaN 
material as a foundation. Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) 
combines the advantages of the ALD process with the use of plasma and is often 
used to deposit thin films with different needs. However, residual oxygen during 
growth has always been an unavoidable issue affecting the quality of the 
resulting film, especially in growing gallium nitride (GaN) films. In this 
study, the NH3-containing plasma was used to capture the oxygen absorbed on the 
growing surface to improve the quality of GaN films. By diagnosing the plasma, 
NH2, NH, and H radicals controlled by the plasma power has a strong influence 
not only on the oxygen content in growing GaN films but also on the growth rate, 
crystallinity, and surface roughness. The NH and NH2 radicals contribute to the 
growth of GaN films while the H radicals selectively dissociate Ga-OH bonds on 
the film surface and etch the grown films. At high plasma power, the GaN film 
with the lowest Ga-O bond ratio has a saturated growth rate, a better 
crystallinity, a rougher surface, and a lower bandgap. In addition, the 
deposition mechanism of GaN thin films prepared with a trimethylgallium metal 
source and NH3/Ar plasma PEALD involving oxygen participation or not is also 
discussed in the study."
1270,"The liver is the most common metastatic site in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
patients. Indeed, 25-30% of the cases develop colorectal liver metastasis (CLM), 
showing an extremely poor 5-year survival rate and resistance to conventional 
anticancer therapies. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) provide a nurturing 
microenvironment for CRC metastasis, promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) through the TGF-β signaling pathway, thus driving tumor cells 
to acquire mesenchymal properties that allow them to migrate from the primary 
tumor and invade the new metastatic site. EMT is known to contribute to the 
disruption of blood vessel integrity and the generation of circulating tumor 
cells (CTCs), thus being closely related to high metastatic potential in 
numerous solid cancers. Despite the fact that it is well-recognized that the 
crosstalk between tumor cells and the inflammatory microenvironment is crucial 
in the EMT process, the association between the EMT and the role of TAMs is 
still poorly understood. In this review, we elaborated on the role that TAMs 
exert in the induction of EMT during CLM development. Since TAMs are the major 
source of TGF-β in the liver, we also focused on novel insights into their role 
in TGF-β-induced EMT."
1271,"Althoughanti-inflammatory drug therapy has been identified as potentially 
beneficial for patients suffering from chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH), 
contemporary literature presents contradictory results. In this meta-analysis, 
we aimed to investigate the impact of anti-inflammatory drug therapy on 
mortality and outcome. We searched for eligible randomized, placebo-controlled 
prospective trials (RTCs) on PubMed, Embase and Medline until July 2022. From 97 
initially identified articles, five RTCs met the criteria and were included in 
our meta-analysis. Our results illustrate significantly lower rates of recurrent 
cSDH (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.21-0.58, p = 0.0001) in patients undergoing 
anti-inflammatory therapy. In the subgroup of patients undergoing primary 
conservative treatment, anti-inflammatory therapy was associated with lower 
rates of ""switch to surgery"" cases (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.14-0.63, p = 0.002). 
Despite these findings, anti-inflammatory drugs seemed to be associated with 
higher mortality rates in patients undergoing surgery (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 
1.03-3.01, p = 0.04), although in the case of primary conservative treatment, no 
effect on mortality has been observed (OR: 2.45; 95% CI: 0.35-17.15, p = 0.37). 
Further multicentric prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate 
anti-inflammatory drugs as potentially suitable therapy for asymptomatic 
patients with cSDH to avoid the necessity of surgical hematoma evacuation on 
what are predominantly elderly, vulnerable, patients."
1272,"Anxiety disorders are the most common mental diseases. Anxiety and the 
associated physical symptoms may disturb social and occupational life and 
increase the risk of somatic diseases. The pathophysiology of anxiety 
development is complex and involves alterations in stress hormone production, 
neurosignaling pathways or free radical production. The various manifestations 
of anxiety, its complex pathophysiological background and the side effects of 
available treatments underlie the quest for constantly seeking therapies for 
these conditions. Melatonin, an indolamine produced in the pineal gland and 
released into the blood on a nightly basis, has been demonstrated to exert 
anxiolytic action in animal experiments and different clinical conditions. This 
hormone influences a number of physiological actions either via specific 
melatonin receptors or by receptor-independent pleiotropic effects. The 
underlying pathomechanism of melatonin's benefit in anxiety may reside in its 
sympatholytic action, interaction with the renin-angiotensin and glucocorticoid 
systems, modulation of interneuronal signaling and its extraordinary antioxidant 
and radical scavenging nature. Of importance, the concentration of this 
indolamine is significantly higher in cerebrospinal fluid than in the blood. 
Thus, ensuring sufficient melatonin production by reducing light pollution, 
which suppresses melatonin levels, may represent an endogenous neuroprotective 
and anxiolytic treatment. Since melatonin is freely available, economically 
undemanding and has limited side effects, it may be considered an additional or 
alternative treatment for various conditions associated with anxiety."
1273,"Biomaterials for tissue scaffolds are key components in modern tissue 
engineering and regenerative medicine. Targeted reconstructive therapies require 
a proper choice of biomaterial and an adequate choice of cells to be seeded on 
it. The introduction of stem cells, and the transdifferentiation procedures, 
into regenerative medicine opened a new era and created new challenges for 
modern biomaterials. They must not only fulfill the mechanical functions of a 
scaffold for implanted cells and represent the expected mechanical strength of 
the artificial tissue, but furthermore, they should also assure their survival 
and, if possible, affect their desired way of differentiation. This paper aims 
to review how modern biomaterials, including synthetic (i.e., polylactic acid, 
polyurethane, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene terephthalate, ceramics) and 
natural (i.e., silk fibroin, decellularized scaffolds), both non-biodegradable 
and biodegradable, could influence (tissue) stem cells fate, regulate and direct 
their differentiation into desired target somatic cells."
1274,"Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of neurodegenerative 
disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). Glial cell activation and 
subsequent adaptive immune involvement are neuroinflammatory features in 
familial and idiopathic PD, resulting in the death of dopaminergic neuron cells. 
An oxidative stress response, inflammatory mediator production, and immune cell 
recruitment and activation are all hallmarks of this activation, leading to 
chronic neuroinflammation and progressive neurodegeneration. Several studies in 
PD patients' cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood revealed alterations in 
inflammatory markers and immune cell populations that may lead to or exacerbate 
neuroinflammation and perpetuate the neurodegenerative process. Most of the 
genes causing PD are also expressed in astrocytes and microglia, converting 
their neuroprotective role into a pathogenic one and contributing to disease 
onset and progression. Nuclear receptor-related transcription factor 1 (NURR1) 
regulates gene expression linked to dopaminergic neuron genesis and functional 
maintenance. In addition to playing a key role in developing and maintaining 
neurotransmitter phenotypes in dopaminergic neurons, NURR1 agonists have been 
shown to reverse behavioral and histological abnormalities in animal PD models. 
NURR1 protects dopaminergic neurons from inflammation-induced degeneration, 
specifically attenuating neuronal death by suppressing the expression of 
inflammatory genes in microglia and astrocytes. This narrative review highlights 
the inflammatory changes in PD and the advances in NURR1-regulated 
neuroinflammation associated with PD. Further, we present new evidence that 
targeting this inflammation with a variety of potential NURR1 target therapy 
medications can effectively slow the progression of chronic 
neuroinflammation-induced PD."
1275,"Therapy of FLT3-positive acute myeloid leukemia still remains complicated, 
despite the availability of newly approved kinase inhibitors. Various strategies 
to avoid the reduced efficacy of therapy have been explored, including the 
development of dual targeting compounds, which inhibit FLT3 and another kinase 
necessary for the survival and proliferation of AML cells. We have designed new 
2,7,9-trisubstituted 8-oxopurines as FLT3 inhibitors and report here the 
structure-activity relationship studies. We demonstrated that substituents at 
positions 7 and 9 modulate activity between CDK4 and FLT3 kinase, and the 
isopropyl group at position 7 substantially increased the selectivity toward 
FLT3 kinase, which led to the discovery of compound 15a 
(9-cyclopentyl-7-isopropyl-2-((4-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl)amino)-7,9-dihydro-8H-purin-8-one). 
Cellular analyses in MV4-11 cells revealed inhibition of autophosphorylation of 
FLT3 kinase in nanomolar doses, including the suppression of downstream STAT5 
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We also describe mechanistic studies in cell lines 
and activity in a mouse xenograft model in vivo."
1276,"We report a case of a patient with Dubin-Johnson syndrome confirmed by a genetic 
study. A 50-year-old woman who had symptoms of intermittent right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain was diagnosed with calculous cholecystitis at another institute 
and was presented to our hospital for a cholecystectomy. She had no history of 
liver disease, and her physical examination was normal. Abdominal computed 
tomography showed a gallbladder stone with chronic cholecystitis. During a 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystitis, a smooth, black-colored liver 
was noted, and a liver biopsy was performed. The biopsy specimen showed coarse, 
dark brown granules in centrilobular hepatocytes via hematoxylin and eosin 
staining. We performed a genetic study using the blood samples of the patient. 
In the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2) 
mutation study, a missense mutation in exon 18 was noted. Based on the 
black-colored liver without nodularity, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, the liver 
biopsy results of the coarse pigment in centrilobular hepatocytes, and the ABCC2 
mutation, Dubin-Johnson syndrome was diagnosed. The patient was managed with 
conservative care using hepatotonics. One month after follow-up, total bilirubin 
and direct bilirubin remained in a similar range. Another follow-up was planned 
a month later, and the patient maintained her use of hepatotonics."
1277,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress activates inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) and 
protein kinase, R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), the two principal 
regulators of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In multiple myeloma, adaptive 
IRE1α signaling is predominantly activated and regulates cell fate along with 
PERK. Recently, we demonstrated that GNF-2, an allosteric c-Abl inhibitor, 
rheostatically enhanced IRE1α activity and induced apoptosis through c-Abl 
conformational changes in pancreatic β cells. Herein, we analyzed whether the 
pharmacological modulation of c-Abl conformation resulted in anti-myeloma 
effects. First, we investigated the effects of GNF-2 on IRE1α activity and cell 
fate, followed by an investigation of the anti-myeloma effects of asciminib, a 
new allosteric c-Abl inhibitor. Finally, we performed RNA sequencing to 
characterize the signaling profiles of asciminib. We observed that both GNF-2 
and asciminib decreased cell viability and induced XBP1 mRNA splicing in primary 
human myeloma cells and myeloma cell lines. RNA sequencing identified the 
induction of UPR- and apoptosis-related genes by asciminib. Asciminib 
re-localized c-Abl to the endoplasmic reticulum, and its combination with a 
specific IRE1α inhibitor, KIRA8, enhanced cell death with the reciprocal 
induction of CHOP mRNA expression. Together, the allosteric inhibition of 
c-Abl-activated UPR with anti-myeloma effects; this could be a novel therapeutic 
target for multiple myeloma."
1278,"Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) is a refractory airway disease 
accompanied by eosinophilic inflammation, the mechanisms of which are unknown. 
We recently found that CCL4/MIP-1β-a specific ligand for CCR5 receptors-was 
implicated in eosinophil recruitment into the inflammatory site and was 
substantially released from activated eosinophils. Moreover, it was found in 
nasal polyps from patients with ECRS, primarily in epithelial cells. In the 
present study, the role of epithelial cell-derived CCL4 in eosinophil activation 
was investigated. First, CCL4 expression in nasal polyps from patients with ECRS 
as well as its role of CCL4 in eosinophilic airway inflammation were 
investigated in an in vivo model. Furthermore, the role of CCL4 in CD69 
expression-a marker of activated eosinophils-as well as the signaling pathways 
involved in CCL4-mediated eosinophil activation were investigated. Notably, CCL4 
expression, but not CCL5, CCL11, or CCL26, was found to be significantly 
increased in nasal polyps from patients with ECRS associated with eosinophil 
infiltration as well as in BEAS-2B cells co-incubated with eosinophils. In an 
OVA-induced allergic mouse model, CCL4 increased eosinophil accumulation in the 
nasal mucosa and the bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF). Moreover, we found that CD69 
expression was upregulated in CCL4-stimulated eosinophils; similarly, 
phosphorylation of several kinases, including platelet-derived growth factor 
receptor (PDGFR)β, SRC kinase family (Lck, Src, and Yes), and extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), was upregulated. Further, CCR5, PDGFRβ, and/or 
Src kinase inhibition partially restored CCL4-induced CD69 upregulation. Thus, 
CCL4, which is derived from airway epithelial cells, plays a role in the 
accumulation and activation of eosinophils at inflammatory sites. These findings 
may provide a novel therapeutic target for eosinophilic airway inflammation, 
such as ECRS."
1279,"Leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor 1 (LAIR1, CD305) belongs 
to the family of immune-inhibitory receptors and is widely expressed on 
hematopoietic mature cells, particularly on immune cells. Four different types 
of ligands of LAIR1 have been described, including collagens, suggesting a 
potential immune-regulatory function on the extracellular matrix. By modulating 
cytokine secretion and cellular functions, LAIR1 displays distinct patterns of 
expression among NK cell and T/B lymphocyte subsets during their differentiation 
and cellular activation and plays a major negative immunoregulatory role. Beyond 
its implications in physiology, the activity of LAIR1 can be inappropriately 
involved in various autoimmune or inflammatory disorders and has been implicated 
in cancer physiopathology, including hematological neoplasms. Its action as an 
inhibitory receptor can result in the dysregulation of immune cellular responses 
and in immune escape within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, when 
expressed by tumor cells, LAIR1 can modulate their proliferation or invasion 
properties, with contradictory pro- or anti-tumoral effects depending on tumor 
type. In this review, we will focus on its role in normal physiological 
conditions, as well as during pathological situations, including hematological 
malignancies. We will also discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting 
LAIR1 for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases and cancer settings."
1280,"Basophils are key effector cells in atopic diseases, and the signaling 
sphingolipid Sphigosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is emerging as an important mediator 
in these conditions. The possible interaction of S1P and basophils and the 
resulting biological effects have not yet been studied. We hypothesize that S1P 
influences the function of basophils in atopy and aim to elucidate the modes of 
interaction. S1P receptor (S1PR) expression in human peripheral blood basophils 
from atopic and non-atopic patients was assessed through qRT-PCR and flow 
cytometry analysis. Functional effects of S1P were assessed through a basophil 
activation test (BAT), calcium flux, apoptosis, and chemotaxis assays. 
Immunofluorescence staining was performed to visualize intracellular S1P. Human 
basophils express S1PR1, S1PR2, S1PR3, and S1PR4 on the mRNA level. 0.1 µM S1P 
have anti-apoptotic, while 10 µM exhibits apoptotic effects on basophils. 
Basophils from atopic patients show less chemotactic activity in response to S1P 
than those from healthy donors. Protein expression of S1PR1 is downregulated in 
atopic patients, and basophils in lesional AD skin possess intracellular S1P. 
These findings suggest that the interaction of S1P and basophils might be an 
important factor in the pathophysiology of atopy."
1281,"Gastrointestinal disease is prevalent and broad, manifesting itself in a variety 
of ways, including inflammation, fibrosis, infection, and cancer. However, 
historically, diagnostic technologies have exhibited limitations, especially 
with regard to diagnostic uncertainty. Despite development of newly emerging 
technologies such as optoacoustic imaging, many recent advancements have focused 
on improving upon pre-existing modalities such as ultrasound, computed 
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopy. These advancements 
include utilization of machine learning models, biomarkers, new technological 
applications such as diffusion weighted imaging, and new techniques such as 
transrectal ultrasound. This review discusses assessment of disease processes 
using imaging strategies for the detection and monitoring of inflammation, 
fibrosis, and cancer in the context of gastrointestinal disease. Specifically, 
we include ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, celiac disease, 
graft vs. host disease, intestinal fibrosis, colorectal stricture, gastric 
cancer, and colorectal cancer. We address some of the most recent and promising 
advancements for improvement of gastrointestinal imaging, including unique 
discussions of such advancements with regard to imaging of fibrosis and 
differentiation between similar disease processes."
1282,"To investigate the therapeutic effect and primary pharmacological mechanism of 
Ziyuglycoside I (Ziyu I) on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. CIA mice were 
treated with 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg of Ziyu I or 2 mg/kg of methotrexate (MTX), and 
clinical manifestations, as well as pathological changes, were observed. T cell 
viability and subset type were determined, and serum levels of transforming 
growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) were detected. The mRNA 
expression of retinoid-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) and transcription 
factor forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) in mouse spleen lymphocytes was 
ascertained by the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR). Molecular docking was used to detect whether there was a molecular 
interaction between Ziyu I and protein kinase B (Akt). The activation of 
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in T cells was verified by Western 
blotting or immunofluorescence. Ziyu I treatment effectively alleviated 
arthritis symptoms of CIA mice, including body weight, global score, arthritis 
index, and a number of swollen joints. Similarly, pathological changes of joints 
and spleens in arthritic mice were improved. The thymic index, T cell activity, 
and RORγt production of Ziyu I-treated mice were significantly reduced. Notably, 
through molecular docking, western blotting, and immunofluorescence data 
analysis, it was found that Ziyu I could interact directly with Akt to reduce 
downstream mTOR activation and inhibit helper T cell 17 (Th17) differentiation, 
thereby regulating Th17/regulatory T cell (Treg) balance and improving arthritis 
symptoms. Ziyu I effectively improves arthritic symptoms in CIA mice by 
inhibiting mTOR activation, thereby affecting Th17 differentiation and 
regulating Th17/Treg balance."
1283,"Exosomes are nanovesicles with a 40-150 nm diameter and are essential for 
communication between cells. Literature data suggest that exosomes obtained from 
different sources (cell cultures, blood plasma, urea, saliva, tears, spinal 
fluid, milk) using a series of centrifugations and ultracentrifugations contain 
hundreds and thousands of different protein and nucleic acid molecules. However, 
most of these proteins are not an intrinsic part of exosomes; instead, they 
co-isolate with exosomes. Using consecutive ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, 
and affinity chromatography on anti-CD9- and anti-CD63-Sepharoses, we isolated 
highly purified vesicle preparations from 18 horse milk samples. Gel filtration 
of the initial preparations allowed us to remove co-isolating proteins and their 
complexes and to obtain highly purified vesicles morphologically corresponding 
to exosomes. Using affinity chromatography on anti-CD9- and 
anti-CD63-Sepharoses, we obtained extra-purified CD9+ and CD63+ exosomes, which 
simultaneously contain these two tetraspanins, while the CD81 tetraspanin was 
presented in a minor quantity. SDS-PAGE and MALDI analysis detected several 
major proteins with molecular masses over 10 kDa: CD9, CD63, CD81, lactadherin, 
actin, butyrophilin, lactoferrin, and xanthine dehydrogenase. Analysis of 
extracts by trifluoroacetic acid revealed dozens of peptides with molecular 
masses in the range of 0.8 to 8.5 kDa. Data on the uneven distribution of 
tetraspanins on the surface of horse milk exosomes and the presence of peptides 
open new questions about the biogenesis of these extracellular vesicles."
1284,"Mitochondrial ATP production plays an important role in most cellular 
activities, including growth and differentiation. Previously we reported that 
Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) is the main ADP supplier in the mitochondrial 
intermembrane space in hematopoietic cells, especially in the bone marrow. AK2 
is crucial for the production of neutrophils and T cells, and its deficiency 
causes reticular dysgenesis. However, the relationship between ADP supply by AK2 
and neutrophil differentiation remains unclear. In this study, we used 
CRISPR/Cas9 technology to establish two heterozygous AK2 knock-out HL-60 clones 
as models for reticular dysgenesis. Their AK2 activities were about half that in 
the wild-type (WT). Furthermore, neutrophil differentiation was impaired in one 
of the clones. In silico analysis predicted that the obtained mutations might 
cause a structural change in AK2. Time course microarray analysis of the WT and 
mutants revealed that similar gene clusters responded to all-trans retinoic acid 
treatment, but their expression was lower in the mutants than in WT. Application 
of fructose partially restored neutrophil differentiation in the heterozygous 
knock-out HL-60 clone after all-trans retinoic acid treatment. Collectively, our 
study suggests that the mutation of N-terminal region in AK2 might play a role 
in AK2-dependent neutrophil differentiation and fructose could be used to treat 
AK2 deficiency."
1285,"Establishing the rapid and accurate diagnosis of sepsis is a key component to 
the improvement of clinical outcomes. The ability of analytical platforms to 
rapidly detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) in blood could 
provide a powerful host-independent biomarker of sepsis. A novel concept was 
investigated based on the idea that a pre-bound and fluorescent ligand could be 
released from lectins in contact with high-affinity ligands (such as PAMPs). To 
create fluorescent ligands with precise avidity, the kinetically followed TEMPO 
oxidation of yeast mannan and carbodiimide coupling were used. The chemical 
modifications led to decreases in avidity between mannan and human collectins, 
such as the mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and human surfactant protein D (SP-D), 
but not in porcine SP-D. Despite this effect, these fluorescent derivatives were 
captured by human lectins using highly concentrated solutions. The resulting 
fluorescent beads were exposed to different solutions, and the results showed 
that displacements occur in contact with higher affinity ligands, proving that 
two-stage competition processes can occur in collectin carbohydrate recognition 
mechanisms. Moreover, the fluorescence loss depends on the discrepancy between 
the respective avidities of the recognized ligand and the fluorescent mannan. 
Chemically modulated fluorescent ligands associated with a diversity of 
collectins may lead to the creation of diagnostic tools suitable for multiplex 
array assays and the identification of high-avidity ligands."
1286,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal 
hematopoietic stem cell disorders with maturation and differentiation defects 
exhibiting morphological dysplasia in one or more hematopoietic cell lineages. 
They are associated with peripheral blood cytopenias and by increased risk for 
progression into acute myelogenous leukemia. Among their multifactorial 
pathogenesis, age-related epigenetic instability and the error-rate DNA 
methylation maintenance have been recognized as critical factors for both the 
initial steps of their pathogenesis and for disease progression. Although 
lower-risk MDS is associated with an inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment, 
higher-risk disease is delineated by immunosuppression and clonal expansion. 
""Epigenetics"" is a multidimensional level of gene regulation that determines the 
specific gene networks expressed in tissues under physiological conditions and 
guides appropriate chromatin rearrangements upon influence of environmental 
stimulation. Regulation of this level consists of biochemical modifications in 
amino acid residues of the histone proteins' N-terminal tails and their 
concomitant effects on chromatin structure, DNA methylation patterns in CpG 
dinucleotides and the tissue-specific non-coding RNAs repertoire, which are 
directed against various gene targets. The role of epigenetic modifications is 
widely recognized as pivotal both in gene expression control and differential 
molecular response to drug therapies in humans. Insights to the potential of 
synergistic cooperations of epigenetic mechanisms provide new avenues for 
treatment development to comfort human diseases with a known epigenetic shift, 
such as MDS. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs), such as epigenetic modulating drugs, 
have been widely used in the past years as first line treatment for elderly 
higher-risk MDS patients; however, just half of them respond to therapy and are 
benefited. Rational outcome predictors following epigenetic therapy in MDS and 
biomarkers associated with disease relapse are of high importance to improve our 
efforts in developing patient-tailored clinical approaches."
1287,"Erythropoietin (EPO) is a circulating hormone conventionally considered to be 
responsible for erythropoiesis. In addition to facilitating red blood cell 
production, EPO has pluripotent potential, such as for cognition improvement, 
neurogenesis, and anti-fibrotic, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, and 
anti-inflammatory effects. In human retinal tissues, EPO receptors (EPORs) are 
expressed in the photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelium, and retinal 
ganglion cell layer. Studies have suggested its potential therapeutic effects in 
many neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma. In this review, we discuss 
the correlation between glaucoma and EPO, physiology and potential 
neuroprotective function of the EPO/EPOR system, and latest evidence for the 
treatment of glaucoma with EPO."
1288,"Nowadays, osteoarthritis (OA), a common, multifactorial musculoskeletal disease, 
is considered to have a low-grade inflammatory pathogenetic component. Lately, 
neuropsychiatric sequelae of the disease have gained recognition. However, a 
link between the peripheral inflammatory process of OA and the development of 
neuropsychiatric pathology is not completely understood. In this review, we 
provide a narrative that explores the development of neuropsychiatric disease in 
the presence of chronic peripheral low-grade inflammation with a focus on its 
signaling to the brain. We describe the development of a pro-inflammatory 
environment in the OA-affected joint. We discuss inflammation-signaling pathways 
that link the affected joint to the central nervous system, mainly using primary 
sensory afferents and blood circulation via circumventricular organs and 
cerebral endothelium. The review describes molecular and cellular changes in the 
brain, recognized in the presence of chronic peripheral inflammation. In 
addition, changes in the volume of gray matter and alterations of connectivity 
important for the assessment of the efficacy of treatment in OA are discussed in 
the given review. Finally, the narrative considers the importance of the use of 
neuropsychiatric diagnostic tools for a disease with an inflammatory component 
in the clinical setting."
1289,"Protein synthesis is tightly regulated by both gene-specific and global 
mechanisms to match the metabolic and proliferative demands of the cell. While 
the regulation of global protein synthesis in response to mitogen or stress 
signals is relatively well understood in multiple experimental systems, how 
different cell types fine-tune their basal protein synthesis rate is not known. 
In a previous study, we showed that resting B and T lymphocytes exhibit dramatic 
differences in their metabolic profile, with implications for their 
post-activation function. Here, we show that resting B cells, despite being 
quiescent, exhibit increased protein synthesis in vivo as well as ex vivo. The 
increased protein synthesis in B cells is driven by mTORC1, which exhibits an 
intermediate level of activation in these cells when compared with resting T 
cells and activated B cells. A comparative analysis of the transcriptome and 
translatome of these cells indicates that the genes encoding the MHC Class II 
molecules and their chaperone CD74 are highly translated in B cells. These data 
suggest that the translatome of B cells shows enrichment for genes associated 
with antigen processing and presentation. Even though the B cells exhibit higher 
mTORC1 levels, they prevent the translational activation of TOP mRNAs, which are 
mostly constituted by ribosomal proteins and other translation factors, by 
upregulating 4EBP1 levels. This mechanism may keep the protein synthesis 
machinery under check while enabling higher levels of translation in B cells."
1290,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a frequent aortic disease. If the diameter of 
the aorta is larger than 5 cm, an open surgical repair (OSR) or an endovascular 
aortic repair (EVAR) are recommended. To prevent possible complications (i.e., 
endoleaks), EVAR-treated patients need to be monitored for 5 years following the 
intervention, using computed tomography angiography (CTA). However, this 
radiological method involves high radiation exposure in terms of CTA/year. In 
such a context, the study of peripheral-blood-circulating extracellular vesicles 
(pbcEVs) has great potential to identify biomarkers for EVAR complications. We 
analyzed several phenotypes of pbcEVs using polychromatic flow cytometry in 22 
patients with AAA eligible for EVAR. From each enrolled patient, peripheral 
blood samples were collected at AAA diagnosis, and after 1, 6, and 12 months 
following EVAR implantation, i.e. during the diagnostic follow-up protocol. 
Patients developing an endoleak displayed a significant decrease in 
activated-platelet-derived EVs between the baseline condition and 6 months after 
EVAR intervention. Furthermore, we also observed, that 1 month after EVAR 
implantation, patients developing an endoleak showed higher concentrations of 
activated-endothelial-derived EVs than patients who did not develop one, 
suggesting their great potential as a noninvasive and specific biomarker for 
early identification of EVAR complications."
1291,"As part of our effort to discover drugs that target HIV-1 entry, we report the 
antiviral activity and crystal structures of two novel inhibitors in a complex 
with a gp120 core. NBD-14204 showed similar antiviral activity against all the 
clinical isolates tested. The IC50 values were in the range of 0.24-0.9 µM with 
an overall mean of 0.47 ± 0.03 µM, showing slightly better activity against the 
clinical isolates than against the lab-adapted HIV-1HXB2 (IC50 = 0.96 ± 0.1 µM). 
Moreover, the antiviral activity of NBD-14208 was less consistent, showing a 
wider range of IC50 values (0.66-5.7 µM) with an overall mean of 3 ± 0.25 µM and 
better activity against subtypes B and D (Mean IC50 2.2-2.5 µM) than the A, C 
and Rec viruses (Mean IC50 2.9-3.9 µM). SI of NBD-14204 was about 10-fold higher 
than NBD-14208, making it a better lead compound for further optimization. In 
addition, we tested these compounds against S375Y and S375H mutants of gp120, 
which occurred in some clades and observed these to be sensitive to NBD-14204 
and NBD-14208. These inhibitors also showed modest activity against HIV-1 
reverse transcriptase. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structures of both 
inhibitors in complexes with gp120 cores. As expected, both NBD-14204 and 
NBD-14208 bind primarily within the Phe43 cavity. It is noteworthy that the 
electron density of the thiazole ring in both structures was poorly defined due 
to the flexibility of this scaffold, suggesting that these compounds maintain 
substantial entropy, even when bound to the Phe43 cavity."
1292,"Endotheliopathy following trauma is associated with poor outcome, but the 
underlying mechanisms are unknown. This study hypothesized that an increased 
extracellular vesicle (EV) concentration is associated with endotheliopathy 
after trauma and that red blood cell (RBC) transfusion could further enhance 
endotheliopathy. In this post hoc sub study of a multicentre observational 
trial, 75 trauma patients were stratified into three groups based on injury 
severity score or shock. In patient plasma obtained at hospital admission and 
after transfusion of four RBC transfusions, markers for endotheliopathy were 
measured and EVs were labelled with anti CD41 (platelet EVs), anti CD235a (red 
blood cell EVs), anti CD45 (leucocyte EVs), anti CD144 (endothelial EVs) or anti 
CD62e (activated endothelial EVs) and EV concentrations were measured with flow 
cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed by a Kruskall Wallis test with 
Bonferroni correction or Wilcoxon rank test for paired data. In patients with 
shock, syndecan-1 and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) were increased compared to 
patients without shock. Additionally, patients with shock had increased red 
blood cell EV and leucocyte EV concentrations compared to patients without 
shock. Endotheliopathy markers correlated with leucocyte EVs (ρ = 0.263, p = 
0.023), but not with EVs derived from other cells. Injury severity score had no 
relation with EV release. RBC transfusion increased circulating red blood cell 
EVs but did not impact endotheliopathy. In conclusion, shock is (weakly) 
associated with EVs from leucocytes, suggesting an immune driven pathway 
mediated (at least in part) by shock."
1293,"Aging correlates with greater incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) 
and erectile dysfunction (ED) in the male population where the 
pathophysiological link remains elusive. The incidence of LUTS and ED correlates 
with the prevalence of vascular risk factors, implying potential role of 
arterial disorders in concomitant development of the two conditions. Human 
studies have revealed lower bladder and prostate blood flow in patients with 
LUTS suggesting that the severity of LUTS and ED correlates with the severity of 
vascular disorders. A close link between increased prostatic vascular resistance 
and greater incidence of LUTS and ED has been documented. Experimental models of 
atherosclerosis-induced chronic pelvic ischemia (CPI) showed increased 
contractile reactivity of prostatic and bladder tissues, impairment of penile 
erectile tissue relaxation, and simultaneous development of detrusor 
overactivity and ED. In the bladder, short-term ischemia caused overactive 
contractions while prolonged ischemia provoked degenerative responses and led to 
underactivity. CPI compromised structural integrity of the bladder, prostatic, 
and penile erectile tissues. Downstream molecular mechanisms appear to involve 
cellular stress and survival signaling, receptor modifications, upregulation of 
cytokines, and impairment of the nitric oxide pathway in cavernosal tissue. 
These observations may suggest pelvic ischemia as an important contributing 
factor in LUTS-associated ED. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss the 
current evidence on CPI as a possible etiologic mechanism underlying 
LUTS-associated ED."
1294,"Uremic toxins and gut dysbiosis in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) can 
induce gut leakage, causing the translocation of gut microbial molecules into 
the systemic circulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) are 
the major gut microbial molecules of Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, 
respectively, and can induce inflammation in several organs. Here, the fibrosis 
in the kidney, liver, and heart was investigated in oral C. 
albicans-administered 5/6 nephrectomized (Candida-5/6 Nx) mice. At 20 weeks post 
5/6 Nx, Candida-5/6 Nx mice demonstrated increased 24 h proteinuria, liver 
enzymes, and serum cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10), but not weight loss, 
systolic blood pressure, hematocrit, serum creatinine, or gut-derived uremic 
toxins (TMAO and indoxyl sulfate), compared to in 5/6 Nx alone. The gut leakage 
in Candida-5/6 Nx was more severe, as indicated by FITC-dextran assay, 
endotoxemia, and serum BG. The areas of fibrosis from histopathology, along with 
the upregulated gene expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and Dectin-1, 
the receptors for LPS and BG, respectively, were higher in the kidney, liver, 
and heart. In vitro, LPS combined with BG increased the supernatant IL-6 and 
TNF-α, upregulated the genes of pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic processes, 
Dectin-1, and TLR-4 in renal tubular (HK-2) cells and hepatocytes (HepG2), when 
compared with LPS or BG alone. This supported the pro-inflammation-induced 
fibrosis and the possible LPS-BG additive effects on kidney and liver fibrosis. 
In conclusion, uremia-induced leaky gut causes the translocation of gut LPS and 
BG into circulation, which activates the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic 
pathways, causing internal organ fibrosis. Our results support the crosstalk 
among several organs in CKD through a leaky gut."
1295,"Significant progress has been made in understanding the connection between 
intestinal barrier function and allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(allo-HCT) recipients' outcomes. The purpose of this study was to further 
evaluate gut barrier permeability and other potential intestinal barrier 
disruption markers in the allo-HCT setting. Fifty-one patients were enrolled in 
the study. Intestinal permeability was assessed with the sugar absorption test 
and faecal concentrations of the zonulin, calprotectin and beta-defensin-2 
levels in the peri-transplantation period. Most patients undergoing allo-HCT in 
our department had a disrupted intestinal barrier at the baseline, which was 
associated with older age and higher Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-specific 
Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI). Regardless of this, we observed a further increase 
in gut barrier permeability after allo-HCT in most patients. However, there was 
no association between permeability assay and other markers (zonulin, 
calprotectin and beta-defensin-2). Patients with acute GVHD had significantly 
higher median calprotectin concentrations after allo-HCT compared with the 
patients without this complication. Our findings indicate that gut barrier 
damage develops prior to allo-HCT with progression after the procedure and 
precedes further complications, but did not prove other markers to be useful 
surrogates of intestinal permeability."
1296,"To date, worldwide, atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiovascular 
disease in adults, with a prevalence of 2% to 4%. The trigger of the 
pathophysiological mechanism of arrhythmia includes several factors that sustain 
and exacerbate the disease. Ectopic electrical conductivity, associated with the 
resulting atrial mechanical dysfunction, atrial remodeling, and fibrosis, 
promotes hypo-contractility and blood stasis, involving micro endothelial 
damage. This causes a significant local inflammatory reaction that feeds and 
sustains the arrhythmia. In our literature review, we evaluate the role of HMGB1 
proteins, heat shock proteins, and S100 in the pathophysiology of atrial 
fibrillation, offering suggestions for possible new therapeutic strategies. We 
selected scientific publications on the specific topics ""alarmins"" and ""atrial 
fibrillation"" from PubMed. The nonsystematic review confirms the pivotal role of 
molecules such as S100 proteins, high-mobility group box-1, and heat shock 
proteins in the molecular pattern of atrial fibrillation. These results could be 
considered for new therapeutic opportunities, including inhibition of oxidative 
stress, evaluation of new anticoagulant drugs with novel therapeutic targets, 
molecular and genetic studies, and consideration of these alarmins as predictive 
or prognostic biomarkers of disease onset and severity."
1297,"There are several conditions that lead to female infertility, where traditional 
or conventional treatments have limited efficacy. In these challenging 
scenarios, stem cell (SC) therapies have been investigated as alternative 
treatment strategies. Human umbilical cord (hUC) mesenchymal stem cells 
(hUC-MSC), along with their secreted paracrine factors, extracts, and 
biomolecules, have emerged as promising therapeutic alternatives in regenerative 
medicine, due to their remarkable potential to promote anti-inflammatory and 
regenerative processes more efficiently than other autologous treatments. 
Similarly, hUC blood derivatives, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or 
isolated plasma elements, such as growth factors, have also demonstrated 
potential. This literature review aims to summarize the recent therapeutic 
advances based on hUC-MSCs, hUC blood, and/or other plasma derivatives (e.g., 
extracellular vesicles, hUC-PRP, and growth factors) in the context of female 
reproductive medicine. We present an in-depth analysis of the principal 
molecules mediating tissue regeneration, compiling the application of these 
therapies in preclinical and clinical studies, within the context of the human 
reproductive tract. Despite the recent advances in bioengineering strategies 
that sustain delivery and amplify the scope of the therapeutic benefits, further 
clinical trials are required prior to the wide implementation of these 
alternative therapies in reproductive medicine."
1298,"Bone-marrow-mesenchymal-stromal-cells (BMSCs)- and platelet-rich-plasma 
(PRP)-based therapies have shown potential for treating osteoarthritis (OA). 
Recently, the combination of these two approaches was proposed, with results 
that overcame those observed with the separate treatments, indicating a possible 
role of PRP in ameliorating BMSCs' regenerative properties. Since a molecular 
fingerprint of BMSCs cultivated in the presence of PRP is missing, the aim of 
this study was to characterize the secretome in terms of soluble factors and 
extracellular-vesicle (EV)-embedded miRNAs from the perspective of tissues, 
pathways, and molecules which frame OA pathology. One hundred and five soluble 
factors and one hundred eighty-four EV-miRNAs were identified in the PRP-treated 
BMSCs' secretome, respectively. Several soluble factors were related to the 
migration of OA-related immune cells, suggesting the capacity of BMSCs to 
attract lympho-, mono-, and granulocytes and modulate their inflammatory status. 
Accordingly, several EV-miRNAs had an immunomodulating role at both the 
single-factor and cell level, together with the ability to target 
OA-characterizing extracellular-matrix-degrading enzymes and cartilage 
destruction pathways. Overall, anti-inflammatory and protective signals far 
exceeded inflammation and destruction cues for cartilage, macrophages, and T 
cells. This study demonstrates that BMSCs cultivated in the presence of PRP 
release therapeutic molecules and give molecular ground for the use of this 
combined and innovative therapy for OA treatment."
1299,"Hypertension is one of the most common risk factors for developing chronic 
cardiovascular diseases, including hypertensive nephropathy. Within the 
glomerulus, hypertension causes damage and activation of mesangial cells (MCs), 
eliciting the production of large amounts of vasoactive and proinflammatory 
agents. Accordingly, the activation of AT1 receptors by the vasoactive molecule 
angiotensin II (AngII) contributes to the pathogenesis of renal damage, which is 
mediated mostly by the dysfunction of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) signaling. 
Similarly, inflammation entails complex processes, where [Ca2+]i also play 
crucial roles. Deregulation of this second messenger increases cell damage and 
promotes fibrosis, reduces renal blood flow, and impairs the glomerular 
filtration barrier. In vertebrates, [Ca2+]i signaling depends, in part, on the 
activity of two families of large-pore channels: hemichannels and pannexons. 
Interestingly, the opening of these channels depends on [Ca2+]i signaling. In 
this review, we propose that the opening of channels formed by connexins and/or 
pannexins mediated by AngII induces the ATP release to the extracellular media, 
with the subsequent activation of purinergic receptors. This process could 
elicit Ca2+ overload and constitute a feed-forward mechanism, leading to kidney 
damage."
1300,"Several types of haemoglobinopathies are caused by copy number variants (CNVs). 
While diagnosis is often based on haematological and biochemical parameters, a 
definitive diagnosis requires molecular DNA analysis. In some cases, the 
molecular characterisation of large deletions/duplications is challenging and 
inconclusive and often requires the use of specific diagnostic procedures, such 
as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Herein, we collected 
and comprehensively analysed all known CNVs associated with haemoglobinopathies. 
The dataset of 291 CNVs was retrieved from the IthaGenes database and was 
further manually annotated to specify genomic locations, breakpoints and MLPA 
probes relevant for each CNV. We developed IthaCNVs, a publicly available and 
easy-to-use online tool that can facilitate the diagnosis of rare and 
diagnostically challenging haemoglobinopathy cases attributed to CNVs. 
Importantly, it facilitates the filtering of available entries based on the type 
of breakpoint information, on specific chromosomal and locus positions, on MLPA 
probes, and on affected gene(s). IthaCNVs brings together manually curated 
information about CNV genomic locations, functional effects, and information 
that can facilitate CNV characterisation through MLPA. It can help laboratory 
staff and clinicians confirm suspected diagnosis of CNVs based on molecular DNA 
screening and analysis."
1301,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most important cause of 
acute lower respiratory tract infection in infants, neonates, and young 
children, even leading to hyperinflation and atelectasis. Oxymatrine (OMT), 
originating from natural herbs, possessed potential antivirus activity against 
influenza A virus, Coxsackie B3 virus, and RSV, whereas the absence of an in 
vivo study indicated the difficulties in overcoming the physiological obstacles. 
Since RSV basically replicated in lung tissue, in this study, we fabricated and 
characterized a chitosan (CS)-coated liposome with OMT loaded for the treatment 
of lethal RSV infection via inhalation. The results uncovered that OMT, as a 
hydrophilic drug, was liable to diffuse in the mucus layer and penetrate through 
the gas-blood barrier to enter systemic circulation quickly, which might 
restrict its inhibitory effect on RSV replication. The CS-coated liposome 
enhanced the distribution and retention of OMT in lung tissue without 
restriction from mucus, which contributed to the improved alleviative effect of 
OMT on lethal RSV-infected mice. Overall, this study provides a novel inhalation 
therapy for RSV infection, and the CS-coated liposome might be a potential 
inhalable nanocarrier for hydrophilic drugs to prevent pulmonary infections."
1302,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by 
clonal expansion of stem and myeloid progenitor cells. Immunotherapy has 
revolutionized the care for other cancers such as solid tumors and lymphomas, 
and has the potential to effectively treat AML. There has been substantial 
progress in the developments of immunotherapeutic approaches for AML over the 
last several years, including the development of antibodies that further 
increase the innate immunogenicity of leukemia cells by the inhibition of NKG2D 
ligand-particularly MICA and MICB-shedding, chimeric proteins such as IL-15 
superagonist that expand natural killer (NK) cells, blockers of immunologic 
checkpoints such as NKG2A, and chemicals that indirectly increase expression of 
immune stimulatory proteins in leukemia stem cells. Furthermore, cellular 
therapies have been designed to enable alloreactive immunity by allogeneic NK 
cells or target leukemia antigens such as mutated NPM1. These immunotherapeutic 
approaches have demonstrated remarkable efficacies in preclinical studies and 
have successfully transitioned to early phase clinical trials, to establish 
safety and initial signal of clinical activity. Here, we briefly discuss some of 
the most recent and impactful developments in the AML immunotherapy field and 
provide our perspectives for the future directions of this exciting and new 
therapeutic opportunity."
1303,"The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methodology was used to 
predict the blood-brain permeability (log BB) for 65 synthetic heterocyclic 
compounds tested as promising drug candidates. The compounds were characterized 
by different descriptors: lipophilicity, parachor, polarizability, molecular 
weight, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, number of rotatable bonds, and polar 
surface area. Lipophilic properties of the compounds were evaluated 
experimentally by micellar liquid chromatography (MLC). In the experiments, 
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the effluent component and the ODS-2 column were 
used. Using multiple linear regression and leave-one-out cross-validation, we 
derived the statistically significant and highly predictive quantitative 
structure-activity relationship models. Thus, this study provides valuable 
information on the expected properties of the substances that can be used as a 
support tool in the design of new therapeutic agents."
1304,"Over the past two decades, the treatment landscape for multiple myeloma (MM) has 
progressed significantly, with the introduction of several new drug classes that 
have greatly improved patient outcomes. At present, it is well known how the 
bone marrow (BM) microenvironment (ME) exerts an immunosuppressive action 
leading to an exhaustion of the immune system cells and promoting the 
proliferation and sustenance of tumor plasma cells. Therefore, having drugs that 
can reconstitute a healthy BM ME can improve results in MM patients. Recent 
findings clearly demonstrated that achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) 
negativity and sustaining MRD negativity over time play a pivotal prognostic 
role. However, despite the achievement of MRD negativity, patients may still 
relapse. The understanding of immunologic changes in the BM ME during treatment, 
complemented by a deeper knowledge of plasma cell genomics and biology, will be 
critical to develop future therapies to sustain MRD negativity over time and 
possibly achieve an operational cure. In this review, we focus on the components 
of the BM ME and their role in MM, on the prognostic significance of MRD 
negativity and, finally, on the relative contribution of tumor plasma cell 
biology and BM ME to long-term disease control."
1305,"The current investigation assessed the effect of the eudesmanolid, Vulgarin 
(VGN), obtained from Artemisia judaica (A. judaica), on the antidiabetic 
potential of glibenclamide (GLB) using streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes. 
Seven groups of rats were used in the study; the first group received the 
vehicle and served as normal control. The diabetic rats of the second to the 
fifth groups were treated with the vehicle (negative control), GLB at 5 mg/kg 
(positive control), VGN at 10 mg/kg (VGN-10) and VGN at 20 mg/kg (VGN-20), 
respectively. The diabetic rats of the sixth and seventh groups were 
administered combinations of GLB plus VGN-10 and GLB plus VGN-20, respectively. 
The diabetic rats treated with GLB plus VGN-20 combination showed marked 
improvement in the fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin and glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c), as well as the lipid profile, compared with those treated with GLB 
alone. Further, the pancreatic tissues of the diabetic rats that received the 
GLB+VGN-20 combination showed superior improvements in lipid peroxidation and 
antioxidant parameters than those of GLB monotherapy. The insulin content of the 
β-cells was restored in all treatments, while the levels of glucagon and 
somatostatin of the α- and δ-endocrine cells were reduced in the pancreatic 
islets. In addition, the concurrent administration of GLB+VGN-20 was the most 
effective in restoring PEPCK and G6Pase mRNA expression in the liver. In 
conclusion, the results demonstrated that the GLB+VGN-20 combination led to 
greater glycemic improvement in diabetic rats compared with GLB monotherapy 
through its antioxidant effect and capability to modulate PEPCK and G6Pase gene 
expression in their livers."
1306,"The activation of monocytes and their trans-differentiation into macrophages are 
critical processes of the immune response. Prior work has characterized the 
differences in the expression between monocytes and macrophages, but the 
transitional process between these cells is poorly detailed. Here, we analyzed 
the temporal changes of the transcriptome during trans-differentiation of 
primary human monocytes into M0 macrophages. We find changes with many 
transcription factors throughout the process, the vast majority of which exhibit 
a maximally different expression at the intermediate stages. A few factors, 
including AP-1, were previously known to play a role in immunological 
transitions, but most were not. Thus, these findings indicate that this 
trans-differentiation requires the dynamic expression of many transcription 
factors not previously discussed in immunology, and provide a foundation for the 
delineation of the molecular mechanisms associated with healthy or pathological 
responses that involve this transition."
1307,"Neutrophils represent the most abundant cell type of leukocytes in the human 
blood and have been considered a vital player in the innate immune system and 
the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Recently, several studies 
showed that neutrophils play an active role in the immune response during cancer 
development. They exhibited both pro-oncogenic and anti-tumor activities under 
the influence of various mediators in the tumor microenvironment. Neutrophils 
can be divided into several subpopulations, thus contradicting the traditional 
concept of neutrophils as a homogeneous population with a specific function in 
the innate immunity and opening new horizons for cancer therapy. Despite the 
promising achievements in this field, a full understanding of tumor-neutrophil 
interplay is currently lacking. In this review, we try to summarize the current 
view on neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer, discuss the different communication 
pathways between tumors and neutrophils, and focus on the implementation of 
these new findings to develop promising neutrophil-based cancer therapies."
1308,"Assessment of T-cell response to the tumor is important for diagnosis of the 
disease and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. For this, new non-destructive 
label-free methods are required. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of 
metabolic coenzymes is a promising innovative technology for the assessment of 
the functional status of cells. The purpose of this work was to test whether 
FLIM can resolve metabolic alterations that accompany T-cell reactivation to the 
tumors. The study was carried out on C57Bl/6 FoxP3-EGFP mice bearing B16F0 
melanoma. Autofluorescence of the immune cells in fresh lymphatic nodes (LNs) 
was investigated. It was found that fluorescence lifetime parameters of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) NAD(P)H are sensitive to tumor 
development. Effector T-cells in the LNs displayed higher contribution of free 
NADH, the form associated with glycolysis, in all tumors and the presence of 
protein-bound NADPH, associated with biosynthetic processes, in the tumors of 
large size. Flow cytometry showed that the changes in the NADH fraction of the 
effector T-cells correlated with their activation, while changes in NADPH 
correlated with cell proliferation. In conclusion, FLIM of NAD(P)H in fresh 
lymphoid tissue is a powerful tool for assessing the immune response to tumor 
development."
1309,"Several studies have indicated that a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) 
formation, apart from its role in host defense, can contribute to or drive 
pathogenesis in a wide range of inflammatory and thrombotic disorders. 
Therefore, NETs may serve as a therapeutic target or/and a diagnostic tool. 
Here, we compare the most commonly used techniques for the assessment of NET 
formation. Furthermore, we review recent data from the literature on the 
application of basic laboratory tools for detecting NET release and discuss the 
challenges and the advantages of these strategies in NET evaluation. Taken 
together, we provide some important insights into the qualitative and 
quantitative molecular analysis of NETs in translational medicine today."
1310,"The purpose of this study was to provide an immuno-mediated substantiation of 
the etiopathogenesis of mucositis and peri-implantitis based on the results of 
experimental, laboratory and clinical studies. The biopsy material was studied 
to identify impregnated nanoscale and microscale particles in the structure of 
pathological tissues by using X-ray microtomography and X-ray fluorescence 
analyses. Electron microscopy with energy-dispersive analysis identified the 
composition of supernatants containing nanoscale metal particles obtained from 
the surfaces of dental implants. The parameters of the nanoscale particles were 
determined by dynamic light scattering. Flow cytometry was used to study the 
effect of nanoscale particles on the ability to induce the activation and 
apoptosis of immunocompetent cells depending on the particles' concentrations 
during cultivation with the monocytic cell line THP-1 with the addition of 
inductors. An analysis of the laboratory results suggested the presence of 
dose-dependent activation, as well as early and late apoptosis of the 
immunocompetent cells. Activation and early and late apoptosis of a monocytic 
cell line when THP-1 was co-cultured with nanoscale metal particles in 
supernatants were shown for the first time. When human venous blood plasma was 
added, both activation and early and late apoptosis had a dose-dependent effect 
and differed from those of the control groups."
1311,"Myocardial infarction (MI), a major contributor to worldwide morbidity and 
mortality, is caused by a lack of blood flow to the heart. Affected heart tissue 
becomes ischemic due to deficiency of blood perfusion and oxygen delivery. In 
case sufficient blood flow cannot be timely restored, cardiac injury with 
necrosis occurs. The ischemic/necrotic area induces a systemic inflammatory 
response and hundreds of thousands of leukocytes are recruited from the blood to 
the injured heart. The blood pool of leukocytes is rapidly depleted and urgent 
re-supply of these cells is needed. Myeloid cells are generated in the bone 
marrow (BM) and spleen, released into the blood, travel to sites of need, 
extravasate and accumulate inside tissues to accomplish various functions. In 
this review we focus on the ""leukocyte supply chain"" and will separately 
evaluate different myeloid cell compartments (BM, spleen, blood, heart) in 
steady state and after MI. Moreover, we highlight the local and systemic 
kinetics of extracellular factors, chemokines and danger signals involved in the 
regulation of production/generation, release, transportation, uptake, and 
activation of myeloid cells during the inflammatory phase of MI."
1312,"Here, we examined the dynamics of the gut and respiratory microbiomes in severe 
COVID-19 patients in need of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). We recruited 85 critically ill patients (53 with COVID-19 and 32 without 
COVID-19) and 17 healthy controls (HCs) and monitored them for up to 4 weeks. We 
analyzed the bacterial and fungal taxonomic profiles and loads of 232 gut and 
respiratory samples and we measured the blood levels of Interleukin 6, IgG, and 
IgM in COVID-19 patients. Upon ICU admission, the bacterial composition and load 
in the gut and respiratory samples were altered in critically ill patients 
compared with HCs. During their ICU stay, the patients experienced increased 
bacterial and fungal loads, drastic decreased bacterial richness, and 
progressive changes in bacterial and fungal taxonomic profiles. In the gut 
samples, six bacterial taxa could discriminate ICU-COV(+) from ICU-COV(-) cases 
upon ICU admission and the bacterial taxa were associated according to age, 
PaO2/FiO2, and CRP levels. In the respiratory samples of the ICU-COV(+) 
patients, bacterial signatures including Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were 
found to be correlated with the length of ICU stay. Our findings demonstrated 
that the gut and respiratory microbiome dysbiosis and bacterial signatures 
associated with critical illness emerged as biomarkers of COVID-19 severity and 
could be a potential predictor of ICU length of stay. We propose using a 
high-throughput sequencing approach as an alternative to traditional isolation 
techniques to monitor ICU patient infection."
1313,"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD), an acquired valvular disease, remains an 
important cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. This chronic 
illness starts from untreated streptococcal throat infection, resulting in acute 
rheumatic fever (ARF) in susceptible individuals. Repeated infections lead to a 
chronic phase characterized by the damage of heart valves. Inflammation has been 
found to play important role in the development of this disease. All the studies 
presented in this review clearly show the involvement of the inflammatory state 
in the progression of this disease. However, the exact role of cytokines in 
inflammation sites remains to be examined, since most studies have so far 
focused on peripheral blood. Such analysis would provide information on 
inflammatory mechanisms in situ."
1314,"Like in many other pathologies, oxidative stress is involved in the development 
of neurodegenerative disorders. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the main protein in 
different body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By its redox state in 
terms of cysteine-34, albumin serves as marker for oxidative burden. We aimed to 
evaluate the redox state of HSA in patients with multiple sclerosis in serum and 
CSF in comparison to controls to identify possible correlations with disease 
activity and severity. Samples were stored at -70 °C until analysis by HPLC for 
the determination of albumin redox state in terms of the fractions of human 
mercaptalbumin (HMA), human nonmercaptalbumin1 (HNA1), and human 
nonmercaptalbumin2 (HNA2). Albumin in CSF showed significantly higher fractions 
of the reduced form HMA and decreased HNA1 and HNA2. There was no difference 
between albumin redox states in serum of patients and controls. In CSF of 
patients HNA2 showed a trend to higher fractions compared to controls. Albumin 
redox state in serum was associated with physical disability in remission while 
albumin redox state in CSF was related to disease activity. Thus, albumin redox 
state in serum and CSF of patients in relation to disease condition merits 
further investigation."
1315,"Small particles in natural sources are a subject of interest for their potential 
role in intercellular, inter-organism, and inter-species interactions, but their 
harvesting and assessment present a challenge due to their small size and 
transient identity. We applied a recently developed interferometric light 
microscopy (ILM) to assess the number density and hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 
isolated small cellular particles (SCPs) from blood preparations (plasma and 
washed erythrocytes) (B), spruce needle homogenate (S), suspension of flagellae 
of microalgae Tetraselmis chuii (T), conditioned culture media of microalgae 
Phaeodactylum tricornutum (P), and liposomes (L). The aliquots were also 
assessed by flow cytometry (FCM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), 
ultraviolet-visible spectrometry (UV-vis), and imaging by cryogenic transmission 
electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). In Rh, ILM showed agreement with DLS within the 
measurement error in 10 out of 13 samples and was the only method used here that 
yielded particle density. Cryo-TEM revealed that representative SCPs from 
Tetraselmis chuii flagella (T) did not have a globular shape, so the 
interpretation by Rh of the batch methods was biased. Cryo-TEM showed the 
presence of thin filaments in isolates from Phaeodactylum tricornutum 
conditioned culture media (P), which provides an explanation for the 
considerably larger Rh obtained by batch methods than the sizes of particles 
observed by cryo-TEM images. ILM proved convenient for assessment of number 
density and Rh of SCPs in blood preparations (e.g., plasma); therefore, its use 
in population and clinical studies is indicated."
1316,"The roles of angiotensin II (Ang II) AT1 (AT1a) receptors and its downstream 
target Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the proximal tubules in the development of 
two-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) Goldblatt hypertension have not been investigated 
previously. The present study tested the hypothesis that deletion of the AT1a 
receptor or NHE3 selectively in the proximal tubules of the kidney attenuates 
the development of 2K1C hypertension using novel mouse models with proximal 
tubule-specific deletion of AT1a receptors or NHE3. 2K1C Goldblatt hypertension 
was induced by placing a silver clip (0.12 mm) on the left renal artery for 4 
weeks in adult male wild-type (WT), global Agtr1a-/-, proximal tubule 
(PT)-specific PT-Agtr1a-/- or PT-Nhe3-/- mice, respectively. As expected, 
telemetry blood pressure increased in a time-dependent manner in WT mice, 
reaching a maximal response by Week 3 (p &lt; 0.01). 2K1C hypertension in WT 
mice was associated with increases in renin expression in the clipped kidney and 
decreases in the nonclipped kidney (p &lt; 0.05). Plasma and kidney Ang II were 
significantly increased in WT mice with 2K1C hypertension (p &lt; 0.05). 
Tubulointerstitial fibrotic responses were significantly increased in the 
clipped kidney (p &lt; 0.01). Whole-body deletion of AT1a receptors completely 
blocked the development of 2K1C hypertension in Agtr1a-/- mice (p &lt; 0.01 vs. 
WT). Likewise, proximal tubule-specific deletion of Agtr1a in PT-Agtr1a-/- mice 
or NHE3 in PT-Nhe3-/- mice also blocked the development of 2K1C hypertension (p 
&lt; 0.01 vs. WT). Taken together, the present study provides new evidence for a 
critical role of proximal tubule Ang II/AT1 (AT1a)/NHE3 axis in the development 
of 2K1C Goldblatt hypertension."
1317,"Abnormalities in hematological parameters of peripheral blood have been noted in 
patients with endogenous Cushing's Syndrome (CS) in the corticotropin 
(ACTH)-dependent and ACTH-independent forms. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism 
of glucocorticoids (GCs) action on human hematopoiesis is still not entirely 
clear. The aim of the study was to determine whether endogenous excessive 
production of GCs could affect apoptosis of CD34+ cells enriched in 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) collected from the peripheral 
blood of newly diagnosed CS patients. Flow cytometry, Annexin-V enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, TUNEL assay, real-time quantitative PCR, and microarray 
RNA/miRNA techniques were used to characterize CS patients' HSPCs. We found that 
the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein expression levels in CS were higher 
than in healthy controls. A complex analysis of apoptotic status of CS patients' 
HSPC cells showed that GCs significantly augmented apoptosis in peripheral 
blood-derived CD34+ cells and results obtained using different methods to detect 
early and late apoptosis in analyzed cell population were consistent. CS was 
also associated with significant upregulation in several members of the BCL-2 
superfamily and other genes associated with apoptosis control. Furthermore, 
global gene expression analysis revealed significantly higher expression of 
genes associated with programmed cell death control in HSPCs from CS patients. 
These findings suggest that human endogenous GCs have a direct pro-apoptotic 
activity in hematopoietic CD34+ cells derived from CS subjects before treatment."
1318,"The stria vascularis (SV) contributes to cochlear homeostasis and consists of 
three layers, one of which contains the blood-labyrinthic barrier (BLB), with a 
large number of bovine cochlear pericytes (BCPs). Cisplatin is a 
chemotherapeutic drug that can damage the SV and cause hearing loss. In this 
study, cell viability, proliferation rate, cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen 
species production were evaluated. The protein content of phospho-extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, total ERK 1/2, phospho-cytosolic 
phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), total cPLA2 and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and the 
release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
from BCPs were analyzed. Finally, the protective effect of platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF-BB) on BCPs treated with cisplatin was investigated. 
Cisplatin reduced viability and proliferation, activated ERK 1/2, cPLA2 and 
COX-2 expression and increased PGE2 and VEGF release; these effects were 
reversed by Dexamethasone. The presence of PDGF-BB during the treatment with 
cisplatin significantly increased the proliferation rate. No studies on cell 
regeneration in ear tissue evaluated the effect of the PDGF/Dex combination. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cisplatin on cochlear 
pericytes and propose new otoprotective agents aimed at preventing the reduction 
of their vitality and thus maintaining the BLB structure."
1319,"Antipsychotics (AP) induced prolongation of the QT interval in patients with 
schizophrenia (Sch) is an actual interdisciplinary problem as it increases the 
risk of sudden death syndrome. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a cardiac adverse drug 
reaction is a multifactorial symptomatic disorder, the development of which is 
influenced by modifying factors (APs' dose, duration of APs therapy, APs 
polytherapy, and monotherapy, etc.) and non-modifying factors (genetic 
predisposition, gender, age, etc.). The genetic predisposition to AP-induced 
LQTS may be due to several causes, including causal mutations in the genes 
responsible for monoheme forms of LQTS, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of the 
candidate genes encoding voltage-dependent ion channels expressed both in the 
brain and in the heart, and SNVs of candidate genes encoding key enzymes of APs 
metabolism. This narrative review summarizes the results of genetic studies on 
AP-induced LQTS and proposes a new personalized approach to assessing the risk 
of its development (low, moderate, high). We recommend implementation in 
protocols of primary diagnosis of AP-induced LQTS and medication dispensary 
additional observations of the risk category of patients receiving APs, 
deoxyribonucleic acid profiling, regular electrocardiogram monitoring, and 
regular therapeutic drug monitoring of the blood APs levels."
1320,"Human platelet lysate (HPL) is an efficient alternative for animal serum 
supplements, significantly enhancing stromal cell proliferation. However, the 
molecular mechanism behind this growth-promoting effect remains elusive. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the effect of HPL on cell cycle gene expression 
in different human stromal cells and to identify the main key players that 
mediate HPL's growth-enhancing effect. RT-qPCR and an antibody array revealed 
significant upregulation of cell cycle genes in stromal cells cultured in HPL. 
As HPL is rich in growth factors that are ligands of tyrosine kinase receptor 
(TKR) pathways, we used TKR inhibitors and could significantly reduce cell 
proliferation. Genome profiling, RT-qPCR and Western blotting revealed an 
enhanced expression of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 3 (STAT3) and MYC, both known TKR downstream effectors and 
stimulators of cell proliferation, in response to HPL. In addition, specifically 
blocking STAT3 resulted in reduced cell proliferation and expression of cell 
cycle genes. Our data indicate that HPL-enhanced cell proliferation can, at 
least in part, be explained by the TKR-enhanced expression of STAT3 and MYC, 
which in turn induce the expression of genes being involved in the promotion and 
control of the cell cycle."
1321,"Using a model of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) in vitro and in vivo, we previously 
demonstrated increased antitumor activity in CD8+ T-cells reprogrammed with an 
MEK inhibitor and PD-1 blocker. In this follow-up study, we carried out the 
reprogramming of human CD8+ T-cells (hrT-cell) using the MEK inhibitor and PD-1 
blocker and targeted LLC cells. The effects of hrT-cell therapy were studied in 
a mouse model of spontaneous metastasis of a solid LLC tumor. We found 
antimetastatic activity of hrT-cells, a decrease in the number of cancer cells 
and cancer stem cells in the lungs, and an increase in the number of T-cells in 
the blood (including effector T-cells). Thus, reprogramming of human CD8+ 
T-cells with an MEK inhibitor and PD-1 blocker with targeted training by tumor 
target cells is a potential platform for developing a new approach to targeted 
lung cancer therapy."
1322,"Venous and arterial thromboembolism (VTE/ATE) are common complications in cancer 
patients. Antithrombin deficiency is a risk factor for thrombosis in the general 
population, but its connection to risk of cancer-associated thrombosis is 
unclear. We investigated the association of antithrombin activity levels with 
risk of cancer-associated VTE/ATE and all-cause mortality in an observational 
cohort study including patients with cancer, the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis 
Study. In total, 1127 patients were included (45% female, median age: 62 years). 
Amongst these subjects, 110 (9.7%) patients were diagnosed with VTE, 32 (2.8%) 
with ATE, and 563 (49.9%) died. Antithrombin was not associated with a risk of 
VTE (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR): 1.00 per 1% increase in antithrombin 
level; 95% CI: 0.99-1.01) or ATE (SHR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.98-1.03). However, 
antithrombin showed a u-shaped association with the risk of all-cause death, 
i.e., patients with very low but also very high levels had poorer overall 
survival. In the subgroup of patients with brain tumors, higher antithrombin 
levels were associated with ATE risk (SHR: 1.02 per 1% increase; 95% CI: 
1.00-1.04) and mortality (HR: 1.01 per 1% increase; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02). Both 
high and low antithrombin activity was associated with the risk of death. 
However, no association with cancer-associated VTE and ATE across all cancer 
types was found, with the exception of in brain tumors."
1323,"Stroke and cancer are disabling diseases with an enormous global burden, 
disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and low- and middle-income 
countries. Both these diseases share common risk factors, which warrant 
concerted attention toward reshaping population health approaches and the 
conducting of fundamental studies. In this article, an overview of 
epidemiological trends in the prevalence and burden of cancer and stroke, 
underlying biological mechanisms and clinical risk factors, and various tools 
available for risk prediction and prognosis are provided. Finally, future 
recommendations for research and existing gaps in our understanding of 
pathophysiology. Further research must investigate the causes that predispose 
patients to an increased risk of stroke and/or cancer, as well as biomarkers 
that can be used to predict growing morbidity and mortality."
1324,"Red blood cell (RBC) aggregation and deformation are governed by the molecular 
processes occurring on the membrane. Since several social important diseases are 
accompanied by alterations in RBC aggregation and deformability, it is important 
to develop a diagnostic parameter of RBC membrane structural integrity and 
stability. In this work, we propose membrane microviscosity assessed by 
time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of the lipophilic PKH26 fluorescent probe 
as a diagnostic parameter. We measured the fluorescence decay curves of the 
PKH26 probe in the RBC membrane to establish the optimal parameters of the 
developed fluorescence assay. We observed a complex biphasic profile of the 
fluorescence anisotropy decay characterized by two correlation times 
corresponding to the rotational diffusion of free PKH26, and membrane-bounded 
molecules of the probe. The developed assay allowed us to estimate membrane 
microviscosity ηm in the range of 100-500 cP depending on the temperature, which 
paves the way for assessing RBC membrane properties in clinical applications as 
predictors of blood microrheological abnormalities."
1325,"β-thalassemia is one of the most common monogenic disorders and a 
life-threatening health issue in children. A cost-effective and safe therapeutic 
approach to treat this disease is to reactivate the γ-globin gene for fetal 
hemoglobin (HbF) production that has been silenced during infancy. Hydroxyurea 
(HU) is the only FDA approved HbF inducer. However, its cytotoxicity and 
inability to respond significantly in all patients pose a need for an HbF 
inducer with better efficacy. The study describes the serum metabolic alteration 
in β-YAC transgenic mice treated with Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (n = 
5), a newly identified HbF inducer, and compared to the mice groups treated with 
HU (n = 5) and untreated control (n = 5) using gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. Various univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were 
performed to identify discriminant metabolites that altered the biological 
pathways encompassing galactose metabolism, lactose degradation, and inositol. 
Furthermore, the decreased concentrations of L-fucose and geraniol in 
TDF-treated mice help in recovering towards normal, decreasing oxidative stress 
even much better than the HU-treated mice. The proposed study suggested that TDF 
can reduce the deficiency of blood required for β-thalassemia and can be used 
for the preclinical study at phase I/II for fetal hemoglobin production."
1326,"Globally, there are over half a million new patients with head and neck squamous 
cell carcinomas (HNSCC) every year. The current therapeutic approaches to HNSCC 
are surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. These approaches carry a high incidence 
of metastasis or recurrence from HNSCC cells' radioresistance. Recent studies 
have revealed that a combination with radiosensitizers can be used to improve 
the radioresistance in HNSCC; however, few agents are approved as 
radiosensitizers. The constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase 
(PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a 
vitally oncogenic type of signaling that promotes tumorigenesis, metastasis, and 
radiotherapy resistance in HNSCC. Pharmacological targeting of PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signaling pathway is considered a promising strategy of radiosensitization in 
HNSCC. In this review, we summarize the oncogenic significance of PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signaling in HNSCC with radiotherapy resistance and highlight the therapeutic 
potential of small molecule inhibitors against PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling for the 
radiosensitization in HNSCC treatment. It provides a mechanistic framework for 
the development of new drugs for radiosensitization in HNSCC radiotherapy via 
targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway."
1327,"Only 3-5% of heavy alcohol users develop acute alcohol pancreatitis (AAP). This 
suggests that additional triggers are required to initiate the inflammatory 
process. Genetic susceptibility contributes to the development of AAP, and 
SPINK1 mutation is a documented risk factor. We investigated the prevalence of 
the SPINK1(N34S) mutation in patients with AAP compared to heavy alcohol users 
who had never suffered an episode of pancreatitis. Blood samples for the 
mutational analysis from patients with first episode (n = 60) and recurrent AAP 
(n = 43) and from heavy alcohol users without a history of AAP (n = 98) as well 
as from a control population (n = 1914) were obtained. SPINK1 mutation was found 
in 8.7% of the patients with AAP. The prevalence was significantly lower in 
healthy controls (3.4%, OR 2.72; 1.32-5.64) and very low in alcoholics without 
pancreatitis (1.0%, OR 9.29; 1.15-74.74). In a comparison adjusted for potential 
cofounders between AAP patients and alcoholics, SPINK1 was found to be an 
independent marker for AAP. The prevalence of the SPINK1 mutation is 
overrepresented in AAP patients and very low in alcoholics without pancreatitis. 
This finding may play a role in understanding the variable susceptibility to AAP 
found in heavy alcohol users."
1328,"Interleukin 35 (IL-35), a new member of the IL-12 family of heterodimeric 
cytokines, could induce two different types of regulatory cells including 
regulatory T and B cells such as IL-35-induced regulatory T cells and 
IL-10-producing regulatory B cells (IL-10+Bregs), and IL-35-producing regulatory 
B cells (IL-35+Bregs). These cells appear to play an important role in 
modulating the immune system in numerous diseases. Several findings suggested 
that the expression of IL-35 is dysregulated in many autoimmune, inflammatory, 
and allergic diseases. Due to the functions of IL-35, it seems that this 
cytokine may act as an efficient therapeutic strategy for numerous conditions 
including atopic dermatitis (AD). We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview 
of the role of IL-35 in modulating the immune system. Additionally, we highlight 
IL-35 as a specific immunological target, discuss its possible involvement in 
the pathogenesis of AD, and hypothesize that IL-35 may become a novel target for 
the treatment of AD. However, further studies are required to evaluate this 
hypothesis."
1329,"Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is characterized by hepatic 
steatosis, metabolic dysregulation, and neutrophilic inflammation. In this 
study, we hypothesized that systemic levels of plasma calprotectin, as a 
biomarker of neutrophilic inflammation, may be associated with suspected MAFLD. 
Plasma calprotectin levels were measured in subjects (n = 5446) participating in 
the Prevention of Renal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease (PREVEND) cohort study. 
Suspected MAFLD was defined by the fatty liver index (FLI ≥ 60) and hepatic 
steatosis index (HSI ≥ 36) as proxies. Plasma calprotectin levels were 
significantly higher in subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (0.57 [IQR: 0.42-0.79] mg/L, n = 
1592) (p &lt; 0.001) compared to subjects with FLI &lt; 60 (0.46 [0.34-0.65] 
mg/L, n = 3854). Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that plasma 
calprotectin levels were significantly associated with suspected MAFLD (FLI ≥ 
60), even after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including current 
smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, 
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), hs-CRP, eGFR, and total cholesterol levels (OR 
1.19 [95% CI: 1.06-1.33], p = 0.003). Interaction analyses revealed significant 
effect modifications for the association between plasma calprotectin and 
suspected MAFLD by BMI (p &lt; 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.003), with the 
strongest associations in subjects with normal BMI and without hypertension. 
Prospectively, plasma calprotectin levels were significantly associated with 
all-cause mortality after adjustment for potential confounding factors, 
particularly in subjects without suspected MAFLD (FLI &lt; 60) (hazard ratio 
(HR) per doubling: 1.34 (1.05-1.72), p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, higher plasma 
calprotectin levels are associated with suspected MAFLD and with the risk of 
all-cause mortality, the latter especially in subjects without suspected MAFLD."
1330,"Multiple myeloma (MM) has a highly heterogeneous genetic background, which 
complicates its molecular tracking over time. Nevertheless, each MM patient's 
malignant plasma cells (PCs) share unique V(D)J rearranged sequences at 
immunoglobulin loci, which represent ideal disease biomarkers. Because the 
tumor-specific V(D)J sequence is highly expressed in bulk RNA in MM patients, we 
wondered whether it can be identified by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). 
To this end we analyzed CD138+ cells purified from bone marrow aspirates of 19 
samples with PC dyscrasias by both a standard method based on bulk DNA and by an 
implementation of the standard 10x Genomics protocol to detect expressed V(D)J 
sequences. A dominant clonotype was easily identified in each sample, accounting 
on average for 83.65% of V(D)J-rearranged cells. Compared with standard methods, 
scRNA-seq analysis proved highly concordant and even more effective in 
identifying clonal productive rearrangements, by-passing limitations related to 
the misannealing of consensus primers in hypermutated regions. We next validated 
its accuracy to track 5 clonal cells with absolute sensitivity in a virtual 
sample containing 3180 polyclonal cells. This shows that single-cell V(D)J 
analysis may be used to find rare clonal cells, laying the foundations for 
functional single-cell dissection of minimal residual disease."
1331,"A defection of blood circulation in the brain leads to ischemia, damage, and the 
death of nerve cells. It is known that individual populations of GABAergic 
neurons are the least resistant to the damaging factors of ischemia and 
therefore they die first of all, which leads to impaired inhibition in neuronal 
networks. To date, the neuroprotective properties of a number of calcium-binding 
proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin), which are markers of 
GABAergic neurons, are known. Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a signaling 
protein that is expressed in all types of neurons and is involved in the 
regulation of neurotransmission. The role of NCS-1 in the protection of neurons 
and especially their individual populations from ischemia and hyperexcitation 
has not been practically studied. In this work, using the methods of 
fluorescence microscopy, vitality tests, immunocytochemistry, and PCR analysis, 
the molecular mechanisms of the protective action of NCS-1 in 
ischemia/reoxygenation and hyperammonemia were established. Since NCS-1 is most 
expressed in GABAergic neurons, the knockdown of this protein with siRNA led to 
the most pronounced consequences in GABAergic neurons. The knockdown of NCS-1 
(NCS-1-KD) suppressed the basic expression of protective proteins without 
significantly reducing cell viability. However, ischemia-like conditions 
(oxygen-glucose deprivation, OGD) and subsequent 24-h reoxygenation led to a 
more massive activation of apoptosis and necrosis in neurons with NCS-1-KD, 
compared to control cells. The mass death of NCS-1-KD cells during OGD and 
hyperammonemia has been associated with the induction of a more pronounced 
network hyperexcitation symptom, especially in the population of GABAergic 
neurons, leading to a global increase in cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i). The 
symptom of hyperexcitation of neurons with NCS-1-KD correlated with a decrease 
in the level of expression of the calcium-binding protein-parvalbumin. This was 
accompanied by an increase in the expression of excitatory ionotropic glutamate 
receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate and 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (NMDAR and AMPAR) 
against the background of suppression of the expression of glutamate 
decarboxylase (synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid)."
1332,"Both physiological and pathological aging processes induce brain alterations 
especially affecting the speed of processing, working memory, conceptual 
reasoning and executive functions. Many therapeutic approaches to reduce the 
impact of brain aging on cognitive functioning have been tested; unfortunately, 
there are no satisfactory results as a single therapy. As aging is partly 
contributed by free radical reactions, it has been proposed that exogenous 
antioxidants could have a positive impact on both aging and its associated 
manifestations. The aim of this report is to provide a summary and a subsequent 
review of the literature evidence on the role of antioxidants in preventing and 
improving cognition in the aging brain. Manipulation of endogenous cellular 
defense mechanisms through nutritional antioxidants or pharmacological compounds 
represents an innovative approach to therapeutic intervention in diseases 
causing brain tissue damage, such as neurodegeneration. Coherently with this 
notion, antioxidants, especially those derived from the Mediterranean diet such 
as hydroxytyrosol and resveratrol, seem to be able to delay and modulate the 
cognitive brain aging processes and decrease the occurrence of its effects on 
the brain. The potential preventive activity of antioxidants should be evaluated 
in long-term exposure clinical trials, using preparations with high 
bioavailability, able to bypass the blood-brain barrier limitation, and that are 
well standardized."
1333,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors show synergy with several genotoxic drugs. 
Herein, we investigated the biological impact of the combined treatment of 
panobinostat and melphalan in multiple myeloma (MM). DNA damage response (DDR) 
parameters and the expression of DDR-associated genes were analyzed in bone 
marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 
26 newly diagnosed MM patients. PBMCs from 25 healthy controls (HC) were 
examined in parallel. Compared with the ex vivo melphalan-only treatment, 
combined treatment with panobinostat and melphalan significantly reduced the 
efficiency of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and double-strand-break repair 
(DSB/R), enhanced the accumulation of DNA lesions (monoadducts and DSBs), and 
increased the apoptosis rate only in patients' BMPCs (all p &lt; 0.001); 
marginal changes were observed in PBMCs from the same patients or HC. 
Accordingly, panobinostat pre-treatment decreased the expression levels of 
critical NER (DDB2, XPC) and DSB/R (MRE11A, PRKDC/DNAPKc, RAD50, XRCC6/Ku70) 
genes only in patients' BMPCs; no significant changes were observed in PBMCs 
from patients or HC. Together, our findings demonstrate that panobinostat 
significantly increased the melphalan sensitivity of malignant BMPCs without 
increasing the melphalan sensitivity of PBMCs from the same patients, thus 
paving the way for combination therapies in MM with improved anti-myeloma 
efficacy and lower side effects."
1334,"Blood-based biomarkers are needed for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). We analyzed longitudinal human plasma samples from AD and control cases to 
identify biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD. Plasma samples were grouped 
based on clinical diagnosis at the time of collection: AD, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and pre-symptomatic (preMCI). Samples were analyzed by ELISA 
using a panel of reagents against nine different AD-related amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, 
or TDP-43 variants. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of different 
biomarker panels for different diagnostic sample groups were determined. 
Analysis of all of the samples gave a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 76% 
for the diagnosis of AD. Early-stage diagnosis of AD, utilizing only the preMCI 
and MCI samples, identified 88% of AD cases. Using sex-biased biomarker panels, 
early diagnosis of AD cases improved to 96%. Using the sex-biased panels, we 
also identified 6 of the 25 control group cases as being at high risk of AD, 
which is consistent with what is expected given the advanced age of the control 
cases. Specific AD-associated protein variants are effective blood-based 
biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD. Notably, significant differences were 
observed in biomarker profiles for the early detection of male and female AD 
cases."
1335,"A promise of cancer nanomedicine is the ""targeted"" delivery of therapeutic 
agents to tumors by the rational design of nanostructured materials. During the 
past several decades, a realization that in vitro and in vivo preclinical data 
are unreliable predictors of successful clinical translation has motivated a 
reexamination of this approach. Mathematical models of drug pharmacokinetics 
(PK) and biodistribution (BD) are essential tools for small-molecule drugs 
development. A key assumption underlying these models is that drug-target 
binding kinetics dominate blood clearance, hence recognition by host innate 
immune cells is not explicitly included. Nanoparticles circulating in the blood 
are conspicuous to phagocytes, and inevitable interactions typically trigger 
active biological responses to sequester and remove them from circulation. Our 
recent findings suggest that, instead of referring to nanoparticles as designed 
for active or passive ""tumor targeting"", we ought rather to refer to immune 
cells residing in the tumor microenvironment (TME) as active or passive actors 
in an essentially ""cell-mediated tumor retention"" process that competes with 
active removal by other phagocytes. Indeed, following intravenous injection, 
nanoparticles induce changes in the immune compartment of the TME because of 
nanoparticle uptake, irrespective of the nature of tumor targeting moieties. In 
this study, we propose a 6-compartment PK model as an initial mathematical 
framework for modeling this tumor-associated immune cell-mediated retention. 
Published in vivo PK and BD results obtained with bionized nanoferrite® (BNF®) 
nanoparticles were combined with results from in vitro internalization 
experiments with murine macrophages to guide simulations. As a preliminary 
approximation, we assumed that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are solely 
responsible for active retention in the TME. We model the TAM approximation by 
relating in vitro macrophage uptake to an effective macrophage avidity term for 
the BNF® nanoparticles under consideration."
1336,"Uncomplicated type 1 diabetes (T1DM) displays all features of subclinical 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) as is associated with inflammation, endothelial 
dysfunction and low endothelial progenitor cells. MiR-200c-3p has been shown in 
animal tissues to be pro-atherogenic. We aimed to explore the role of 
miR-200c-3p in T1DM, a model of subclinical CVD. 19 samples from T1DM patients 
and 20 from matched controls (HC) were analyzed. MiR-200c in plasma and 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured by real-time 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results were compared with the 
following indices of vascular health: circulating endothelial progenitor cells, 
(CD45dimCD34+VEGFR-2+ or CD45dimCD34+CD133+) and proangiogenic cells (PACs). 
MiR-200c-3p was significantly downregulated in PBMCs but not in plasma in T1DM. 
There was a significant negative correlation between the expression of 
miR-200c-3p and HbA1c, interleukin-7 (IL-7), vascular endothelial growth 
factor-C (VEGF-C), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and a positive 
correlation with CD45dimCD34+VEGFR-2+, CD45dimCD34+CD133+ and PACs. Receiver 
operating curve analyses showed miR-200c-3p as a biomarker for T1DM with 
significant downregulation of miR-200c-3p, possibly defining subclinical CVD at 
HbA1c &gt; 44.8 mmol/mol (6.2%). In conclusion, downregulated miR-200c-3p in 
T1DM correlated with diabetic control, VEGF signaling, inflammation, vascular 
health and targeting VEGF signaling, and may define subclinical CVD. Further 
prospective studies are necessary to validate our findings in a larger group of 
patients."
1337,"Gastrointestinal diseases, such as peptic ulcers, are caused by a damage in the 
gastric mucosa provoked by several factors. This stomach injury is regulated by 
many inflammatory mediators and is commonly treated with proton-pump inhibitors, 
histamine H2 receptor blockers and antacids. However, various medicinal plants 
have demonstrated positive effects on gastric ulcer treatment, including plants 
of the Ceiba genus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiulcer and 
anti-inflammatory activities of the stem bark ethanolic extract of Ceiba 
speciosa (A. St.-Hil.) Ravenna. We performed a preliminary quantification of 
phenolic compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array 
detection (HPLC-DAD), followed by the prospection of other chemical groups 
through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A set of in vitro assays 
was used to evaluate the extract potential regarding its antioxidant activity 
(DPPH: 19.83 ± 0.34 µg/mL; TPC: 307.20 ± 6.20 mg GAE/g of extract), effects on 
cell viability and on the release of TNF-α in whole human blood. Additionally, 
in vivo assays were performed to evaluate the leukocyte accumulation and total 
protein quantification in carrageenan-induced air pouch, as well as the 
antiulcerogenic effect of the extract on an ethanol-induced ulcer in rats. The 
extract contains flavonoids and phenolic compounds, as well as sugars and quinic 
acid derivatives exhibiting potent antioxidant activity and low toxicity. The 
extract reduced the release of TNF-α in human blood and inhibited the activity 
of p38α (1.66 µg/mL), JAK3 (5.25 µg/mL), and JNK3 (8.34 µg/mL). Moreover, it 
reduced the leukocyte recruitment on the pouch exudate and the formation of 
edema, reverting the effects caused by carrageenan. The extract presented a 
significant prevention of ulcer formation and a higher reduction than the 
reference drug, Omeprazole. Therefore, C. speciosa extract has demonstrated 
relevant therapeutic potential for the treatment of gastric diseases, deserving 
the continuation of further studies to unveil the mechanisms of action of plant 
bioactive ingredients."
1338,"Evidence is accumulating that the tumour microenvironment (TME) has a key role 
in the progression of gliomas. Non-neoplastic cells in addition to the tumour 
cells are therefore finding increasing attention. Microglia and other 
glioma-associated macrophages are at the centre of this interest especially in 
the context of therapeutic considerations. New ideas have emerged regarding the 
role of microglia and, more recently, blood-derived brain macrophages in 
glioblastoma (GBM) progression. We are now beginning to understand the 
mechanisms that allow malignant glioma cells to weaken microglia and brain 
macrophage defence mechanisms. Surface molecules and cytokines have a prominent 
role in microglia/macrophage-glioma cell interactions, and we discuss them in 
detail. The involvement of exosomes and microRNAs forms another focus of this 
review. In addition, certain microglia and glioma cell pathways deserve special 
attention. These ""synergistic"" (we suggest calling them ""Janus"") pathways are 
active in both glioma cells and microglia/macrophages where they act in concert 
supporting malignant glioma progression. Examples include CCN4 (WISP1)/Integrin 
α6β1/Akt and CHI3L1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR. They represent attractive therapeutic 
targets."
1339,"Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) plays an important role in reverse electron 
transfer during hypoxia/anoxia, in particular, in ischemia, when blood supply to 
an organ is disrupted, and oxygen is not available. It was detected in the 
voltammetry studies about three decades ago that the SDHA/SDHB subcomplex of SDH 
can have such a strong nonlinear property as a ""tunnel-diode"" behavior in 
reverse quinol-fumarate reductase direction. The molecular and kinetic 
mechanisms of this phenomenon, that is, a strong drop in the rate of fumarate 
reduction as the driving force is increased, are still unclear. In order to 
account for this property of SDH, we developed and analyzed a mechanistic 
computational model of reverse electron transfer in the SDHA/SDHB subcomplex of 
SDH. It was shown that a decrease in the rate of succinate release from the 
active center during fumarate reduction quantitatively explains the 
experimentally observed tunnel-diode behavior in SDH and threshold values of the 
electrode potential of about -80 mV. Computational analysis of ROS production in 
the SDHA/SDHB subcomplex of SDH during reverse electron transfer predicts that 
the rate of ROS production decreases when the tunnel-diode behavior appears. 
These results predict a low rate of ROS production by the SDHA/SDHB subcomplex 
of SDH during ischemia."
1340,"Neovascular or ""wet"" age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a leading cause 
of blindness among older adults. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major 
pathological feature of nAMD, in which abnormal new blood vessel growth from the 
choroid leads to irreversible vision loss. There is a critical need to develop 
novel therapeutic strategies to address limitations of the current anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor biologics. Previously, we identified soluble epoxide 
hydrolase (sEH) as a possible therapeutic target for CNV through a forward 
chemical genetic approach. The purpose of this study was to validate sEH as a 
target by examining retinal expression of sEH protein and mRNA by 
immunohistochemistry and RNAscope in situ hybridization, respectively, and to 
assess the efficacy of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector designed to knock 
down the sEH gene, Ephx2, in the murine laser-induced (L-) CNV model. nAMD 
patient postmortem eye tissue and murine L-CNV showed overexpression of sEH in 
photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells. Ephx2 knockdown 
significantly reduced CNV and normalized mRNA expression levels of CNV-related 
inflammatory markers. Thus, this study further establishes sEH as a promising 
therapeutic target against CNV associated with nAMD."
1341,"Despite the current developments in cancer therapeutics, efforts to excavate new 
anticancer agents continue rigorously due to obstacles, such as side effects and 
drug resistance. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) can be utilized to treat cancer 
because of their effectiveness on a variety of molecular targets, along with 
high selectivity and specificity for cancer cells. In the present study, a novel 
ACP was de novo designed using in silico methods, and its functionality and 
molecular mechanisms of action were explored. AC-P19M was discovered through 
functional prediction and sequence modification based on peptide sequences 
currently available in the database. The peptide exhibited anticancer activity 
against lung cancer cells, A549 and H460, by disrupting cellular membranes and 
inducing apoptosis while showing low toxicity towards normal and red blood 
cells. In addition, the peptide inhibited the migration and invasion of lung 
cancer cells and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, AC-P19M 
showed anti-angiogenic activity through the inhibition of vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor 2 signaling. Our findings suggest that AC-P19M is a novel 
ACP that directly or indirectly targets cancer cells, demonstrating the 
potential development of an anticancer agent and providing insights into the 
discovery of functional substances based on an in silico approach."
1342,"The complement system is composed of a complex protein network and is pivotal to 
innate immunity. Complement 3 (C3) is a critical protein in the complement 
cascade and participates in complement activation and immune defense. In this 
study, C3 from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was cloned and its function 
in resisting pathogen infection was characterized. The full length of OnC3 open 
reading frame is 4974 bp, encoding 1657 aa, and the predicted protein mass 
weight is 185.93 kDa. The OnC3 amino acid sequence contains macroglobulin 
domains. The expression pattern of OnC3 mRNA in the tissues of healthy fish was 
detected, with the highest in the liver and the lowest in the muscle. After 
challenged with Streptococcus agalactiae and Aeromonas hydrophila, the 
expression of OnC3 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in the liver, spleen, and 
head kidney. Further, the recombinant OnC3 protein alleviated the inflammatory 
response and pathological damage of tissues after infected with S. agalactiae. 
Moreover, the OnC3 promoted the phagocytosis of monocytes/macrophages to S. 
agalactiae. The data obtained in this study provide a theoretical reference for 
in-depth understanding of C3 in host defense against bacterial infection and the 
immunomodulatory roles in teleost fish."
1343,"Inflammation plays a considerable role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, 
including neurodegenerative and psychiatric ones. Elucidation of the specific 
features of an immune response in various model organisms, and studying the 
relation of these features with the behavioral phenotype, can improve the 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of many psychopathologies. In this 
work, we focused on BTBR mice, which have a pronounced autism-like behavioral 
phenotype, elevated levels of oxidative-stress markers, an abnormal immune 
response, several structural aberrations in the brain, and other unique traits. 
Although some studies have already shown an abnormal immune response in BTBR 
mice, the existing literature data are still fragmentary. Here, we used 
inflammation induced by low-dose lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic:polycytidylic 
acid, or their combinations, in mice of strains BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) and 
C57BL6/J. Peripheral inflammation was assessed by means of a complete blood 
count, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, and expression levels of cytokines in the 
spleen. Neuroinflammation was evaluated in the hypothalamus and prefrontal 
cortex by analysis of mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis 
factor, Tnf), (interleukin-1 beta, Il-1β), and (interleukin-6, Il-6) and of 
markers of microglia activation (allograft inflammatory factor 1, Aif1) and 
astroglia activation (glial fibrillary acidic protein, Gfap). We found that in 
both strains of mice, the most severe inflammatory response was caused by the 
administration of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, whereas the combined 
administration of the two toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists did not enhance this 
response. Nonetheless, BTBR mice showed a more pronounced response to low-dose 
lipopolysaccharide, an altered lymphocytosis ratio due to an increase in the 
number of CD4+ lymphocytes, and high expression of markers of activated 
microglia (Aif1) and astroglia (Gfap) in various brain regions as compared to 
C57BL6/J mice. Thus, in addition to research into mechanisms of autism-like 
behavior, BTBR mice can be used as a model of TLR3/TLR4-induced 
neuroinflammation and a unique model for finding and evaluating the 
effectiveness of various TLR antagonists aimed at reducing neuroinflammation."
1344,"The nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT) are generally accepted as an immune 
induction site, but the activation of naïve T-cells in that compartment has not 
been well-characterized. I wanted to determine if early events in naïve CD4+ T 
cell activation and the extent of antigen specific cell division are similar in 
NALT to that observed in other secondary lymphoid compartments. I performed 
antigen tracking experiments and analyzed the activation of naïve 
antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT). I 
directly observed transepithelial transport of fluorescently labeled antigen 
from the lumen of the airway to the interior of the NALT two hours following 
immunization. One day following intranasal (i.n.) immunization with antigen and 
adjuvant, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the NALT associated as clusters, 
while antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in control mice immunized with adjuvant only 
remained dispersed. The antigen-specific CD4+ populations in the NALT and 
cranial deep cervical lymph nodes of immunized mice expanded significantly by 
day three following immunization. These findings are consistent with initial 
activation of naïve CD4+ T cells in the NALT and offer insight into adjuvant 
mechanism of flagellin in the upper respiratory compartment."
1345,"Some physicians use dapsone as part of the standard treatment of severe COVID-19 
patients entering the ICU, though some do not. To obtain an indication of 
whether dapsone is helping or not, we undertook a retrospective chart review of 
29 consecutive ICU COVID-19 patients receiving dapsone and 30 not receiving 
dapsone. As we previously reported, of those given dapsone, 9/29 (30%) died, 
while of those not given dapsone, 18/30 (60%) died. We looked back on that data 
set to determine if there might be basic laboratory findings in these patients 
that might give an indication of a mechanism by which dapsone was acting. We 
found that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio decreased in 48% of those given 
dapsone and in 30% of those not given dapsone. We concluded that dapsone might 
be lowering that ratio. We then reviewed collected data on neutrophil related 
inflammation pathways on which dapsone might act as presented here. As this was 
not a controlled study, many variables prevent drawing any conclusions from this 
work; a formal, randomized controlled study of dapsone in severe COVID-19 is 
warranted."
1346,"ONC201, the anticancer drug, targets and activates mitochondrial ATP-dependent 
caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP), a serine protease located in the mitochondrial 
matrix. Given the promise of ONC201 in cancer treatment, we evaluated its 
effects on the breast ductal carcinoma cell line (BT474). We showed that the 
transient single-dose treatment of BT474 cells by 10 µM ONC201 for a period of 
less than 48 h induced a reversible growth arrest and a transient activation of 
an integrated stress response indicated by an increased expression of CHOP, 
ATF4, and GDF-15, and a reduced number of mtDNA nucleoids. A prolonged exposure 
to the drug (&gt;48 h), however, initiated an irreversible loss of mtDNA, 
persistent activation of integrated stress response proteins, as well as cell 
cycle arrest, inhibition of proliferation, and suppression of the intrinsic 
apoptosis pathway. Since Natural Killer (NK) cells are quickly gaining momentum 
in cellular anti-cancer therapies, we evaluated the effect of ONC201 on the 
activity of the peripheral blood derived NK cells. We showed that following the 
ONC 201 exposure BT474 cells demonstrated enhanced sensitivity toward human NK 
cells that mediated killing. Together our data revealed that the effects of a 
single dose of ONC201 are dependent on the duration of exposure, specifically, 
while short-term exposure led to reversible changes; long-term exposure resulted 
in irreversible transformation of cells associated with the senescent phenotype. 
Our data further demonstrated that when used in combination with NK cells, 
ONC201 created a synergistic anti-cancer effect, thus suggesting its possible 
benefit in NK-cell based cellular immunotherapies for cancer treatment."
1347,"Inflammation is a protective reaction of the innate immune system as a response 
to imbalances caused by a specific stimulus, a disease or a pathogen. A 
prolonged inflammatory condition may lead to the development of metabolic 
syndrome, which affects more than one-fourth of the world's population. This 
condition leads to the development of multi-organ disorders based on disrupted 
blood lipid and sugar levels, hypertension and oxidative stress. The review aims 
to present Zingiber officinale Rosc. as a plant that exhibits a variety of 
healing properties and restores the organism's equilibrium. Ginger (GI) rhizomes 
have been commonly used in traditional medicine to treat arthritis, stomach 
ache, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, rheumatism, nervous system syndromes, 
asthma, diabetes and nausea caused by pregnancy or chemotherapy. This review 
gathers together data from in vivo experiments related to the application of 
ginger for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, obesity, diabetes and other 
related disorders as a consequence of metabolic syndrome, including the 
confirmed molecular mechanisms of action."
1348,"Neuropathic pain is a condition affecting the quality of life of a substantial 
part of the population, but biomarkers and treatment options are still limited. 
While this type of pain is caused by nerve damage, in which lipids play key 
roles, lipidome alterations related to nerve injury remain poorly studied. Here, 
we assessed blood lipidome alterations in a common animal model, the rat sciatic 
nerve crush injury. We analyzed alterations in blood lipid abundances between 
seven rats with nerve injury (NI) and eight control (CL) rats in a time-course 
experiment. For these rats, abundances of 377 blood lipid species were assessed 
at three distinct time points: immediately after, two weeks, and five weeks post 
injury. Although we did not detect significant differences between NI and CL at 
the first two time points, 106 lipids were significantly altered in NI five 
weeks post injury. At this time point, we found increased levels of 
triglycerides (TGs) and lipids containing esterified palmitic acid (16:0) in the 
blood plasma of NI animals. Lipids containing arachidonic acid (20:4), by 
contrast, were significantly decreased after injury, aligning with the crucial 
role of arachidonic acid reported for NI. Taken together, these results indicate 
delayed systematic alterations in fatty acid metabolism after nerve injury, 
potentially reflecting nerve tissue restoration dynamics."
1349,"Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy has proven to be 
effective in lung cancer treatment, it may not be sufficient to fully activate 
the antitumor immune response. Here, we investigated whether entinostat, a 
histone deacetylase inhibitor, could improve the efficacy of radiotherapy and 
anti-PD-1 in a murine syngeneic LL/2 tumor model. A total of 12 Gy of X-rays 
administered in two fractions significantly delayed tumor growth in mice, which 
was further enhanced by oral entinostat administration. Flow cytometry-aided 
immune cell profiling revealed that entinostat increased radiation-induced 
infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD8+ T cells with decreased 
regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Transcriptomics-based immune phenotype prediction 
showed that entinostat potentiated radiation-activated pathways, such as 
JAK/STAT3/interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. Entinostat 
augmented the antitumor efficacy of radiation and anti-PD-1, which may be 
related to an increase in IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T-cells with a decrease in Treg 
cells. Comparative transcriptomic profiling predicted that entinostat increased 
the number of dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells in tumors treated with 
radiation and anti-PD-1 by inducing MHC-II genes. In conclusion, our findings 
provided insights into how entinostat improves the efficacy of ionizing 
radiation plus anti-PD-1 therapy and offered clues for developing new strategies 
for clinical trials."
1350,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is an important member of 
extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). It shares similar 
pathogenic strategies with neonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC) and may threaten 
human health due to its potential zoonosis. RyhB is a small non-coding RNA that 
regulates iron homeostasis in E. coli. However, it is unclear whether RyhB 
regulates meningitis occurrence. To investigate the function of RyhB in the 
development of meningitis, we constructed the deletion mutant APEC XM∆ryhB and 
the complemented mutant APEC XM∆ryhB/pryhB, established a mouse meningitis model 
and evaluated the role of RyhB in virulence of APEC. The results showed that the 
deletion of ryhB decreased biofilm formation, adhesion to the brain 
microvascular endothelial cell line bEnd.3 and serum resistance. RNA-seq data 
showed that the expression of multiple virulence-related genes changed in the 
ryhB deletion mutant in the presence of duck serum. Deletion of ryhB reduced the 
clinical symptoms of mice, such as opisthotonus, diarrhea and neurological 
signs, when challenged with APEC. Compared with the mice infected with the 
wild-type APEC, fewer histopathological lesions were observed in the brain of 
mice infected with the ryhB deletion mutant APEC XM∆ryhB. The bacterial loads in 
the tissues and the relative expression of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in 
the brain significantly decreased when challenged with the APEC XM∆ryhB. The 
expressions of tight junction proteins (claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1) were not 
reduced in the brain of mice infected with APEC XM∆ryhB; that is, the 
blood-brain barrier permeability of mice was not significantly damaged. In 
conclusion, RyhB contributes to the pathogenicity of APEC XM in the 
meningitis-causing process by promoting biofilm formation, adhesion to 
endothelial cells, serum resistance and virulence-related genes expression."
1351,"[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography 
([18F]FDG-PET/CT) is used to diagnose large vessel vasculitis in giant cell 
arteritis (GCA). We aimed to define a semi-quantitative threshold for 
identifying GCA aortitis from aortic atheroma or the control. Contrast enhanced 
computed tomography (CECT) was used as the reference imaging for aortic 
evaluation and to define aortitis, aortic atheroma and control aortas. 
[18F]FDG-PET/CT was performed on 35 GCA patients and in two different control 
groups (aortic atheroma (n = 70) and normal control (n = 35)). Aortic 
semi-quantitative features were compared between the three groups. GCA patients 
without aortitis on CECT were excluded. Of the GCA patients, 19 (54.3%) were not 
on glucocorticoids (GC) prior to [18F]FDG-PET/CT. The SUVmax, TBRblood and 
TBRliver aortic values were significantly higher in the GCA aortitis group than 
in the aortic atheroma and control groups (p &lt; 0.001). Receiver operating 
characteristic curve analyses brought to light quantitative cut-off values 
allowing GCA aortitis diagnosis with optimal sensitivity and specificity versus 
control or aortic atheroma patients for each PET-based feature analyzed. 
Considering the overall aorta, a SUVmax threshold of 3.25 and a TBRblood 
threshold of 1.75 had a specificity of 83% and 75%, respectively, a sensitivity 
of 81% and 81%, respectively, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.86 
and 0.83, respectively, for aortitis detection compared to control groups in GCA 
cases with GC. A SUVmax threshold of 3.45 and a TBRblood threshold of 1.97 had a 
specificity of 90% and 93%, respectively, a sensitivity of 89% and 89%, 
respectively, with an AUC of 0.89 and 0.96, respectively, for aortitis detection 
compared to the control in GC-free GCA cases. Discriminative thresholds of 
SUVmax and TBRblood for the diagnosis of GCA aortitis were established using 
CECT as the reference imaging."
1352,"In this study, we investigated the effects of eleven synthetic guanidines 
containing the 1,3-diphenylpropenone core on the viabilities of six human cancer 
cells. The most cytotoxic compound against human cancer cells of this series 
contains a N-tosyl group and a N-methylpiperazine moiety 6f. It was cytotoxic 
against leukemia cells (U-937, HL-60, MOLT-3, and NALM-6) with significant 
effects against Bcl-2-overexpressing U-937/Bcl-2 cells as well as the human 
melanoma SK-MEL-1 cell line. It exhibited low cytotoxicity against quiescent or 
proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The IC50 value for the 
leukemia U-937 cells was 1.6 ± 0.6 µM, a similar value to that in the 
antineoplastic agent etoposide. The guanidine containing a N-phenyl substituent 
6i was also as cytotoxic as the guanidine containing the N-tosyl substituent and 
the N-methylpiperazine group 6f against human U-937 leukemia cells and both 
synthetic guanidines were potent apoptotic inducers. Cell death was mediated by 
the activation of the initiator caspase-9 and the executioner caspase-3, and 
associated with the release of cytochrome c. These synthetic guanidines are 
potent cytotoxic compounds against several human leukemia cells and even the 
human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-1 and might be useful in the development of new 
strategies in the fight against cancer."
1353,"This study investigated whether sphingosine is effective as prophylaxis against 
Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. In vitro experiments showed that sphingosine 
is very efficacious against A. fumigatus and Nakeomyces glabrataa (formerly 
named C. glabrata). A mouse model of invasive aspergillosis showed that 
sphingosine exerts a prophylactic effect and that sphingosine-treated animals 
exhibit a strong survival advantage after infection. Furthermore, mechanistic 
studies showed that treatment with sphingosine leads to the early depolarization 
of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and the generation of 
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and to a release of cytochrome C within 
minutes, thereby presumably initiating apoptosis. Because of its very good 
tolerability and ease of application, inhaled sphingosine should be further 
developed as a possible prophylactic agent against pulmonary aspergillosis among 
severely immunocompromised patients."
1354,"At the inner blood-retinal barrier (BRB), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) contributes to 
maintaining the homeostasis of substance concentration in the retina by 
transporting drugs and exogenous toxins from the retina to the circulating 
blood. Under inflammatory conditions, P-gp activities have been reported to be 
altered in various tissues. The purpose of this study was to clarify the 
alterations in P-gp activity at the inner BRB due to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 
an inflammatory agent, and the molecular mechanisms of the alterations induced 
by LPS. Ex vivo P-gp activity was evaluated as luminal accumulation of 
7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole-cyclosporin A (NBD-CSA), a fluorescent P-gp 
substrate, in freshly prepared rat retinal capillaries. The luminal NBD-CSA 
accumulation was significantly decreased in the presence of LPS, indicating that 
P-gp activity at the inner BRB is reduced by LPS. This LPS-induced attenuation 
of the luminal NBD-CSA accumulation was abolished by inhibiting toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4), a receptor for LPS. Furthermore, an inhibitor/antagonist of 
tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, endothelin B receptor, nitric oxide synthase, 
or protein kinase C (PKC) significantly restored the LPS-induced decrease in the 
luminal NBD-CSA accumulation. Consequently, it is suggested that the TLR4/PKC 
pathway is involved in the reduction in P-gp function in the inner BRB by LPS."
1355,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and ranks first in 
terms of both prevalence and cancer-related mortality in women. In this study, 
we aimed to evaluate the anticancer effect of mebendazole (MBZ) and radiotherapy 
(RT) concomitant use in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and elucidate 
the underlying mechanisms of action. Breast cancer mouse models and several 
types of breast cancer cells, including TNBC-derived RT-resistant (RT-R) 
MDA-MB-231 cells, were treated with MBZ and/or RT. In mice, changes in body 
weight, renal and liver toxicity, tumor volume, and number of lung metastases 
were determined. In cells, cell viability, colony formation, scratch wound 
healing, Matrigel invasion, and protein expression using western blotting were 
determined. Our findings showed that MBZ and RT combined treatment increased the 
anticancer effect of RT without additional toxicity. In addition, we noted that 
cyclin B1, PH2AX, and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity increased 
following MBZ + RT treatment compared to unaided RT. Our results suggest that 
MBZ + RT have an enhanced anticancer effect in TNBC which acquires radiation 
resistance through blocking cell cycle progression, initiating DNA double-strand 
breaks, and promoting NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity."
1356,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls brain homeostasis; it is formed by 
vascular endothelial cells that are physically connected by tight junctions 
(TJs). The BBB expresses efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which limit the passage of substrate 
molecules from blood circulation to the brain. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with 
microbubbles can create a local and reversible detachment of the TJs. However, 
very little is known about the effect of FUS on the expression of efflux 
transporters. We investigated the in vivo effects of moderate acoustic pressures 
on both P-gp and BCRP expression for up to two weeks after sonication. Magnetic 
resonance-guided FUS was applied in the striatum of 12 rats. P-gp and BCRP 
expression were determined by immunohistochemistry at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days 
postFUS. Our results indicate that FUS-induced BBB opening is capable of (i) 
decreasing P-gp expression up to 3 days after sonication in both the treated and 
in the contralateral brain regions and is capable of (ii) overexpressing BCRP up 
to 7 days after FUS in the sonicated regions only. Our findings may help improve 
FUS-aided drug delivery strategies by considering both the mechanical effect on 
the TJs and the regulation of P-gp and BCRP."
1357,"Hepcidin (DTHFPICIFCCGCCHRSKCGMCCKT), an iron-regulatory hormone, is a 
25-amino-acid peptide with four intramolecular disulfide bonds circulating in 
blood. Its hormonal activity is indirect and consists of marking ferroportin-1 
(an iron exporter) for degradation. Hepcidin biosynthesis involves the 
N-terminally extended precursors prepro-hepcidin and pro-hepcidin, processed by 
peptidases to the final 25-peptide form. A sequence-specific formation of 
disulfide bonds and export of the oxidized peptide to the bloodstream follows. 
In this study we considered the fact that prior to export, reduced hepcidin may 
function as an octathiol ligand bearing some resemblance to the N-terminal part 
of the α-domain of metallothioneins. Consequently, we studied its ability to 
bind Zn(II) and Cd(II) ions using the original peptide and a model for 
prohepcidin extended N-terminally with a stretch of five arginine residues 
(5R-hepcidin). We found that both form equivalent mononuclear complexes with two 
Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions saturating all eight Cys residues. The average affinity at 
pH 7.4, determined from pH-metric spectroscopic titrations, is 1010.1 M-1 for 
Zn(II) ions; Cd(II) ions bind with affinities of 1015.2 M-1 and 1014.1 M-1. 
Using mass spectrometry and 5R-hepcidin we demonstrated that hepcidin can 
compete for Cd(II) ions with metallothionein-2, a cellular cadmium target. This 
study enabled us to conclude that hepcidin binds Zn(II) and Cd(II) sufficiently 
strongly to participate in zinc physiology and cadmium toxicity under 
intracellular conditions."
1358,"Experimental findings for SARS-CoV-2 related to the glycan biochemistry of 
coronaviruses indicate that attachments from spike protein to glycoconjugates on 
the surfaces of red blood cells (RBCs), other blood cells and endothelial cells 
are key to the infectivity and morbidity of COVID-19. To provide further insight 
into these glycan attachments and their potential clinical relevance, the 
classic hemagglutination (HA) assay was applied using spike protein from the 
Wuhan, Alpha, Delta and Omicron B.1.1.529 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 mixed with 
human RBCs. The electrostatic potential of the central region of spike protein 
from these four lineages was studied through molecular modeling simulations. 
Inhibition of spike protein-induced HA was tested using the macrocyclic lactone 
ivermectin (IVM), which is indicated to bind strongly to SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein glycan sites. The results of these experiments were, first, that spike 
protein from these four lineages of SARS-CoV-2 induced HA. Omicron induced HA at 
a significantly lower threshold concentration of spike protein than the three 
prior lineages and was much more electropositive on its central spike protein 
region. IVM blocked HA when added to RBCs prior to spike protein and reversed HA 
when added afterward. These results validate and extend prior findings on the 
role of glycan bindings of viral spike protein in COVID-19. They furthermore 
suggest therapeutic options using competitive glycan-binding agents such as IVM 
and may help elucidate rare serious adverse effects (AEs) associated with 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which use spike protein as the generated antigen."
1359,"Implantation of scaffolds causes a local inflammatory response whereby the early 
recruitment of neutrophils is of great importance not only for fighting the 
infection, but also for facilitating effective regeneration. We used 
luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, flow cytometry, ELISA, and confocal 
microscopy to assess the responses of neutrophils after the exposure to the 
scaffold-decellularized bovine pericardium (collagen type I) crosslinked with 
genipin (DBPG). We demonstrated that DBPG activated neutrophils in whole blood 
causing respiratory burst, myeloperoxidase (MPO) secretion, and formation of 
neutrophil extracellular trap-like structures (NETs). In addition, we studied 
platelets, another important player of the immediate immune host response. We 
found that platelets triggered redox-activation of isolated neutrophils by the 
pericardium scaffold, and likely participate in the NETs formation. Free 
radicals generated by neutrophils and hypochlorous acid produced by MPO are 
potent oxidizing agents which can oxidatively degrade biological structures. 
Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of redox activation of neutrophils 
by pericardium scaffolds is important for the development of new approaches to 
increase the efficiency of tissue regeneration."
1360,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a controversially discussed 
inflammatory marker in major depressive disorder (MDD). While some studies show 
an association of high MIF protein levels with depression, animal models have 
yielded conflicting results. Thus, it remains elusive as to whether MIF plays an 
anti- or pro-depressive role. Therefore, we aimed to examine the potential of 
MIF at the genetic, expression and protein levels as a risk factor and biomarker 
to diagnose, monitor, or predict the course of MDD. Patients with a current 
major depressive episode (n = 66 with, and n = 63 without, prior medication) and 
remitted patients (n = 39) were compared with healthy controls (n = 61). 
Currently depressed patients provided a second blood sample after three weeks of 
therapy. Depression severity was assessed by self-evaluation and clinician 
rating scales. We genotyped for three MIF polymorphisms and analyzed peripheral 
MIF expression and serum levels. The absence of minor allele homozygous 
individuals in the large group of 96 female patients compared with 10-16% in 
female controls suggests a protective effect for MDD, which was not observed in 
the male group. There were no significant group differences of protein and 
expression levels, however, both showed predictive potential for the course of 
depression severity in some subgroups. While MIF protein levels, but not MIF 
expression, decreased during treatment, they were not associated with changes in 
depression severity. This project is the first to investigate three biological 
levels of MIF in depression. The data hint toward a genetic effect in women, but 
do not provide robust evidence for the utility of MIF as a biomarker for the 
diagnosis or monitoring of MDD. The observed predictive potential requires 
further analysis, emphasizing future attention to confounding factors such as 
sex and premedication."
1361,"Ischaemia, followed by reperfusion, causes the generation of reactive oxygen 
species, overproduction of peroxynitrite, activation of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs), and subsequently the degradation of heart contractile 
proteins in the cardiomyocytes. Klotho is a membrane-bound or soluble protein 
that regulates mineral metabolism and has antioxidative activity. This study 
aimed to examine the influence of Klotho protein on the MMP-mediated degradation 
of contractile proteins during ischaemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) to the 
cardiomyocytes. Human cardiac myocytes (HCM) underwent in vitro chemical IRI 
(with sodium cyanide and deoxyglucose), with or without the administration of 
recombinant Klotho protein. The expression of MMP genes, the expression and 
activity of MMP proteins, as well as the level of contractile proteins such as 
myosin light chain 1 (MLC1) and troponin I (TnI) in HCM were measured. 
Administration of Klotho protein resulted in a decreased activity of MMP-2 and 
reduced the release of MLC1 and TnI that followed in cells subjected to IRI. 
Thus, Klotho protein contributes to the inhibition of MMP-dependent degradation 
of contractile proteins and prevents injury to the cardiomyocytes during IRI."
1362,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal gammopathy characterized by biological 
heterogeneity and unregulated proliferation of plasma cells (PCs) in bone marrow 
(BM). MM is a multistep process based on genomic instability, epigenetic 
dysregulation and a tight cross-talk with the BM microenvironment that plays a 
pivotal role supporting the proliferation, survival, drug-resistance and homing 
of PCs. The BM microenvironment consists of a hematopoietic and a 
non-hematopoietic compartment, which cooperate to create a tumor environment. 
Among the non-hematopoietic component, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and 
osteoblasts (OBs) appear transcriptionally and functionally different in MM 
patients compared to healthy donors (HDs) and to patients with pre-malignant 
monoclonal gammopathies. Alterations of both MSCs and OBs underly the osteolytic 
lesions that characterize myeloma-associated bone disease. In this review, we 
will discuss the different characteristics of MSCs and OBs in MM patients, 
analyzing the transcriptome, the deregulated molecular pathways and the role 
performed by miRNAs and exosome in the pathophysiology of MM."
1363,"In Latin America, Mexico is the country with the second highest annual estimated 
number of Chagas disease cases, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, due to vector-borne 
transmission. The state of Oaxaca is the location of the first documented human 
cases of Chagas disease in Mexico and contained the highest T. cruzi 
seropositive rate (3.5%) from blood donors. Here, entomological surveys, from 
2017 to 2019, were conducted to collect triatomines in 124 villages of 60 
municipalities. Four principal domestic Triatoma spp. (Hemiptera: Triatominae), 
Triatoma phyllosoma, T. barberi, T. mazzotti, and T. dimidiata, of Oaxaca, 
Mexico were identified by morphology and molecular analysis of the barcode 
region of the cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1 or COI or CO1) gene. A total of 41 out 
of 83 T. phyllosoma specimens examined by microscopy were positive for T. cruzi 
(49%), 49 out of 171 for T. barberi (28%), 31 out of 177 for T. mazzotti (17%), 
and none out of 10 for T. dimidiata (0%). Overall, the infestation index was 
3.1% of households containing at least one triatomine; the crowding index was a 
mean of two Triatoma spp./household; and the colonization index was 0.38 for 
households based on presence of nymphs. Geographical distribution of triatomines 
in Oaxaca at the municipality level and endophilic behavior is also reported. 
Precise identification, endophilic habits, and infection rates of these 
triatomines are paramount for vector control programs of the Ministry of Health 
of Oaxaca and beyond."
1364,"The benefits of swimming as a treatment for overweight children are undefined. 
We investigated the effects of recreational swimming on cardiometabolic risk in 
children/adolescents with normal and excess weight. Participants (n = 49, 26 
girls, 10.3 ± 1.8 y) were grouped as 'eutrophic swimming' (EU-Swim, n = 14); 
'excess weight swimming' (EW-Swim, n = 20) with an 'obese swimming' subgroup 
(OB-Swim, n = 10); and 'excess weight sedentary' (EW-Sed, n = 15) with an 'obese 
sedentary' subgroup (OB-Sed, n = 11). Swimming (50 min, twice/week, 
moderate-vigorous intensity) was an extra activity during the school year (6 + 3 
months with a 3-month school break). Nutritional status, blood pressure (BP), 
physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, biochemical variables, autonomic 
modulation, endothelial function, abdominal fat, and carotid thickness were 
assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Greater improvements (p &lt; 0.05) 
occurred in EW-Swim vs. EW-Sed in body mass index (z-BMI, -16%, d+ 0.52), 
waist-to-height ratio (W/H, -8%, d+ 0.59-0.79), physical activity (37-53%, d+ 
1.8-2.2), cardiorespiratory fitness (30-40%, d+ 0.94-1.41), systolic BP (SBP, 
-6-8%, d+ 0.88-1.17), diastolic BP (DBP, -9-10%, d+ 0.70-0.85), leptin (-14-18%,

(SAT, -6%, d+ 0.18), and intra-abdominal fat (VAT, -16%, d+ 0.63). OB-Swim 
showed improvements vs. OB-Sed in TNFα (-17%, d+ 1.15) and adiponectin (22%, d+ 
0.40). Swimming improved fitness and cardiometabolic risk in 
children/adolescents with overweight/obesity. (TCTR20220216001)."
1365,"The aim of the study was to determine whether Whole Body Vibration Training 
(WBVT) affects intrinsic risk factors for falls in women aged 60+ at fall risk.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Blinding was applied to the 
persons in charge of evaluating the intervention's clinical results and 
statistical analysis.
METHODS: Forty-two women over 60 years old were randomly assigned to an 
experimental group (EG-12-week WBVT; n = 22) and a control group (CG-no 
additional physical activities; n = 20). Fear of falling was measured by the 
FES-I questionnaire, gait and dynamic balance using the Time-Up and Go test 
(TUG), aerobic endurance with the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and the functional 
strength of the lower body muscles with the 30-s Chair Stand Test (30SCST) at 
baseline and post-intervention. Additionally assayed were participants' blood 
concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6).
RESULTS: The 12-week WBVT improves gait and balance (TUG, p = 0.009), exercise 
tolerance (6MWT, p = 0.001), and functional strength (30SCST; p = 0.027) but 
does not reduce the intensity of fear of falling (FES-I, p = 0.655) and the IL-6 
serum concentration (p = 0.377).
CONCLUSIONS: WBVT affects selected fall risk factors in women aged 60+ at fall 
risk."
1366,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a progressive muscle 
relaxation program on psychological (stress levels, anxiety, and mood states) 
and physiological (blood pressure and heart rate) variables in basketball 
athletes. Fifty-nine basketball players, aged 14 to 19 years, and members of 
Bauru Basket team, were recruited for this study and grouped into control group 
(CG, n = 30) and intervention group (IG, n = 29). The participants were 
evaluated, before and after the intervention, by the following means: 
Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2), to measure the pre-competitive 
anxiety state, i.e., how anxious each athlete felt just before the competition; 
Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), an instrument for early detection of overtraining 
syndrome; Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (RESTQ-Sport), to identify 
the extent to which each athlete was physically or mentally stressed and the 
athlete's current capability for recovery; Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), 
specifically developed for athletes. The IG athletes participated in 12 
progressive muscle relaxation sessions, a practice for tensing or tightening a 
specific muscle until an ideal state of relaxation is reached. Each participant 
had blood pressure and heart rate measured before and after every session. The 
CG athletes were evaluated similarly to those in the IG but without relaxation. 
The results showed statistically significant differences in cognitive anxiety (p 
= 0.039) and specific stress (p = 0.016) between CG and IG before the 
intervention; in addition, a significant heart rate decrease (p &lt; 0.01) 
between IG and CG was noted."
1367,"The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of local heating on skeletal 
muscle transcriptional response related to mitochondrial biogenesis and 
mitophagy. Twelve healthy subjects (height, 176.0 ± 11.9 cm; weight, 83.6 ± 18.3 
kg; and body composition, 19.0 ± 7.7% body fat) rested in a semi-reclined 
position for 4 h with a heated thermal wrap (HOT) around one thigh and a wrap 
without temperature regulation (CON) around the other (randomized). Skin 
temperature, blood flow, intramuscular temperature, and a skeletal muscle biopsy 
from the vastus lateralis were obtained after the 4 h intervention. Skin 
temperature via infrared thermometer and thermal camera was higher after HOT 
(37.3 ± 0.7 and 36.7 ± 1.0 °C, respectively) than CON (34.8 ± 0.7, 35.2 ± 0.8 
°C, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Intramuscular temperature was higher in HOT 
(36.3 ± 0.4 °C) than CON (35.2 ± 0.8 °C, p &lt; 0.001). Femoral artery blood 
flow was higher in HOT (304.5 ± 12.5 mL‧min-1) than CON (272.3 ± 14.3 mL‧min-1, 
p = 0.003). Mean femoral shear rate was higher in HOT (455.8 ± 25.1 s-1) than 
CON (405.2 ± 15.8 s-1, p = 0.019). However, there were no differences in any of 
the investigated genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, NRF1, GAPBA, 
ERRα, TFAM, VEGF) or mitophagy (PINK-1, PARK-2, BNIP-3, BNIP-3L) in response to 
heat (p &gt; 0.05). These data indicate that heat application alone does not 
impact the transcriptional response related to mitochondrial homeostasis, 
suggesting that other factors, in combination with skeletal muscle temperature, 
are involved with previous observations of altered exercise induced gene 
expression with heat."
1368,"BACKGROUND: The referral process is an important research focus because of the 
potential consequences of delays, especially for patients with serious medical 
conditions that need immediate care, such as those with metastatic cancer. Thus, 
a systematic literature review of recent and influential manuscripts is critical 
to understanding the current methods and future directions in order to improve 
the referral process.
METHODS: A hybrid bibliometric-structured review was conducted using both 
quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Searches were conducted of three 
databases, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed, in addition to the references 
from the eligible papers. The papers were considered to be eligible if they were 
relevant English articles or reviews that were published from January 2010 to 
June 2021. The searches were conducted using three groups of keywords, and 
bibliometric analysis was performed, followed by content analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 163 papers that were published in impactful journals between 
January 2010 and June 2021 were selected. These papers were then reviewed, 
analyzed, and categorized as follows: descriptive analysis (n = 77), cause and 
effect (n = 12), interventions (n = 50), and quality management (n = 24). Six 
future research directions were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimal attention was given to the study of the primary referral of 
blood cancer cases versus those with solid cancer types, which is a gap that 
future studies should address. More research is needed in order to optimize the 
referral process, specifically for suspected hematological cancer patients."
1369,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is one of the most vital risk factors for 
cardiovascular diseases, so we wanted to explore the impact of the interaction 
between occupational stress and smoking, alcohol drinking and BMI on 
hypertension in Chinese petrochemical workers.
METHODS: A total of 1488 employees participated. Questionnaires included the 
value of blood pressure, occupational stress (assessed by the effort-reward 
imbalance scale), demographic factors and work conditions. Multivariable 
logistic regression was used to explore related factors, and the interactions 
between occupational stress and smoking, alcohol drinking and BMI on 
hypertension were analyzed using an additive model.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension was 34.3%. Age ≥ 56 (OR = 3.19, 95%CI: 
1.841-5.526), male (OR = 1.436, 95%CI: 1.056-1.954), BMI ≥ 25 (OR = 1.86, 95%CI: 
1.468-2.346), smoking (OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.191-1.951) and alcohol drinking (OR = 
1.53, 95%CI: 1.180-1.972), ERI &gt; 1 (OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.133-1.960) are risk 
factors for hypertension, and a higher education level (OR = 0.57, 95%CI: 
0.438-0.754) is a protective factor against hypertension. Positive interactions 
existed between occupational stress and smoking (RERI = 2.134, AP = 0.328, S = 
1.635), alcohol drinking (RERI = 2.332, AP = 0.361, S = 1.746) and BMI (RERI = 
1.841, AP = 0.340, S = 1.717) on hypertension in petrochemical workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Age, gender, educational level, BMI, smoking, alcohol drinking and 
occupational stress are closely related to the risk of hypertension. There are 
also positive interactions between occupational stress and alcohol drinking, 
smoking and BMI, which have a certain impact on hypertension."
1370,"Adults with cardiovascular disease and heart failure are at higher risk of 
cognitive decline. Cerebral hypoperfusion appears to be a significant 
contributor, which can result from vascular dysfunction and impairment of 
cerebral blood flow regulation. In contrast, higher cardiorespiratory fitness 
shows protection against brain atrophy, reductions in cerebral blood flow, and 
cognitive decline. Given that high intensity interval training (HIIT) has been 
shown to be a potent stimulus for improving cardiorespiratory fitness and 
peripheral vascular function, its utility for improving cognitive aging is an 
important area of research. This article will review the physiology related to 
cerebral blood flow regulation and cognitive decline in adults with 
cardiovascular disease and heart failure, and how HIIT may provide a more 
optimal stimulus for improving cognitive aging in this population."
1371,"BACKGROUND: Insufficient HIV detection and late presentation to antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) pose significant public health challenges. In China, universal 
access to HIV testing is available now. Under this background, we aim to analyze 
the trends of HIV detection and the prevalence of delayed HIV diagnosis (DHD) in 
order to provide evidence for HIV prevention and treatment in China.
METHODS: Data of HIV tests in Hangzhou city between 2007 and 2018 were collected 
from the Chinese National HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Response Information Management 
System (CRIMS). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics 
of HIV testing and detection and the prevalence of DHD among newly diagnosed HIV 
cases. Non-parametric tests were employed to examine the prevalence of DHD among 
newly diagnosed HIV cases. Moreover, logistic regression models were employed to 
explore the influencing factors of DHD.
RESULTS: Testing rates doubled from 14.1% in 2007-2010 to 28.2% in 2016-2018. 
The total positive rate of HIV tests was 5.3 per 10,000. Preoperative testing 
was the predominant pathway for HIV tests, accounting for 41.9%, followed by 
testing for health screening, maternal examination and other patients, 
accounting for 18.4%, 13.2% and 11.8%, respectively. Meanwhile, the predominant 
pathway for HIV case detection was also preoperative testing, accounting for 
29.1%, followed by testing for other patients, testing at STD clinics and VCT, 
with the proportions of 18.8%, 15.8% and 13.6%, respectively. MSM (men who have 
sex with men) contact was the main transmission route, accounting for 55.3%, 
followed by heterosexual contact, accounting for 41.6%. Overall, DHD occurred in 
29.0% of the newly diagnosed cases, and this rate had not improved over the 
years. A higher prevalence of DHD was found in those diagnosed through a 
pre-test for receiving blood/products [OR (95%CI): 5.42(2.95-9.97)], detection 
of other patients [OR (95%CI): 2.08(1.64-2.63)], preoperative testing [OR 
(95%CI): 1.83(1.44-2.32)] and spouse or sexual partner testing in positive 
person [OR (95%CI): 1.93(1.34-2.78)] compared with those diagnosed at a VCT 
clinic. Heterosexuals [OR (95%CI): 1.20(1.06-1.36)] had a higher risk of DHD 
than MSM. Diagnosis at a CDC [OR (95%CI): 0.68(0.55-0.83)] and community health 
centers [OR (95%CI): 0.54(0.39-0.75)] had a lower risk of DHD than in hospitals. 
Older age, males, being single/divorced or widowed and floating population were 
also associated with DHD.
CONCLUSIONS: In China, DHD had not improved in the last 10 years, although HIV 
testing had been expanded. Therefore, it is important for continued efforts to 
promote early diagnosis of HIV to prevent transmission, morbidity and early 
mortality in HIV infection."
1372,"Dengue virus (DENV) was detected in Senegal in 1979 for the first time. Since 
2017, unprecedented frequent outbreaks of DENV were noticed yearly. In this 
context, epidemiological and molecular evolution data are paramount to decipher 
the virus diffusion route. In the current study, we focused on a dengue outbreak 
which occurred in Senegal in 2018 in the context of a large religious gathering 
with 263 confirmed DENV cases out of 832 collected samples, including 25 
life-threatening cases and 2 deaths. It was characterized by a co-circulation of 
dengue serotypes 1 and 3. Phylogenetic analysis based on the E gene revealed 
that the main detected serotype in Touba was DENV-3 and belonged to Genotype 
III. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis was performed and suggested one viral 
introduction around 2017.07 (95% HPD = 2016.61-2017.57) followed by cryptic 
circulation before the identification of the first case on 1 October 2018. 
DENV-3 strains are phylogenetically related, with strong phylogenetic links 
between strains retrieved from Burkina Faso and other West African countries. 
These phylogenetic data substantiate epidemiological data of the origin of 
DENV-3 and its spread between African countries and subsequent diffusion after 
religious mass events. The study also highlighted the usefulness of a mobile 
laboratory during the outbreak response, allowing rapid diagnosis and resulting 
in improved patient management."
1373,"Aging and regular exercise may have opposite effects on brain health, and 
although oxidative stress and sirtuins may be involved in these effects, studies 
on this topic are limited. Accordingly, the present study aimed to verify the 
effect of exercise training on oxidant-antioxidant balance, neurotrophic 
factors, blood-brain barrier permeability, and sirtuins in young-old and old-old 
women. The study participants were 12 women aged 65-74 years (Young-Old group) 
and 12 women aged 75-84 years (Old-Old group). All of the selected participants 
performed exercise training consisting of treadmill walking and resistance band 
exercise three times a week for 12 weeks. Blood samples were collected before 
and after exercise training to analyze serum oxidant-antioxidant markers 
(reactive oxygen species [ROS], superoxide dismutase [SOD]), neurotrophic factor 
(brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], vascular endothelial growth factor 
[VEGF]) levels, and blood-brain barrier permeability marker (S100 
calcium-binding protein β [S100β], matrix metalloproteinase-9 [MMP-9]) levels, 
and sirtuin (SIRT-1, SIRT-2, SIRT-3) levels. The Young-Old group showed 
significantly increased SOD, BDNF, VEGF, SIRT-1, and SIRT-3 levels after 
training in comparison with the levels before training (p &lt; 0.05), and a 
significantly higher BDNF level than the Old-Old group after training (p &lt; 
0.05). On the other hand, the Old-Old group showed significantly higher SIRT-1 
levels after training in comparison with the levels before training (p &lt; 
0.05). Thus, exercise training may be effective in increasing the levels of 
neurotropic factors and reducing blood-brain barrier permeability in the elderly 
women, and increased antioxidant capacity and elevated levels of sirtuins are 
believed to play a major role in these effects. The positive effect of exercise 
may be greater in participants of relatively young age."
1374,"Despite being a prerequisite for tailoring specific therapeutic interventions, 
knowledge of pattern and prevalence of clinically significant psychiatric 
symptomatology among patients with cardiac pacemakers (PMs), especially of 
symptoms of posttraumatic stress, is limited. We studied symptoms of depression, 
anxiety, and posttraumatic stress among PM patients (PM due to syncope or 
presyncope) compared to participants of (i) a cardiac, (ii) a chronic disease, 
and (iii) a healthy control group. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and 
posttraumatic stress were measured by validated self-report scales at least 6 
months after implantation of the PM (PM group; n = 38), percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI; PCI control group; n = 23), and first dialysis (Dialysis 
control group; n = 17). Blood donors constituted the Healthy control group (n = 
42). Both PM, PCI, and dialysis patients reported depressive symptoms above 
clinical cut-off more frequently than the healthy controls (16.2, 26.1, 41.2, 
and 0%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Self-report of symptoms of anxiety and 
posttraumatic stress did not differ significantly across study groups. However, 
a non-negligible proportion of PM patients reported on symptoms of posttraumatic 
stress of anticipated clinical relevance. Identification and treatment of 
depression deserves attention in clinical routine in all three patient 
populations. Further study of posttraumatic stress in PM patients seems 
advisable."
1375,"Invertebrates have long been an important tool for assessing water pollution due 
to their characteristics as intermediate consumers in aquatic ecosystem food 
chains. Most of the time, the effects of contaminants are measured by their 
effect on oxidative status or by mortality, although there already exists an 
easier tool-hemocytes. Hemocytes are circulating cells with a very important 
role in the immune system of invertebrates, which can be found within the 
hemolymph, analogous to the blood in vertebrates. The collection of hemolymph 
samples is easy, fast, minimally invasive, and poses no danger to the life of 
invertebrates. The purpose of this review was to highlight the advantages of 
using hemolymph for toxicity assays of various substances, including heavy 
metals, micro- and nano-plastics, pesticides, hydrocarbons, and oil spills. A 
literature search was conducted for this purpose using the most common and most 
often used databases, with a focus on the most recent and relevant studies. 
Bivalve mollusks, crustaceans, and gastropods were chosen for this 
investigation. This review found a growing number of studies choosing to use 
hemolymph as the standard methodology for toxicology assays, confirming their 
qualities as reliable tools."
1376,"(1) Background: As times change, the detection rate of hypertension is 
increasing in the young and middle-aged population due to prevalent sedentary 
behaviors. The purpose of this study was to conduct a scoping review to identify 
and summarize the research on sedentary behavior in this population by 
separating it into five stages: the relationship between sedentary behavior and 
health; measurement modalities; influencing factors; interventions; and 
translational research in young and middle-aged adults with hypertension. (2) 
Methods: Using a scoping review research approach, the PubMed, Web of Science 
Core Collection, and MEDLINE databases were used to search for the literature on 
this subject from the date of the database's creation to 14 June 2022, and the 
behavioral epidemiology framework was used to classify the retrieved articles. 
(3) Results: A total of eight articles were included. Among them, there were six 
articles on the relationship between behavior and health, which includes blood 
pressure, insulin resistance, and the cardiovascular system; one article on the 
study of measurement methods, which was used for clinical decision making 
through decision trees; one article on influencing factors, which was divided 
into intrinsic and extrinsic factors; and no articles on intervention program 
development or the translation of intervention programs to further practice in 
this population. (4) Conclusions: Sedentary behavioral studies of young and 
middle-aged adults with hypertension are scarce and are generally carried out in 
the early stages of the condition. In the future, in-depth studies can be 
conducted on the dose-response relationship between sedentary behavior and 
health in this population; the development of easier and targeted measurement 
tools; the exploration of more influencing factors; and the effectiveness and 
translation of intervention programs."
1377,"Saudi Arabia is a country with high prevalence of diabetes, uncontrolled 
diabetes, and diabetes-related complications. Poor glycemic control is 
multifactorial and could be explained in part by physician and patient 
reluctance toward insulin or insulin inertia. This study aimed to address 
physician barriers toward insulin therapy in primary care settings. It included 
288 physicians from 168 primary healthcare centers (PHC) in the Jazan region of 
Saudi Arabia. Participants responded to questionnaire investigating physicians' 
attitude and barriers to insulin initiation and intensification in PHCs. In 
physician opinion, the most common barriers among their patients were fear of 
injection, lack of patient education, fear of hypoglycemia, and difficult 
administration. Physicians were reluctant to initiate insulin for T2D patients 
mostly due to patient non-adherence to blood sugar measurement, non-adherence to 
appointment or treatment, elderly patients, or due to patient refusal. 
Physicians' fear of hypoglycemia, lack of staff for patient education, and lack 
of updated knowledge were the primary clinician-related barriers. Exaggerated 
fears of insulin side effects, patient non-adherence, limited staff for 
patient's education, patient refusal, and inadequate consultation time were the 
main barriers to insulin acceptance and prescription."
1378,"Frailty is a major challenge facing the aging world. The phenotype of the frail 
subject is still far from being satisfactorily defined. We report data on mood, 
cognition, and quality of life (QoL) in relation to anamnestic factors, health, 
and socio-economic status in the FRASNET geriatric population (1204 subjects in 
stable health conditions), which is an observational cohort study that includes 
fairly balanced groups of Italian frail (421, 35%), pre-frail (449, 37.3%) and 
robust (334, 27.7%) subjects. A conditional inference tree analysis revealed a 
substantial influence of psychological variables on frailty. The physical 
indicator of QoL (Short Form Survey-36-Physical Component Summary, SF-36-PCS) 
was the predominant variable in the full model (threshold at 39.9, p &lt; 
0.001): higher frailty was found in subjects with a caregiver and lower 
SF-36-PCS. Frailty was also associated with the mental indicator of QoL (Short 
Form Survey-36-Mental Component Summary, SF-36-MCS), depression (Geriatric 
Depression Scale, GDS-15), leisure activities, and level of education. In 
support of the prominent role of inflammation in aging and mental illness, the 
SF-36-PCS score was correlated with the blood concentration of C-X-C motif 
chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) (r Pearson -0.355, p = 0.015), a critical signal in 
cell senescence and inflammaging, while the rs7567647 variant in FN1 gene 
encoding a glycoprotein in the extracellular matrix was significantly associated 
with frailty in a multivariable model (p = 0.0006). The perception of 
health-related QoL and subclinical depression contribute to frailty. Their 
assessment could improve the identification of older patients at increased risk 
of adverse outcomes."
1379,"AIM: In order to investigate the effect of cycling wheelchair training as an 
exercise for aged 65+ disabled patients on cognitive function, quality of life, 
aerobic capacity and physiological parameters.
METHODS: Participants in nursing home performed cycling wheelchair training for 
30 min a day, 5 days a week, for a total of 4 weeks. The main outcome measure 
was the short form 12 survey (SF-12). Other outcome measures included the 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), aero bike work rate test, resting blood 
pressure, and heart rate.
RESULTS: In this study, 41 volunteers were recruited and no participants dropped 
out of the study voluntarily during training, and no serious adverse effect was 
identified. Physical and mental component summary total scores of SF-12 were 
significantly higher after training with statistical significance (p = 0.001). 8 
subscales also showed significant improvements after training (p = 0.025 ~ 
&lt;0.001). Total MMSE score has no difference before and after training. 
Attention/calculation (p = 0.018), short term memory (p = 0.041), and aerobic 
capacity (p &lt; 0.001) as measured by subscales of MMSE and aero bike test 
showed marked improvements, while resting systolic blood pressure (p = 0.931) 
and heart rate (p = 0.793) did not change.
CONCLUSIONS: Cycling wheelchair is practical for the disabled elderly to 
exercise, and a 4-week exercise program enhanced their quality of life and 
aerobic capacity."
1380,"Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) may have an additional effect on 
cardiovascular autonomic modulation, which could improve the metabolism and 
vascular function of the muscles.
AIM: To determine the effects of IMT on vascular and metabolic muscle changes 
and their relationship to changes in physical performance.
METHODS: Physically active men were randomly placed into an experimental (IMTG; 
n = 8) or IMT placebo group (IMTPG; n = 6). For IMT, resistance load was set at 
50% and 15% of the maximum dynamic inspiratory strength (S-Index), respectively. 
Only the IMTG's weekly load was increased by 5%. In addition, both groups 
carried out the same concurrent training. Besides the S-Index, a 1.5-mile 
running test, spirometry, and deoxyhemoglobin (HHbAUC during occlusion) and 
reperfusion tissue saturation index (TSIMB and TSIMP: time from minimum to 
baseline and to peak, respectively) in a vascular occlusion test were measured 
before and after the 4-week training program. In addition, resting heart rate 
and blood pressure were registered.
RESULTS: IMTG improved compared to IMTPG in the S-Index (Δ = 28.23 ± 26.6 
cmH2O), maximal inspiratory flow (MIF: Δ = 0.91 ± 0.6 L/s), maximum oxygen 
uptake (Δ = 4.48 ± 1.1 mL/kg/min), 1.5-mile run time (Δ = -0.81 ± 0.2 s), TSIMB 
(Δ = -3.38 ± 3.1 s) and TSIMP (Δ = -5.88 ± 3.7 s) with p &lt; 0.05. ΔVO2max 
correlated with S-Index (r = 0.619) and MIF (r = 0.583) with p &lt; 0.05. Both 
ΔTSIMB and TSIMP correlated with ΔHHbAUC (r = 0.516 and 0.596, respectively) and 
with Δ1.5-mile run time (r = 0.669 and 0.686, respectively) with p &lt; 0.05.
CONCLUSION: IMT improves vascular function, which is related to additional 
improvements in physical performance."
1381,"The prevalence of hypertension is becoming more common in children and 
adolescents than ever before. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the 
associations between the built environment on physical activity, sedentary 
behaviour, waist circumference, and health amongst adolescents in Saudi Arabia. 
A systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate and waist 
circumference of 380 boys and girls aged between 15-19 years old (male = 199 and 
females = 181) were measured. The International physical activity Questionnaire 
Short Form was used to assess the physical activity levels and time spent 
sitting. The statistical analysis conducted were means and standard deviation, 
2-way and 3-way of variance (ANOVA), Bonferroni post hoc tests, Chi-squared 
distribution and Pearson's correlations. Among males, 16.75% were classified as 
hypertensive, 12.69% as pre-hypertensive, and 70.56% as normal whereas, females, 
23.20% were classified as hypertensive, 12.15% as pre-hypertensive and 64.64% as 
normal. There were significant differences (F1,379 = 16.50, p &lt; 0.001) 
between males and females waist circumference. Pearson's correlation also 
revealed significant positive relationships in sedentary time (r = 0.123, p &lt; 
0.016), WC (r = 0.104, p &lt; 0.043), and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.110, p 
&lt; 0.032). The results revealed that systolic and diastolic blood pressure are 
significantly related to multiple measures of weight status, and sedentary 
behaviour. The results also highlight that active youth had lower resting heart 
rate compared to inactive peers. The present findings provide a foundation of 
knowledge for future research and highlight the major need for research and 
policy interventions, to address the concerning health habits of Al-Ahsa youth 
and broader Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
1382,"The possible link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes 
has so far demonstrated heterogeneous results in terms of maternal, fetal, and 
neonatal complications. We aim to investigate the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 
seroconversion and/or neutralization titer and pregnancy outcomes. We analyzed a 
population of 528 pregnant women followed up from the first trimester of 
gestation until delivery. For each woman, we collected a first blood sample 
between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation and a second sample in the perinatal period 
(between peripartum and puerperium) to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 
antibodies and/or microneutralization titer (MN titer). Data on pregnancy 
outcomes (gestational age at delivery, preterm birth before 34 weeks, 
hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and abnormal fetal growth) were 
collected. We observed that serologic status per se is not associated with major 
pregnancy complications. On the contrary, the MN titer was associated with 
increased odds of gestational diabetes. Although we mainly reported asymptomatic 
SARS-CoV-2 infections and the absence of severe maternal and neonatal adverse 
outcomes, SARS-CoV-2 infection might challenge the maternal immune system and 
explain the moderate increase in adverse outcome odds."
1383,"BACKGROUND: It is well documented that telemedicine offers effective 
accessibility and consistency which are useful in overcoming the barriers 
associated with the traditional delivery of chronic disease management. 
Furthermore, home-based telemonitoring approach for managing chronic disease 
conditions has been shown to break geographical barriers and facilitate 
provider-to-patient communication. However, the efficacy of telemedicine in 
reducing HbA1c is debatable.
AIM: This systematic review aims to evaluate the effect of telemedicine on 
glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHOD: This systematic review has been conducted in line with Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. 
Searches were primarily conducted using the EBSCOhost database. Other search 
engines such as Cochrane Library and Google scholar were also used and search of 
grey literature was performed using google, NHS.uk website, WHO websites, and 
gov.uk website. Nine articles were included in this review.
RESULTS: Three themes were identified in this review including diabetes 
education/telemonitoring technology and glycaemic control, the attitude of 
participants, and cost effectiveness of tele-medicine. While three studies 
reported improved glycaemic control with statistically significant improvement 
in HbA1c compared to the control group, three other studies did not find 
significant improvement in glycaemic control. In addition, the findings suggest 
that participants' positive attitude to self-care can lead to an improved HbA1c, 
and finally, several of the selected studies found that telemonitoring is not 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this review show that telemedicine may be effective 
in managing blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, factors 
such as educational level of patients, attitude and costs may limit its 
application in primary care. More studies are required to fully establish the 
effectiveness of Telemonitoring in managing patients with type 2 diabetes."
1384,"Pre-existing diabetes, hypertension and kidney disorders are prominent risk 
factors of pre-eclampsia (PE). It is a multifactorial pregnancy disorder 
associated with high blood pressure, proteinuria, and multiorgan failure, which 
develops after the 20th week of pregnancy. It is one of the most feared 
pregnancy disorders, as it consumes thousands of fetomaternal lives per annum. 
According to clinical and pathological studies, the placenta appears to be a key 
player in the pathogenesis of PE; however, the exact origin of this disorder is 
still under debate. Defective placentation and angiogenesis are the hallmarks of 
PE progression. This angiogenic imbalance, together with maternal 
susceptibility, might determine the severity and clinical presentation of PE. 
This article comprehensively examines the mechanisms of pathogenesis of PE and 
current evidence of the factors involved in its progression. Finally, this 
article will explore the genetic association of PE, various candidate genes, 
their proposed mechanisms and variants involved in its pathogenesis."
1385,"Due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the risk it represents to 
public health, and the possible consequences for animal health and welfare, 
there is an increasing focus on reducing antimicrobial usage (AMU) in animal 
husbandry. Therefore, a great interest in developing alternatives to AMU in 
livestock production is present worldwide. Recently, essential oils (EOs) have 
gained great attention as promising possibilities for the replacement of 
antibiotics. The current study aimed to test the potential of using a novel 
EO-based pharmaceutical formulation (Phyto-Bomat) in bovine mastitis treatment. 
The antibacterial activity was performed using the microdilution technique. 
Lactating dairy cows were treated with 15 mL of Phyto-Bomat in the inflamed 
quarter for 5 consecutive days in order to analyze blood and milk samples for 
thymol and carvacrol residues using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry 
(GC-MS). Antimicrobial activity expressed as the minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) indicates that 
this formulation has the highest activity against Gram-positive strains. The 
dominant compounds in Phyto-Bomat were thymol and carvacrol, at 12.58 ± 1.23 
mg/mL and 23.11 ± 2.31 mg/mL, respectively. The quantification of these two 
compounds in evaluated biological samples showed that 24 h after administration 
the concentration of thymol and carvacrol in milk samples was at the same level 
as before application. On the other hand, thymol and carvacrol were detectable 
in plasma samples even after 24 h post-treatment, with values ranging from 
0.15-0.38 and 0.21-0.66 µg/mL, respectively. The tested formulation showed 
encouraging results of antibacterial activity against bovine mastitis pathogens, 
as well as the withdrawal period of dominant compounds, which implies that 
further testing regarding the bacteriological and clinical cure rates in 
clinical settings is needed."
1386,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is very disruptive in adolescence and hospitalizations 
interfere with this development stage in becoming independent, developing social 
relationships, and making plans for the future. A major challenge in the care of 
adolescents with cancer is being able to enhance their quality of life. The aim 
of this project is to increase our understanding of how adventure therapy 
influenced quality of life for adolescents with cancer.
METHODS: Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, in collaboration with the Tender to 
Nave Italia Foundation (TTNI), has been conducting a unique project, located on 
a beautiful brigantine of the Italian Navy. Adventure therapy is a form of 
experiential therapy that consists of various types of adventure, in particular 
outdoor and sailing activities. Ninety teenagers have been the protagonists of 
this project to date and filled out two questionnaires about quality of life and 
self-esteem, before and after the sailing experience.
RESULTS: The adventure provides the opportunity for the participants to build 
interpersonal relationships and develop life skills that they can benefit from 
in the future experiences. All participants report a significant improvement in 
their quality of life and self-esteem at the end of this experience.
CONCLUSION: This collaborative adventure project is a great way to learn and 
practice new behaviors, improve interpersonal skills, heal painful emotions, 
overcome personal obstacles and challenges, and help the teenagers to resume 
their developmental path after an onco-hematological diagnosis."
1387,"BACKGROUND: While iron deficiency is commonly discussed in populations of 
professional female athletes, less is known about highly trained, sub-elite 
female athletes (e.g., those winning international age-group competitions) who 
generally have less access to medical and allied health support.
METHODS: Thirteen non-professional highly trained female endurance athletes 
provided training diaries and completed a blood test, where iron markers of 
haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Hct), C-reactive protein (Crp), serum iron, serum 
ferritin, and transferrin were assessed. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body 
composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were also obtained. 
Participants were classified as iron deficient (ID) if serum ferritin was &lt;30 
ug/L serum ferritin.
RESULTS: Six of the 13 females were classified as ID. Serum iron, ferritin, Hb, 
Hct, and ferrin were greater in the ID group (p &lt; 0.05). Crp resulted in 
large to very large correlations with serum iron (r = -0.72), serum ferritin (r 
= -0.66), and transferrin (r = 0.70).
CONCLUSIONS: In this population of highly trained female athletes, 46% were 
diagnosed with sub-optimal iron levels, which could have lasting health effects 
and impair athletic performance. The need for more education and support in 
non-professional athletes regarding iron deficiency is strongly advised."
1388,"School nurses should participate in the care of children with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus. The aim of this study was to assess the level of knowledge of school 
nurses about the basic principles of self-control and the treatment of type 1 
diabetes mellitus and to attempt to determine the factors that influence this 
level of knowledge. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among school nurses 
from October 2018 to November 2019 in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. The study was 
conducted using a self-constructed questionnaire. The survey included questions 
about the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents, and a test of the 
knowledge and skills regarding the principles of self-control and the treatment 
of type 1 diabetes mellitus (16 test questions). This study included 168 Polish 
school nurses (mean age ± SD = 55.1 ± 8.9 years). Most of the nurses had a 
secondary education (81%), worked in a municipal educational institution 
(78.6%), and provided care to more than one student with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus at school (70.2%). The average level of knowledge of school nurses was 
12.5 ± 2.0 points (maximum 16). The nurses working in a village school and those 
who worked only in one school had lower levels of knowledge. Only 85.7% of 
nurses reported that they could independently perform a blood glucose 
measurement with a glucometer, and as many as 56.5% were unable to determine the 
level of ketone bodies in the urine with Keto-Diastix test strips. Only 62.5% of 
nurses had a glucometer and glucometer strips in their nursing office. A total 
of 19.6% of nurses did not have glucagon (1 mg GlucaGen HypoKit®, Novo Nordisk 
A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark) or an ampoule with 20% glucose for an intravenous 
administration. The knowledge of school nurses about the principles of 
self-control and the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus is insufficient. Due 
to the strong increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus among 
children and adolescents, it is important to organize permanent, continuous, and 
mandatory training on the principles of self-control and the treatment of type 1 
diabetes mellitus for school nurses. The equipment in Polish school nurses' 
offices should be supplemented with a working glucometer and blood glucose test 
strips, and the set of obligatory medications in the school nurse's office 
should be supplemented with glucagon for students with type 1 diabetes mellitus."
1389,"The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of new-onset hypertension 
when the definition of hypertension is changed from the traditional definition 
(140/90 mmHg) to a new definition (130/80 mmHg). Using data from the Taiwan 
Biobank, a total of 17,072 and 21,293 participants in the new and traditional 
definition groups were analyzed, respectively. During a mean follow-up period of 
3.9 years, 3641 and 3002 participants developed hypertension in the new and 
traditional definition groups, respectively. After multivariable analysis, older 
age (OR, 1.035; 95% CI, 1.030 to 1.039; p &lt; 0.001), male sex (OR, 1.332; 95% 
CI, 1.194 to 1.486; p &lt; 0.001), high systolic blood pressure (SBP) (OR, 
1.067; 95% CI, 1.062 to 1.073; p &lt; 0.001), high diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP) (OR, 1.048; 95% CI, 1.040 to 1.056; p &lt; 0.001), high heart rate (OR, 
1.007; 95% CI, 1.002 to 1.012; p = 0.004), high body mass index (BMI) (OR, 
1.091; 95% CI, 1.077 to 1.106; p &lt; 0.001), high fasting glucose (OR, 1.004; 
95% CI, 1.001 to 1.006; p = 0.002), and high triglycerides (OR, 1.001; 95% CI, 
1.000 to 1.001; p = 0.004) were significantly associated with new-onset 
hypertension in the new definition group. In the traditional definition group, 
the predictors of new-onset hypertension were older age (OR, 1.038; 95% CI, 
1.032 to 1.043; p &lt; 0.001), high SBP (OR, 1.078; 95% CI, 1.072 to 1.084; p 
&lt; 0.001), high DBP (OR, 1.039; 95% CI, 1.031 to 1.046; p &lt; 0.001), high 
heart rate (OR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.000 to 1.010; p = 0.032), high BMI (OR, 1.072; 
95% CI, 1.058 to 1.087; p &lt; 0.001), high fasting glucose (OR, 1.003; 95% CI, 
1.000 to 1.005; p = 0.020), low cholesterol (OR, 0.998; 95% CI, 0.997 to 0.999; 
p = 0.004), high triglycerides (OR, 1.001; 95% CI, 1.000 to 1.001; p = 0.001), 
and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (OR, 0.995; 95% CI, 0.993 to 
0.997; p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, older age, high SBP and DBP, high heart 
rate, high BMI, high fasting glucose, and high triglycerides were useful 
predictors of new-onset hypertension in both the new and traditional definition 
groups. However, male sex was a significant predictor of new-onset hypertension 
only in the new definition group, and low cholesterol and low eGFR were 
significant predictors of new-onset hypertension only in the traditional 
definition group. Hence, changing the diagnostic cut-off value for hypertension 
may have a significant impact on the association of some clinical and laboratory 
parameters with new-onset hypertension."
1390,"Drinking water is an important natural resource. For many people worldwide, 
especially in developing countries, access to safe drinking water is still a 
dream. An increasing number of human activities and industrialization have 
caused various physical, chemical, and biological pollutants to enter water 
bodies, affecting human health. Water pollutants contain a vast number of 
additives, such as perfluorinated chemicals, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, 
phthalate, nanomaterials, insecticides, microcystins, heavy metals, and 
pharmacologies. In this work, we aim to explore the potential relationship 
between water pollutants and human diseases. Here, we explored an integrative 
approach to identify genes, biological processes, molecular functions, and 
diseases linked to exposure to these water pollutants. These processes and 
functions affected by water pollutants are related to many diseases, including 
colonic neoplasms, breast neoplasms, hepatitis B, bladder cancer, and human 
cytomegalovirus infection. In addition, further analysis revealed the genes that 
play a key role in the human diseases induced by water pollutants. Therefore, 
conducting an integrative toxicogenomic analysis of water pollutants is more 
appropriate for evaluating the potential effects of water pollutants on human 
health."
1391,"A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the effect of 
fermented sarco oysters (FSO) on muscle strength in postmenopausal females with 
low muscle mass. Fifty-two female participants were randomly divided into the 
experiment group (EG) or control group (CG). For 12 weeks, the EG was subjected 
to 1000 mg of FSO extract daily while the CG consumed the placebo extract. The 
muscle extension and flexion at an angular velocity of 60°/s and with respect to 
grip strength, body composition, and muscle growth-related blood factors were 
measured at the baseline and after the trial. The difference in the quadriceps 
muscle extension at an angular velocity of 60°/s, grip strength on both the left 
and right side, and insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) between groups were 
significantly higher in the EG compared with the CG. However, no differences 
were found in body composition, blood pyruvate, lactate, or high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration between the two groups. In conclusion, 
FSO supplements may improve muscle strength in postmenopausal females with 
relatively reduced muscle strength without a change in muscle mass."
1392,"INTRODUCTION: Correct perioperative management of anticoagulant therapy is 
essential to prevent thromboembolic events and reduce the risk of bleeding. The 
lack of universally accepted guidelines makes perioperative anticoagulant 
therapy management difficult. The present study aims to identify the 
perioperative risks of oral anticoagulant therapy and to reduce adverse events 
through Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary working group was set up, and four 
main phases of the process were identified. Each of these phases was divided 
into micro-activities to identify the related possible failure modes and their 
potential consequences. The Risk Priority Number was calculated for each failure 
mode.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Seventeen failure modes were identified in the entire 
perioperative period; those with a higher priority of intervention concern the 
incorrect timing between therapy suspension and surgery, and the incorrect 
assessment of the bleeding risk related to the invasive procedure.
CONCLUSION: The FMEA method can help identify anticoagulant therapy 
perioperative failures and implement the management and patient safety of 
surgical procedures."
1393,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the most common physical examination tests (PET) for 
the screening for referral of patients with back or chest pain caused by serious 
pathology.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Searches were performed on seven 
electronic databases between June 2020 and December 2021. Only studies 
evaluating patients with back and/or chest pain with clear reporting of PETs and 
prompt patient referrals were included.
RESULTS: 316 full texts were included, and these studies had a total of 474/492 
patients affected by a serious disease. Only 26 studies of them described 
suspicion of serious disease due to at least one positive PET. Cardiac/pulmonary 
auscultation and heartbeats/blood pressure measurements were the most frequently 
reported tests. None of the reported studies included physiotherapists and 
chiropractors who reported the use of various tests, such as: cardiac and 
pulmonary auscultation, lung percussion, costovertebral angle tenderness, and 
lymph node palpation, highlighting a lack of attention in measuring vital 
parameters. On the contrary, doctors and nurses reported the assessment of the 
range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine and hip less frequently.
CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate reporting of PETs is sparse, and their utilization is 
heterogeneous among different healthcare professionals. Further primary studies 
are needed to describe PETs results in patients suffering from back and/or chest 
pain."
1394,"BACKGROUND: High-altitude tourist trekking continues to grow in popularity on 
the Everest Trek in Nepal. We examined which pre-existing cardiovascular and 
health conditions these global trekkers had and what health issues they 
encountered during the trek, be it exacerbations of pre-existing conditions, or 
new acute ones.
METHOD: Trekkers (n = 350) were recruited from guesthouses along the Everest 
Trek, mostly at Tengboche (3860 m). After completing a questionnaire on their 
health and travel preparation, they underwent a basic physical examination with 
an interview.
RESULTS: Almost half (45%) had pre-existing conditions, mostly orthopaedic and 
cardiovascular diseases. The average age was 42.7 years (range 18-76). The 
average BMI was 23.4 kg/m2, but 21% were overweight. A third were smokers (30%), 
and 86% had at least one major cardiovascular risk factor. A quarter (25%) were 
suffering from manifest acute mountain sickness (AMS), and 72% had at least one 
symptom of AMS. Adequate pre-travel examination, consultation, and sufficient 
personal preparation were rarely found. In some cases, a distinct cardiovascular 
risk profile was assessed. Hypertensive patients showed moderately elevated 
blood pressure, and cholesterol levels were favourable in most cases. No 
cardiovascular emergencies were found, which was fortunate as timely, sufficient 
care was not available during the trek.
CONCLUSION: The results of earlier studies in the Annapurna region should be 
revalidated. Every trekker to the Himalayas should consult a physician prior to 
departure, ideally a travel medicine specialist. Preventative measures and 
education on AMS warrant special attention. Travellers with heart disease or 
with a pronounced cardiovascular risk profile should be presented to an internal 
medicine professional. Travel plans must be adjusted individually, especially 
with respect to adequate acclimatisation time and no physical overloading. With 
these and other precautions, trekking at high altitudes is generally safe and 
possible, even with significant pre-existing health conditions. Trekking can 
lead to invaluable personal experiences. Since organized groups are limited in 
their flexibility to change their itinerary, individual trekking or guided tours 
in small groups should be preferred."
1395,"Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive, and neurodegenerative disease, 
and yet with an imprecise etiopathogenesis. Although neuroinflammation was 
initially thought to be a secondary condition, it is now believed that 
microglia-induced inflammation could also contribute to the degeneration of the 
nigrostriatal pathway. Here, we aimed to establish the feasibility of basic 
inflammatory biomarkers as prognostic factors in PD. The study was based on 
retrospective analyses of blood samples taken from patients diagnosed with PD, 
as well as from healthy subjects. Complete medical records, total leukocyte 
count with subpopulations, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were 
analyzed. We calculated the serum neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) and 
platelet-to lymphocytes ratio (PLR), and also compared the laboratory data 
between the PD group and the control group. Only PLR and NLR showed 
statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.001 and 0.04, respectively). In 
our study, ESR did not show statistically significant correlations with motor 
score or with disability. In our research, ESR was correlated with the disease 
duration (p = 0.04), and PLR showed a significant correlation with disease stage 
(p = 0.027) and disease duration (p = 0.001), but not with motor state. These 
biomarkers could prove to be effective tools for a primary evaluation of 
inflammation in PD, but further tests are required to properly investigate the 
neuroinflammatory status of these patients."
1396,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in patients with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD), and its presence is associated with a higher risk of 
stroke and mortality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The FAERC study performed a retrospective multicentre 
analysis of historical cohorts in which data were collected from arrhythmia 
diagnosis onwards.
RESULTS: We analysed a Spanish cohort of 4749 patients with CKD (mean eGFR 33.9 
mL/min) followed up in the nephrology clinic, observing a 12.2% prevalence of 
non-valvular AF. In total, 98.6% of these patients were receiving anticoagulant 
treatment, mainly with coumarins (79.7%). Using direct-acting oral 
anticoagulants (DOACs) was associated with fewer cerebrovascular events than 
using acenocoumarol, but in contrast with other studies, we could not 
corroborate the association of risk of bleeding, coronary events, or death with 
a type of anticoagulant prescribed.
CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation is highly prevalent in renal patients. 
Direct-acting anticoagulants seem to be associated with fewer ischemic-embolic 
complications, with no differences in bleeding, coronary events, or mortality 
rates."
1397,"We aimed to evaluate the hypoalgesic effect of an elbow flexion low-load 
resistance exercise with blood flow restriction (LLRE-BFR) when compared to 
high-load resistance exercise (HLRE) with sham-BFR in healthy individuals. Forty 
healthy young adults (17 women), with a mean age ± SD: 26.6 ± 6.8 years, and 
mean body mass index ± SD: 23.6 ± 2.7 were randomly assigned to either an 
LLRE-BFR (30% 1 repetition maximum, RM) or an HLRE with sham-BFR group (70% of 1 
RM). Blood pressure and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured pre- and 
post-exercise intervention. The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded 
after each set. There were non-significant between-group changes in PPT at the 
dominant biceps (-0.61, 95%CI: -1.92 to 0.68) with statistically significant 
reductions between pre- and post-exercise in LLRE-BFR (effect size, d = 0.88) 
and HLRE-BFR (effect size, d = 0.52). No within- or between-group differences 
were recorded in PPT at non-exercising sites of measurement. No mediating 
effects of changes in blood pressure or RPE on the changes in pressure pain 
threshold were observed. LLRE-BFR produced a similar hypoalgesic effect locally 
compared to HLRE and can be used as an alternative intervention to decrease pain 
sensitivity when HLRE is contraindicated or should be avoided."
1398,"This study aimed to compare the changes in physical activity (PA), chronic 
disease, and mental health indicators of Koreans before and after the COVID-19 
outbreak, using raw data from more than 400,000 representative samples from the 
2019-2020 Community Health Survey by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and to explore the correlations among them. We used two-way ANOVA to 
analyze changes and differences in PA and obesity levels. We assessed the 
influence of gender and recurrent PA using chi-square tests for mental health 
status and chronic disease. Finally, we performed a correlation analysis to 
determine the relationships among PA days, mental health, and chronic disease. 
The results showed that, compared to the levels before the COVID-19 period, 
moderate-intensity (Days: 1.415~1.217; Time: 114.688~107.321) and high-intensity 
(Days: 0.798~0.671; Time: 112.866~106.110) PA significantly decreased in Koreans 
during the COVID-19 period, while low-intensity (Time: 60.305~61.735) PA 
increased. Before and during the COVID-19 period, men (18,436 (8.1%)~16,124 
(7.0%)) performed PA more regularly than women (13,207 (5.8%)~9382 (4.1%)). 
Compared to the number of regular PA participants before the COVID-19 period, 
regular PA participants (male, female) decreased from 31,643 (13.8%) to 25,506 
(11.1%) during the COVID-19 period. Compared with the levels before the COVID-19 
period, the experience rates of stress (3.1%~2.6%), depression (0.8%~0.6%), HBP 
(3.0%~2.2%), and diabetes (1.2%~0.9%) significantly changed under different 
levels of conventional PA intervention. In addition, the obesity rate during the 
COVID-19 period (23.957) was higher than it was before COVID-19 (23.477). During 
the COVID-19 period, the PA of Koreans was greatly restricted, but low-intensity 
PA was maintained and increased. PA is an effective activity for maintaining 
mental health and for preventing and reducing chronic diseases. Recommendations 
for appropriate intensity or a combination of high-, moderate-, and 
low-intensity PA should be based on the health status of Koreans to help them 
maintain mental health and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases during 
COVID-19 social distancing."
1399,"Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) cause serious infections 
and aggravate disease progression. Last resort antibiotics are effective against 
MDR-GNB and are reimbursed by flat rates based on German diagnosis-related 
groups (G-DRG). From a hospital management perspective, this analysis compared 
hospital reimbursement for last resort antibiotics with their acquisition costs 
to outline potential funding gaps. Retrospective analyses based on medical 
charts and real-life reimbursement data included patients with pneumonia due to 
MDR-GNB treated in intensive care units (ICU) of a German tertiary care hospital 
(University Hospital Cologne) between January 2017 and December 2020. 
Drug-associated hospital reimbursement of G-DRG was compared with drug 
acquisition costs based on preliminarily approved last resort antibiotics 
(cefiderocol, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and 
imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam) according to label. Funding gaps were determined 
for the treatment of Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter 
baumannii, and mixed infections, respectively. Most of the 31 patients were 
infected with Enterobacterales (n = 15; 48.4%) and P. aeruginosa (n = 13; 
41.9%). Drug-associated G-DRG reimbursement varied from 44.50 EUR (mixed 
infection of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales) to 2265.27 EUR (P. aeruginosa; 
mixed infection of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales). Drug acquisition costs 
ranged from 3284.40 EUR in ceftazidime-avibactam (minimum duration) to 15,827.01 
EUR for imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam (maximum duration). Underfunding was 
found for all MDR-GNB, reaching from 1019.13 EUR (P. aeruginosa; mixed infection 
of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales) to 14,591.24 EUR (Enterobacterales). This 
analysis revealed the underfunding of last resort antibiotics in German hospital 
treatment. Insufficient reimbursement implies less research in this field, 
leading to a more frequent use of inappropriate antibiotics. The cycle closes as 
this contributes to the development of multi-drug resistant bacteria."
1400,"In this paper, a real-time knee extension monitoring and rehabilitation system 
for people, such as patients, the elderly, athletes, etc., is developed and 
tested. The proposed system has three major functions. The first function is 
two-channel surface electromyography (EMG) signal measurement and processing for 
the vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) muscles using a developed EMG 
device set. The second function is the knee extension range of motion (ROM) 
measurement using an angle sensor device set (i.e., accelerometer sensor). Both 
functions are connected and parallelly processed by the NI-myRIO embedded 
device. Finally, the third function is the graphical user interface (GUI) using 
LabVIEW, where the knee rehabilitation program can be defined and flexibly set, 
as recommended by physical therapists and physicians. Experimental results 
obtained from six healthy subjects demonstrated that the proposed system can 
efficiently work with real-time response. It can support multiple rehabilitation 
users with data collection, where EMG signals with mean absolute value (MAV) and 
root mean square value (RMS) results and knee extension ROM data can be 
automatically measured and recorded based on the defined rehabilitation program. 
Furthermore, the proposed system is also employed in the hospital for validation 
and evaluation, where bio-feedback EMG and ROM data from six patients, including 
(a) knee osteoarthritis, (b) herniated disc, (c) knee ligament injury, (d) 
ischemic stroke, (e) hemorrhagic stroke, and (f) Parkinson are obtained. Such 
data are also collected for one month for tracking, evaluation, and treatment. 
With our proposed system, results indicate that the rehabilitation people can 
practice themselves and know their rehabilitation progress during the time of 
testing. The system can also evaluate (as a primary treatment) whether the 
therapy training is successful or not, while experts can simultaneously review 
the progress and set the optimal treatment program in response to the 
rehabilitation users. This technology can also be integrated as a part of the 
Internet of Things (IoT) and smart healthcare systems."
1401,"Abdominal obesity has emerged globally as a major public health issue due to its 
high prevalence and morbidity. The benefits of physical exercise among the obese 
population are well documented. However, the optimal exercise intensity for 
reducing body fat and preventing insulin resistance and metabolic disorders is 
still under debate. This study aimed to examine the effects of three different 
intensities of combined endurance and strength training programs on 
anthropometric variables, physiological and muscular adaptations, and insulin 
sensitivity. Forty-three obese young women (age 26.4 ± 4.7 years, BMI 33.1 ± 2.5 
kg/m2) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: a control group (G0), a 
moderate-intensity training group (G50, exercising brisk walking at 50% heart 
rate reserve HRR), a high-intensity training group (G75, exercise jogging at 75% 
HRR), and an alternated-intensity training group (G50/75, exercise 
brisk-walking/jogging at 50-75% HRR) with additional strength training once a 
week for each group. Body composition, waist circumference (WC), fasting blood 
glucose, insulin sensitivity and resistance (Homa-IR), resting heart rate (RHR), 
6-min walk distance (6MWD), 1-repetition maximum (1-RM), and time to exhaustion 
(TTE) at 45% and 75% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for both the flexor and 
extensor muscle groups of the knees, were recorded before and after three months 
of exercise training. All training groups showed significant decreases in body 
mass, BMI, total body fat, body fat percentage, WC, abdominal and visceral mass 
(p &lt; 0.001), with a greater reduction of body mass and BMI in G75 (p &lt; 
0.05). Lean mass increased significantly only in G50/75 (p &lt; 0.05). The 
insulin sensitivity and Homa-IR decreased in the three training groups (p &lt; 
0.01), with greater enhanced resistance in G50 compared to G75 and G50/75 (p 
&lt; 0.05). In contrast, there were no pre-post changes in all groups for 
fasting blood glucose (p &gt; 0.05). 1-RM and TTE of the knee flexor and 
extensor muscles were improved in the three groups (p &lt; 0.01), with greater 
improvement in G50/75 for 1RM and G75 in most of the TTE parameters (p &lt; 
0.05). RHR decreased and 6MWD increased significantly in the three training 
groups (p &lt; 0.01), with greater 6MWD improvement in G75 (p &lt; 0.05). In 
conclusion, the three training intensities seem to generate benefits in terms of 
body composition, physiological and muscular adaptations, and insulin 
resistance. High training intensity resulted in greater improvements in body 
mass, BMI, and endurance and strength, whereas moderate training intensity 
resulted in greater improvements of insulin resistance and homo-IR. Following 
alternate-intensity training, greater improvements were observed in lean mass 
and maximal strength performance."
1402,"Bariatric surgery (BS) has been demonstrated to achieve sustained weight loss 
with significant metabolic improvement, including a reduction in cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes. The aim of this retrospective study is to measure the 
effect of BS on the Framingham risk score (FRS) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) 
among patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Additionally, we determine the 
effect of BS on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) among euthyroid obese 
patients. A retrospective follow-up study was conducted at King Abdullah Medical 
City, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. A total of 160 patients underwent BS and completed 
one-year follow-up visits. Medical history, anthropometric, biochemical, and 
hormonal parameters were evaluated at baseline and 3-12 months after BS. The 
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria were used to diagnose MetS. 
There was a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP), glycated hemoglobin (Hba1c), TSH, low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL), triglycerides, and total cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001). A significant 
decrease was seen in MetS, BMI, FRS, SBP, DBP, Hba1c, LDL, triglycerides, 
cholesterol, and liver enzymes, with a significant increase in high-density 
lipoprotein levels 12 months postoperatively (p &lt; 0.001). At 12 months, the 
prevalence of MetS, DM, and HTN and the FRS significantly decreased from 72.5%, 
43.1%, 78.1%, and 11.4 to 16.3%, 9.4%, 22.5%, and 5.4, respectively. In addition 
to achieving substantial weight loss, BS improves MetS prevalence and 
cardiovascular risk profiles."
1403,"Dental procedures have posed challenges in managing anticoagulated patients due 
to early reports of oral hemorrhage. This study aims to evaluate the risks of 
postoperative bleeding with the local application of tranexamic acid. A 
systematic search was conducted until 31 March 2022, with keywords including 
tranexamic acid, oral hemorrhage, dental, and/or coagulation. The following 
databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and 
Cochrane Library. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4. 
In total, 430 patients were pooled in with the local application of tranexamic 
acid using mouthwash, irrigation, and compression with a gauze/gauze pad. The 
mean age was 61.8 years in the intervention group and 58.7 in the control group. 
Only 4 patients in the intervened group out of the 210 discontinued the trial 
due to non-drug-related adverse events. The risk difference was computed as 
-0.07 (p = 0.05), meaning that patients administered with local antifibrinolytic 
therapy for postoperative bleeding reduction for dental procedures were at a 7% 
less risk of oral bleeding. Current evidence on managing anticoagulated patients 
undergoing dental or oral procedures remains unclear. The present study presents 
favorable outcomes of postoperative bleeding with local tranexamic acid used in 
the postoperative period."
1404,"The information logged by nurses on electronic health records (EHRs) using 
standardised nursing languages can help us identify the characteristics of 
highly complex chronic patients (HCCP) by focusing on care in terms of patients' 
health needs. The aim of this study was to describe the profile of HCCPs using 
EHRs from primary care (PC) facilities, presenting patients' characteristics, 
functional status based on health patterns, NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, health 
goals based on Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC), and care interventions 
using Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC). With an observational, 
descriptive, cross-sectional, epidemiological study design, this study was 
carried out with a sample of 51,374 individuals. The variables were grouped into 
sociodemographic variables, clinical variables, resources, functional status 
(health patterns), nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions. A total of 
57.4% of the participants were women, with a mean age of 73.3 (12.2), and 51% 
were frail or dependent. Prevalent conditions included high blood pressure 
(87.2%), hyperlipidaemia (80%), osteoarthritis (67.8%), and diabetes (56.1%). 
The participants were frequent users of healthcare services, with 12.1% admitted 
to hospital in the past year. Some 49.2% had one to four health patterns 
assessed, with more information on biological and functional aspects than on 
psychosocial aspects. The mean number of nursing diagnoses was 7.3 (5.2), NOC 
outcomes 5.1 (4.1), and NIC interventions 8.1 (6.9). Moderately and highly 
significant differences were observed between dysfunction in physical 
activity/exercise health pattern and age group, and between dysfunction in other 
health patterns and classification as a frail or dependent elderly person. 
Regarding the presence of certain nursing diagnoses, significant differences 
were observed by age group, classification of elderly person status, and 
presence of diseases. A total of 20 NIC interventions showed moderately or 
relatively strong associations for older age groups, higher levels of 
dependency, and chronic health conditions."
1405,"The public demand for popular science knowledge regarding health is increasing, 
and physicians' popular science practices on online medical platforms are 
becoming frequent. Few studies have been conducted to address the relationship 
between specific characteristics of popular science articles by physicians and 
their performance. This study explored the impact of the characteristics of 
popular science articles on physicians' performance based on the elaboration 
likelihood model (ELM) from the central path (topic focus and readability) and 
the peripheral path (form diversity). Data on four diseases, namely, lung 
cancer, brain hemorrhage, hypertension, and depression, were collected from an 
online medical platform, resulting in relevant personal data from 1295 doctors 
and their published popular science articles. Subsequently, the independent 
variables were quantified using thematic analysis and formula calculation, and 
the research model and hypotheses proposed in this paper were verified through 
empirical analysis. The results revealed that the topic focus, readability, and 
form diversity of popular science articles by physicians had a significant 
positive effect on physicians' performance. This study enriches the research 
perspective on the factors influencing physicians' performance, which has 
guiding implications for both physicians and platforms, thereby providing a 
basis for patients to choose physicians and enabling patients to receive popular 
science knowledge regarding health in an effective manner."
1406,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the ability to 
predict the trajectory of the disease has represented a major challenge for 
clinicians. There is recent evidence that complete blood cell count 
(CBC)-derived inflammation indexes have predictive value in COVID-19. We aimed 
to describe any changes in the clinical features, CBC-derived ratios, and 
outcomes of patients admitted to our hospital across two temporally distinct 
waves.
METHODS: We retrospectively assessed and compared the clinical characteristics 
and blood cell count values of patients hospitalized during the second and 
fourth waves of COVID-19, and explored any outcome differences in terms of the 
level of respiratory support required and transfer to intensive care.
RESULTS: We observed that fourth-wave patients were older, less 
male-predominant, and carried more comorbidities compared to the second-wave 
patients but, nevertheless, experienced more favorable outcomes. A strong 
internal correlation was documented for both waves between outcomes and 
CBC-derived ratios, with the fourth-wave cases displaying lower admission values 
of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR (dNLR), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic inflammation index (SII). No 
significant differences were found for lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), 
systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and aggregate index of systemic 
inflammation (AISI).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that both admission values of CBC-derived indexes and 
adverse respiratory outcomes decreased from the second to the fourth wave of 
COVID-19. These data represent a contribution to the existing knowledge on the 
role of CBC-derived indexes as a potential tool to help clinicians to quickly 
differentiate in-hospital patients at increased risk of serious illness and 
death."
1407,"There is scientific evidence that Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) is beneficial in 
healthy people, the elderly and patients with musculoskeletal disorders. A 
systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of BFR in patients 
with neurological disorders. The literature search was conducted up until July 
2022 in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), Physiotherapy 
Evidence Database (PEDro), LILACS, Scopus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and 
Allied Literature Complete (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library and Scientific 
Electronic Library Online (SciELO). The PEDro scale was used to analyze the 
methodological quality of the studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool was 
employed to evaluate the risk of bias. A total of seven articles were included. 
BFR seems to be beneficial in neurological disorders. Improvements have been 
found in sensorimotor function, frequency and step length symmetry, perceived 
exertion, heart rate and gait speed, walking endurance, fatigue, quality of 
life, muscles thickness, gluteus density and muscle edema. No improvements were 
found in lower limb strength or balance. However, results must be taken with 
caution due to the small number of articles and to the large heterogeneity. More 
clinical trials are needed. These studies should homogenize the protocols used 
in larger samples, as well as improve their methodological quality."
1408,"This study compared the anthropometric parameters of patients with fatty acid 
oxidation disorders (FAOD) and healthy controls, showing an increased prevalence 
of abnormal body weight (overweight and obesity) in the FAOD group. First, 
differences in BMI, BMI percentiles and z-scores, and weight and weight 
percentiles were compared in a cohort of 39 patients with FAOD and 156 healthy 
controls, as well as between patients born before and after the introduction of 
a populational newborn screening programme (NBS) in 2014 in Poland. We also 
performed a systematic literature review yielding 12 studies mentioning 
anthropometric parameters in 80 FAOD patients and 121 control subjects, followed 
by a meta-analysis of data from 8 studies and our cohort. There were significant 
differences in body weight percentiles (p = 0.001), BMI (p = 0.022), BMI 
percentiles (p = 0.003) and BMI z-scores (p = 0.001) between FAOD patients and 
controls in our cohort but not between pre- and post-newborn-screening patients. 
The meta-analysis did not show any differences in weight and BMI in all tested 
subgroups, i.e., all FAOD patients vs. controls, medium-chain acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase (MCADD) patients vs. controls and patients with FAOD types other 
than MCAD vs. controls. These results, however, should be interpreted with 
caution due to the overall low quality of evidence as assessed by GRADE, the 
small sample sizes and the significant heterogeneity of the included data."
1409,"Nurses who take care of patients with hematology have more difficulty in 
therapeutic communication. The aim of this study is to explore the therapeutic 
communication experiences of nurses caring for patients with hematology and the 
meaning of the essential structure of therapeutic communication. Colaizzi's 
phenomenological method was applied to explore the essential structures and 
meanings of therapeutic communication in depth through a focus group interview. 
The interview was conducted at a tertiary care hospital with 20 nurses caring 
for patients with hematology. As a result of the analyses, 22 themes, 14 theme 
clusters, and 5 categories were derived. The categories derived from the 
analyses included ""acquiring core competencies as nursing professionals"", 
""improving patient-centered nursing performance"", ""forming a partnership 
treatment relationship"", ""obtaining clinical performance skills to solve 
problems"", and ""preparing efficient system improvement"". Based on this study's 
results, it will be possible to provide high-quality nursing to patients by 
improving the therapeutic communication ability of nurses caring for patients 
with hematology. In addition, it will be the basis for the development of a 
nurses' therapeutic communication promotion program for nurses caring for such 
patients."
1410,"The present study examined the influence of inulin on fecal microbiota, 
cardiometabolic risk factors, eicosanoids, and oxidative stress in rats on a 
high-fat (HF) diet. Thirty-six male Wistar-Kyoto rats were divided into three 
dietary groups: standard diet, HF diet, and HF diet + Inulin diet. After 10 
weeks, the HF + Inulin diet promoted high dominance of a few bacterial genera 
including Blautia and Olsenella in feces while reducing richness, diversity, and 
rarity compared to the HF diet. These changes in fecal microbiota were 
accompanied by an increased amount of propionic acid in feces. The HF + Inulin 
diet decreased cardiometabolic risk factors, decreased the amount of the 
eicosanoids 11(12)-EET and 15-HETrE in the liver, and decreased oxidative stress 
in blood compared to the HF diet. In conclusion, increasing consumption of 
inulin may be a useful nutritional strategy to protect against the onset of 
obesity and its associated metabolic abnormalities by means of modulation of gut 
microbiota."
1411,"Porcine blood is an important by-product from slaughterhouses and an abundant 
source of proteins. Indeed, cruor, the solid part of blood, is mainly composed 
of hemoglobin. Its enzymatic hydrolysis with pepsin generates a diversity of 
peptides, particularly antimicrobials. One of the downsides of using these 
hydrolysates as food bio-preservatives is the color brought by the heme, which 
can be removed by discoloration. Nonetheless, the effects of this procedure on 
the antimicrobial peptide population have not been completely investigated. In 
this study, its impacts were evaluated on the final antibacterial and antifungal 
activities of a cruor hydrolysate. The results demonstrated that 38 identified 
and characterized peptides showed a partial or total decrease in the 
hydrolysate, after discoloration. Antifungal activities were observed for the 
raw and discolored hydrolysates: MICs vary between 0.1 and 30.0 mg/mL of 
proteins, and significant differences were detected between both hydrolysates 
for the strains S. boulardii, C. guilliermondii, K. marxianus, M. racemosus and 
P. chrysogenum. The raw hydrolysate showed up to 12 times higher antifungal 
activities. Hence, peptides with the highest relative abundance decrease after 
discoloration were synthesized and tested individually. In total, eight new 
antifungal peptides were characterized as active and promising. To our 
knowledge, this is the first time that effective antifungal peptide sequences 
have been reported from porcine cruor hydrolysates."
1412,"The scope of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing was expanded to the genome, which 
allowed screening for rare chromosome anomalies (RCAs). Since the efficiency of 
the test for RCAs remains below the common aneuploidies, there is a debate on 
the usage of expanded tests. This study focuses on the confirmatory and 
follow-up data of cases with positive cfDNA testing for RCAs and cases with 
screen-negative results in a series of 912 consecutive cases that underwent 
invasive testing following cfDNA testing. Chorion villus sampling (CVS), 
amniocentesis (AS), fetal blood sampling, and term placenta samples were 
investigated using classical cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic techniques. 
Out of 593 screen-positive results, 504 (85%) were for common aneuploidies, 40 
(6.7%) for rare autosomal trisomies (RATs), and 49 (8.3%) for structural 
chromosome anomalies (SAs). Of the screen-positives for RATs, 20 cases were 
evaluated only in fetal tissue, and confined placental mosaicism (CPM) could not 
be excluded. Among cases with definitive results (n = 20), the rates of true 
positives, placental mosaics, and false positives were 35%, 45%, and 10%, 
respectively. Among screen-positives for SAs, 32.7% were true positives. The 
confirmation rate was higher for duplications than deletions (58.3% vs. 29.4%). 
The rate of chromosomal abnormality was 10.9% in the group of 256 
screen-negatives with pathological ultrasound findings. This study provides 
further data to assess the efficiency of expanded cfDNA testing for RATs and 
SAs. The test efficiency for cfDNA seems to be higher for duplications than for 
deletions, which is evidence of the role of expert ultrasound in identifying 
pregnancies at increased risk for chromosome anomalies, even in pregnancies with 
screen-negatives. Furthermore, we discussed the efficiency of CVS vs. AC in 
screen-positives for RATs."
1413,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal 
dominant inheritance caused by glutamine expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). 
Striatal projection neurons (SPNs) in HD are more vulnerable to cell death. The 
executive striatal population is directly connected with the Brodmann Area 
(BA9), which is mainly involved in motor functions. Analyzing the disease 
samples from BA9 from the SRA database provides insights related to neuron 
degeneration, which helps to identify a promising therapeutic strategy. Most 
gene expression studies examine the changes in expression and associated 
biological functions. In this study, we elucidate the relationship between 
variants and their effect on gene/downstream transcript expression. We computed 
gene and transcript abundance and identified variants from RNA-seq data using 
various pipelines. We predicted the effect of genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS)/novel variants on regulatory functions. We found that many variants 
affect the histone acetylation pattern in HD, thereby perturbing the 
transcription factor networks. Interestingly, some variants affect miRNA binding 
as well as their downstream gene expression. Tissue-specific network analysis 
showed that mitochondrial, neuroinflammation, vasculature, and 
angiogenesis-related genes are disrupted in HD. From this integrative omics 
analysis, we propose that abnormal neuroinflammation acts as a two-edged sword 
that indirectly affects the vasculature and associated energy metabolism. 
Rehabilitation of blood-brain barrier functionality and energy metabolism may 
secure the neuron from cell death."
1414,"Alström syndrome (ALMS) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) are rare genetic 
diseases with a number of common clinical features ranging from early-childhood 
obesity and retinal degeneration. ALMS and BBS belong to the ciliopathies, which 
are known to have the expression products of genes, encoding them as 
cilia-localized proteins in multiple target organs. The aim of this study was to 
perform transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on cellular models of ALMS and BBS 
syndromes to identify common and distinct pathological mechanisms present in 
both syndromes. For this purpose, epithelial cells were isolated from the urine 
of patients and healthy subjects, which were then cultured and reprogrammed into 
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The pathways of genes associated with the 
metabolism of lipids and glycosaminoglycan and the transport of small molecules 
were found to be concomitantly downregulated in both diseases, while transcripts 
related to signal transduction, the immune system, cell cycle control and DNA 
replication and repair were upregulated. Furthermore, protein pathways 
associated with autophagy, apoptosis, cilium assembly and Gli1 protein were 
upregulated in both ciliopathies. These results provide new insights into the 
common and divergent pathogenic pathways between two similar genetic syndromes, 
particularly in relation to primary cilium function and abnormalities in cell 
differentiation."
1415,"BACKGROUND: Heterozygous gain-of-function variants in SAMD9L are associated with 
ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome (ATXPC) and monosomy 7 myelodysplasia and leukemia 
syndrome-1 (M7MLS1). Association with peripheral neuropathy has rarely been 
described.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) from DNA extracted from peripheral blood 
was performed in a 10-year-old female presenting with demyelinating neuropathy, 
her similarly affected mother and the unaffected maternal grandparents. In 
addition to evaluation of single nucleotide variants, thorough work-up of copy 
number and exome-wide variant allele frequency data was performed.
RESULTS: Combined analysis of the mother's and daughter's duo-exome data and 
analysis of the mother's and her parents' trio-exome data initially failed to 
detect a disease-associated variant. More detailed analysis revealed a copy 
number neutral loss of heterozygosity of 7q in the mother and led to reanalysis 
of the exome data for respective sequence variants. Here, a previously reported 
likely pathogenic variant in the SAMD9L gene on chromosome 7q 
(NM_152703.5:c.2956C&gt;T; p.(Arg986Cys)) was identified that was not detected 
with standard filter settings because of a low percentage in blood cells (13%). 
The variant also showed up in the daughter at 32%, a proportion well below the 
expected 50%, which in each case can be explained by clonal selection processes 
in the blood due to this SAMD9L variant.
CONCLUSION: The report highlights the specific pitfalls of molecular genetic 
analysis of SAMD9L and, furthermore, shows that gain-of-function variants in 
this gene can lead to a clinical picture associated with the leading symptom of 
peripheral neuropathy. Due to clonal hematopoietic selection, displacement of 
the mutant allele occurred, making diagnosis difficult."
1416,"X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) is a primary immunodeficiency 
that is caused by mutations in the interleukin-2 receptor gamma (IL2RG) gene. 
Some patients present atypical X-SCID with mild clinical symptoms due to somatic 
revertant mosaicism. CRISPR/Cas9 and prime editing are two advanced genome 
editing tools that paved the way for treating immune deficiency diseases. Prime 
editing overcomes the limitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, as it does not need 
to induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) or exogenous donor DNA templates to modify 
the genome. Here, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 with single-stranded 
oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) and prime editing methods to generate an in vitro 
model of the disease in K-562 cells and healthy donors' T cells for the c. 
458T&gt;C point mutation in the IL2RG gene, which also resulted in a useful way 
to optimize the gene correction approach for subsequent experiments in patients' 
cells. Both methods proved to be successful and were able to induce the mutation 
of up to 31% of treated K-562 cells and 26% of treated T cells. We also applied 
similar strategies to correct the IL2RG c. 458T&gt;C mutation in patient T cells 
that carry the mutation with revertant somatic mosaicism. However, both methods 
failed to increase the frequency of the wild-type sequence in the mosaic T cells 
of patients due to limited in vitro proliferation of mutant cells and the 
presence of somatic reversion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
attempt to treat mosaic cells from atypical X-SCID patients employing 
CRISPR/Cas9 and prime editing. We showed that prime editing can be applied to 
the formation of specific-point IL2RG mutations without inducing nonspecific 
on-target modifications. We hypothesize that the feasibility of the nucleotide 
substitution of the IL2RG gene using gene therapy, especially prime editing, 
could provide an alternative strategy to treat X-SCID patients without revertant 
mutations, and further technological improvements need to be developed to 
correct somatic mosaicism mutations."
1417,"The breast muscle is essential for flight and determines the meat yield and 
quality of the meat type in pigeons. At present, studies about long non-coding 
RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles in skeletal muscles across the postnatal 
development of pigeons have not been reported. Here, we used transcriptome 
sequencing to examine the White-King pigeon breast muscle at four different ages 
(1 day, 14 days, 28 days, and 2 years old). We identified 12,918 mRNAs and 9158 
lncRNAs (5492 known lncRNAs and 3666 novel lncRNAs) in the breast muscle, and 
7352 mRNAs and 4494 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in the process of 
development. We found that highly expressed mRNAs were mainly related to 
cell-basic and muscle-specific functions. Differential expression and 
time-series analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were primarily 
associated with muscle development and functions, blood vessel development, cell 
cycle, and energy metabolism. To further predict the possible role of lncRNAs, 
we also conducted the WGCNA and trans/cis analyses. We found that differentially 
expressed lncRNAs such as lncRNA-LOC102093252, lncRNA-G12653, 
lncRNA-LOC110357465, lncRNA-G14790, and lncRNA-LOC110360188 might respectively 
target UBE2B, Pax7, AGTR2, HDAC1, Sox8 and participate in the development of the 
muscle. Our study provides a valuable resource for studying the lncRNAs and 
mRNAs of pigeon muscles and for improving the understanding of molecular 
mechanisms in muscle development."
1418,"As a distinguished Chinese indigenous pig breed that exhibits disease resistance 
and high meat quality, the Anqing six-end-white (AQ) pig represents a valuable 
germplasm resource for improving the quality of the pig breeding industry. In 
this study, 24 AQ pigs that were distantly blood-related and 6 Asian Wild Boar 
(AWB) were selected for 10× deep-genome resequencing. The signatures of the 
selection were analyzed to explore the genetic basis of their germplasm 
characteristics and to identify excellent germplasm-related functional genes 
based on NGS data. A total of 49,289,052 SNPs and 6,186,123 indels were detected 
across the genome in 30 pigs. Most of the genetic variations were synonym 
mutations and existed in the intergenic region. We identified 275 selected 
regions (top 1%) harboring 85 genes by applying a crossover approach based on 
genetic differentiation (FST) and polymorphism levels (π ratio). Some genes were 
found to be positively selected in AQ pigs' breeding. The SMPD4 and DDX18 genes 
were involved in the immune response to pseudorabies virus (PRV) and porcine 
reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The BCL6 and P2RX6 genes 
were involved in biological regulation of immune T cells and phagocytes. The 
SLC7A4 and SPACA4 genes were related to reproductive performance. The MSTN and 
HIF1A genes were related to fat deposition and muscle development. Moreover, 138 
overlapping regions were detected in selected regions and ROH islands of AQ 
pigs. Additionally, we found that the QTLs with the most overlapping regions 
were related to back fat thickness, meat color, pH value, fatty acid content, 
immune cells, parasitic immunity, and bacterial immunity. Based on functional 
enrichment analysis and QTLs mapping, we conducted further research on the 
molecular genetic basis of germplasm traits (disease resistance and excellent 
meat quality). These results are a reliable resource for conserving germplasm 
resources and exploiting molecular markers of AQ pigs."
1419,"The COVID-19 pandemic stemmed a parallel upsurge in the scientific literature 
about SARS-CoV-2 infection and its health burden. The Rat Genome Database (RGD) 
created a COVID-19 Disease Portal to leverage information from the scientific 
literature. In the COVID-19 Portal, gene-disease associations are established by 
manual curation of PubMed literature. The portal contains data for nine 
ontologies related to COVID-19, an embedded enrichment analysis tool, as well as 
links to a toolkit. Using these information and tools, we performed analyses on 
the curated COVID-19 disease genes. As expected, Disease Ontology enrichment 
analysis showed that the COVID-19 gene set is highly enriched with coronavirus 
infectious disease and related diseases. However, other less related diseases 
were also highly enriched, such as liver and rheumatic diseases. Using the 
comparison heatmap tool, we found nearly 60 percent of the COVID-19 genes were 
associated with nervous system disease and 40 percent were associated with 
gastrointestinal disease. Our analysis confirms the role of the immune system in 
COVID-19 pathogenesis as shown by substantial enrichment of immune system 
related Gene Ontology terms. The information in RGD's COVID-19 disease portal 
can generate new hypotheses to potentiate novel therapies and prevention of 
acute and long-term complications of COVID-19."
1420,"Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder where an oncogenic 
TP53 germline mutation is inherited by offspring of a carrier parent. p53 is a 
key tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. 
Unexpectedly, some mutant TP53 carriers remain unaffected, while their children 
develop cancer early in life. To begin unravelling this paradox, the response of 
dermal fibroblasts (dFb) isolated from a child with LFS was compared to those 
from her unaffected father after UV exposure. Phospho-Chk1[S345], a key 
activator of cell cycle arrest, was increased by UV induction in the LFS patient 
compared to their unaffected parent dFb. This result, along with previous 
findings of reduced CDKN1A/p21 UV induction in affected dFb, suggest that cell 
cycle dysregulation may contribute to cancer onset in the affected LFS subject 
but not the unaffected parent. Mutant p53 protein and its promoter binding 
affinity were also higher in dFb from the LFS patient compared to their 
unaffected parent. These results were as predicted based on decreased mutant 
TP53 allele-specific mRNA expression previously found in unaffected dFb. 
Investigation of the potential mechanism regulating this TP53 allele-specific 
expression found that, while epigenetic promoter methylation was not detectable, 
TP53 wild-type mRNA was specifically stabilized in the unaffected dFb. Hence, 
the allele-specific stabilization of wild-type TP53 mRNA may allow an unaffected 
parent to counteract genotoxic stress by means more characteristic of homozygous 
wild-type TP53 individuals than their affected offspring, providing protection 
from the oncogenesis associated with LFS."
1421,"The endothelium is a monolayer of cells lining the inner blood vessels. 
Endothelial cells (ECs) play indispensable roles in angiogenesis, homeostasis, 
and immune response under normal physiological conditions, and their dysfunction 
is closely associated with pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases. Abnormal 
EC metabolism, especially dysfunctional fatty acid (FA) metabolism, contributes 
to the development of many diseases including pulmonary hypertension (PH). In 
this review, we focus on discussing the latest advances in FA metabolism in ECs 
under normal and pathological conditions with an emphasis on PH. We also 
highlight areas of research that warrant further investigation."
1422,"Oxidized in vitro genomic DNA (gDNA) is known to launch an adaptive response in 
human cell cultures. The cfDNA extracted from the plasma of schizophrenic 
patients (sz-cfDNA) and healthy controls (hc-cfDNA) contains increased amounts 
of 8-oxodG, a DNA-oxidation marker. The aim of the research was answering a 
question: can the human cfDNA isolated from blood plasma stimulate the adaptive 
response in human cells? In vitro responses of ten human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) 
and four peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lines after 1-24 h of 
incubation with sz-cfDNA, gDNA and hc-cfDNA containing different amounts of 
8-oxodG were examined. Expressions of RNA of eight genes (NOX4, NFE2L2, SOD1, 
HIF1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BAX and BCL2), six proteins (NOX4, NRF2, SOD1, HIF1A, γH2AX 
and BRCA1) and DNA-oxidation marker 8-oxodG were analyzed by RT-qPCR and flow 
cytometry (when analyzing the data, a subpopulation of lymphocytes (PBL) was 
identified). Adding hc-cfDNA or sz-cfDNA to HSFs or PBMC media in equal amounts 
(50 ng/mL, 1-3 h) stimulated transient synthesis of free radicals (ROS), which 
correlated with an increase in the expressions of NOX4 and SOD1 genes and with 
an increase in the levels of the markers of DNA damage γH2AX and 8-oxodG. ROS 
and DNA damage induced an antioxidant response (expression of NFE2L2 and HIF1A), 
DNA damage response (BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene expression) and anti-apoptotic 
response (changes in BAX and BCL2 genes expression). Heterogeneity of cells of 
the same HSFs or PBL population was found with respect to the type of response 
to (sz,hc)-cfDNA. Most cells responded to oxidative stress with an increase in 
the amount of NRF2 and BRCA1 proteins along with a moderate increase in the 
amount of NOX4 protein and a low amount of 8-oxodG oxidation marker. However, 
upon the exposure to (sz,hc)-cfDNA, the size of the subpopulation with apoptosis 
signs (high DNA damage degree, high NOX4 and low NRF2 and BRCA1 levels) also 
increased. No significant difference between the responses to sz-cfDNA and 
hc-cfDNA was observed. Sz-cfDNA and hc-cfDNA showed similarly high bioactivity 
towards fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Conclusion: In cultured human cells, 
hc-cfDNA and sz-cfDNA equally stimulated an adaptive response aimed at launching 
the antioxidant, repair, and anti-apoptotic processes. The mediator of the 
development of the adaptive response are ROS produced by, among others, NOX4 and 
SOD1 enzymes."
1423,"Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed necrotic cell death, but its 
potential prognostic value in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. On 
the basis of available AML data from TCGA and TARGET databases, a 10-gene 
signature model was constructed to effectively predict AML prognosis by 
performing LASSO Cox regression analysis, which showed that patients with a 
low-risk score had a significantly better prognosis than that of the high-risk 
group, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis achieved superior 
performance in the prognostic model. The model was further well-verified in an 
external GEO cohort. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that, in 
addition to age, the risk score was an independent poor survival factor for AML 
patients, and a nomogram model was constructed with high accuracy. Moreover, the 
high-risk group generally had higher cytolytic activity and increased levels of 
infiltrating immune cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and 
regulatory T cells (Tregs), which could be related to the expression of immune 
checkpoint genes. Additionally, low-risk AML patients may have a better response 
from traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. In conclusion, a pyroptosis-related 
gene signature can independently predict the prognosis of AML patients with 
sufficient predictive power, and pyroptosis plays an important role in the 
immune microenvironment of AML, which may be used to develop a new effective 
therapeutic method for AML in the future."
1424,"Studies suggest that ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1 C69T) 
polymorphism is associated with a decreased incidence of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) and that there is an association between ABCA1 C69T polymorphism 
and the risk of dyslipidemia in diabetic individuals. However, other studies 
contradict these suggestions. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence 
of ABCA1 C69T (rs1800977) gene polymorphism in a representative sample of the 
Saudi population not previously diagnosed with diabetes and its possible 
association with dyslipidemia and dysglycemia. A cross-sectional design was used 
to recruit nondiabetic adults of both genders from the Saudi population in 
Jeddah by employing a stratified, two-stage cluster sampling method. A total of 
650 people (337 men and 313 women) were recruited. Demographic, dietary, and 
lifestyle variables, as well as medical history and family history of chronic 
diseases, were collected using a predesigned questionnaire. Fasting blood 
samples were taken for the determination of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipids profile, which were followed by a 1-h 
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Real-time PCR technology was used to 
determine the ABCA1 C69T gene SNP (rs1800977). The T allele of ABCA1 C69T 
(rs1800977) was very frequent (TT in 44.9% and CT in 43.7%). There was a trend 
toward significance for a higher dysglycemia percentage in people with CT and TT 
genotypes (25.7%, and 23.3%, respectively) compared with CC genotypes (16.2%). 
In addition, FPG and 1-h plasma glucose were significantly higher in people with 
both TT and CT genotypes compared to CC genotypes. However, T allele was not 
associated with any dysregulation of lipid parameters."
1425,"Despite extensive industrial use, the biocompatibility of nanocomposites has not 
been extensively explored. The present study was designed to report the effect 
of variable doses of a newly synthesized nanocomposite, Neodymium Zirconate Zinc 
Sulfide, on selective serum and complete blood count parameters and on the 
oxidative stress markers from the vital organs of albino mice. Albino mice 
(C57BL/6 strain, 5 weeks old) of both sexes were orally treated for 11 days, 
either with 10 mg (low dose) or 20 mg/mL saline/kg body weight (high dose) of 
Neodymium Zirconate Zinc Sulfide nanocomposite. A control group that was not 
treated with the nanocomposite but with saline solution was also maintained. 
Data analysis revealed that high-dose nanocomposite-treated male mice had 
significantly reduced hemoglobin concentration as compared to the control males. 
Female mice treated with both doses of nanocomposite had higher serum 
triglyceride levels than controls. High-dose-treated female mice had elevated 
serum cholesterol concentration compared to their saline-treated controls. 
Oxidative stress marker analysis from selected organs indicated that 
concentrations of malonaldehyde (MDA) in the kidney and liver, Superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) levels in the brain and catalase in the kidney of male mice 
treated with the nanocomposite were significantly higher than in the control 
group, whereas SOD in the heart, MDA in the heart and kidney and catalase levels 
in the kidney were significantly disrupted in female mice compared to their 
respective controls."
1426,"The current gold standard for the definitive diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy uses 
either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, both of which are which 
are invasive procedures carrying a procedure-related risk of miscarriage of up 
to 0.1-0.2%. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis using fetal nucleated red blood 
cells (FNRBCs) isolated from maternal peripheral venous blood would remove this 
risk of miscarriage since these cells can be isolated from the mother's blood. 
We aimed to detect whole-chromosome aneuploidies from single nucleated fetal red 
blood cells using whole-genome amplification followed by massively parallel 
sequencing performed on a semiconductor sequencing platform. Twenty-six single 
cells were picked from the placental villi of twelve patients thought to have a 
normal fetal genotype and who were undergoing elective first-trimester surgical 
termination of pregnancy. Following karyotyping, it was subsequently found that 
two of these cases were also abnormal (one trisomy 15 and one mosaic genotype). 
One single cell from chorionic villus samples for two patients carrying a fetus 
with trisomy 21 and two single cells from women carrying fetuses with T18 were 
also picked. Pooled libraries were sequenced on the Ion Proton and data were 
analysed using Ion Reporter software. We correctly classified fetal genotype in 
all 24 normal cells, as well as the 2 T21 cells, the 2 T18 cells, and the two 
T15 cells. The two cells picked from the fetus with a mosaic result by CVS were 
classified as unaffected, suggesting that this was a case of confined placental 
mosaicism. Fetal sex was correctly assigned in all cases. We demonstrated that 
semiconductor sequencing using commercially available software for data analysis 
can be achieved for the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of whole-chromosome 
aneuploidy with 100% accuracy."
1427,"Tengchong snow, which has white feathers and black meat, is one of the most 
important black-bone chicken breeds and a genetic treasure of black food in 
China. Although the black meat traits are dominant, there are some chickens with 
white meat traits born in the process of folk selection and breeding. The 
purpose of this study was to compare the differences in skeletal muscle 
development between Tengchong snow black meat chickens (BS) and white meat 
chickens (WS), as well as whether excessive melanin deposition has an effect on 
skeletal muscle development. The BS and WS groups were selected to determine 
their muscle development difference at stages of 1, 7, 14, 21, and 42 days, 
using histological stain methods to analyze the development and composing type 
of breast and leg muscle fibers, as well as the count of melanin in BS muscle 
fibers. Finally, we were validated key candidate genes associated with muscle 
development and melanin synthesis. The results showed that BS breast muscle 
development was inhibited at 7, 14, and 21 days, while the leg muscle was 
inhibited at 7, 14, 21, and 42 days, compared to WS. Melanin deposition was 
present in a temporal migration pattern and was greater in the leg muscles than 
in the breast muscles, and it focused around blood vessels, as well as the 
epithelium, perimysium, endomysium, and connective tissue. Additionally, melanin 
produced an inhibitory effect similar to MSTN during skeletal muscle fiber 
development, and the inhibition was strongest at the stage of melanin entry 
between muscle fibers, but the precise mechanisms need to be confirmed. This 
study revealed that melanin has an inhibitory effect on the early development of 
skeletal muscle, which will provide new insights into the role of melanin in the 
black-boned chicken and theoretical references for the future conservation and 
utilization of black-boned chicken."
1428,"It is well known that first-trimester miscarriages are associated with 
chromosome abnormalities, with numerical chromosome abnormalities being the ones 
most commonly detected. Conventional karyotyping is still considered the gold 
standard in the analysis of products of conception, despite the extended use of 
molecular genetic techniques. However, conventional karyotyping is a laborious 
and time-consuming method, with a limited resolution of 5-10 Mb and hampered by 
maternal cell contamination and culture failure. The aim of our study was to 
assess the type and frequency of chromosomal abnormalities detected by 
conventional karyotyping in specimens of sporadic first-trimester miscarriages 
in a Romanian cohort, using QF-PCR to exclude maternal cell contamination. 
Long-term cultures were established and standard protocols were applied for cell 
harvesting, slide preparation, and GTG banding. All samples with 46,XX karyotype 
were tested for maternal cell contamination by QF-PCR, comparing multiple 
microsatellite markers in maternal blood with cell culture and tissue samples. 
Out of the initial 311 specimens collected from patients with sporadic 
first-trimester miscarriages, a total of 230 samples were successfully analyzed 
after the exclusion of 81 specimens based on unsuitable sampling, culture 
failure, or QF-PCR-proven maternal cell contamination. Chromosome abnormalities 
were detected in 135 cases (58.7%), with the most common type being single 
autosomal trisomy (71/135-52.6%), followed by monosomy (monosomy X being the 
only one detected, 24/135-17.8%), and polyploidy (23/135-17.0%). The subgroup 
analysis based on maternal age showed a statistically significant higher rate of 
single trisomy for women aged 35 years or older (40.3%) compared to the young 
maternal age group (26.1%) (p = 0.029). In conclusion, the combination of 
conventional karyotyping and QF-PCR can lead to an increased chromosome 
abnormality detection rate in first-trimester miscarriages. Our study provides 
reliable information for the genetic counseling of patients with first-trimester 
miscarriages, and further large-scale studies using different genetic techniques 
are required."
1429,"The tremendous evolution of genome-editing tools in the last two decades has 
provided innovative and effective approaches for gene therapy of congenital and 
acquired diseases. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator- like 
effector nucleases (TALENs) and CRISPR-Cas9 have been already applied by ex vivo 
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy in genetic diseases (i.e., 
Hemoglobinopathies, Fanconi anemia and hereditary Immunodeficiencies) as well as 
infectious diseases (i.e., HIV), and the recent development of CRISPR-Cas9-based 
systems using base and prime editors as well as epigenome editors has provided 
safer tools for gene therapy. The ex vivo approach for gene addition or editing 
of HSCs, however, is complex, invasive, technically challenging, costly and not 
free of toxicity. In vivo gene addition or editing promise to transform gene 
therapy from a highly sophisticated strategy to a ""user-friendly' approach to 
eventually become a broadly available, highly accessible and potentially 
affordable treatment modality. In the present review article, based on the 
lessons gained by more than 3 decades of ex vivo HSC gene therapy, we discuss 
the concept, the tools, the progress made and the challenges to clinical 
translation of in vivo HSC gene editing."
1430,"(1) Background: Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability. 
Walking dysfunction and paresis of the upper extremities occurs in more than 80% 
of people who have had a stroke. (2) Methods: We studied post-genomic markers in 
biosamples of muscle and brain tissue from animals that underwent intracerebral 
hematoma and recovered after 42 days. Our purpose was to understand the 
biological mechanisms associated with recovery from hemorrhagic stroke. We 
analyzed the peptides formed after trypsinolysis of samples by HPLC-MS, and the 
results were processed by bioinformatics methods, including the establishment of 
biochemical relationships (gene to gene) using topological omics databases such 
as Reactome and KEGG. (3) Results: In the pig brain, unique compounds were 
identified which are expressed during the recovery period after traumatic 
injury. These are molecular factors of activated microglia, and they contribute 
to the functional recovery of neurons and reduce instances of hematoma, edema, 
and oxidative stress. Complexes of the main binding factors of the neurotrophins 
involved in the differentiation and survival of nerve cells were found in 
muscles. (4) Conclusions: A network of gene interactions has been constructed 
for proteins involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission, in particular 
presynaptic vesicular and endocytic processes. The presence of transmitters and 
transporters associated with stimulation of NMDA receptors at neuromuscular 
junctions shows the relationship between upper motor neurons and neuromuscular 
junctions."
1431,"Alport syndrome (AS) is the most frequent monogenic inherited glomerulopathy and 
is also genetically and clinically heterogeneous. It is caused by semi-dominant 
pathogenic variants in the X-linked COL4A5 (NM_000495.5) gene or recessive 
variants in the COL4A3/COL4A4 (NM_000091.4/NM_000092.4) genes. The disease 
manifests in early childhood with persistent microhematuria and can progress to 
proteinuria and kidney failure in adolescence or early adulthood if left 
untreated. On biopsy, pathognomonic features include alternate thinning, 
thickening and lamellation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), in the 
presence of podocyte foot process effacement. Although previous studies indicate 
a prevalence of AS of about 1/50,000, a recent publication reported a predicted 
rate of pathogenic COL4A5 variants of 1/2320. We herewith present 98 patients 
(40 M/58 F) from 26 Greek families. We are selectively presenting the families 
segregating the X-linked form of AS with pathogenic variants in the COL4A5 gene. 
We found 21 different pathogenic variants, 12 novel: eight glycine and one 
proline substitutions in the collagenous domain, one cysteine substitution in 
the NC1 domain, two premature termination of translation codons, three splicing 
variants, one 5-bp insertion/frameshift variant, one indel-frameshift variant 
and four gross deletions. Notably, patients in six families we describe here and 
three families we reported previously, carried the COL4A5-p.G624D substitution, 
a founder defect encountered all over Europe which is hypomorphic with mostly 
milder symptomatology. Importantly, on several occasions, the correct genetic 
diagnosis reclassified patients as patients with AS, leading to termination of 
previous immunosuppressive/cyclosporine A therapy and a switch to angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). With the understanding that all 98 patients 
span a wide range of ages from infancy to late adulthood, 15 patients (11 M/4 F) 
reached kidney failure and 11 (10 M/1 F) received a transplant. The prospects of 
avoiding lengthy diagnostic investigations and erroneous medications, and the 
advantage of delaying kidney failure with very early administration of 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade, highlights the importance 
of timely documentation of AS by genetic diagnosis."
1432,"SLC26A4 is one of the most common genes causing autosomal recessive 
non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). It has been reported to cause 
Pendred Syndrome (PDS) and DFNB4 which is deafness with enlarged vestibular 
aqueduct (EVA). However, mutated SLC26A4 is not conclusive for having either 
DFNB4 or PDS. Three unrelated Jordanian families consisting of eight affected 
individuals with congenital bilateral hearing loss (HL) participated in this 
study. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing were performed to investigate the 
underlying molecular etiology of HL. Further clinical investigations, including 
laboratory blood workup for the thyroid gland, CT scan for the temporal bone, 
and thyroid ultrasound were performed. Three disease-causing variants were 
identified in SLC26A4 in the three families, two of which were novel. Two 
families had a novel pathogenic homozygous splice-site accepter variant 
(c.165-1G&gt;C), while the third family had compound heterozygous pathogenic 
variants (c.1446G&gt;A; p.Trp482* and c.304G&gt;A; p.Gly102Arg). Our approach 
helped in redirecting the diagnosis of several affected members of three 
different families from non-syndromic HL to syndromic HL. Two of the affected 
individuals had typical PDS, one had DFNB4, while the rest had atypical PDS. Our 
work emphasized the intra- and inter-familial variability of SLC26A4-related 
phenotypes. In addition, we highlighted the variable phenotypic impact of 
SLC26A4 on tailoring a personalized healthcare management."
1433,"Tonsillectomy is one of the most common procedures performed in children, 
however there are currently no published studies evaluating tonsillectomy in 
children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). With this study, our goal was 
to investigate the indications, efficacy, and complications of tonsillectomy in 
a pediatric cohort of patients with 22q11DS. This is a retrospective chart 
review of patients in our 22q Center's repository. Inclusion criteria were a 
diagnosis of 22q11DS and a history of tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Data 
collected included: indications for tonsillectomy, preoperative and 
postoperative polysomnography (PSG) results, and surgical complications. In 
total, 33 patients were included. Most common indications for tonsillectomy were 
facilitation with speech surgery (n = 21) and sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB)/obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (n = 16). Average length of stay was 1.15 
days. Most patients (69%) had some degree of persistent OSA on postoperative 
PSG. Complications occurred in 18% of patients and included respiratory 
distress, hemorrhage, and hypocalcemia. This study demonstrates tonsillectomy 
was a commonly performed procedure in this cohort of patients with 22q11DS. 
These data highlight the potential need for close postoperative calcium and 
respiratory monitoring. The data were limited with respect to PSG outcomes, and 
future studies are needed to better characterize OSA outcomes and complications 
in this patient population."
1434,"During training camps, training load is purposefully intensified. Intensified 
training loads (TL) are associated with psychological variations, increased 
fatigue, insufficient recovery, decreased muscular performance, and biological 
changes in adult athletes, but whether these changes occur during training camps 
in youth athletes has not been established. The aim of this study was to assess 
changes in psychometric status, vertical jump performance (i.e., height), and 
hematological markers before and after an intensive training camp in youth 
soccer players. In this case, 15male youth soccer players (mean ± SD: age: 14.8 
± 0.4 years; height: 172.0 ± 6.9 cm, body mass: 60.8 ± 7.9 kg; training 
experience: 5.2 ± 0.7 years) completed a 2-week training program consisting of 1 
week of moderate TL (MT) and 1 week of intensive training camp (TC). Rate of 
perceived exertion (RPE), TL, monotony, strain, and psychometric status (total 
quality of recovery (TQR) and well-being indices (sleep, stress, fatigue, and 
muscle soreness) were monitored before each first daily training session across 
two weeks. The profile of mood states (POMS), countermovement jump (CMJ) height, 
and blood markers (complete blood count, urea, and creatinine) were assessed 
before and after TC. TL (d = 5.39, large), monotony (d = 3.03, large), strain (d 
= 4.38, large), and well-being index (d = 7.5, large) scores increased and TQR 
(d = 4.6, large) decreased during TC. The TC increased tension, fatigue, and 
total mood disturbance and decreased vigor (all p &lt;0.01). CMJ performance p

leukocyte concentration (p &lt; 0.01, d = 1.4, large) and granulocyte 
concentration (p &lt; 0.01, d = 1.93, large) increased after TC. Percentage of 
lymphocytes (p &lt; 0.05, d = 1.17, large) and monocytes (p &lt; 0.01, d = 1.05, 
large) decreased while the percentage of granulocytes (p &lt; 0.05, d = 0.86, 
large) increased significantly. Well-being, quality of recovery, mood, 
granulocyte concentration, and creatinine were all altered during the week-long 
intensified training camp. These results may provide coaches with valuable 
information about psychometric status and physiological fatigue and recovery of 
youth soccer players to better prescribe and adjust training loads during 
intensive training periods."
1435,"Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement is a key tool for determining the 
degree of chronic kidney disease. The assessment of GFR is even more challenging 
in children than in adults with more variables in the equation than race and 
sex. Monitoring the progress of the kidney disease can therefore be difficult as 
in the initial stages of a decline in kidney function, there are no clinical 
signs. Due to children's growth and development, changes in muscle mass and 
growth impair GFR estimation based solely on serum creatinine values. More 
invasive methods of GFR measurement are more reliable, but techniques using 
ionising agents, requiring large volume blood samples or timed voiding, have 
limited application in children. This paper reviews the methods of measuring and 
determining glomerular filtration rate and kidney function in children."
1436,"Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) has 
been shown in adults to minimize nerve palsy after thyroid surgery, but only few 
studies on its efficacy in a pediatric population have been reported. We 
conducted a retrospective study on patients operated for thyroid lesions from 
2016 to 2022. The analyzed population was divided in two groups: patients 
treated from 2016 to 2020, when the identification of the RLN was performed 
without IONM (Group A); and patients treated since 2021, when IONM was 
implemented in every surgical procedure on the thyroid (Group B). Intraoperative 
Neurophysiological Monitoring was performed by using corticobulbar motor-evoked 
potentials and continuous electromyography. Twentyfive children underwent 
thyroid resection, 19 (76%) of which due to thyroid carcinoma. Each patient's 
recurrent nerve was identified; IONM was used in 13 patients. In Group A, one 
temporary nerve palsy was identified postoperatively (8.3%), while in group B 
one nerve dysfunction occurred (7.7%). No statistically significant difference 
was found between the two groups in terms of post-operative RLN palsy. No 
surgical complication due to the use of IONM was reported. In children and 
teenagers, intraoperative neuromonitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is a 
safe and accurate method, minimizing the risk of nerve damage."
1437,"Transfusion exposure increases the risk of death in critically ill patients of 
all ages. This was thought to relate to co-morbidities in the transfusion 
recipient. However, donor characteristics are increasingly recognised as 
critical to transfusion recipient outcome with systematic reviews suggesting 
blood donor sex influences transfusion recipient health. Originally focusing on 
plasma and platelet transfusions, retrospective studies report greater risks of 
adverse outcomes such as transfusion related acute lung injury in those 
receiving products from female donors. There is increasing awareness that 
exposure to red blood cells (RBCs) poses a similar risk. Recent studies focusing 
on transfusion related outcomes in extremely preterm newborns report conflicting 
data on the association between blood donor sex and outcomes. Despite a renewed 
focus on lower versus higher transfusion thresholds in neonatal clinical 
practice, this group remain a heavily transfused population, receiving on 
average 3-5 RBC transfusions during their primary hospital admission. Therefore, 
evidence supporting a role for better donor selection could have a significant 
impact on clinical outcomes in this high-risk population. Here, we review the 
emerging evidence for an association between blood donor sex and clinical 
outcomes in extremely preterm newborns receiving one or more transfusions."
1438,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the neurodevelopmental outcome 
at 18-24 months in surviving preterm infants with grades I-IV intraventricular 
hemorrhages (IVHs) compared to those with no IVH.
STUDY DESIGN: We included preterm survivors &lt;29 weeks' GA admitted to the 
Canadian Neonatal Network's NICUs from April 2009 to September 2011 with 
follow-up data at 18-24 months in a retrospective cohort study. The neonates 
were grouped based on the severity of the IVH detected on a cranial ultrasound 
scan and recorded in the database: no IVH; subependymal hemorrhage or IVH 
without ventricular dilation (grades I-II); IVH with ventricular dilation (grade 
III); and persistent parenchymal echogenicity/lucency (grade IV). The primary 
outcomes of neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), significant neurodevelopmental 
impairment (sNDI), and the effect modification by other short-term neonatal 
morbidities were assessed. Using multivariable regression analysis, the adjusted 
ORs (AOR) and 95% of the CIs were calculated.
RESULTS: 2327 infants were included. The odds of NDI were higher in infants with 
grades III and IV IVHs (AOR 2.58, 95% CI 1.56, 4.28 and AOR 2.61, 95% CI 1.80, 
3.80, respectively) compared to those without IVH. Infants with an IVH grade ≤II 
had similar outcomes for NDI (AOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86, 1.35) compared to those 
without an IVH, but the odds of sNDI were higher (AOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16, 2.17).
CONCLUSIONS: There were increased odds of sNDI in infants with grades I-II IVHs, 
and an increased risk of adverse NDI in infants with grades ≥III IVHs is 
corroborated with the current literature."
1439,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The greatest anthropometric and physiological changes 
occur during adolescence. Assessment of growth patterns is necessary to prevent 
future health risks.
AIMS: To describe the values of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic (SBP) 
and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, triceps skinfold, and abdominal 
circumference according to gender and age (between 12 and 17 years), as well as 
explore the differences between body weight conditions.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out, including 4130 
adolescents between 12 and 17 years old. SBP and DBP, HbA1c, triceps skinfold, 
and abdominal circumference were evaluated.
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between males and females for 
HbA1c (p &lt; 0.001), SBP (p &lt; 0.001), triceps curl (p &lt; 0.001), and 
abdominal circumference (p &lt; 0.001), independently of the age group. 
Regardless of gender and age groups, significant differences were observed 
between overweight/obese and normal-weight adolescents in SBP (p &lt; 0.001), 
DBP (p &lt; 0.001 to 0.009), triceps skinfold (p &lt; 0.001), and abdominal 
perimeter (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed higher SBP, DBP, triceps skinfold, and 
abdominal circumference in overweight/obese adolescents compared to 
normal-weight adolescents in both genders."
1440,"The present case report features a highly uncommon form of a paediatric TCF3-HLF 
positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) relapse, an extramedullary, 
peripheral bone manifestation. Following complete remission, during the 
conditioning for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), our 
sixteen-year-old male patient complained of fever, pain and swelling of the 
right forearm. Radiography suggested acute osteomyelitis in the right ulna with 
subsequent surgical confirmation. Intraoperatively obtained debris culture grew 
Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter pittii. Measures taken to control the 
infection were deemed to be successful. However, after the completion of the 
otherwise uneventful HSCT, a very early medullary relapse was diagnosed. 
Revising the original surgical samples from the ulna, bone relapse of ALL was 
immunohistochemically confirmed. Reviewing the previous cases found in the 
literature, it is advised to consider uncommon forms of ALL relapse when 
encountering ambiguous cases of osteomyelitis or arthritis during haematological 
remission."
1441,"Severe acute behavioral and emotional problems represent one of the most serious 
treatment-related adverse effects for children and adolescents who have cancer. 
The critical and severe nature of these symptoms often makes necessary the use 
of psychotropic drugs. A working group composed of experts in multiple 
disciplines had the task of creating an agreement regarding a management plan 
for severe acute behavioral and emotional problems (SABEPs) in children and 
adolescents treated for cancer. To obtain global information on the use of 
psychotropic drugs in pediatric oncology, the working group first developed and 
mailed a 15-item questionnaire to many Italian pediatric oncology centers. 
Overall, an evident lack of knowledge and education regarding the use of 
psychotropic medications for the treatment of SABEPs was found. Thus, by 
referring to an adapted version of the Delphi method of consensus and standard 
methods for the elaboration of clinical questions (PICOs), the working group 
elaborated evidence-based recommendations for psychotropic drugs in the 
pediatric oncology setting. Furthermore, based on a thorough multivariate 
analysis of needs and difficulties, a comprehensive management flow was 
developed to optimize therapeutic interventions, which allows more accurate and 
efficient matching of the acute needs of patients while guiding treatment 
options."
1442,"The prognosis in children and adolescents with relapsed ALL, despite intensive 
therapy, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, is still 
challenging. This study aims to analyze the incidence of relapsed ALL and 
survival rates in correlation to the risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 125 pediatric patients with ALL diagnosed in our 
department between 2000-2018; age 1-18 years old (median 6.4); female 53.6% vs. 
male 46.4%.
RESULTS: 19 pts (15.2%) were diagnosed with a relapse. Three pts (15.8%) had 
been diagnosed with very early relapses (2/3 T-ALL), 12 pts (63.1%) as an early 
relapse, and 4 pts (21.1%) as a late relapse. Bone marrow was the most frequent 
relapses localization. The five-year survival has been achieved by six patients 
(31.6%). A significant difference was found in regard to the five-year overall 
survival and relapse type (p &lt; 0.05). The group with very early relapses 
(3/3; 100%) has not reached the five-year survival.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. The main prognostic factor in children's ALL relapses is still 
the time of the onset of the relapse. 2. The T lineage acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia is a worse prognostic factor. 3. The analysis of the above relapse risk 
factors alongside cytogenethic markers and flow cytometry or polymerase chain 
reaction minimal residual disease is very important for first-line chemotherapy 
improvement and a more personalized choice of therapy for ALL patients."
1443,"INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune 
disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. SLE 
disproportionately affects women and minorities. Childhood-onset SLE (cSLE) in 
particular tends to be more aggressive than adult-onset SLE. Despite substantial 
improvements in the treatment of cSLE, there is significant variability in 
treatment responses and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, there is a paucity of 
studies involving cSLE, and in particular, cSLE among different age groups. The 
aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that an early-onset cSLE cohort 
would demonstrate unique characteristics with distinctive clinical and 
laboratory features at disease onset. We specifically investigated whether 
clinical, epidemiological, or serological factors are differentially associated 
with early- and late-onset cSLE. This could have direct impact on clinical 
management with the goal of improving outcomes and quality of life for children 
with SLE.
METHODS: Our study was conducted at a large tertiary center. We included 213 
subjects seen at our pediatric rheumatology clinic aged 4-17 years. 
Epidemiologic, clinical phenotype, disease severity, serology, treatment, and 
outcome data were compared between subjects with cSLE onset prior to 10 years of 
age (early-onset disease, n = 43) and those with cSLE onset greater than 10 
years of age (peri-adolescent disease, n = 170). We compared clinical features 
between early- and peri-adolescent onset cSLE in order to investigate the 
association between age at disease onset of cSLE and clinical disease expression 
and outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 213 subjects with cSLE in our study, 43 subjects had early-onset 
disease (age 2 to ≤9 years) and 170 patients had peri-adolescent onset disease. 
We found that early-onset cSLE was associated with a higher prevalence of 
positive anti-dsDNA antibody at cSLE diagnosis, higher anti-dsDNA antibody titer 
at cSLE diagnosis, rash, and azathioprine use (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.004, p = 
0.011, and p = 0.008, respectively). In contrast, we found that peri-adolescent 
onset cSLE (≥10 years of age) was associated with worse disease activity (SLEDAI 
range 0-24) (p &lt; 0.001), higher SLICC at diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001), as well as 
a higher rate of mycophenolate mofetil and hydroxychloroquine use (p = 0.003 and 
p &lt; 0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in the 
prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms or the development of Class IV/Class V 
lupus nephritis between the early-onset and peri-adolescent groups."
1444,"Oral health is a likely source of health inequalities in children with special 
health care needs (CSHCN), according to multiple studies. This systematic review 
aimed to explore the evidence of family influence-as well as family features, 
such as societal variables and parents' perspectives-on these children's dental 
caries status. Embase, Ebsco, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were 
all searched. All cross-sectional research published on the variables of family 
impact ranging from 2010 to 2021 were considered. The DMFT and dmft index was 
utilised for the report data of dental caries, whereas the National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute (NHLBI) was used for the purposes of assessing quality. Of 
the 3861 records identified, 14 were eligible. Further, most of the studies had 
a caries prevalence of over 50%, (p-value &lt; 0.005). Family influences 
imparted a significant relationship and association towards the dental caries 
status of the demographic being studied. The influences on the children included 
tooth brushing behaviour, parents' education level, parents' occupation level, 
diet pattern, dental visit, snacking frequency, parents' psychological status, 
family size, and parents' knowledge towards oral health. Future research should 
further explore the family functioning domains, specifically among the CSHCN 
population. This study was registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42021274923."
1445,"The aim of this systematic review is to distinguish the clinical features of 
immunocompetent children with non-typhoid Salmonella spondylodiscitis and 
summarize the diagnosis, diagnostic tools, and treatment methods to guide 
clinicians. The review was conducted according to the preferred PRISMA 
guidelines. We conducted a literature search in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane 
Library databases. Article screening, data extraction, and study evaluation were 
performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 20 articles, published 
between 1977 and 2020, were selected, which included 21 patients with average 
age of 12.76 years (range, 2-18) without comorbidities; in total, 19% of the 
patients had positive blood cultures for non-typhoid Salmonella, and 80.9% 
underwent either CT-guided or open biopsy, which were positive for NTS. All 
infections were monomicrobial, and 11 different serotypes of non-typhoid 
Salmonella were identified. Analyzing the reviewed cases, 52.4% of the patients 
presented with fever, 90.5% had localized pain, and only 19% had 
gastroenteritis. The most common level of discitis was the lumbar region, 
especially the L4/L5 level. Primarily, third-generation cephalosporin was 
administered, and antibiotic treatment was given for an average of 9.6 weeks. 
Non-typhoid Salmonella spondylodiscitis is a rare clinical entity in healthy and 
immunocompetent children. The identification of the responsible organism is 
essential to guide antibiotic therapy and define the treatment duration. A 
significant limiting factor in this systematic review was the lack of published 
research articles and case series due to the rarity of the disease."
1446,"Current data support an increase in the prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP) 
in pediatric patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Adeno-tonsillectomy 
has been shown to be an effective treatment for most patients. Our objective was 
to determine the prevalence of HBP in pediatric patients with SDB and the impact 
of adeno-tonsillectomy with a multicenter, longitudinal, and prospective study 
that included 286 children referred for suspected SDB. The diagnosis of SDB was 
established by polysomnography (PSG) and the diagnosis of HBP by 24-h ambulatory 
blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). In patients without SDB and SDB without 
treatment indication, these tests were repeated six months after the baseline 
visit. For patients with medical treatment for SDB, the tests were repeated six 
months after the treatment initiation. Finally, in patients with surgery 
indication, ABPM was performed just before surgical treatment and ABPM and PSG 
six months after the intervention. The study contributes to elucidating the 
association between SDB and HBP in pediatric patients. Moreover, it contributes 
to determining if intervention with adeno-tonsillectomy is associated with BP 
reduction. The results have direct implications for the management of SDB, 
providing essential information on treatment indications for existing clinical 
guidelines. NCT03696654."
1447,"BACKGROUND: To compare chest compression (CC) rates of 90/min with 180/min and 
their effect on the time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival, 
hemodynamic, and respiratory parameters. We hypothesized that asphyxiated 
newborn piglets that received CC at 180/min vs. 90/min during cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation would have a shorter time to ROSC.
METHODS: Newborn piglets (n = 7/group) were anesthetized, intubated, 
instrumented and exposed to 45 min normocapnic hypoxia followed by asphyxia and 
cardiac arrest. Piglets were randomly allocated to a CC rate of 180/min or 
90/min. CC was performed using an automated chest compression machine using CC 
superimposed with sustained inflation. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters 
and applied compression force were continuously measured.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) time to ROSC was 91 (34) and 256 (97) s for CC rates of 
180/min and 90/min, respectively (p = 0.08). The number of piglets that achieved 
ROSC was 7 (100%) and 5 (71%) with 180/min and 90/min CC rates, respectively (p 
= 0.46). Hemodynamic parameters (i.e., diastolic and mean blood pressure, 
carotid blood flow, stroke volume, end-diastolic volume, left ventricular 
contractile function) and respiratory parameters (i.e., minute ventilation, peak 
inflation and peak expiration flow) were all improved with a CC rate of 180/min.
CONCLUSION: Time to ROSC and hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were not 
statistical significant different between CC rates of 90/min and 180/min. Higher 
CC rates during neonatal resuscitation warrant further investigation."
1448,"PURPOSE: Infants who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy 
have an increased risk of neurological complications and mortality. 
Microvascular imaging (MVI) is an advanced Doppler technique that allows 
high-resolution visualization of microvasculature in the brain. We describe the 
feasibility and utility of MVI for the evaluation of cerebral microvascular 
perfusion in patients undergoing ECMO.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed brain MVI scans of neonates undergoing 
ECMO. Two pediatric radiologists qualitatively assessed MVI scans to determine 
the presence or absence of tortuosity, symmetry, heterogeneity, engorgement, and 
hypoperfusion of the basal ganglia-thalamus (BGT) region, as well as the 
presence or absence of white matter vascular engorgement and increased 
peri-gyral flow in the cortex. We tested the association between the presence of 
the aforementioned brain MVI features and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We included 30 patients, 14 of which were male (46.7%). The time of 
ECMO duration was 11.8 ± 6.9 days. The most prevalent microvascular finding in 
BGT was lenticulostriate vessel tortuosity (26/30, 86.7%), and the most common 
microvascular finding in the cortex was increased peri-gyral flow (10/24, 
41.7%). Cortical white matter vascular engorgement was significantly associated 
with the presence of any poor outcome as defined by death, seizure, and/or 
cerebrovascular events on magnetic resonance imaging (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: MVI is a feasible modality to evaluate cerebral perfusion in infants 
undergoing ECMO. Additionally, evidence of white matter vascular engorgement 
after ECMO cannulation could serve as a predictor of poor outcomes in this 
population."
1449,"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and angiography have a crucial role in the 
diagnostic evaluation and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with 
congenital heart disease. Although much of the information required of advanced 
imaging studies can be provided by standard gadolinium-enhanced magnetic 
resonance imaging, the limitations of precise bolus timing, long scan duration, 
complex imaging protocols, and the need to image small structures limit more 
widespread use of this modality. Recent experience with off-label diagnostic use 
of ferumoxytol has helped to mitigate some of these barriers. Approved by the 
U.S. FDA for intravenous treatment of anemia, ferumoxytol is an ultrasmall 
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle that has a long blood pool residence 
time and high relaxivity. Once metabolized by macrophages, the iron core is 
incorporated into the reticuloendothelial system. In this work, we aim to 
summarize the evolution of ferumoxytol-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic 
resonance imaging and angiography and highlight its many applications for 
congenital heart disease."
1450,"BACKGROUND: The paediatric massive transfusion protocol (MTP) is activated in 
the paediatric population for both trauma and non-trauma related indications. 
While it helps to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the delivery of blood 
products, it can also result in increased wastage. We aimed to evaluate the 
wastage rates from our paediatric MTP activations from 2013 to 2018.
METHOD: As part of an audit, we retrospectively reviewed the records of the 
paediatric patients who had MTP activations. We collected the following data: 
reason for MTP activation, weight of patient, number of cycles of MTP required, 
blood products used, blood products wasted, deviation from our institution's 
recommended MTP blood product ratio, and reason for wastage.
RESULT: We had 26 paediatric MTP activations within the audit period. There was 
an overall wastage rate of 1.5%, with wastage occurring in 3 out of 26 patients. 
The reason for all wastage was demise of the patient. Most patients' transfusion 
ratios deviated from our institution's MTP protocol.
CONCLUSION: Our wastage rates are low likely because of clear MTP activation 
guidelines and a flexible MTP workflow."
1451,"Emergency Radiology is a unique branch of imaging, as rapidity in the diagnosis 
and management of different pathologies is essential to saving patients' lives. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many potential applications in emergency 
radiology: firstly, image acquisition can be facilitated by reducing acquisition 
times through automatic positioning and minimizing artifacts with AI-based 
reconstruction systems to optimize image quality, even in critical patients; 
secondly, it enables an efficient workflow (AI algorithms integrated with 
RIS-PACS workflow), by analyzing the characteristics and images of patients, 
detecting high-priority examinations and patients with emergent critical 
findings. Different machine and deep learning algorithms have been trained for 
the automated detection of different types of emergency disorders (e.g., 
intracranial hemorrhage, bone fractures, pneumonia), to help radiologists to 
detect relevant findings. AI-based smart reporting, summarizing patients' 
clinical data, and analyzing the grading of the imaging abnormalities, can 
provide an objective indicator of the disease's severity, resulting in quick and 
optimized treatment planning. In this review, we provide an overview of the 
different AI tools available in emergency radiology, to keep radiologists up to 
date on the current technological evolution in this field."
1452,"Neuroblastic tumors (NTs) represent the most common extracranial neoplasm 
occurring in childhood. Although ganglioneuroblastoma intermixed (GNBI) and 
ganglioneuroma (GN) are classified as very low-risk tumors, neuroblastoma (NB) 
and ganglioneuroblastoma-nodular (GNBN) may represent a serious risk to 
survival. Unfortunately, areas of GNBI and GNBN can coexist in the same mass, 
leading to incorrect risk staging when only biopsy is performed. Herein, we 
describe a case of multifocal NT (thoracic and abdominal localization) occurring 
in a 4-year-old male. Different histological subtypes, namely GNBI and GNBN, 
were revealed in the two lesions. We focus on the difficulties of proper 
diagnosis and risk stratification, underlining the usefulness of several 
diagnostic tools for appropriate management and therapeutic choices."
1453,"Amiodarone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic drug, with proven efficacy in 
prevention and treatment of numerous arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation 
especially, or ventricular arrhythmias, with a long half-life (55-60 days). The 
increased risk of developing amiodarone-induced pulmonary fibrosis is directly 
related to the dose and the duration of the intake. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary 
toxicity is conditioned by dose, patient's age, and pre-existent pulmonary 
pathologies. The pattern for drug-induced lung injury may vary in many forms, 
but the amiodarone can cause polymorphous injuries such as diffuse alveolar 
damage, chronical interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary 
hemorrhage, lung nodules or pleural disease. The pathological mechanism of 
pulmonary injury induced by amiodarone consists of the accumulation of 
phospholipid complexes in histocytes and type II pneumocytes. Differential 
diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis induced by amiodarone is made mainly with 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, left ventricular failure or infectious disease. 
Before starting treatment with amiodarone, patients should be informed of 
potential adverse effects and any new respiratory symptoms should promptly be 
reported to their family physician or attending physician. The assessment 
carried out at the initiation of amiodarone treatment should include at least 
chest X-ray and respiratory function tests and extrapulmonary evaluation."
1454,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) correlates with the 
prevalence of hypertension (HT). We studied the prevalence and predictors of CKD 
in a representative sample of the Romanian adult population.
METHODS: A sample of 1470 subjects were enrolled in the SEPHAR IV (Study for the 
Evaluation of Prevalence of Hypertension and Cardiovascular Risk) survey. All 
subjects were evaluated for blood pressure (BP) and extensive evaluations of 
target organ damage, blood, and urine samples were undertaken.
RESULTS: A total of 883 subjects were included in the statistical analysis. 
Those experiencing CKD with an eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were older at 71.94 ± 
7.4 years (n = 19, 2.15%) compared with those without renal impairment at 50.3 ± 
16.21 years (n = 864, 97.85%), p &lt; 0.0001. The prevalence of CKD among 
hypertensives (379 from 883) was 4.49% (17/379), while 17 out of 19 subjects 
with CKD had HT (89.47%). After adjusting for age, sex, and diabetic status, 
only serum uric acid (SUR) &gt; 6.9 mg/dL (OR: 6.61; 95% CI: 2.063, 10.83; p = 
0.004) was an independent risk factor and a predictor of CKD.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CKD in hypertensive Romanian adults was more than 
ten times higher than in the normotensive population. Levels of SUR &gt; 6.9 
mg/dL were predictors of CKD."
1455,"Digital hemoglobinometers have been used as point-of-care tests (POCT) to 
estimate the burden of anemia in community-based studies and national-level 
surveys in India. As the accuracy of hemoglobin estimated in POCT varies, there 
is a need for adjustments to the POCT-hemoglobin to ensure they are closer to 
reality and are comparable. We used data (collected between 2016 and 2020) (N = 
1145) from four studies from India: three among pregnant women and 
6-59-month-old children from Haryana and the fourth from a national nutritional 
survey among 1-19-year-old children. We compared the same individuals' 
POCT-hemoglobin (capillary blood) and automated hematology analyzers (AHA) 
hemoglobin (venous blood) and developed a predictive linear regression model to 
obtain the correction equation for POCT-hemoglobin. We analyzed paired data from 
1145 participants. The correction equation for obtaining the true hemoglobin 
value = 3.35 + 0.71 × POCT-hemoglobin using capillary blood (adjusted R2-64.4% 
and mean squared error -0.841 g/dL). In comparison with the AHA-hemoglobin, the 
mean difference of POCT-hemoglobin was 0.2 g/dL, while with the predicted Hb 
obtained from the correction equation it was 0.01 g/dL. The correction equation 
was the first attempt at deriving the true hemoglobin values from the POCTs. 
There is a need for multi-country collaborative studies to improve the 
correction equation by adjusting for factors affecting hemoglobin estimation."
1456,"The quantitative prediction of the SYNTAX score for cardiovascular artery 
disease patients using the inverse problem algorithm (IPA) technique in 
artificial intelligence was explored in this study. A 29-term semi-empirical 
formula was defined according to seven risk factors: (1) age, (2) mean arterial 
pressure, (3) body surface area, (4) pre-prandial blood glucose, (5) 
low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, (6) Troponin I, and (7) C-reactive protein. 
Then, the formula was computed via the STATISTICA 7.0 program to obtain a 
compromised solution for a 405-patient dataset with a specific loss function 
[actual-predicted]2 as low as 3.177, whereas 0.0 implies a 100% match between 
the prediction and observation via ""the lower, the better"" principle. The IPA 
technique first created a data matrix [405 × 29] from the included patients' 
data and then attempted to derive a compromised solution of the column matrix of 
29-term coefficients [29 × 1]. The correlation coefficient, r2, of the 
regression line for the actual versus predicted SYNTAX score was 0.8958, showing 
a high coincidence among the dataset. The follow-up verification based on 
another 105 patients' data from the same group also had a high correlation 
coefficient of r2 = 0.8304. Nevertheless, the verified group's low derived 
average AT (agreement) (ATavg = 0.308 ± 0.193) also revealed a slight deviation 
between the theoretical prediction from the STATISTICA 7.0 program and the 
grades assigned by clinical cardiologists or interventionists. The predicted 
SYNTAX scores were compared with earlier reported findings based on a 
single-factor statistical analysis or scanned images obtained by sonography or 
cardiac catheterization. Cardiologists can obtain the SYNTAX score from the 
semi-empirical formula for an instant referral before performing a cardiac 
examination."
1457,"Over the last decades, individualized approaches and a better understanding of 
coagulopathy complexity in end-stage liver disease (ESLD) patients has evolved. 
The risk of both thrombosis and bleeding during minimally invasive interventions 
or surgery is associated with a worse outcome in this patient population. 
Despite deranged quantitative and qualitative coagulation laboratory parameters, 
prophylactic coagulation management is unnecessary for patients who do not 
bleed. Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) and blood products carries 
independent risks for morbidity and mortality, including modulation of the 
immune system with increased risk for nosocomial infections. Optimal coagulation 
management in these complex patients should be based on the analysis of standard 
coagulation tests (SCTs) and viscoelastic tests (VETs). VETs represent an 
individualized approach to patients and can provide information about 
coagulation dynamics in a concise period of time. This narrative review will 
deliver the pathophysiology of deranged hemostasis in ESLD, explore the 
difficulties of evaluating the coagulopathies in liver disease patients, and 
examine the use of VET assays and management of coagulopathy using coagulation 
factors. Methods: A selective literature search with PubMed as the central 
database was performed with the following."
1458,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) frequently leads to post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) 
which is challenging to predict and prevent. Identifying those at high risk of 
developing PTS may help to focus preventative strategies. Adults were recruited 
within 3 months of DVT diagnosis. Blood was sampled during the therapeutic 
anticoagulation phase. Overall hemostatic potential (OHP) assay, a 
spectrophotometric assay, was performed on platelet-poor plasma (PPP). In this 
assay, fibrin formation is triggered by small amounts of thrombin and termed the 
overall coagulation potential (OCP). Simultaneously, thrombin and tissue 
plasminogen activator are added to PPP and the resulting fibrin aggregation 
curve is the overall hemostatic potential (OHP). Fibrinolysis is expressed by 
the parameter overall fibrinolytic potential (OFP%). Patients were followed up 
at regular intervals. PTS was diagnosed if the Villalta score was ≥5 at least 3 
months after the DVT diagnosis. Results were obtained from 190 patients (53.7% 
male, mean age 56.9 years). PTS developed in 62 (32.6%) patients. Patients with 
PTS displayed significantly higher median OCP (45.8 vs. 38.8 units, p = 0.010), 
OHP (12.8 vs. 9.2 units, p = 0.005) and significantly lower OFP (74.1 vs. 75.6%, 
p = 0.050). PTS patients had higher neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios (NLR) (2.3 vs. 
1.9, p = 0.007). After multivariate analysis, proximal DVT location, history of 
varicose veins, NLR ≥ 2.6, OHP &gt; 13.0 units and weight &gt;108 kg were 
independent predictors for PTS. The c-statistic of the multivariate model was 
0.77. This pilot study suggests that OHP testing while patients are still 
anticoagulated may assist in the prediction of PTS development and could assist 
in prognostication and targeting of preventative measures. However, larger 
prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."
1459,"The aim of this study was to explore the proof of concept for using Raman 
spectroscopy as a diagnostic platform in the setting of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). We sought to identify unique Raman signatures in serum 
blood samples to successfully segregate SLE patients from healthy controls (HC). 
In addition, a retrospective audit was undertaken to assess the clinical utility 
of current testing platforms used to detect anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) 
antibodies (n = 600). We examined 234 Raman spectra to investigate key variances 
between SLE patients (n = 8) and HC (n = 4). Multi-variant analysis and 
classification model construction was achieved using principal component 
analysis (PCA), PCA-linear discriminant analysis and partial least 
squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). We achieved the successful segregation 
of Raman spectra from SLE patients and healthy controls (p-value &lt; 0.0001). 
Classification models built using PLS-DA demonstrated outstanding performance 
characteristics with 99% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Twelve 
statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.001) wavenumbers were identified as 
potential diagnostic spectral markers. Molecular assignments related to proteins 
and DNA demonstrated significant Raman intensity changes between SLE and HC 
groups. These wavenumbers may serve as future biomarkers and offer further 
insight into the pathogenesis of SLE. Our audit confirmed previously reported 
inconsistencies between two key methodologies used to detect anti-dsDNA, 
highlighting the need for improved laboratory testing for SLE. Raman 
spectroscopy has demonstrated powerful performance characteristics in this 
proof-of-concept study, setting the foundations for future translation into the 
clinical setting."
1460,"The aim of this study was to provide prediction models for masked uncontrolled 
hypertension (MUCH) detected by ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring in an 
Italian population. We studied 738 treated hypertensive patients with normal 
clinic BPs classified as having controlled hypertension (CH) or MUCH if their 
daytime BP was &lt; or ≥135/85 mmHg regardless of nighttime BP, respectively, or 
CH or MUCH if their 24-h BP was &lt; or ≥130/80 mmHg regardless of daytime or 
nighttime BP, respectively. We detected 215 (29%) and 275 (37%) patients with 
MUCH using daytime and 24-h BP thresholds, respectively. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis showed that males, those with a smoking habit, left 
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and a clinic systolic BP between 130-139 mmHg 
and/or clinic diastolic BP between 85-89 mmHg were associated with MUCH. The 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed good accuracy at 
0.78 (95% CI 0.75-0.81, p &lt; 0.0001) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.80, p &lt; 
0.0001) for MUCH defined by daytime and 24 h BP, respectively. Internal 
validation suggested a good predictive performance of the models. Males, those 
with a smoking habit, LVH, and high-normal clinic BP are indicators of MUCH and 
models including these factors provide good diagnostic accuracy in identifying 
this ambulatory BP phenotype."
1461,"We aimed at evaluating the prognostic capacity of the inflammatory indices 
derived from routine complete blood cell counts in two groups of patients with 
acute pancreatitis from two different time periods, before and during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, when a high incidence of complications with surgical risk and 
mortality was found. Two new markers were introduced: the mean corpuscular 
volume to lymphocyte ratio (MCVL) and the cumulative inflammatory index (IIC), 
which were calculated at a baseline in the two groups of patients. Of the 
already established markers, none of them managed to effectively predict the 
complications with surgical risk and mortality, with a decrease of less than 50% 
in specificity in the peri-COVID group. The MCVL had the best prediction of 
complications with surgical risk in both the pre-COVID and peri-COVID groups, 
validated it as an independent factor by multivariate analysis. The IIC had the 
best prediction of mortality in both periods and was proven to be an independent 
factor by multivariate analysis. As the IIC predicted death best, we tested the 
occurrence of death and found that patients with PA who had an IIC &gt; 12.12 
presented a risk of death 4.08 times higher in the pre-COVID group and 3.33 
times higher in the peri-COVID group. The new MCVL and IIC independent markers 
had a superior sensitivity and specificity in predicting surgical risk 
complications and, respectively, mortality in the group of patients with acute 
pancreatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic, which makes them widely applicable in 
populations with modified immune and inflammatory status. Conclusions: In 
patients with acute pancreatitis, MCVL has a significant predictive value 
regarding complications with surgical risk (abscess, necrosis, and pseudocyst), 
and the IIC has a significant predictive value for mortality."
1462,"Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. gallolyticus) has been linked to the development 
of infections in adults; however, in neonates S. gallolyticus sepsis is very 
rare and resembles Group B Streptococcal infections. In this case report, we 
present the case of a full-term neonate who developed early-onset sepsis due to 
S. gallolyticus. A systematic review of the literature was also conducted. The 
neonate had good APGAR scores at 1' and 5'. At 5 h postnatally, the neonate 
developed poor feeding and respiratory distress. She received oxygen in a head 
box, and a complete blood count and biochemistry, blood, CSF and body surface 
cultures were obtained. Empiric intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin and 
tobramycin) were initiated, and she was transferred to a tertiary NICU for 
further treatment. The neonate was mechanically ventilated and received dopamine 
and colloid fluids for circulatory support. A cardiology consultation revealed 
pulmonary hypertension on day one. S. gallolyticus was isolated in the blood 
culture. Central nervous system ultrasonography, brainstem auditory evoked 
potentials, and a second cardiology evaluation were normal on day three. 
Clinical and laboratory improvement was noted on day three, and the baby was 
discharged after a 12-day hospitalization. Follow-up visits were scheduled for 
reevaluation."
1463,"We conducted a two-phase study to test the reliability and usability of an 
all-in-one artificial intelligence-based device (ButterfLife), which allows 
simultaneous monitoring of five vital signs. The first phase of the study aimed 
to test the agreement between measurements performed with ButterfLife vs. 
standard of care (SoC) in 42 hospitalized patients affected by acute respiratory 
failure. In this setting, the greatest discordance between ButterfLife and SoC 
was in respiratory rate (mean difference -4.69 bpm). Significantly close 
correlations were observed for all parameters except diastolic blood pressure 
and oxygen saturation (Spearman's Rho -0.18 mmHg; p = 0.33 and 0.20%; p = 0.24, 
respectively). The second phase of the study was conducted on eight 
poly-comorbid patients using ButterfLife at home, to evaluate the number of 
clinical conditions detected, as well as the patients' compliance and 
satisfaction. The average proportion of performed tests compared with the 
scheduled number was 67.4%, and no patients reported difficulties with use. 
Seven conditions requiring medical attention were identified, with a sensitivity 
of 100% and specificity of 88.9%. The median patient satisfaction was 9.5/10. In 
conclusion, ButterfLife proved to be a reliable and easy-to-use device, capable 
of simultaneously assessing five vital signs in both hospital and home settings."
1464,"Background: The incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has 
increased in recent years in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). C. 
difficile is a toxin-producing bacterium, and CDI results in the worsening of 
underlying IBD, increasing the risk of IBD treatment failure, surgery, and 
hospitalization. Because the symptoms of CDI overlap with those of IBD, it is 
challenging to make a differential diagnosis. Therefore, early, rapid, and 
reliable diagnostic tools that can identify CDI in IBD patients would be 
valuable to clinicians. Methods: This study retrospectively collected 135 
patients with IBD. Among them, 44 patients were diagnosed with CDI, and 42 
patients were diagnosed with viral or fungal infections. A total of 49 patients 
without infections were defined as the control group. The diagnostic values of 
procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell (WBC) count 
in the peripheral blood were examined. Results: In this study, PCT levels were 
significantly higher in patients with CDI than in non-CDI patients (including 
patients with viral/fungal infections and the control group; p &lt; 0.001 and p 
&lt; 0.05, respectively). CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with 
CDI than in non-CDI patients (p &lt; 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of 
PCT and WBC count were compared using DeLong's test: the AUCs of PCT vs. CRP for 
the detection of the IBD-CDI group and the control group was 0.826 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.743-0.909] vs. 0.663 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.551-0.774] (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. WBC count was inferior as a diagnostic 
tool for CDI. The sensitivity was 59.09% (95% CI: 43.2% to 73.7%), the 
specificity was 89.80% (95% CI: 77.8% to 96.6%), and the positive likelihood 
ratio LR (+) was 5.79 for PCT for the diagnosis of CDI. Conclusions: The present 
study demonstrates the superiority of PCT over CRP and WBC count for the rapid 
diagnosis of CDI in IBD patients."
1465,"The MNS7 (Mia) blood group antigen is found at a different prevalence among 
different ethnic groups. Anti-Mia can cause hemolytic disease of the fetus and 
newborn (HDFN) and both acute- and delayed-type hemolytic transfusion reactions 
(HTR). Mia typing should be performed in donors to prevent life-threatening 
hemolytic transfusion reactions. The gel card and standard tube methods still 
need specialized equipment, centrifugation, and expertise for result 
interpretation. We used a novel paper-based analytical device (PAD) pre-coated 
with monoclonal IgM anti-Mia for Mia phenotyping. We measured grey pixel 
intensity in blood typing results for interpretation processing using OpenCV at 
the sample (SP) and elution parts (EP); furthermore, we used the SP: EP ratio 
and F-score as analysis criteria. We typed 214 blood EDTA samples with PAD-Mia 
and then compared with gel card results for setting an analysis criterion. We 
observed 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy when we applied the SP: EP 
ratio and F-score with the optimal criterion (1.07 and 0.17 for SP: EP ratio and 
F-score, respectively). The validation of PAD-Mia typing for blood donor samples 
(n = 150) via F-score gave 100% sensitivity and specificity when compared with 
the gel card method; therefore, we argue that PAD-Mia typing can be used for Mia 
phenotyping without sero-centrifugation. Moreover, to study the correlation 
between genotype and phenotype, PCR-SSP was performed to identify GYP(B-A-B) 
hybrids. The results revealed that all Mia+ blood samples gave a positive with 
GP. Hut, GP. HF, GP. Mur, GP. Hop, and GP. Bun. Results of the gel card method 
and PCR-SSP were concordant. Hence, using PAD-Mia typing in blood donors would 
be helpful for creating a phenotype database of blood donors for reducing 
alloimmunization risks."
1466,"BACKGROUND: The term ""bacterial translocation"" (BT) refers to the migration of 
bacteria or their products from the gastrointestinal tract to tissues located 
outside it, and may occur after intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. The term 
""endotoxin"" is synonymous, and is used interchangeably with the term 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS, a component of Gram-negative gut bacteria, is a 
potent microbial virulence factor, that can trigger production of 
pro-inflammatory mediators, causing localized and systemic inflammation. The aim 
of this study is to investigate if neonatal asphyxia provokes BT and an 
increased concentration of LPS in an animal model of asphyxia in piglets.
METHODS: Twenty-one (21) newborn male Landrace/Large White piglets, 1-4 days 
old, were randomly allocated into three groups, Control (A), Asphyxia (B) and 
Asphyxia-Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) (C). All animals were instrumented, 
anesthetized and underwent hemodynamic monitoring. In Group A, the animals were 
euthanized. In Group B, the endotracheal tube was occluded to cause asphyxia 
leading to cardiopulmonary arrest. In Group C, the animals were resuscitated 
after asphyxia and further monitored for 30'. Bacterial translocation was 
assessed by the measurement of endotoxin in blood from the portal vein and the 
aorta, and also by the measurement of endotoxin in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) 
at euthanasia. The results are given as median (IQR) with LPS concentration in 
EU/mL.
RESULTS: BT was observed in all groups with minimum LPS concentration in the MLN 
and maximum concentration in the portal vein. LPS levels in the MLNs were higher 
in the Group B: 6.38 EU/mL (2.69-9.34) compared to the other groups (Group A: 
2.1 EU/mL (1.08-2.52), Group C: 1.66 EU/mL (1.51-2.48), p = 0.012). The aorta to 
MLNs LPS difference (%) was lower in Group B: 0.13% (0.04-1.17), compared to 
Group A: 5.08% (2.2-10.7), and Group C: 3.42% (1.5-5.1)) (p = 0.042). The same 
was detected for portal to MLNs LPS difference (%) which was lower in Group B: 
0.94% (0.5-3) compared to Group A: 4.9% (4-15), and Group C: 3.85% (1.5-5.1)) (p 
= 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal asphyxia can provoke ΒΤ and increased LPS concentration in 
blood and tissue located outside the gastrointestinal system."
1467,"The goal of this study was to identify the pathogenic gene variants in patients 
with odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia syndrome (OODD) or nonsyndromic tooth 
agenesis. Four unrelated individuals with tooth agenesis and their available 
family members were recruited. Peripheral blood was collected from four probands 
and five family members. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were 
used to identify the pathogenic gene variants. The harmfulness of these 
variations was predicted by bioinformatics. We identified four biallelic 
variants of the WNT10A gene in four patients, respectively: the proband#660: 
c.1176C &gt; A (p.Cys392*) and c.812G &gt; A (p.Cys271Tyr); the proband#681: 
c.637G &gt; A (p.Gly213Ser) and c.985C &gt; T (p.Arg329*); the proband#829: 
c.511C &gt; T (p.Arg171Cys) and c.637G &gt; A (p.Gly213Ser); and the 
proband#338: c.926A&gt; G (p.Gln309Arg) and c.511C &gt; T (p.Arg171Cys). Among 
them, two variants (c.812G &gt; A; p.Cys271Tyr and c.985C &gt; T; p.Arg329*) 
were previously unreported. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the 
pathogenicity of these six variants was different. Tertiary structure analysis 
showed that these variants were predicted to cause structural damage to the 
WNT10A protein. Genotype-phenotype analysis showed that the biallelic variants 
with more harmful effects, such as nonsense variants, caused OODD syndrome (#660 
Ⅱ-1) or severe nonsyndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) (#681 Ⅱ-1); the biallelic 
variants with less harmful effects, such as missense variants, caused a mild 
form of NSTA (#829 Ⅱ-2 and #338 Ⅱ-1). Individuals with a heterozygous variant 
presented a mild form of NSTA or a normal state. Our results further suggest the 
existence of the dose dependence of WNT10A pathogenicity on the tooth agenesis 
pattern, which broadens the variation spectrum and phenotype spectrum of WNT10A 
and could help with clinical diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling."
1468,"(1) Background: The aim of this study was to produce in-house ELISAs which can 
be used to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels directed against the 
spike protein (S), the S1 subunit of S and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of 
S in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated and infected humans. (2) Methods: Three in-house 
ELISAs were developed by using recombinant proteins of SARS-CoV-2, namely the S, 
S1 and RBD proteins. Specificity and sensitivity evaluations of these tests were 
performed using sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected (n = 70) and SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated 
(n = 222; CoronaVac vaccine) humans in Istanbul, Turkey. The analyses for the 
presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were performed using the in-house 
ELISAs, a commercial ELISA (Abbott) and a commercial surrogate virus 
neutralization test (sVNT). We also analyzed archival human sera (n = 50) 
collected before the emergence of COVID-19 cases in Turkey. (3) Results: The 
sensitivity of the in-house S, S1 and RBD ELISAs was found to be 88.44, 90.17 
and 95.38%, while the specificity was 72.27, 89.08 and 89.92%, respectively, 
when compared to the commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody test kit. The area under 
curve (AUC) values were 0.777 for the in-house S ELISA, 0.926 for the S1 ELISA, 
and 0.959 for the RBD ELISA. The kappa values were 0.62, 0.79 and 0.86 for the 
S, S1 and RBD ELISAs, respectively. (4) Conclusions: The in-house S1 and RBD 
ELISAs developed in this study have acceptable performance characteristics in 
terms of sensitivity, specificity, AUC and kappa values. In particular, the RBD 
ELISA seems viable to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels, both in 
infected and vaccinated people, and help mitigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and 
spread."
1469,"Schistosoma mekongi, a blood fluke that causes Asian zoonotic schistosomiasis, 
is distributed in communities along the Mekong River in Cambodia and Lao 
People's Democratic Republic. Decades of employing numerous control measures 
including mass drug administration using praziquantel have resulted in a decline 
in the prevalence of schistosomiasis mekongi. This, however, led to a decrease 
in sensitivity of Kato-Katz stool microscopy considered as the gold standard in 
diagnosis. In order to develop a serological assay with high sensitivity and 
specificity which can replace Kato-Katz, recombinant S. mekongi thioredoxin 
peroxidase-1 protein (rSmekTPx-1) was expressed and produced. Diagnostic 
performance of the rSmekTPx-1 antigen through ELISA for detecting human 
schistosomiasis was compared with that of recombinant protein of S. japonicum 
TPx-1 (rSjTPx-1) using serum samples collected from endemic foci in Cambodia. 
The sensitivity and specificity of rSmekTPx-1 in ELISA were 89.3% and 93.3%, 
respectively, while those of rSjTPx-1 were 71.4% and 66.7%, respectively. In 
addition, a higher Kappa value of 0.82 calculated between rSmekTPx-1 antigen 
ELISA and Kato-Katz confirmed better agreement than between rSjTPx-1 antigen 
ELISA and Kato-Katz (Kappa value 0.38). These results suggest that ELISA with 
rSmekTPx-1 antigen can be a potential diagnostic method for detecting active 
human S. mekongi infection."
1470,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the incidence of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccine-related hypermetabolic 
lymphadenopathy (HLA) and evaluate which time point produces the least number of 
false-positive findings in an 18F-2-Fluor-2-desoxy-D-glucose positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT).
METHODS: For this retrospective, multi-center imaging study, patients with any 
form of SARS-CoV2 vaccination prior to an 18F-FDG-PET/CT were included between 
January 2021 and December 2021. Patients were divided into six groups according 
to the time point of vaccination prior to their 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging, e.g., 
group one (0-6 days) and group six (35-80 days). As the reference standards, the 
SUVmax of the mediastinal blood pool (MBP) and the SUVmax contralateral 
reference lymph node (RL) were determined. (A) The absolute SUVmax of HLA, (B) 
the ratio of SUVmaxHLA/SUVmax mediastinal blood pool (rHLA/MBP), (C) the ratio 
SUVmax HLA vs. SUVmax contralateral reference lymph node (rHLA/RL), (D) and the 
incidence of HLA defined as rHLA/MBP &gt; 1.5 were assessed.
RESULTS: Group one (days 0-6) showed the highest incidence of HLA 16/23 (70%) 
and rHLA/MBP (2.58 ± 2.1). All three parameters for HLA reduced statistically 
significantly in the comparison of Groups 1-3 (days 0-20) versus Groups 4-6 
(days 21-80) (p-values &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: If feasible, an FDG PET should be postponed by at least 3 weeks 
after SARS-CoV2 vaccination, especially if an accurate evaluation of axillary 
status is required."
1471,"Blood glucose stability in diabetic patients determines the degree of health, 
and changes in blood glucose levels are related to the outcome of diabetic 
patients. Therefore, accurate monitoring of blood glucose has a crucial role in 
controlling diabetes. Aiming at the problem of high volatility of blood glucose 
concentration in diabetic patients and the limitations of a single regression 
prediction model, this paper proposes a method for predicting blood glucose 
values based on particle swarm optimization and model fusion. First, the Kalman 
filtering algorithm is used to smooth and reduce the noise of the sensor current 
signal to reduce the effect of noise on the data. Then, the hyperparameter 
optimization of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting 
Machine (LightGBM) models is performed using particle swarm optimization 
algorithm. Finally, the XGBoost and LightGBM models are used as the base learner 
and the Bayesian regression model as the meta-learner, and the stacking model 
fusion method is used to achieve the prediction of blood glucose values. In 
order to prove the effectiveness and superiority of the method in this paper, we 
compared the prediction results of stacking fusion model with other 6 models. 
The experimental results show that the stacking fusion model proposed in this 
paper can accurately predict blood glucose values, and the average absolute 
percentage error of blood glucose prediction is 13.01%, and the prediction error 
of the stacking fusion model is much lower than that of the other six models. 
Therefore, the proposed diabetes blood glucose prediction method in this paper 
has superiority."
1472,"Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) is a safe, non-invasive, and affordable primary 
screening tool to identify the vascular risk factors of stroke. The overall 
process of DUS examination involves a series of complex processes, such as 
identifying blood vessels, capturing the images of blood vessels, measuring the 
velocity of blood flow, and then physicians, according to the above information, 
determining the severity of artery stenosis for generating final ultrasound 
reports. Generation of transcranial doppler (TCD) and extracranial carotid 
doppler (ECCD) ultrasound reports involves a lot of manual review processes, 
which is time-consuming and makes it easy to make errors. Accurate 
classification of the severity of artery stenosis can provide an early 
opportunity for decision-making regarding the treatment of artery stenosis. 
Therefore, machine learning models were developed and validated for classifying 
artery stenosis severity based on hemodynamic features. This study collected 
data from all available cases and controlled at one academic teaching hospital 
in Taiwan between 1 June 2020, and 30 June 2020, from a university teaching 
hospital and reviewed all patients' medical records. Supervised machine learning 
models were developed to classify the severity of artery stenosis. The receiver 
operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive 
and negative predictive value were used for model performance evaluation. The 
performance of the random forest model was better compared to the logistic 
regression model. For ECCD reports, the accuracy of the random forest model to 
predict stenosis in various sites was between 0.85 and 1. For TCD reports, the 
overall accuracy of the random forest model to predict stenosis in various sites 
was between 0.67 and 0.86. The findings of our study suggest that a machine 
learning-based model accurately classifies artery stenosis, which indicates that 
the model has enormous potential to facilitate screening for artery stenosis."
1473,"The evacuation of a chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common 
procedures in neurosurgery. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of 
drainage suction in the surgical treatment of cSDH on the recurrence rate. Post 
hoc analysis was conducted on two randomized controlled trials (cSDH-Drain-Trial 
and TOSCAN trial) stratifying a total of 581 patients into active or passive 
drain type. Of the 581 patients, 359 (61.8%) and 220 (37.9%) were stratified 
into the active and passive drainage groups, respectively. The reoperation rate 
following postoperative recurrence was 23.1% and 14.1% in the active and passive 
drainage groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.011). After propensity score matching, 
the differences in recurrence rate remained significant (26.6% versus 15.6%, p = 
0.012). However, the functional outcome (mRS) at 6-12 months did not differ 
significantly (median [IQR]) between the 2 groups (passive drainage group 0.00 
[0.00, 2.00], active drainage group 1.00 [0.00, 2.00], p = 0.431). Mortality was 
comparable between the groups (passive drainage group 12 (5.5%), active drainage 
group 20 (5.6%), p = 0.968). In the univariate analysis, active drainage, short 
(&lt;48 h) duration of drainage, and early (&lt;48 h) postoperative mobilization 
were significantly associated with a higher recurrence rate. However, the 
multivariate logistic regression model could not confirm that any of these 
parameters were significantly associated with recurrence. Our post hoc analysis 
proposes that using a passive instead of an active drain might be associated 
with a reduced recurrence rate after evacuation of a cSDH. We suggest gathering 
further evidence by means of a randomized controlled trial."
1474,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide. It is a 
malignant and heterogeneous disease with distinct molecular subtypes, which has 
prognostic and predictive implications. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), cell-free 
fragmented tumor-derived DNA in blood plasma, is an invaluable source of 
specific cancer-associated mutations and holds great promise for the development 
of minimally invasive diagnostic tests. Furthermore, serial monitoring of ctDNA 
over the course of systemic and targeted therapies not only allows unparalleled 
efficacy assessments but also enables the identification of patients who are at 
risk of progression or recurrence. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a powerful 
technique for the detection and monitoring of ctDNA. Due to its relatively high 
accuracy, sensitivity, reproducibility, and capacity for absolute 
quantification, it is increasingly used as a tool for managing cancer patients 
through liquid biopsies. In this review paper, we gauge the clinical utility of 
ddPCR as a technique for mutational profiling in breast cancer patients and 
focus on HER2, PIK3CA, ESR1, and TP53, which represent the most frequently 
mutated genes in breast cancers."
1475,"OBJECTIVES: It is difficult to capture the severity of synovial inflammation on 
imaging. Herein we hypothesize that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived 
metrics may delineate the aggregation of the inflammatory cells and expression 
of inflammatory cytokines and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging may 
provide information regarding vascularity in the inflamed synovium.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with knee arthritis (&gt;3-months duration) 
underwent conventional (T2-weighted fast spin echo and spin echo T1-weighted 
images) as well as DTI and DCE MRI and thereafter arthroscopic guided synovial 
biopsy. DCE and DTI metrics were extracted from the masks of the segments of the 
inflamed synovium which enhanced on post-contrast T1-weighted MRI. These metrics 
were correlated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) parameters of inflammation on 
synovium.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Pearson's correlation was performed to study the 
relationship between DTI- and DCE-derived metrics, IHC parameters, and 
post-contrast signal intensity. Linear regression model was used to predict the 
values of IHC parameters using various DTI and DCE derived metrics as 
predictors.
RESULTS: There were 80 patients (52 male) with mean age 39.78 years and mean 
disease duration 19.82 months. Nineteen patients had tuberculosis and the rest 
had chronic undifferentiated monoarthritis (n = 31), undifferentiated 
spondyloarthropathy (n = 14), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 6), osteoarthritis (n = 
4), reactive arthritis (n = 3), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 2), and juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (n = 1). Fractional anisotropy (FA), a metric of DTI, had 
significant correlation with number of immune cells (r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.01) 
infiltrating into the synovium and cytokines (IL-1β, r = 0.55, p &lt; 0.01; 
TNF-α, r = 0.42, p &lt; 0.01) in all patients and also in each group of patients 
and adhesion molecule expressed on these cells in all patients (CD54, r = 0.51, 
p &lt; 0.01). DCE parameters significantly correlated with CD34 (blood flow, r = 
0.78, p &lt; 0.01; blood volume, r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.01) in each group of 
patients, a marker of neo-angiogenesis. FA was the best predictor of 
infiltrating inflammatory cells, adhesion molecule and proinflammatory 
cytokines. Amongst the DCE parameters, blood volume, was best predictor of CD34.
CONCLUSION: DTI and DCE metrics capture cellular and molecular markers of 
synovial inflammation in patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis."
1476,"The synthesis of Lewis blood group antigens is governed by two 
fucosyltransferase genes, FUT2 and FUT3. Evidence is accumulating to suggest 
that functional polymorphisms of FUT2 and FUT3 are associated with a variety of 
clinical conditions. Fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA), using three 
different dual-labeled probes for concurrent genotyping of three single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FUT3, c.59T&gt;G, c.314C&gt;T, and 
c.484G&gt;A for Lewis-negative allele inference, was developed and validated 
using Ghanaian and Caucasian subjects. Although two other SNPs, c.55G&gt;A, and 
c.61C&gt;T, are located in the probe sequence for c.59T&gt;G, it seems feasible 
to detect these two SNPs along with c.59T&gt;G. The results obtained by 
probe-based FMCA were in perfect accordance with those obtained by Sanger 
sequencing for 106 Ghanaians and 100 Caucasians. The present method is useful 
and reliable for estimating Lewis-negative alleles on a relatively large scale."
1477,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe medical condition 
characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), right ventricular 
(RV) failure, and death in the absence of appropriate treatment. The progression 
and prognosis are strictly related to the etiology, biochemical parameters, and 
treatment response. The gold-standard test remains right-sided heart 
catheterization, but dynamic monitoring of systolic pressure in the pulmonary 
artery is performed using echocardiography. However, simple and easily 
accessible non-invasive assays are also required in order to monitor this 
pathology. In addition, research in this area is in continuous development. In 
recent years, more and more biomarkers have been studied and included in 
clinical guidelines. These biomarkers can be categorized based on their 
associations with inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, cardiac fibrosis, 
oxidative stress, and metabolic disorders. Moreover, biomarkers can be easily 
detected in blood and urine and correlated with disease severity, playing an 
important role in diagnosis, prognosis, and disease progression."
1478,"BACKGROUND: Primary macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia (PMAH) is a rare 
form of adrenal Cushing's syndrome with incomplete penetrance which may be 
sporadic or autosomal dominant. The inactivation of the ARMC5 gene, a potential 
tumor suppressor gene, is one of the associated causes of PMAH. This study aimed 
to identify the variant responsible for Iranian familial PMAH.
METHODS: The proband, a 44-year-old woman, was directed to whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) of the blood sample to discover a germline variant. In 
addition, the identified causative variant was confirmed and segregated in other 
and available unaffected family members.
RESULTS: The novel germline heterozygous missense variant, c.2105C&gt;A in the 
ARMC5 gene, was found, and the same germline variant as the proband was 
confirmed in two affected sisters. This variant was detected in the brother of 
the proband with an asymptomatic condition and this considered because of 
incomplete penetrance and age-dependent appearance. The function of the ARMC5 
protein would be damaged by the identified variant, according to in silico and 
computer analyses that followed.
CONCLUSION: The new germline ARMC5 variation (c.2105C&gt;A, (p. Ala702Glu)) was 
interpreted as a likely pathogenic variant based on ACMG and Sherloc standards. 
PMAH may be diagnosed early using genetic testing that shows inherited autosomal 
dominant mutations in the ARMC5 gene."
1479,"Background: The accurate diagnosis of malaria cases, especially asymptotic and 
low-parasitemia patients, using robust molecular methods (nested-PCR) have been 
emphasized. The goal of this study was to detect active cases of malaria in 
areas with a history of local malaria transmission focusing on the use of 
molecular tools to ensure that the malaria elimination program has been 
implemented successfully. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 816 blood 
samples were taken from immigrants and local residents of malaria-endemic areas 
in Hormozgan province, Iran. In order to identify asymptomatic malaria parasite 
reservoirs, the samples were examined using microscopic, RDT, and nested-PCR 
techniques. Results: About twelve positive asymptomatic malaria cases were 
identified when the molecular method (nested-PCR) was used. The positivity rates 
among immigrants and local residents were 2.07% and 0.93%, respectively. No 
positive cases were detected using microscopic and RDT methods. Conclusions: The 
finding of the research emphasize that in addition to microscopy and RDTs 
methods, sensitive molecular tools as a standard and essential strategy are 
needed in the diagnosis and detection of asymptomatic parasite reservoir."
1480,"Identifying novel biomarkers of kidney function in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) has strong clinical value as current measures have limitations. 
This study aims to develop and validate a sensitive and specific ephrin type-A 
receptor 2 (EphA2) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for human serum, 
and determine whether its results correlate with traditional renal measures in 
patients with hypertension. The novel ELISA of the current study was validated 
and used to measure circulating EphA2 levels in 80 hypertensive patients with 
and without kidney function decline (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Validation of the EphA2 ELISA showed good recovery (87%) and linearity (103%) 
and no cross-reactivity with other Eph receptors. Patients with kidney function 
decline had lower diastolic blood pressure, and higher UPCR and EphA2 than those 
without kidney function decline. The association of age and eGFR with EphA2 was 
maintained in the stepwise multiple regression analysis. In a multivariate 
logistic model, EphA2 was associated with a lower eGFR (&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
after adjustment for age, sex, and UPCR. High circulating EphA2 levels have 
potential application as a clinical biomarker for the presence of CKD in 
patients with hypertension."
1481,"After the exclusion of iron deficiency and β-thalassemia, molecular research for 
α-thalassemia is recommended to investigate microcytic anemia. Aiming to suggest 
more efficiently the molecular analysis for individuals with a greater chance of 
having a symptomatic form of the disease, we have developed and validated a new 
decision tool to predict the presence of two or more deletions of α-thalassemia, 
increasing considerably the pre-test probability. The model was created using 
the variables: the percentage of HbA2, serum ferritin and mean corpuscular 
volume standardized by age. The model was trained in 134 patients and validated 
in 160 randomly selected patients from the total sample. We used Youden's index 
applied to the ROC curve methodology to establish the optimal odds ratio (OR) 
cut-off for the presence of two or more α-globin gene deletions. Using the OR 
cut-off of 0.4, the model's negative predictive value (NPV) was 96.8%; the 
cut-off point accuracy was 85.4%; and the molecular analysis pre-test 
probability increased from 25.9% to 65.4% after the use of the proposed model. 
This tool aims to assist the physician in deciding when to perform molecular 
studies for the diagnosis of α-thalassemia. The model is useful in places with 
few financial health resources."
1482,"(1) Background: It is widely accepted that aberrant methylation patterns 
contribute to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Ten-eleven 
translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase is an essential enzyme of which 
there are three members, TET1, 2, and 3, involved in hydroxymethylation, a newly 
uncovered mechanism of active DNA methylation. The epigenomes of gene 
transcription are regulated by 5-hydroxymethylcytocine (5-hmC) and TETs, leading 
to dysregulation of the immune system in SLE. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the global hydroxymethylation status in SLE peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to explore the role of TETs in changing the 
patterns of methylation. (2) Methods: We collected PBMCs from 101 SLE patients 
and 100 healthy donors. TaqMan real-time polymerase chain-reaction assay was 
performed for the detection of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), 5-hmC, and TET2 mRNA 
expression and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. The methylation rates 
in different CpG sites of TET2 promoters were examined using next-generation 
sequencing-based deep bisulfite sequencing. Putative transcription factors were 
investigated using the UCSC Genome Browser on the Human Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38) 
Assembly. (3) Results: 5-mC and 5-hmC were both decreased in SLE. The mRNA 
expression level of TET2 was notably high and found to be correlated with the 
levels of immunologic biomarkers that are indicative of SLE disease activity. 
The analysis of methylation rates in the TET2 promoter revealed that SLE 
patients had significantly higher and lower rates of methylation in TET2 
105146072-154 and TET2 105146218-331, respectively. (4) Conclusions: TET2 may 
play an important role in 5-mC/5-hmC dynamics in the PBMCs of SLE patients. The 
epigenetic modification of TET2 promoters could contribute to the pathogenesis 
of SLE and the intensity of the immunologic reaction."
1483,"NUP98::NSD1 fusion, a cryptic translocation of t(5;11)(q35;p15.5), occurs 
predominantly in pediatric AML, having a poor prognostic outcome. There are 
limited studies on the diagnosis of NUP98::NSD1 fusion in a clinical setting, 
and most of the data are from Western countries. No study on the detection of 
this translocation has been reported from the Indian subcontinent to date. One 
possible reason could be the lack of availability of a potential tool to detect 
the fusion transcript. We have developed a real-time quantitative PCR 
(qRT-PCR)-based assay to detect NUP98::NSD1 fusion transcript with high 
sensitivity and specificity. Screening 150 AML patients (38 pediatric and 112 
adults) using the assay showed the presence of fusion transcript in six patients 
including 03 pediatric, and 03 adult patients. We observed a prevalence rate of 
7.89% (3/38) and 2.67% (3/112) fusion transcript in pediatric and adult 
patients, respectively. Sanger sequencing further validated the occurrence of 
NUP98::NSD1 fusion in all six patients. Molecular characterization of these 
patients revealed a co-occurrence of FLT3-ITD mutation, accompanied by altered 
expression of the HOX and other genes associated with AML. All six patients 
responded poorly to induction therapy. Overall, this is the first study to show 
the presence of the NUP98::NSD1 fusion transcript in Indian AML patients. 
Further, we demonstrate that our in-house developed qRT-PCR assay can be used to 
screen NUP98::NSD1 fusion in clinical settings."
1484,"Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a frequent and well-known complication of 
hemodialysis, occurring in about one third of patients. An integrated approach 
with different methods is needed to minimize IDH episodes and their 
complications. In this prospective observational study, recruited patients 
underwent a multiparametric evaluation of fluid status through a lung ultrasound 
(LUS) with the quantification of B-lines, a physical examination, blood 
pressure, NT-proBNP and chest X-rays. The evaluation took place immediately 
before and at the end of the dialysis session, and the patients were divided 
into IDH and no-IDH groups. We recruited a total of 107 patients. A pre-dialysis 
B-line number ≥ 15 showed a high sensitivity in fluid overload diagnosis 
(94.5%), even higher than a chest X-ray (78%) or physical examination (72%) 
alone. The identification at the beginning of dialysis of &lt;8 B-lines in the 
overall cohort or &lt;20 B-lines in patients with NYHA 3-4 class are optimal 
thresholds for identifying those patients at higher risk of experiencing an IDH 
episode. In the multivariable analysis, the NYHA class, a low pre-dialysis 
systolic BP and a low pre-dialysis B-line number were independent risk factors 
for IDH. At the beginning of dialysis, the B-line quantification at LUS is a 
valuable and reliable method for evaluating fluid status and predicting IDH 
episodes. A post-dialysis B-line number &lt;5 may allow for an understanding of 
whether the IDH episode was caused by dehydration, probably due to due to an 
overestimation of the dry weight."
1485,"Blood remains the specimen of preference for malaria diagnosis, whether it is 
for microscopic, nucleic acid-based or biomarker detection of Plasmodium present 
in a patient. However, concerning the disadvantages of blood drawing, specimens 
that can be non-invasively collected under non-hygienic settings would come in 
handy for malaria diagnosis in endemic areas with limited resources. Although 
the current approaches using saliva or urine might not be as sensitive and 
specific as using blood, the potential of these two specimens should not be 
underestimated and efforts in developing diagnostic methods for Plasmodium 
detection specifically in these two specimens should continue without giving up. 
This review not only compiles and summarizes the sensitivity and specificity 
achieved by various detection approaches when using these samples for malaria 
diagnosis, it also intends to enhance the possibility of using saliva and urine 
for diagnostic purposes by describing how Plasmodium nucleic acid and antigens 
may likely be present in these samples. This review may hopefully encourage and 
motivate researchers in developing saliva- and urine-based diagnostic methods 
for Plasmodium detection to facilitate the control and eradication of malaria. 
In summary, the presence of Plasmodium DNA and antigens in urine and saliva 
makes these two specimens relevant and useful for malaria diagnosis."
1486,"This study presents the most comprehensive machine-learning analysis for the 
predictors of blood transfusion, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization period 
in COVID-19 patients. Data came from Korea National Health Insurance claims data 
with 7943 COVID-19 patients diagnosed during November 2019-May 2020. The 
dependent variables were all-cause mortality and the hospitalization period, and 
their 28 independent variables were considered. Random forest variable 
importance (GINI) was introduced for identifying the main factors of the 
dependent variables and evaluating their associations with these predictors, 
including blood transfusion. Based on the results of this study, blood 
transfusion had a positive association with all-cause mortality. The proportions 
of red blood cell, platelet, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate 
transfusions were significantly higher in those with death than in those without 
death (p-values &lt; 0.01). Likewise, the top ten factors of all-cause mortality 
based on random forest variable importance were the Charlson Comorbidity Index 
(53.54), age (45.68), socioeconomic status (45.65), red blood cell transfusion 
(27.08), dementia (19.27), antiplatelet (16.81), gender (14.60), diabetes 
mellitus (13.00), liver disease (11.19) and platelet transfusion (10.11). The 
top ten predictors of the hospitalization period were the Charlson Comorbidity 
Index, socioeconomic status, dementia, age, gender, hemiplegia, antiplatelet, 
diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. In conclusion, 
comorbidity, red blood cell transfusion, and platelet transfusion were the major 
factors of all-cause mortality based on machine learning analysis. The effective 
management of these predictors is needed in COVID-19 patients."
1487,"We sought to systematically review and meta-analy the role of cerebral blood 
flow (CBF) in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) using arterial spin labeling 
magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) and compare this in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
cognitively normal adults (CN). The prevalence of AD is increasing and leading 
to high healthcare costs. A potential biomarker that can identify people at risk 
of developing AD, whilst cognition is normal or only mildly affected, will 
enable risk-stratification and potential therapeutic interventions in the 
future. All studies investigated the role of CBF in the MTL and compared this 
among AD, MCI, and CN participants. A total of 26 studies were included in the 
systematic review and 11 in the meta-analysis. Three separate meta-analyses were 
conducted. Four studies compared CBF in the hippocampus of AD compared with the 
CN group and showed that AD participants had 2.8 mL/min/100 g lower perfusion 
compared with the CN group. Eight studies compared perfusion in the hippocampus 
of MCI vs. CN group, which showed no difference. Three studies compared 
perfusion in the MTL of MCI vs. CN participants and showed no statistically 
significant differences. CBF measured via ASL-MRI showed impairment in AD 
compared with the CN group in subregions of the MTL. CBF difference was 
significant in hippocampus between the AD and CN groups. However, MCI and CN 
group showed no significant difference in subregions of MTL."
1488,"Substantial milestones have been attained in the field of heart failure (HF) 
diagnostics and therapeutics in the past several years that have translated into 
decreased mortality but a paradoxical increase in HF-related hospitalizations. 
With increasing data digitalization and access, remote monitoring via wearables 
and implantables have the potential to transform ambulatory care workflow, with 
a particular focus on reducing HF hospitalizations. Additionally, artificial 
intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have been increasingly employed at 
multiple stages of healthcare due to their power in assimilating and integrating 
multidimensional multimodal data and the creation of accurate prediction models. 
With the ever-increasing troves of data, the implementation of AI/ML algorithms 
could help improve workflow and outcomes of HF patients, especially time series 
data collected via remote monitoring. In this review, we sought to describe the 
basics of AI/ML algorithms with a focus on time series forecasting and the 
current state of AI/ML within the context of wearable technology in HF, followed 
by a discussion of the present limitations, including data integration, privacy, 
and challenges specific to AI/ML application within healthcare."
1489,"BACKGROUND: Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO) is a 
temporary life support for severe cardiogenic shock, gaining time for organ 
recovery, permanent assistance, or transplantation. In this work, we aimed to 
investigate the trends of blood biomarkers over the period of ECMO support and 
their role in patient outcome.
METHODS: This retrospective study comprised patients receiving va-ECMO support 
over the period of 14 years at a tertiary university center.
RESULTS: Of 435 patients, 62% (268/435) survived to discharge, and the most 
frequent adverse event was hemorrhage (46%), followed by thrombosis (25%). 
Deceased patients had increased blood levels of C-reactive protein, 
procalcitonin, and white blood cells during the whole observation period, with 
higher peaks compared with survivors. The multivariable model identified 
hemorrhage (HR 1.73, p = 0.005) and higher levels of procalcitonin (HR 1.01, p = 
0.001) as independent risk factors for death.
CONCLUSIONS: In our population of critically ill patients receiving va-ECMO 
support, deceased patients had increased inflammatory biomarkers during the 
whole observation period. Patients having higher values of procalcitonin and 
experiencing bleeding events showed an increased risk for mortality. Further 
studies focusing on inflammation in ECMO patients, clarifying its role in 
patient outcome and potential therapeutic interventions, are warranted."
1490,"Whereas hypertension is an established cardiovascular risk factor in the general 
population, the contribution of increased blood pressure (BP) to the huge burden 
of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients receiving dialysis 
continues to be debated. In a large part, this controversy is attributable to 
particular difficulties in the accurate diagnosis of hypertension. The reverse 
epidemiology of hypertension in dialysis patients is based on evidence from 
large cohort studies showing that routine predialysis or postdialysis BP 
measurements exhibit a U-shaped or J-shaped association with cardiovascular or 
all-cause mortality. However, substantial evidence supports the notion that home 
or ambulatory BP measurements are superior to dialysis-unit BP recordings in 
diagnosing hypertension, in detecting evidence of target-organ damage and in 
prognosticating the all-cause death risk. In the first part of this article, we 
explore the accuracy of different methods of BP measurement in diagnosing 
hypertension among patients on dialysis. In the second part, we describe how the 
epidemiology of hypertension is modified when the assessment of BP is based on 
dialysis-unit versus home or ambulatory recordings."
1491,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) has significant morbidity due to 
multiorgan involvement and an unpredictable disease course. We analyzed the data 
of 14 patients diagnosed with HHT. The case series comprised 14 patients with a 
median age at presentation of 48 years old (41-74 years). In twelve patients 
(85.7%), the diagnosis was confirmed by using the Curacao Criteria. The most 
common reason for admission was epistaxis, with 9 patients (57%) presenting with 
nosebleed refractory to prolonged self-tamponade. The biochemical abnormalities 
identified were elevations in AP and gamma-GT; liver synthetic function was 
generally normal, even though 21% of patients had clinical or imaging findings 
for cirrhosis. Nosebleeds were the main reason for admission and significantly 
impacted quality of life through anemia and frequent hospital admissions. 
However, the visceral manifestations seemed to be more serious. The hepatic 
arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) appeared to remain asymptomatic or led to 
minimal changes for the majority of patients; some cases were associated with 
liver and biliary tract ischemia, necrosis leading to acute liver failure and 
even death. Hepatic AVMs can also lead to high-output heart failure due to 
arterio-venous shunting. The most frequent AVM was hepatic artery to hepatic 
vein, with secondary hepatic vein dilation and hemodynamic consequences."
1492,"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is one of the most serious complications 
after joint arthroplasty. The incidence rate of PJI after total joint 
replacement is 1-3%. Although there are different guidelines and diagnostic 
criteria used to diagnose PJI, diagnosing PJI is a highly difficult process for 
orthopedists. The current Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria are 
widely used for the diagnosis of PJI. These criteria include results from 
blood/synovial fluid tests, physical examination, and histological and 
microbiological analyses of intra-operative samples. However, there is currently 
no blood or synovial test that can definitively diagnose PJI. To make a more 
effective diagnosis of PJI, a large number of studies have explored and continue 
to investigate biomarkers. This review aims to provide general information about 
serum and synovial markers used for the diagnosis of PJI that may be used to 
create a database to guide researchers in new studies."
1493,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiological agent of varicella (chickenpox) 
and herpes zoster (shingles). VZV infections are ubiquitous and highly 
contagious, and diagnosis is mostly based on the assessment of signs and 
symptoms. However, monkeypox, an emerging infectious disease caused by the 
monkeypox virus (MPXV), has clinical manifestations that are similar to those of 
VZV infections. With the recent monkeypox outbreak in non-endemic regions, VZV 
infections are likely to be misdiagnosed in the absence of laboratory testing. 
Considering the lack of accessible diagnostic tests that discriminate VZV from 
MPXV or other poxviruses, a handy and affordable detection system for VZV is 
crucial for rapid differential diagnosis. Here, we developed a new detection 
method for VZV using recombinase-aided amplification technology, combined with 
the lateral flow system (RAA-LF). Given the prevalence of VZV worldwide, this 
method can be applied not only to distinguish VZV from other viruses causing 
rash, but also to foster early detection, contributing substantially to disease 
control."
1494,"Aging hemophiliacs face cardiovascular disease. Lots of evidence has been 
gathered that hemophiliacs have a more unfavorable cardiovascular profile than 
the general population does, especially due to the increased prevalence of 
hypertension (HTN). Among the existing scattered evidence, our study provides 
the most comprehensive and systematized analysis of the determinants of HTN in 
hemophiliacs. We discussed the contribution to the HTN substrate of 
hemophilia-specific factors, such as type, severity and the presence of 
inhibitors. The complex mechanism of kidney dysfunction in relation to hematuria 
and viral infections was meticulously addressed. Furthermore, we highlighted the 
new pathogenic concepts of endothelial dysfunction and the association between 
HTN and hemophilic arthropathy. The clustering of cardiovascular risk factors is 
common in hemophiliacs, and it enhances the negative vascular effect of HTN and 
aggravates HTN. It usually leads to an increased risk for coronary and 
cerebrovascular events. Our work provides reliable evidence to guide and improve 
the management of HTN in hemophiliacs."
1495,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of NASH needs a liver biopsy, an invasive procedure 
that is not frequently accepted by patients. The aim of our study was to 
evaluate the efficacy of the 13C-Octanoate breath test (OBT) as a non-invasive 
surrogate marker to differentiate patients with NASH from patients with simple 
steatosis (NAFL).
METHODS: We performed a prospective study on patients with histologically 
established non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and no other hepatic disease. Each 
patient underwent a testing protocol, which included a clinical exam, laboratory 
blood tests, standard abdominal ultrasound, and a 13C-Octanoate breath test.
RESULTS: The study group included: 82 patients with steatohepatitis, 64 patients 
with simple steatosis, and 21 healthy volunteers. The univariate and bivariate 
analysis identified that significant values were the percent dose recovery (PDR) 
at 15 min-r = 0.65 (AUROC = 0.902) and cumulative percent dose recovery (cPDR) 
at 120 min-r = 0.69 (AUROC = 0.899).
DISCUSSION: Our study showed that 13C-OBT had good efficacy for identifying 
patients with NASH from those with NAFL (steatosis alone) but not those with 
NAFL from healthy subjects. Considering all these pathogenic steps in NASH we 
considered that OBT could have the clinical utility to identify patients at risk 
for NASH, especially ""fast progressors""."
1496,"Non-acute subdural hematomas (NASHs) are a cause of significant morbidity and 
mortality, particularly with recurrences. Although recurrence is believed to 
involve a disordered neuroinflammatory cascade involving vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), this pathway has yet to be completely elucidated. 
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are key factors that promote 
inflammation/apoptosis and can be induced by VEGF. We investigated whether NETs 
are present in NASH membranes, quantified NET concentrations, and examined 
whether NET and VEGF levels are correlated in NASHs. Samples from patients 
undergoing NASH evacuation were collected during surgery and postoperatively at 
24 and 48 h. Fluid samples and NASH membranes were analyzed for levels of VEGF, 
NETs, and platelet activation. NASH samples contained numerous neutrophils 
positive for NET formation. Myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes (a marker of NETs) 
remained elevated 48 h postoperatively (1.06 ± 0.22 day 0, 0.72 ± 0.23 day 1, 
and 0.83 ± 0.33 day 2). VEGF was also elevated in NASHs (7.08 ± 0.98 ng/mL day 
0, 3.40 ± 0.68 ng/mL day 1, and 6.05 ± 1.8 ng/mL day 2). VEGF levels were 
significantly correlated with myeloperoxidase-DNA levels. These results show 
that NETs are increasing in NASH, a finding that was previously unknown. The 
strong correlation between NET and VEGF levels indicates that VEGF may be an 
important mediator of NET-related inflammation in NASH."
1497,"Numb chin syndrome (NCS) is a rare sensory neuropathy resulting from inferior 
alveolar or mental nerve injury. It manifests as hypoesthesia, paraesthesia, or, 
rarely, as pain in the chin and lower lip. Several case reports suggest that 
sickle cell disease (SCD) could be a cause of NCS. However, information about 
NCS is scarce in this population. Our objectives were to synthesize all the 
available literature relevant to NCS in SCD and to propose recommendations for 
diagnosis and management based on the best available evidence. A systematic 
review was performed on several databases to identify all relevant publications 
on NCS in adults and children with SCD. We identified 73 publications; fourteen 
reports met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. These described 33 unique 
patients. Most episodes of NCS occurred in the context of typical veno-occlusive 
crises that involved the mandibular area. Radiological signs of bone infarction 
were found on some imaging, but not all. Neuropathy management was mostly 
directed toward the underlying cause. Overall, these observations suggest that 
vaso-occlusion and bone infarction could be important pathophysiological 
mechanisms of NCS. However, depending on the individual context, we recommend a 
careful evaluation to rule out differential causes, including infections, local 
tumors, metastatic disease, and stroke."
1498,"As a result of the increasing use of improved detection methods, Kingella 
kingae, a Gram-negative component of the pediatric oropharyngeal microbiota, is 
increasingly appreciated as the prime etiology of septic arthritis, 
osteomyelitis, and spondylodiscitis in children aged 6 to 48 months. The medical 
literature was reviewed to summarize the laboratory methods required for 
detecting the organism. Kingella kingae is notoriously fastidious, and seeding 
skeletal system samples onto solid culture media usually fails to isolate it. 
Inoculation of synovial fluid aspirates and bone exudates into blood culture 
vials enhances Kingella kingae recovery by diluting detrimental factors in the 
specimen. The detection of the species has been further improved by nucleic acid 
amplification tests, especially by using species-specific primers targeting 
Kingella kingae's rtxA, groEL, and mdh genes in a real-time PCR platform. 
Although novel metagenomic next-generation technology performed in the patient's 
plasma sample (liquid biopsy) has not yet reached its full potential, 
improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of the method will probably make 
this approach the primary means of diagnosing Kingella kingae infections in the 
future."
1499,"Splenic torsion is an unusual condition that results in congenital abnormality, 
especially in the visceral abnormal arrangement. We report the case of an 
8.5-year-old boy with features in the right upper quadrant. Radiological 
investigations revealed heterotaxy syndrome with polysplenia and a hypodense 
tumor in the right upper quadrant adjacent to several spleens. We initially 
treated it as an intra-abdominal tumor. Laparoscopy was performed to check the 
tumor condition and revealed a congestive tumor located in the abdomen of the 
right upper quadrant below the central liver, which was suspected to be a 
torsion spleen without attaching ligaments. Laparoscopic splenectomy was 
successfully carried out without complications. The pathological report shows 
splenic tissue with hemorrhagic infarction. Physicians should be vigilant of the 
differential diagnosis of the acute abdomen in adolescents."
1500,"BACKGROUND: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is common in intensive care 
units (ICUs). Lung biopsies may be required to make a definitive diagnosis in 
patients with unknown etiologies. The feasibility of transbronchial lung 
cryobiopsy is undetermined in patients with respiratory failure in the ICU.
METHODS: Patients who underwent bronchoscopy examinations with transbronchial 
lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) between July 2018 and December 2019 were retrospectively 
analyzed through medical chart review. The procedures were performed by 
well-experienced interventional pulmonologists.
RESULTS: Ten patients underwent bronchoscopy examinations with TBLC in the ICU 
at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital during the study period. In all patients, the 
diagnosis was made via pathological analysis. One patient developed pneumothorax 
and required chest tube placement after the procedure. None of the patients had 
bleeding requiring blood transfusion, and no deaths were directly related to the 
procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: TBLC is a feasible technique to obtain lung pathology in patients 
with acute respiratory diseases of unknown etiologies. While the complication 
rate may be acceptable, the procedure should be performed by experienced 
interventional pulmonologists. However, airway blockers and fluoroscopy are 
highly recommended when used according to the current guideline. We do not 
encourage TBLC to be performed without having airway blockers available at the 
bedside."
1501,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Portal hypertension (PH), as the main consequence of 
cirrhosis, leads to the development of gastroesophageal varices (GEVs). Variceal 
hemorrhage (VH) caused by the rupture of GEVs is a life-threatening emergency. 
Thus, the prediction of VH risk is considerably important. Our pilot study aimed 
to identify the risk factors of variceal hemorrhage (VH) in cirrhosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cirrhotic patients were prospectively included and 
divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of VH. Conventional 
ultrasound and shear wave dispersion (SWD) imaging were conducted to detect the 
portal vein diameter, spleen diameter, ascites, liver stiffness (LS) and shear 
wave dispersion slope (SWDS). The laboratory tests were recorded, including 
platelets (PLT), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
total bilirubin (TBIL) and albumin (ALB). The risk factors of VH were screened 
using univariate analyses and identified using multivariate logistic regression. 
The ROC curves were used to assess diagnostic accuracy. Comparisons between AUCs 
were performed using the Delong method.
RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with 22 VHs were finally included. The SWDS, spleen 
diameter and ascites were identified as independent risk factors for VH. The 
SWDS showed good performance for diagnosing VH (AUC = 0.768, 95% CI: 
0.647-0.864), and sensitively identified 95.5% (95% CI: 77.2%-99.9%) of patients 
with VH. Including the three risk factors in multivariate logistic regression, 
we obtained a formula for diagnosing VH: -20.749 + 0.804 × SWDS + 0.449 × spleen 
diameter + 1.803 × ascites (no ascites = 0, ascites = 1). Comparison of AUCs 
revealed that the formula (AUC = 0.900, 95% CI: 0.800-0.961) performed better 
than LS, SWDS, and spleen diameter in diagnosing VH (p &lt; 0.001; p &lt; 0.05; 
p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: SWDS is a sensitive parameter for assessing the risk of VH. 
Combining the SWDS, spleen diameter and ascites resulted in good diagnostic 
accuracy."
1502,"Hospital-acquired anemia is common in patients hospitalized in the intensive 
care unit (ICU). A major source of iatrogenic blood loss in the ICU is the 
withdrawal of blood for laboratory testing. The aim of our study was to analyze 
the feasibility and accuracy of non-invasive spot-check pulse co-oximetry 
(SpHb), and a reduced-volume blood gas analysis (ABG Hb) for the determination 
of Hb concentration in critically ill patients. Comparisons between Hb 
determined with test devices and the gold standard-complete blood count 
(CBC)-were performed using Bland-Altman analysis and concordance correlation 
coefficient (CCC). The limits of agreement between SpHb and CBC Hb were -2.0 
[95%CI -2.3-(-1.7)] to 3.6 (95%CI 3.3-3.9) g/dL. The limits of agreement between 
ABG Hb and CBC Hb were -0.6 [95%CI -0.7-(-0.4)] to 2.0 (95%CI 1.9-2.2) g/dL. 
Spearman's coefficient and CCC between ABG Hb and CBC Hb were 0.96 (95%CI 
0.95-0.97, p &lt; 0.001) and 0.91 (95%CI 0.88-0.92), respectively. Non-invasive 
spot-check Hb co-oximetry is not sufficiently accurate for the monitoring of 
hemoglobin concentration in critically ill patients. Reduced volume arterial 
blood gas analysis has acceptable accuracy and could replace complete blood 
count for the monitoring of Hb concentration in critically ill patients, leading 
to a significant reduction in blood volume lost for anemia diagnostics."
1503,"White blood cells (WBCs) in the human immune system defend against infection and 
protect the body from external hazardous objects. They are comprised of 
neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, whereby each 
accounts for a distinct percentage and performs specific functions. 
Traditionally, the clinical laboratory procedure for quantifying the specific 
types of white blood cells is an integral part of a complete blood count (CBC) 
test, which aids in monitoring the health of people. With the advancements in 
deep learning, blood film images can be classified in less time and with high 
accuracy using various algorithms. This paper exploits a number of 
state-of-the-art deep learning models and their variations based on CNN 
architecture. A comparative study on model performance based on accuracy, 
F1-score, recall, precision, number of parameters, and time was conducted, and 
DenseNet161 was found to demonstrate a superior performance among its 
counterparts. In addition, advanced optimization techniques such as 
normalization, mixed-up augmentation, and label smoothing were also employed on 
DenseNet to further refine its performance."
1504,"Biomarkers including fasting blood sugar, heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), 
blood pressure, etc. are essential in the heart disease (HD) diagnosing. Using 
wearable sensors, these measures are collected and applied as inputs to a deep 
learning (DL) model for HD diagnosis. However, it is observed that model 
accuracy weakens when the data gathered are scarce or imbalanced. Therefore, 
this work proposes two DL-based frameworks, GAN-1D-CNN, and GAN-Bi-LSTM. These 
frameworks contain: (1) a generative adversarial network (GAN) and (2) a 
one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) or bi-directional long 
short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). The GAN model is utilized to augment the small and 
imbalanced dataset, which is the Cleveland dataset. The 1D-CNN and Bi-LSTM 
models are then trained using the enlarged dataset to diagnose HD. Unlike 
previous works, the proposed frameworks increase the dataset first to avoid the 
prediction bias caused by the limited data. The GAN-1D-CNN achieved 99.1% 
accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, and 100% area under the curve 
(AUC). Similarly, the GAN-Bi-LSTM obtained 99.3% accuracy, 99.2% specificity, 
99.3% sensitivity, 99.2% F1-score, and 100% AUC. Furthermore, time complexity of 
proposed frameworks is investigated with and without principal component 
analysis (PCA). The PCA method reduced prediction times for 61 samples using 
GAN-1D-CNN and GAN-Bi-LSTM to 68.8 and 74.8 ms, respectively. These results show 
that it is reliable to use our frameworks for augmenting limited data and 
predicting heart disease."
1505,"Lung cancers are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Studies 
have shown that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which constitutes the 
majority of lung cancers, is significantly more responsive to early-stage 
interventions. However, the early stages are often asymptomatic, and current 
diagnostic methods are limited in their precision and safety. The cell-free RNAs 
(cfRNAs) circulating in plasma (liquid biopsies) offer a non-invasive detection 
of spatial and temporal changes occurring in primary tumors since the early 
stages. To address gaps in the current cfRNA knowledge base, we conducted a 
pilot study for the comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide changes in 
plasma cfRNA in NSCLC patients. Total cfRNA was extracted from archived plasma 
collected from NSCLC patients (N = 12), cancer-free former smokers (N = 12), and 
non-smoking healthy volunteers (N = 12). Plasma cfRNA expression levels were 
quantified by using a tagmentation-based library preparation and sequencing. The 
comparisons of cfRNA expression levels between patients and the two control 
groups revealed a total of 2357 differentially expressed cfRNAs enriched in 123 
pathways. Of these, 251 transcripts were previously reported in primary NSCLCs. 
A small subset of genes (N = 5) was validated in an independent sample (N = 50) 
using qRT-PCR. Our study provides a framework for developing blood-based assays 
for the early detection of NSCLC and warrants further validation."
1506,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death around the world. 
Based on the roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members 
to regulate blood and lymphatic vessels and metabolic functions, several 
therapeutic approaches have been attempted during the last decade. However 
proangiogenic therapies based on classical VEGF-A have been disappointing. 
Therefore, it has become important to focus on other VEGFs such as VEGF-B, which 
is a novel member of the VEGF family. Recent studies have shown the very 
promising potential of the VEGF-B to treat CHD and heart failure. The aim of 
this review article is to present the role of VEGF-B in endothelial biology and 
as a potential therapeutic agent for CHD and heart failure. In addition, key 
differences between the VEGF-A and VEGF-B effects on endothelial functions are 
demonstrated."
1507,"Umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (UC-BSCs) are cells with low 
immunogenicity and differentiation potential, and the transfer of exosomes 
carried by UC-BSCs can regulate innate and adaptive immunity and affect immune 
homeostasis. This is an area of focus for autoimmune illnesses such as systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE). The target of this research was to investigate the 
immunomodulatory effect of exosomes produced from mesenchymal stem cells on SLE 
and its mechanism. After isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
from the SLE group and healthy group and treatment of SLE-derived PBMCs with 
UC-BSC-derived exosomes, the mRNA levels of corresponding factors in cells under 
different treatments were determined by RT-PCR, Th17/Treg content was analyzed 
by FCM (flow cytometry), and the targeted binding of microRNA-19b (miR-19b) to 
KLF13 was identified by in vitro experiments and bioinformatics analysis. The 
findings demonstrated that PBMC cells from SLE patients had higher proportions 
of Th17 subsets than the control group, whereas Treg subgroups with lower 
percentages were discovered. miR-19b's expression level was markedly reduced, 
which was inversely associated to the concentration of KLF13. In vitro 
experiments show that UC-BSC-derived exosome treatment can target KLF13 
expression by increasing the miR-19b level, thereby regulating Th17/Treg balance 
and inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors. According to the study's 
findings, SLE patients have dysregulated expression of the genes miR-19b and 
KLF13, and UC-BSC exosomes could regulate Th17/Treg cell balance and 
inflammatory factor expression in SLE patients through miR-19b/KLF13."
1508,"Hepatocytes exhibit a multi-polarized state under the in vivo physiological 
environment, however, human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hEHs) 
rarely exhibit polarity features in a two-dimensional (2D) condition. Thus, we 
hypothesized whether the polarized differentiation might enhance the maturity 
and liver function of hEHs. In this study, we obtained the polarized hEHs 
(phEHs) by using 2D differentiation in conjunct with employing transwell-based 
polarized culture. Our results showed that phEHs directionally secreted albumin, 
urea and bile acids, and afterward, the apical membrane and blood-bile barrier 
(BBIB) were identified to form in phEHs. Moreover, phEHs exhibited a higher 
maturity and capacitity of cellular secretory and drug metabolism than those of 
non-phEHs. Through transcriptome analysis, it was found that the polarized 
differentiation induced obvious changes in gene expression profiles of cellular 
adhesion and membrane transport in hEHs. Our further investigation revealed that 
the activation of Hippo and AMPK signaling pathways made contributions to the 
regulation of function and cellular polarity in phEHs, further verifying that 
the liver function of hEHs was closely related with their polarization state. 
These results not only demonstrated that the polarized differentiation enhanced 
the maturity and liver function of hEHs, but also identified the molecular 
targets that regulated the polarization state of hEHs."
1509,"Macrophage polarization is a steering factor of osteoarthritis (OA) progression. 
Synovial fluid (SF) obtained from OA patients with different Kellgren-Lawrence 
grades (KL grades) holds several proinflammatory factors and was hypothesized to 
induce macrophage differentiation and polarization by providing the needed 
microenvironment. U937 cells and peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cell-derived 
monocytes (PBMC-derived CD14+ cells) were induced with SFs of progressive KL 
grades for 48 h, and the status of the differentiated cells was evaluated by 
cell surface markers representing M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes. Functional 
viability assessment of the differentiated cells was performed by cytokine 
estimation. The fraction of macrophages and their phenotypes were estimated by 
immunophenotyping of SF-isolated cells of different KL grades. A grade-wise 
proteome analysis of SFs was performed in search of the factors which are 
influential in macrophage differentiation and polarization. In the assay on U937 
cells, induction with SF of KL grade III and IV showed a significant increase in 
M1 type (CD86+). The percentage of M2 phenotype (CD163+) was significantly 
higher after the induction with SF of KL grade II. A Significantly higher M1/M2 
ratio was estimated in the cells induced with KL grade III and IV. The cell 
differentiation pattern in the assay on PBMC-derived CD14+ cells showed a 
grade-wise decline in both M1 (CD11C+, CD86+) and M2 phenotype (CD163+). 
Cytokine estimation specific to M1 (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ) and M2 (IL-4 and 
IL-10) macrophages corelated with the differentiation pattern in the U937 cell 
assay, while it did not reveal any significant changes in the PBMC-derived CD14+ 
cells assay. SF cells' immunophenotyping showed the highest percentage of CD14+ 
macrophages in KL grade II; CD86+ and CD163+ cells were minimal in all KL 
grades' SFs. The proteome analysis revealed significantly expressed MIF, 
CAPG/MCP, osteopontin, and RAS-related RAB proteins in KL grade III and IV 
samples, which are linked with macrophages' movement, polarization, and 
migration-behavior. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SF in OA joints 
acts as a niche and facilitates M1 phenotype polarization by providing a 
proinflammatory microenvironment."
1510,"This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the impact of maternal oral 
inflammation on human milk composition including neutrophil counts, activation 
state (based on cluster of differentiation (CD) markers expression), and fatty 
acid levels. Fifty mothers were recruited from St. Michael's hospital, Toronto, 
and followed up from 2-4 weeks until 4 months postpartum. Oral rinse and human 
milk samples were collected at both timepoints. Oral polymorphonuclear 
neutrophils (oPMNs) within the rinses were quantified using flow cytometry and 
the participants' oral health state was categorized into three groups (i.e., 
healthy, moderate, and severe) based on the oPMNs counts. Fatty acids were 
identified and quantified using a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector 
(GC-FID). Compared to mothers with a healthy oral health state, mothers with 
moderate to severe oral inflammation had a statistically significant decrease in 
the expression of CD64 biomarker, an increase in the expression of CD14 
biomarker on human milk neutrophils and a decrease in the levels of 
eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3) in their human milk at follow-up compared to 
baseline. This study demonstrates for the first time that maternal oral 
inflammation can affect human milk composition. The mechanism by which these 
alterations can affect infant health outcomes in the long term critically needs 
to be considered."
1511,"Chemokines are molecules that pertain to a family of small cytokines and can 
generate cell chemotaxis through the interaction with their receptors. 
Chemokines can trigger signaling via conventional G-protein-coupled receptors or 
through atypical chemokine receptors. Currently, four atypical chemokine 
receptors have been are described (ACKR1, ACKR2, ACKR3 and ACKR4). ACKRs are 
expressed in various cells and tissues, including T lymphocytes. These 
receptors' main function is related to the internalization and degradation of 
chemokines, as well as to the inflammation control. However, the expression of 
these receptors in human T lymphocytes is unclear in the literature. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of ACKRs in different 
subpopulations of T lymphocytes. For this, peripheral blood from healthy donors 
was used to analyze the expression of ACKR2, ACKR3 and ACKR4 by 
immunophenotyping CD4, CD8 T lymphocytes and, in their subsets, naive, 
transition and memory. Results obtained in this study demonstrated that ACKR2, 
ACKR3 and ACKR4 receptors were expressed by T lymphocytes subsets in different 
proportions. These receptors are highly expressed in the cytoplasmic milieu of 
all subsets of T lymphocytes, therefore suggesting that their expression in 
plasma membrane is regulated after transcription, and it must be dependent on a 
stimulus, which was not identified in our study. Thus, regarding ACKRs function 
as scavenger receptors, at least for the ACKR3, this function does not impair 
the chemotaxis exert for their ligand compared to the typical counterpart 
receptor."
1512,"Several endocrine signals mediate mosquito egg development, including 
20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). This study reports on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as an 
additional, but core, mediator of oogenesis in a human disease-vectoring 
mosquito, Aedes albopictus. Injection of aspirin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 
(COX)) after blood-feeding (BF) inhibited oogenesis by preventing nurse cell 
dumping into a growing oocyte. The inhibitory effect was rescued by PGE2 
addition. PGE2 was found to be rich in nurse cells and follicular epithelium 
after BF. RNA interference (RNAi) treatments of PG biosynthetic genes, including 
PLA2 and two COX-like peroxidases, prevented egg development. Interestingly, 20E 
treatment significantly increased the expressions of PG biosynthetic genes, 
while the RNAi of Shade (which is a 20E biosynthetic gene) expression prevented 
inducible expressions after BF. Furthermore, RNAi treatments of PGE2 receptor 
genes suppressed egg production, even under PGE2. These results suggest that a 
signaling pathway of BF-20E-PGE2 is required for early vitellogenesis in the 
mosquito."
1513,"Gut microbiota is thought to influence host responses to allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). Recent evidence points to this 
post-transplant for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). We asked whether 
any such association might be found pre-transplant and conducted a 
metagenome-wide association study (MWAS) to explore. Microbial abundance 
profiles were estimated using ensembles of Kaiju, Kraken2, and DeepMicrobes 
calls followed by dimensionality reduction. The area under the curve (AUC) was 
used to evaluate classification of the samples (aGvHD vs. none) using an elastic 
net to test the relevance of metagenomic data. Clinical data included the 
underlying disease (leukemia vs. other hematological malignancies), recipient 
age, and sex. Among 172 aHSCT patients of whom 42 developed aGVHD post 
transplantation, a total of 181 pre-transplant tool samples were analyzed. The 
top performing model predicting risk of aGVHD included a reduced species profile 
(AUC = 0.672). Beta diversity (37% in Jaccard's Nestedness by mean fold change, 
p &lt; 0.05) was lower in those developing aGvHD. Ten bacterial species 
including Prevotella and Eggerthella genera were consistently found to associate 
with aGvHD in indicator species analysis, as well as relief and impurity-based 
algorithms. The findings support the hypothesis on potential associations 
between gut microbiota and aGvHD based on a data-driven approach to MWAS. This 
highlights the need and relevance of routine stool collection for the discovery 
of novel biomarkers."
1514,"Myc, a member of the ""Myc Network"" of bHLH-ZIP transcription factors, supervises 
proliferation, metabolism, and translation. It also engages in crosstalk with 
the related ""Mlx Network"" to co-regulate overlapping genes and functions. We 
investigated the consequences of stepwise conditional inactivation of Myc and 
Mlx in primary and SV40 T-antigen-immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts 
(MEFs). Myc-knockout (MycKO) and Myc × Mlx ""double KO"" (DKO)-but not 
MlxKO-primary MEFs showed rapid growth arrest and displayed features of 
accelerated aging and senescence. However, DKO MEFs soon resumed proliferating, 
indicating that durable growth arrest requires an intact Mlx network. All three 
KO MEF groups deregulated multiple genes and functions pertaining to aging, 
senescence, and DNA damage recognition/repair. Immortalized KO MEFs proliferated 
in Myc's absence while demonstrating variable degrees of widespread genomic 
instability and sensitivity to genotoxic agents. Finally, compared to primary 
MycKO MEFs, DKO MEFs selectively downregulated numerous gene sets associated 
with the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) pathways and G2/M arrest. Thus, the 
reversal of primary MycKO MEF growth arrest by either Mlx loss or SV40 T-antigen 
immortalization appears to involve inactivation of the p53 and/or Rb pathways."
1515,"CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is efficacious for 
refractory/relapsed (R/R) B-cell hematological malignancies, yet relapse due to 
CD19 antigen escape remains a challenge. Our trial explored simultaneous 
targeting of multiple B-cell antigens as a therapeutic approach that may reduce 
the risk of relapse. We tested the safety and efficacy of CAR19/22 T-cell 
cocktail therapy including murinized and humanized products among patients with 
R/R aggressive B-cell lymphoma. In the group that received the humanized 
product, 11/12 (91.7%) patients achieved an objective response, including 9/12 
(75%) complete responses (CRs) by day 28. The overall response rate and CR rate 
in the murinized group was 92.9% (13/14) and 42.9% (6/14), respectively. Nine of 
12 (75%) patients in the humanized group maintained CR at month 3 following 
infusion, compared to 5/14 patients (35.7%) in the murinized group. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was more favorable in the humanized compared to 
the murinized group. Most patients had mild cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
(grade 1-2) in both groups. This study demonstrates that CAR19/22 T-cell 
cocktail therapy is safe and effective for R/R B-cell lymphoma and that patients 
treated with a humanized CAR-T exhibited better efficacy compared to patients 
treated with a murinized CAR-T therapy."
1516,"Neutrophils are highly abundant circulating leukocytes that are amongst the 
first cells to be recruited to sites of infection or sterile injury. Their 
ability to generate and release powerful cytotoxic products ties with their role 
in host defence from bacterial and fungal infections. Neutrophilic inflammation 
is tightly regulated to limit the amount of 'bystander injury' caused. 
Neutrophils were in the past regarded as short-lived, indiscriminate killers of 
invading microorganisms. However, this view has changed quite dramatically in 
recent years. Amongst other insights, neutrophils are now recognised to also 
have important anti-inflammatory functions that are critical for the resolution 
of inflammation and return to homeostasis. This minireview focusses on 
anti-inflammatory neutrophil functions, placing a particular focus on recent 
findings linked to neutrophil cell death, several types of which may be 
anti-inflammatory (apoptosis, secondary necrosis, and neutrophil extracellular 
traps). These are discussed together with features that may further promote the 
clearance of dead cells by efferocytosis and reprogramming of macrophages to 
promote resolution and repair."
1517,"Atherosclerosis is a complex metabolic disease characterized by the dysfunction 
of lipid metabolism and chronic inflammation in the intimal space of the vessel. 
As the most abundant innate immune cells, monocyte-derived macrophages play a 
pivotal role in the inflammatory response, cholesterol metabolism, and foam cell 
formation. In recent decades, it has been demonstrated that monocytes and 
macrophages can establish innate immune memory (also termed trained immunity) 
via endogenous and exogenous atherogenic stimuli and exhibit a long-lasting 
proinflammatory phenotype. The important cellular metabolism processes, 
including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis, are reprogrammed. 
Trained monocytes/macrophages with innate immune memory can be persistently 
hyperactivated and can undergo extensive epigenetic rewiring, which contributes 
to the pathophysiological development of atherosclerosis via increased 
proinflammatory cytokine production and lipid accumulation. Here, we provide an 
overview of the regulation of cellular metabolic processes and epigenetic 
modifications of innate immune memory in monocytes/macrophages as well as the 
potential endogenous and exogenous stimulations involved in the progression of 
atherosclerosis that have been reported recently. These elucidations might be 
beneficial for further understanding innate immune memory and the development of 
therapeutic strategies for inflammatory diseases and atherosclerosis."

1519,"Immunotherapy using primary T cells has revolutionized medical care in some 
pathologies in recent years, but limitations associated to challenging cell 
genome edition, insufficient cell number production, the use of only autologous 
cells, and the lack of product standardization have limited its clinical use. 
The alternative use of T cells generated in vitro from human pluripotent stem 
cells (hPSCs) offers great advantages by providing a self-renewing source of T 
cells that can be readily genetically modified and facilitate the use of 
standardized universal off-the-shelf allogeneic cell products and rapid clinical 
access. However, despite their potential, a better understanding of the 
feasibility and functionality of T cells differentiated from hPSCs is necessary 
before moving into clinical settings. In this study, we generated human-induced 
pluripotent stem cells from T cells (T-iPSCs), allowing for the preservation of 
already recombined TCR, with the same properties as human embryonic stem cells 
(hESCs). Based on these cells, we differentiated, with high efficiency, 
hematopoietic progenitor stem cells (HPSCs) capable of self-renewal and 
differentiation into any cell blood type, in addition to DN3a thymic progenitors 
from several T-iPSC lines. In order to better comprehend the differentiation, we 
analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of the different cell types and 
demonstrated that HPSCs differentiated from hiPSCs had very similar profiles to 
cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Furthermore, differentiated T-cell 
progenitors had a similar profile to thymocytes at the DN3a stage of thymic 
lymphopoiesis. Therefore, utilizing this approach, we were able to regenerate 
precursors of therapeutic human T cells in order to potentially treat a wide 
range of diseases."
1520,"Clonal heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) forms the basis for 
treatment failure and relapse. Attempts to decipher clonal evolution and clonal 
competition primarily depend on deep sequencing approaches. However, this 
prevents the experimental confirmation of the identified disease-relevant traits 
on the same cell material. Here, we describe the development and application of 
a complex fluorescent genetic barcoding (cFGB) lentiviral vector system for the 
labeling and subsequent multiplex tracking of up to 48 viable AML clones by flow 
cytometry. This approach allowed the visualization of longitudinal changes in 
the in vitro growth behavior of multiplexed color-coded AML clones for up to 137 
days. Functional studies of flow cytometry-enriched clones documented their 
stably inherited increase in competitiveness, despite the absence of 
growth-promoting mutations in exome sequencing data. Transplantation of aliquots 
of a color-coded AML cell mix into mice revealed the initial engraftment of 
similar clones and their subsequent differential distribution in the animals 
over time. Targeted RNA-sequencing of paired pre-malignant and de novo expanded 
clones linked gene sets associated with Myc-targets, embryonic stem cells, and 
RAS signaling to the foundation of clonal expansion. These results demonstrate 
the potency of cFGB-mediated clonal tracking for the deconvolution of verifiable 
driver-mechanisms underlying clonal selection in leukemia."
1521,"The gene changes for diagnosis and prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) still remain unclear. RAC1 was reported to be asso;ciated with the B 
cell receptor signal pathway, but its relations with DLBCL have not yet been 
systematically explored. In this study, we have conducted molecular, 
bioinformatics and clinical analyses by using publicly available data from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Wilcoxon signed-rank test and logistic regression 
were performed to evaluate the association between RAC1 and clinical features in 
patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to examine the 
impacts of RAC1 expression level on overall survival, and a nomogram was 
performed to illustrate the correlation between RAC1 and the risk of DLBCL. Our 
results revealed that the expression level of RAC1 in DLBCL was higher than that 
in normal tissues or lymphadenitis. High-level expression of RAC1 was 
significantly associated with clinical stage, as well as being an independent 
factor affecting overall survival. RAC1 was negatively correlated with Bruton's 
tyrosine kinase (BTK). The association between RAC1 gene expression and the risk 
of DLBCL was presented in a nomogram. In conclusion, RAC1 expression patterns 
may be used to predict the development and prognosis of DLBCL."
1522,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a cell-wall immunostimulatory endotoxin component of 
Gram-negative bacteria. A growing body of evidence reveals that alterations in 
the bacterial composition of the intestinal microbiota (gut dysbiosis) disrupt 
host immune homeostasis and the intestinal barrier function. Microbial dysbiosis 
leads to a proinflammatory milieu and systemic endotoxemia, which contribute to 
the development of neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. Two 
important pathophysiological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are 
oxidative/nitrative stress and inflammation, which can be initiated by elevated 
intestinal permeability, with increased abundance of pathobionts. These changes 
lead to excessive release of LPS and other bacterial products into blood, which 
in turn induce chronic systemic inflammation, which damages the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). An impaired BBB allows the translocation of potentially harmful 
bacterial products, including LPS, and activated neutrophils/leucocytes into the 
brain, which results in neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Chronic 
neuroinflammation causes neuronal damage and synaptic loss, leading to memory 
impairment. LPS-induced inflammation causes inappropriate activation of 
microglia, astrocytes, and dendritic cells. Consequently, these alterations 
negatively affect mitochondrial function and lead to increases in 
oxidative/nitrative stress and neuronal senescence. These cellular changes in 
the brain give rise to specific clinical symptoms, such as impairment of 
locomotor function, muscle weakness, paralysis, learning deficits, and dementia. 
This review summarizes the contributing role of LPS in the development of 
neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death in various neurodegenerative diseases."
1523,"Whereas autoimmune diseases are mediated primarily by T and B cells, 
auto-inflammatory syndromes (AIFS) involve natural killer cells, macrophages, 
mast cells, dendritic cells, different granulocyte subsets and complement 
components. In contrast to autoimmune diseases, the immune response of patients 
with AIFS is not associated with a breakdown of immune tolerance to 
self-antigens. Focusing on B lymphocyte subsets, this article offers a fresh 
perspective on the multiple cross-talks between both branches of innate and 
adaptive immunity in mounting coordinated signals that lead to AIFS. By virtue 
of their potential to play a role in adaptive immunity and to exert innate-like 
functions, B cells can be involved in both promoting inflammation and mitigating 
auto-inflammation in disorders that include mevalonate kinase deficiency 
syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, inflammatory bone disorders, Schnitzler syndrome, 
Neuro-Behçet's disease, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Since there 
is a significant overlap between the pathogenic trajectories that culminate in 
autoimmune diseases, or AIFS, a more detailed understanding of their respective 
roles in the development of inflammation could lead to designing novel 
therapeutic avenues."
1524,"Testudines, also known as living fossils, have evolved diversely and comprise 
many species that occupy a variety of ecological niches. However, the immune 
adaptation of testudines to the different ecological niches remains poorly 
understood. This study compared the composition, function, and differentiation 
trajectories of peripheral immune cells in testudines (Chelonia mydas, Trachemys 
scripta elegans, Chelonoidis carbonaria, and Pelodiscus sinensis) from different 
habitats using the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique. The results 
showed that T. scripta elegans, which inhabits freshwater and brackish 
environments, had the most complex composition of peripheral immune cells, with 
11 distinct immune cell subsets identified in total. The sea turtle C. mydas, 
had the simplest composition of peripheral immune cells, with only 5 distinct 
immune cell clusters. Surprisingly, neither basophils were found in C. mydas nor 
T cells in C. carbonaria. Basophil subsets in peripheral blood were identified 
for the first time; two basophil subtypes (GATA2-high-basophils and 
GATA2-low-basophils) were observed in the peripheral blood of T. scripta 
elegans. In addition, ACKR4 cells, CD4 T cells, CD7 T cells, serotriflin cells, 
and ficolin cells were specifically identified in the peripheral blood of T. 
scripta elegans. Furthermore, LY6G6C cells, SPC24 cells, and NKT cells were 
specifically observed in C. carbonaria. Moreover, there were differences in the 
functional status and developmental trajectory of peripheral immune cells among 
the testudine species. The identification of specific features of peripheral 
immune cells in testudines from different habitats may enable elucidation of the 
adaptation mechanism of testudines to various ecological niches."

1526,"B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is an immune checkpoint molecule that 
mediates the escape of tumor cells from immunosurveillance. Consequently, BTLA 
and its ligand herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) are potentially 
immunotherapeutic targets. However, the potential effects of BTLA on tumor cells 
remain incompletely unknown. Here, we show that BTLA is expressed across a broad 
range of tumor cells. The depletion of BTLA or HVEM promotes cell proliferation 
and colony formation, which is reversed by the overexpression of BTLA in BTLA 
knockout cells. In contrast, overexpression of BTLA or HVEM inhibits tumor cell 
proliferation and colony formation. Furthermore, the proliferation of a 
subpopulation with high BTLA was also significantly slower than that of the low 
BTLA subpopulation. Mechanistically, the coordination of BTLA and HVEM inhibits 
its major downstream extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signaling 
pathway, thus preventing tumor cell growth. This study demonstrates that tumor 
cell-intrinsic BTLA/HVEM is a potential tumor suppressor and is likely to have a 
potential antagonist for immunotherapy, thus representing a potential biomarker 
for the optimal cancer immunotherapeutic treatment."
1527,"The etiology of hyperglycemic-induced depressive behaviors is unclear. We 
hypothesized that long-term hyperglycemia may induce long-lasting disturbances 
in glutamatergic signaling and neural damages, causing depressive behaviors. To 
prove our hypothesis, a C57BL/6N mouse model of hyperglycemia was maintained for 
4 weeks (equivalent to approximately 3 years in humans), after which insulin 
treatment was administered for an additional 4 weeks to normalize 
hyperglycemia-induced changes. Hyperglycemic mice showed depressive-like 
behaviors. Glutamatergic neurons and glial cells in the medial prefrontal cortex 
(mPFC) were affected by hyperglycemia. Insulin treatment improved blood glucose, 
water intake, and food intake to normoglycemic levels, but did not improve 
depressive-like behaviors. Glutamatergic signaling decreased with long-term 
hyperglycemia and did not normalize with insulin-induced normoglycemia. 
Importantly, hyperglycemia-induced changes in the mPFC were almost not reversed 
by the 4-week insulin treatment. In particular, levels of insulin receptor beta 
subunit (IRβ), IRS-1, vesicular glutamate transporter 1, glutamine transporter 
SNAT2, phosphate-activated glutaminase, and GLUT-3 were not changed by insulin. 
Nitration and the dephosphorylation of IRβ in the PFC also did not improve with 
insulin treatment. Therefore, our results suggest that hypoactive glutamatergic 
activity in the mPFC is involved in diabetic-associated depressive behaviors, 
and it is difficult to cure with glycemic regulation alone."
1528,"The development of nanoparticles (NPs) to enable the passage of drugs across 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents one of the main challenges in 
neuropharmacology. In recent years, NPs that are able to transport drugs and 
interact with brain endothelial cells have been tested. Here, we investigated 
whether the functionalization of avidin-nucleic-acid-nanoassembly (ANANAS) with 
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) would allow BBB passage in the SOD1G93A mouse model of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our results demonstrated that ANANAS was able to 
transiently cross BBB to reach the central nervous system (CNS), and ApoE did 
not enhance this property. Next, we investigated if ANANAS could improve CNS 
drug delivery. To this aim, the steroid dexamethasone was covalently linked to 
ANANAS through an acid-reversible hydrazone bond. Our data showed that the 
steroid levels in CNS tissues of SOD1G93A mice treated with nanoformulation were 
below the detection limit. This result demonstrates that the passage of BBB is 
not sufficient to guarantee the release of the cargo in CNS and that a different 
strategy for drug tethering should be devised. The present study furthermore 
highlights that NPs can be useful in improving the passage through biological 
barriers but may limit the interaction of the therapeutic compound with the 
specific target."
1529,"The perivascular localization of endometrial mesenchymal stem/stromal cells 
(eMSC) allows them to sense local and distant tissue damage, promoting tissue 
repair and healing. Our hypothesis is that eMSC therapeutic effects are largely 
exerted via their exosomal secretome (eMSC EXOs) by targeting the immune system 
and angiogenic modulation. For this purpose, EXOs isolated from Crude and CD146+ 
eMSC populations were compared for their miRNA therapeutic signatures and 
immunomodulatory functionality under inflammatory conditions. eMSC EXOs 
profiling revealed 121 in Crude and 88 in CD146+ miRNAs, with 82 commonly 
present in both populations. Reactome and KEGG analysis of miRNAs highly present 
in eMSC EXOs indicated their involvement among others in immune system 
regulation. From the commonly present miRNAs, four miRNAs (hsa-miR-320e, 
hsa-miR-182-3p, hsa-miR-378g, hsa-let-7e-5p) were more enriched in CD146+ eMSC 
EXOs. These miRNAs are involved in macrophage polarization, T cell activation, 
and regulation of inflammatory cytokine transcription (i.e., TNF-α, IL-1β, and 
IL-6). Functionally, stimulated macrophages exposed to eMSC EXOs demonstrated a 
switch towards an alternate M2 status and reduced phagocytic capacity compared 
to stimulated alone. However, eMSC EXOs did not suppress stimulated human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation, but significantly reduced 
secretion of 13 pro-inflammatory molecules compared to stimulated alone. In 
parallel, two anti-inflammatory proteins, IL-10 and IL-13, showed higher 
secretion, especially upon CD146+ eMSC EXO exposure. Our study suggests that 
eMSC, and even more, the CD146+ subpopulation, possess exosomal secretomes with 
strong immunomodulatory miRNA attributes. The resulting evidence could serve as 
a foundation for eMSC EXO-based therapeutics for the resolution of detrimental 
aspects of tissue inflammation."
1530,"Cancer immunotherapy has now entered clinical practice and has reshaped the 
standard of care for many cancer patients. With these new strategies, specific 
toxicities have emerged, and renal side effects have been described. In this 
review, we will describe the causes of acute kidney injury in CAR T cell, immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer immuno-therapy recipients. CAR T cell 
therapy and bispecific T cell engaging antibodies can lead to acute kidney 
injury as a consequence of cytokine release syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, 
sepsis or specific CAR T cell infiltration. Immune checkpoint blockade most 
often results in acute tubular interstitial nephritis, but glomerular diseases 
have also been described. Although the pathophysiology remains mostly elusive, 
we will describe the mechanisms of renal damage in these contexts, its prognosis 
and treatment. As the place of immunotherapy in the anti-cancer armamentarium is 
exponentially increasing, close collaboration between nephrologists and 
oncologists is of utmost importance to provide the best standard of care for 
these patients."
1531,"DNA methylation is a part of the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression, 
including chromatin remodeling and the activity of microRNAs, which are involved 
in the regulation of T-cell differentiation and function. However, the role of 
cfDNA methylation in T-cell differentiation is entirely unknown. In patients 
with endometrial polyps (EPs), we have found an imbalance of T-cell 
differentiation and an aberrant cfDNA methylation profile, respectively. In this 
study, we investigated the relationship between cfDNA methylation profiles and 
T-cell differentiation in 14 people with EPs and 27 healthy controls. We found 
that several differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were associated with T-cell 
differentiation in people with EPs (ITGA2-Naïve CD4, r = -0.560, p = 0.037; 
CST9-EMRA CD4, r = -0.626, p = 0.017; and ZIM2-CM CD8, r = 0.576, p = 0.031), 
but not in healthy controls (all p &gt; 0.05). When we combined the patients' 
characteristics, we found a significant association between ITGA2 methylation 
and polyp diameter (r = 0.562, p = 0.036), but this effect was lost when 
adjusting the level of Naïve CD4 T-cells (r = 0.038, p = 0.903). Moreover, the 
circulating sex hormone levels were associated with T-cell differentiation 
(estradiol-Naïve CD4, r = -0.589, p = 0.027), and the cfDNA methylation profile 
(testosterone-ZIM2, r = -0.656, p = 0.011). In conclusion, this study has 
established a link between cfDNA methylation profiles and T-cell differentiation 
among people with EPs, which may contribute to the etiology of EPs. Further 
functional studies are warranted."
1532,"Red blood cell (RBC) distribution, RBC shape, and flow rate have all been shown 
to have an effect on the pulmonary diffusing capacity. Through this study, a gas 
diffusion model and the immersed finite element method were used to simulate the 
gas diffusion into deformable RBCs running in capillaries. It has been 
discovered that when RBCs are deformed, the CO flux across the membrane becomes 
nonuniform, resulting in a reduced capacity for diffusion. Additionally, when 
compared to RBCs that were dispersed evenly, our simulation showed that 
clustered RBCs had a significantly lower diffusion capability."
1533,"Historical standard of care treatments of T-cell malignancies generally entailed 
the use of cytotoxic and depleting approaches. These strategies are, however, 
poorly validated and record dismal long-term outcomes. More recently, the 
introduction and approval of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has 
revolutionized the therapy of B-cell malignancies. Translating this success to 
the T-cell compartment has so far proven hazardous, entangled by risks of 
fratricide, T-cell aplasia, and product contamination by malignant cells. 
Several strategies have been utilized to overcome these challenges. These 
include the targeting of a selective cognate antigen exclusive to T-cells or a 
subset of T-cells, disruption of target antigen expression on CAR-T constructs, 
use of safety switches, non-viral transduction, and the introduction of 
allogeneic compounds and gene editing technologies. We herein overview these 
historical challenges and revisit the opportunities provided as potential 
solutions. An in-depth understanding of the tumor microenvironment is required 
to optimally harness the potential of the immune system to treat T-cell 
malignancies."
1534,"The Myc Network, comprising a small assemblage of bHLH-ZIP transcription 
factors, regulates many hundreds to thousands of genes involved in 
proliferation, energy metabolism, translation and other activities. A 
structurally and functionally related set of factors known as the Mlx Network 
also supervises some of these same functions via the regulation of a more 
limited but overlapping transcriptional repertoire. Target gene co-regulation by 
these two Networks is the result of their sharing of three members that suppress 
target gene expression as well as by the ability of both Network's members to 
cross-bind one another's consensus DNA sites. The two Networks also differ in 
that the Mlx Network's control over transcription is positively regulated by 
several glycolytic pathway intermediates and other metabolites. These 
distinctive properties, functions and tissue expression patterns potentially 
allow for sensitive control of gene regulation in ways that are differentially 
responsive to environmental and metabolic cues while allowing for them to be 
both rapid and of limited duration. This review explores how such control might 
occur. It further discusses how the actual functional dependencies of the Myc 
and Mlx Networks rely upon cellular context and how they may differ between 
normal and neoplastic cells. Finally, consideration is given to how future 
studies may permit a more refined understanding of the functional 
interrelationships between the two Networks."
1535,"Osteoclasts regulate skeletal development but also drive pathological 
osteolysis, making them prime therapeutic targets. Osteoclast research is 
limited by the heterogeneity of osteoclast populations generated in vitro, where 
the mixture of undifferentiated monocytes, binuclear pre-osteoclasts and 
multinucleated osteoclasts has by necessity been considered a single osteoclast 
population. This study describes the differentiation of primary human CD14+ 
monocyte-derived osteoclasts in 3D collagen gels. These osteoclasts remained 
small (&gt;95% with ≤5 nuclei) but were viable and active; when released from 
the gel with collagenase, they fused rapidly when reseeded onto solid substrates 
and resorbed dentine for 2-3 weeks. 3D-generated osteoclasts expressed cell 
surface markers of osteoclast differentiation (e.g., CD9, RANK, OSCAR, CD63, 
CD51/61) which, with their small size, enabled live cell sorting of highly 
enriched viable subpopulations of human osteoclasts that retained full 
functional resorption capacity. Low-yield osteoclast preparations were strongly 
enriched to remove undifferentiated cells (e.g., 13.3% CD51/61+ to 84.2% 
CD51/61+), and subpopulations of CD9+CD51/61- early osteoclasts and CD9+CD51/61+ 
mature cells were distinguished. This novel approach allows the study of 
selected populations of differentiating osteoclasts in vitro and opens the door 
to in-depth transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of these cells, increasing our 
ability to study human osteoclast molecular mechanisms relevant to development, 
aging and disease."
1536,"We previously developed an in vitro model of the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
based on the use of endothelial cells derived from CD34+-hematopoietic stem 
cells and cultured with brain pericytes. The purpose of the present study was to 
provide information on the protein expression levels of the transporters, 
receptors, tight junction/adherence junction molecules, and 
transporter-associated molecules of human brain-like endothelial cells (hBLECs). 
The absolute protein expression levels were determined by liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry-based quantitative targeted absolute proteomics 
and compared with those from human brain microvessels (hBMVs). The protein 
levels of CD144, CD147, MRP4, Annexin A6 and caveolin-1 showed more than 3-fold 
abundance in hBLECs, those of MCT1, Connexin 43, TfR1, and claudin-5 showed less 
than 3-fold differences, and the protein levels of other drug efflux 
transporters and nutrient transporters were less represented in hBLECs than in 
hBMVs. It is noteworthy that BCRP was more expressed than MDR1 in hBLECs, as 
this was the case for hBMVs. These results suggest that transports mediated by 
MCT1, TfR1, and claudin-5-related tight junction function reflect the in vivo 
BBB situation. The present study provided a better characterization of hBLECs 
and clarified the equivalence of the transport characteristics between in vitro 
BBB models and in vivo BBB models using LC-MS/MS-based protein quantification."
1537,"(1) Background: Both sepsis acute lung injury (SALI) and non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) are life-threatening diseases caused by immune response disorders 
and inflammation, but the underlining linking mechanisms are still not clear. 
This study aimed to detect the shared gene signature and potential molecular 
process between SALI and NSCLC. (2) Methods: RNA sequences and patient 
information on sepsis and NSCLC were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to 
build a co-expression network associated with sepsis and NSCLC. Protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) analysis of shared genes was intuitively performed by the 
Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. 
The involvement of EZH2 in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and sepsis 
immune microenvironment (IME) was assessed by R software. Western blot, flow 
cytometry, and other in vitro assays were performed to further confirm the 
function and mechanism of EZH2 in NSCLC and SALI. (3) Results: WGCNA recognized 
three major modules for sepsis and two major modules for NSCLC, and there were 
seven shared genes identified for the two diseases. Additionally, the hub gene 
EZH2 was screened out. It was shown that EZH2 was closely related to the IME in 
the two diseases. In the validation assay, our data showed that EZH2 was 
expressed at a higher level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 
septic patients than those of healthy donors (HDs), and EZH2 was also expressed 
at a higher level in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PBMCs and non-small cell 
lung cancer (A549) cells. EZH2 inhibitor (GSK343) downregulated the 
proliferation ability of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, 
parallel with the decreased expression level of PD-L1. Similarly, GSK343 
inhibited PD-L1 protein expression and downregulated the level of 
proinflammatory factors in LPS-induced PBMCs. In the co-culture system of PBMCs 
and human type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATIIs), the addition of GSK343 to 
PBMCs significantly downregulated the apoptosis of LPS-induced ATIIs. (4) 
Conclusions: This study illustrated that EZH2 inhibition could ameliorate A549 
cell proliferation and LPS-induced ATII apoptosis in parallel with 
downregulation of PD-L1 protein expression, which provided new insights into 
molecular signaling networks involved in the pathogenetics of SALI and NSCLC."
1538,"Metabolic effects of physical activity may be reno-protective in the context of 
hypertension, although exercise stresses kidneys. Aldosterone participates in 
renal disease in hypertension, but exercise affects the plasma concentration of 
aldosterone. This study was designed to evaluate whether physical activity and 
pharmacological treatment by aldosterone have additive effects on renal 
protection in hypertensive rats. Female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) or 
normotensive Wistar rats performed voluntary running wheel activity alone or in 
combination with aldosterone blockade (spironolactone). The following groups 
were studied: young and pre-hypertensive SHR (n = 5 sedentary; n = 10 running 
wheels, mean body weight 129 g), 10-month-old Wistar rats (n = 6 sedentary; n = 
6 running wheels, mean body weight 263 g), 10-month-old SHRs (n = 18 sedentary, 
mean body weight 224 g; n = 6 running wheels, mean body weight 272 g; n = 6 
aldosterone, mean body weight 219 g; n = 6 aldosterone and running wheels, mean 
body weight 265 g). Another group of SHRs had free access to running wheels for 
6 months and kept sedentary for the last 3 months (n = 6, mean body weight 240 
g). Aldosterone was given for the last 4 months. SHRs from the running groups 
had free access to running wheels beginning at the age of 6 weeks. Renal 
function was analyzed by microalbuminuria (Alb/Cre), urinary secretion of kidney 
injury molecule-1 (uKim-1), and plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration. 
Molecular adaptation of the kidney to hypertension and its modification by 
spironolactone and/or exercise were analyzed by real-time PCR, immunoblots, and 
histology. After six months of hypertension, rats had increased Alb/Cre and BUN 
but normal uKim-1. Voluntary free running activity normalized BUN but not 
Alb/Cre, whereas spironolactone reduced Alb/Cre but not BUN. Exercise 
constitutively increased renal expression of proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9; mRNA and protein) and arginase-2 (mRNA). 
Spironolactone reduced these effects. uKim-1 increased in rats performing 
voluntary running wheel activity exercise irrespectively of blood pressure and 
aldosterone blockade. We observed independent but no additive effects of 
aldosterone blockade and physical activity on renal function and on molecules 
potentially affecting renal lipid metabolism."
1539,"Peroxiredoxin (Prx) 2 in red blood cells (RBCs) reacts with various reactive 
oxygen species and changes to hyperoxidized Prx2 (Prx2-SO2/3). Therefore, Prx2 
may serve as an indicator of oxidative stress in vivo. This study aimed to 
analyze Prx2-SO2/3 levels in clinical samples to examine whether the oxidation 
state of Prx2 in human RBCs reflects the pathological condition of oxidative 
stress diseases. We first focused on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a hypoxic 
stress-induced disease of the respiratory system, and investigated the levels of 
Prx2-SO2/3 accumulated in the RBCs of OSA patients. In measurements on a small 
number of OSA patients and healthy subjects, levels of Prx2-SO2/3 accumulation 
in patients with OSA were clearly increased compared to those in healthy 
subjects. Hence, we proceeded to validate these findings with more samples 
collected from patients with OSA. The results revealed significantly higher 
levels of erythrocytic Prx2-SO2/3 in patients with OSA than in healthy subjects, 
as well as a positive correlation between the severity of OSA and Prx2-SO2/3 
levels in the RBCs. Moreover, we performed a chromatographic study to show the 
structural changes of Prx2 due to hyperoxidation. Our findings demonstrated that 
the Prx2-SO2/3 molecules in RBCs from patients with OSA were considerably more 
hydrophilic than the reduced form of Prx2. These results implicate Prx2-SO2/3 as 
a promising candidate biomarker for OSA."
1540,"During systemic inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in the 
bloodstream, producing large amounts of oxidized HDL (oxHDL). OxHDL loses the 
vascular protective features of native HDL, acquiring detrimental actions. 
Systemic inflammation promotes endothelial fibrosis, characterized by adhesion 
protein downregulation and fibrotic-specific gene upregulation, disrupting 
endothelial monolayer integrity. Severe systemic inflammatory conditions, as 
found in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), exhibit 
endothelial hyperpermeability, hypotension, and organ hypoperfusion, promoting 
organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Because endothelial fibrosis disturbs 
the endothelium, it is proposed that it is the cellular and molecular origin of 
endothelial hyperpermeability and the subsequent deleterious consequences. 
However, whether oxHDL is involved in this process is unknown. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the fibrotic effect of oxHDL on the endothelium, to 
elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism, and to determine its 
effects on vascular permeability, blood pressure, and mortality. The results 
showed that oxHDL induces endothelial fibrosis through the LOX-1/NOX-2/ROS/NF-κB 
pathway, TGF-β secretion, and ALK-5/Smad activation. OxHDL-treated rats showed 
endothelial hyperpermeability, hypotension, and an enhanced risk of death and 
mortality, which was prevented using an ALK-5 inhibitor and antioxidant diet 
consumption. Additionally, the ICU patients showed fibrotic endothelial cells, 
and the resuscitation fluid volume administered correlated with the plasma oxHDL 
levels associated with an elevated risk of death and mortality. We conclude that 
oxHDL generates endothelial fibrosis, impacting blood pressure regulation and 
survival."
1541,"Chronic nephritis leads to irreversible renal fibrosis, ultimately leading to 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and death. Macrophage infiltration and interleukin 
1β (IL-1β) upregulation are involved in inflammation-mediated renal fibrosis and 
CKD. Sesamol (SM), which is extracted from sesame seeds, has antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to explore whether SM mitigates 
macrophage-mediated renal inflammation and its underlying mechanisms. ApoE-/- 
mice were subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) with or without the oral gavage 
of SM for eight weeks. Blood and urine samples and all the kidney remnants were 
collected for analysis. Additionally, THP-1 cells were used to explore the 
mechanism through which SM attenuates renal inflammation. Compared with the sham 
group, the 5/6 Nx ApoE-/- mice exhibited a significant increase in the 
macrophage infiltration of the kidneys (nephritis), upregulation of IL-1β, 
generation of reactive oxygen species, reduced creatinine clearance, and renal 
fibrosis. However, the administration of SM significantly alleviated these 
effects. SM suppressed the H2O2-induced secretion of IL-1β from the THP-1 cells 
via the heme oxygenase-1-induced inhibition of the IKKα-NF-κB pathway. SM 
attenuated renal inflammation and arrested macrophage accumulation by inhibiting 
IKKα, revealing a novel mechanism of the therapeutic effects of SM on renal 
injury and offering a potential approach to CKD treatment."
1542,"Physical activity has a positive effect on human health and well-being, but 
intense exercise can cause adverse changes in the organism, leading to the 
development of oxidative stress and inflammation. The aim of the study was to 
determine the effect of short-term cold water immersion (CWI) and a sauna bath 
as methods of postexercise regeneration on the indicators of inflammation and 
oxidative damage in the blood of healthy recreational athletes. Forty-five male 
volunteers divided into two groups: 'winter swimmers' who regularly use winter 
baths (n = 22, average age 43.2 ± 5.9 years) and 'novices' who had not used 
winter baths regularly before (n = 23, mean age 25 ± 4.8 years) participated in 
the study. The research was divided into two experiments, differing in the 
method of postexercise regeneration used, CWI (Experiment I) and a sauna bath 
(Experiment II). During Experiment I, the volunteers were subjected to a 30-min 
aerobic exercise, combined with a 20-min rest at room temperature (RT-REST) or a 
20-min rest at room temperature with an initial 3-min 8 °C water bath 
(CWI-REST). During the Experiment II, the volunteers were subjected to the same 
aerobic exercise, followed by a RT-REST or a sauna bath (SAUNA-REST). The blood 
samples were taken before physical exercise (control), immediately after 
exercise and 20 min after completion of regeneration. The concentrations of 
selected indicators of inflammation, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), 
interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 10 
(IL-10), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α), as well as the activity of indicators of oxidative damage: 
α1-antitrypsin (AAT) and lysosomal enzymes, including arylsulfatase A (ASA), 
acid phosphatase (AcP) and cathepsin D (CTS D), were determined. CWI seems to be 
a more effective post-exercise regeneration method to reduce the inflammatory 
response compared to a sauna bath. A single sauna bath is associated with the 
risk of proteolytic tissue damage, but disturbances of cellular homeostasis are 
less pronounced in people who regularly use cold water baths than in those who 
are not adapted to thermal stress."
1543,"Blood pressure is determined by cardiac output and peripheral vascular 
resistance. The L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ (Cav1.2) channel in small arteries and 
arterioles plays an essential role in regulating Ca2+ influx, vascular 
resistance, and blood pressure. Hypertension and preeclampsia are characterized 
by high blood pressure. In addition, diabetes has a high prevalence of 
hypertension. The etiology of these disorders remains elusive, involving the 
complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors. Common to these 
disorders are oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) derived from NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and mitochondria are primary sources of 
vascular oxidative stress, whereas dysfunction of the Cav1.2 channel confers 
increased vascular resistance in hypertension. This review will discuss the 
importance of ROS derived from NOXs and mitochondria in regulating vascular 
Cav1.2 and potential roles of ROS-mediated Cav1.2 dysfunction in aberrant 
vascular function in hypertension, diabetes, and preeclampsia."
1544,"An impaired nocturnal decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increases the 
blood pressure (BP) load, which is a main factor in endothelial dysfunction, 
atherosclerosis, and arterial stiffness. We aimed to quantify some markers of 
oxidative stress in hypertensive patients, to compare their levels between 
individuals with dipper and non-dipper DBP profiles, and to assess their 
correlation with the nocturnal DBP (nDBP) dipping. It was an observational study 
that included patients older than 18 years with a diagnosis of essential 
hypertension who consented to participate. The collected variables were some 
indices of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, demographic, 
epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory variables. Plasma thiobarbituric acid 
reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced thiols, together with serum vitamin E, 
vitamin A, copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) levels were assessed as oxidative stress 
markers. We recruited 248 patients with a median age of 56 years (56% women). 
The percentage of nDBP dipping showed a weak positive correlation with reduced 
thiol, vitamin E, and vitamin A levels; and a weak negative correlation with Cu 
levels. We also found a negative correlation between nDBP dipping and the 
TBARS/Thiol, TBARS/Vitamin E, and TBARS/Vitamin A ratios. After multivariate 
analysis, we found that increased TBARS/Thiol ratio and serum Cu levels were 
associated with a higher risk of a non-dipper DBP profile. As in other 
situations of increased cardiovascular risk, an impaired nDBP decrease may 
coincide with abnormalities in redox status."
1545,"BACKGROUND: CD4+ T cells critically contribute to the initiation and 
perturbation of inflammation. When CD4+ T cells enter inflamed tissues, they 
adapt to hypoxia and oxidative stress conditions, and to a reduction in 
nutrients. We aimed to investigate how this distinct environment regulates T 
cell responses within the inflamed joints of patients with childhood rheumatism 
(JIA) by analyzing the behavior of NRF2-the key regulator of the anti-oxidative 
stress response-and its signaling pathways.
METHODS: Flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR were used to perform metabolic 
profiling of T cells and to measure the production of inflammatory cytokines. 
Loss of function analyses were carried out by means of siRNA transfection 
experiments. NRF2 activation was induced by treatment with 4-octyl-Itaconate 
(4-OI).
RESULTS: Flow cytometry analyses revealed a high metabolic status in CD4+ T 
cells taken from synovial fluid (SF) with greater mitochondrial mass, and 
increased glucose and fatty acid uptake. This resulted in a heightened oxidative 
status of SF CD4+ T cells. Despite raised ROS levels, expression of NRF2 and its 
target gene NQO1 were lower in CD4+ T cells from SF than in those from blood. 
Indeed, NRF2 activation of CD4+ T cells downregulated oxidative stress markers, 
altered the metabolic phenotype and reduced secretion of IFN-γ.
CONCLUSION: NRF2 could be a potential regulator in CD4+ T cells during chronic 
inflammation and could instigate a drift toward disease progression or 
regression, depending on the inflammatory environment."
1546,"Intracranial hypertension is a common phenomenon in patients with aneurysmal 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) plays an 
important role in early brain injuries and is associated with unfavorable 
outcomes. Despite advances in the management of aSAH, there is no consensus 
about the mechanisms involved in ICP increases after aSAH. Recently, a growing 
body of evidence suggests that oxidative stress (OS) may play a crucial role in 
physio-pathological changes following aSAH, which may also contribute to 
increased ICP. Herein, we discuss a potential relation between increased ICP and 
OS, and resultantly propose antioxidant mechanisms as a potential therapeutic 
strategy for the treatment of ICP elevation following aSAH."
1547,"Decreased selenium (Se) levels during childhood and infancy are associated with 
worse respiratory health. Se is biologically active after incorporation into 
Se-containing antioxidant enzymes (AOE) and proteins. It is unknown how 
decreased maternal Se during pregnancy and lactation impacts neonatal pulmonary 
selenoproteins, growth, and lung development. Using a model of neonatal Se 
deficiency that limits Se intake to the dam during pregnancy and lactation, we 
evaluated which neonatal pulmonary selenoproteins are decreased in both the 
saccular (postnatal day 0, P0) and early alveolar (postnatal day 7, P7) stages 
of lung development. We found that Se deficient (SeD) pups weigh less and 
exhibit impaired alveolar development compared to Se sufficient (SeS) pups at 
P7. The activity levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin 
reductase (Txnrd) were decreased at P0 and P7 in SeD lungs compared to SeS 
lungs. Protein content of GPx1, GPx3 and Txnrd1 were decreased in SeD lungs at 
P0 and P7, whereas Txnrd2 content was unaltered compared to SeS controls. The 
expression of NRF-2 dependent genes and several non-Se containing AOE were 
similar between SeS and SeD lungs. SeD lungs exhibited a decrease in 
selenoprotein N, an endoplasmic reticulum protein implicated in alveolar 
development, at both time points. We conclude that exposure to Se deficiency 
during pregnancy and lactation impairs weight gain and lung growth in offspring. 
Our data identify multiple selenoproteins in the neonatal lung that are 
vulnerable to decreased Se intake, which may impact oxidative stress and cell 
signaling under physiologic conditions as well as after oxidative stressors."
1548,"BACKGROUND: Autophagy can confer protection to pancreatic β-cells from the 
harmful effects of metabolic stress by delaying apoptosis. Curcumin (CUR) 
alleviates oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, activates autophagy, 
reduces inflammation, and decreases β-cell damage in type I diabetes. Liposomal 
CUR (LPs-CUR) has a higher therapeutic value and better pharmacokinetics than 
CUR.
OBJECTIVES: We determined LPs-CUR's ability to alleviate stress, reduce β-cell 
damage and unraveled the mechanism underlying its protective effect using a 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type I diabetic rat model.
METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped into vehicle control, STZ-diabetic 
(STZ 65 mg/kg), STZ-diabetic-3-MA (3-methyladenine [3-MA] 10 mg/kg b.wt), STZ. 
diabetic-LPs-CUR (LPs-CUR 10 mg/kg b.wt), and STZ diabetic-LPs-CUR-3-MA (LPs-CUR 
10 mg/kg b.wt; 3-MA 10 mg/kg b.wt).
RESULTS: LPs-CUR significantly reduced blood glucose, oxidative stress, and 
cellular inflammation in the pancreatic tissue (p &lt; 0.001). ER 
stress-dependent genes included ATF-6, eIF-2, CHOP, JNK, BiP, and XBP LPs-CUR 
significantly suppressed fold changes, while it upregulated the autophagic 
markers Beclin-1 and LC3-II.
CONCLUSIONS: LP-CUR ameliorates β-cell damage by targeting the autophagy pathway 
with the regulatory miRNAs miR-137 and miR-29b, which functionally abrogates ER 
stress in β-cells. This study presents a new therapeutic target for managing 
type I diabetes using miR-137 and miR-29b."
1549,"Plants are an entity essential to the function of the biosphere as well as human 
health. In the context of human health, this research investigated the effect of 
Lasia spinosa (Lour) leaf methanolic extracts (LSML) on antioxidative enzymes 
and gene expression as well as biochemical and histological markers in a 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model. Fructose-fed streptozotocin 
(STZ)-induced diabetic animals were subjected to a four-week intervention 
followed by the assessment of the animal's blood and tissues for enzymatic, 
biochemical, histological, and genetic changes. LSML-treated groups were shown 
to decrease plasma glucose levels and improve body and organ weights compared to 
the untreated group in a dose-dependent manner. At the doses of 125 and 250 
mg/kg b.w., LSML were able to normalize serum, hepatic, and renal biochemical 
parameters and restore the pancreas, kidney, liver, and spleen tissue 
architectures to their native state. A considerable increase (p &lt; 0.01) of 
liver antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD, GSH, and a decrease of MDA level in 
LSML-treated groups were found at higher doses. The improved mRNA expression 
level of antioxidant genes CAT, SOD2, PON1, and PFK1 was also found at the doses 
of 125 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg BW when compared to untreated control groups. The 
results demonstrate that LSML impacts the upregulation of antioxidative gene 
expressions, thus improving the diabetic complications in animal models which 
need to be affirmed by compound-based antioxidative actions for therapeutic 
development."
1550,"Radiotherapy (RT) is part of the standard treatment of breast cancer (BC) 
because of its effects on relapse reduction and survival. However, response to 
treatment is highly variable, and some patients may develop disease progression 
(DP), a second primary cancer, or may succumb to the disease. Antioxidant 
systems and inflammatory processes are associated with the onset and development 
of BC and play a role in resistance to treatment. Here, we report our 
investigation into the clinical evolution of BC patients, and the impact of RT 
on the circulating levels of the antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase-1 (PON1), 
cytokines, and other standard biochemical and hematological variables. Gradient 
Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm was used to identify predictive variables. This 
was a retrospective study in 237 patients with BC. Blood samples were obtained 
pre- and post-RT, with samples of healthy women used as control subjects. 
Results showed that 24 patients had DP eight years post-RT, and eight patients 
developed a second primary tumor. The algorithm identified interleukin-4 and 
total lymphocyte counts as the most relevant indices discriminating between BC 
patients and control subjects, while neutrophils, total leukocytes, eosinophils, 
very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and PON1 activity were potential 
predictors of fatal outcome."
1551,"Reduced angiotensin 1-7 bioavailability due to inhibition of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may contribute to increased mortality in 
hypertensive individuals during COVID-19. However, effects of ACE2 inhibitor 
MLN-4760 in brain functions remain unknown. We investigated the selected 
behavioural and hemodynamic parameters in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) 
after a 2-week s.c. infusion of MLN-4760 (dose 1 mg/kg/day). The biochemical and 
molecular effects of MLN-4760 were investigated in the brainstem and blood 
plasma. MLN-4760 had no effects on hemodynamic and behavioural parameters. 
However, MLN-4760 increased plasma hydrogen sulfide (H2S) level and total nitric 
oxide (NO) synthase activity and conjugated dienes in the brainstem. Increased 
NO synthase activity correlated positively with gene expression of Nos3 while 
plasma H2S levels correlated positively with gene expressions of H2S-producing 
enzymes Mpst, Cth and Cbs. MLN-4760 administration increased gene expression of 
Ace2, Sod1, Sod2, Gpx4 and Hmox1, which positively correlated with expression of 
Nfe2l2 gene encoding the redox-sensitive transcription factor NRF2. 
Collectively, MLN-4760 did not exacerbate pre-existing hypertension and 
behavioural hyperactivity/anxiety in SHRs. However, MLN-4760-induced oxidative 
damage in brainstem was associated with activation of NO- and H2S-mediated 
compensatory mechanisms and with increased gene expression of antioxidant, NO- 
and H2S-producing enzymes that all correlated positively with elevated Nfe2l2 
expression."
1552,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common respiratory 
complication of prematurity as younger and smaller infants are surviving beyond 
the immediate neonatal period. The recognition that oxidative stress (OS) plays 
a key role in BPD pathogenesis has been widely accepted since at least the 
1980s. In this article, we examine the interplay between OS and genetic 
regulation and review 'omics' data related to OS in BPD. Data from animal models 
(largely models of hyperoxic lung injury) and from human studies are presented. 
Epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses have demonstrated several genes related 
to OS to be differentially expressed in murine models that mimic BPD as well as 
in premature infants at risk of BPD development and infants with established 
lung disease. Alterations in the genetic regulation of antioxidant enzymes is a 
common theme in these studies. Data from metabolomics and proteomics have also 
demonstrated the potential involvement of OS-related pathways in BPD. A 
limitation of many studies includes the difficulty of obtaining timely and 
appropriate samples from human patients. Additional 'omics' studies could 
further our understanding of the role of OS in BPD pathogenesis, which may prove 
beneficial for prevention and timely diagnosis, and aid in the development of 
targeted therapies."
1553,"Cerebral ischemic stroke is characterized by acute ischemia in a certain part of 
the brain, which leads to brain cells necrosis, apoptosis, ferroptosis, 
pyroptosis, etc. At present, there are limited effective clinical treatments for 
cerebral ischemic stroke, and the recovery of cerebral blood circulation will 
lead to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Cerebral ischemic stroke 
involves many pathological processes such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), 
as one of the most critical antioxidant transcription factors in cells, can 
coordinate various cytoprotective factors to inhibit oxidative stress. Targeting 
Nrf2 is considered as a potential strategy to prevent and treat cerebral 
ischemia injury. During cerebral ischemia, Nrf2 participates in signaling 
pathways such as Keap1, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, NF-κB, and HO-1, and then alleviates 
cerebral ischemia injury or CIRI by inhibiting oxidative stress, 
anti-inflammation, maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, protecting the 
blood-brain barrier, and inhibiting ferroptosis. In this review, we have 
discussed the structure of Nrf2, the mechanisms of Nrf2 in cerebral ischemic 
stroke, the related research on the treatment of cerebral ischemia through the 
Nrf2 signaling pathway in recent years, and expounded the important role and 
future potential of the Nrf2 pathway in cerebral ischemic stroke."
1554,"Colorectal cancer (CRC), associated with an increased intake of processed red 
meats, saturated fats, and simple carbohydrates accompanied by low dietary 
fiber, fruits, and vegetables consumption, presents a high epidemiological 
burden. Connexin43 (Cx43) protein, which forms gap junctions or hemichannels, 
has tumor suppressor or oncogenic activities in a cancer type- and 
stage-dependent manner. Cx43 expression varies during colon carcinogenesis, and 
its functional role is not fully understood. Thus, we evaluated the implications 
of Cx43 heterologous deletion (Cx43+/-) during the early stages of a chemically 
induced model of colon carcinogenesis. Female C57BL/6J mice (wild-type or 
Cx43+/-) were submitted to a colon carcinogenesis model induced by 1,2 
dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Mice were euthanized eight hours (week 7) or 30 weeks 
(week 37) after the last DMH administration to evaluate subacute colon toxicity 
outcomes or the burden of (pre)neoplastic lesions, respectively. At week 7, Cx43 
deficiency inferred no alterations in the DMH-induced increase in systemic 
(peripheral blood), in situ (colonocytes) DNA damage, and apoptosis in the 
colonocytes. At week 30, Cx43+/- mice presented an increase in preneoplastic 
aberrant crypt foci (ACF) multiplicity, while no alterations were observed in 
colorectal adenoma (CRA) occurrence, multiplicity, volume, proliferation, 
growth, and β-catenin immunoexpression. Similarly, an in silico analysis of 
human CRA showed decreased mRNA expression of Cx43 with no correlation with 
proliferation, apoptosis, and β-catenin markers. These findings indicate the 
discrete role of Cx43 in the early stages of chemically induced mouse colon 
carcinogenesis."
1555,"Oxidative stress is an important pathophysiological mechanism in the development 
of numerous cardiovascular disorders, but few studies have examined the levels 
of oxidative stress in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD). The objective 
of this study was to investigate oxidative stress levels in adults with CHD and 
the association with inflammation, exercise capacity and endothelial function. 
To this end, 36 adults with different types of CHD and 36 age- and 
gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Blood cell counts, hs-CRP, 
NT-proBNP, fasting glucose, cholesterol levels, iron saturation and folic acid 
concentrations were determined in venous blood samples. Levels of superoxide 
anion radical in whole blood were determined using electron paramagnetic 
resonance spectroscopy in combination with the spin probe CMH. Physical activity 
was assessed with the IPAQ-SF questionnaire. Vascular function assessment 
(EndoPAT) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing were performed in the patient 
group. Superoxide anion radical levels were not statistically significantly 
different between adults with CHD and the matched controls. Moreover, oxidative 
stress did not correlate with inflammation, or with endothelial function or 
cardiorespiratory fitness in CHD; however, a significant negative correlation 
with iron saturation was observed. Overall, whole blood superoxide anion radical 
levels in adults with CHD were not elevated, but iron levels seem to play a more 
important role in oxidative stress mechanisms in CHD than in healthy controls. 
More research will be needed to improve our understanding of the underlying 
pathophysiology of CHD."
1556,"Atherosclerosis is the greatest contributor to cardiovascular events and is 
involved in the majority of deaths worldwide. Plaque rapture or erosion 
precipitates life-threatening thrombi, resulting in the obstruction blood flow 
to the heart (acute coronary syndrome), brain (ischemic stroke) or low 
extremities (peripheral vascular diseases). Among these events, major causation 
dues to the plaque rupture. Although the initiation, procession, and precise 
time of controlling plaque rupture are unclear, foam cell formation and 
apoptosis, cell death, extracellular matrix components, protease expression and 
activity, local inflammation, intraplaque hemorrhage, and calcification 
contribute to the plaque instability. These alterations tightly associate with 
the function regulation of intraplaque various cell populations. Hydrogen 
sulfide (H2S) is gasotransmitter derived from methionine metabolism and exerts a 
protective role in the genesis of atherosclerosis. Recent progress also showed 
H2S mediated the plaque stability. In this review, we discuss the progress of 
endogenous H2S modulation on functions of vascular smooth muscle cells, 
monocytes/macrophages, and T cells, and the molecular mechanism in plaque 
stability."
1557,"Phytotherapy has been promoted for the treatment of liver diseases in dogs. The 
interest in identifying the antioxidant/hepatoprotective potential of various 
plants is increasing. Every 10 days for 30 days, forty dogs were subjected to 
blood sampling and hepatic ultrasound assessment. Clinically healthy dogs (group 
A) and dogs with liver enzyme and ultrasound hepatic aspects and sizes outside 
the physiological range (group B) were divided into two subgroups. Every day for 
30 days, one subgroup received Epacare pet + pasta® and the other received a 
placebo. Differences due to groups were observed in dROM, SHp, AST and LDH serum 
concentrations. The administration of Epacarepet + pasta® for 30 days had an 
influence on the serum concentration of dROMs, SHp, AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, and 
urea. The application of paired Student's t-test showed a decrease in the 
longitudinal and transverse liver axis size. In conclusion, feed supplementation 
with Epacare pet + pasta® had a beneficial effect on the antioxidant status and 
liver enzymes in animals with liver enzymatic alterations and in healthy dogs."
1558,"Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is a landmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) at the 
core of the cardiovascular consequences of OSA. IH triggers oxidative stress, a 
major underlying mechanism for elevated blood pressure (BP) and increased 
infarct size. L-citrulline is an amino acid that has been demonstrated to be 
protective of the cardiovascular system and exert pleiotropic effects. 
Therefore, we tested the impact of citrulline supplementation on IH-induced 
increase in BP and infarct size. Four groups of rats exposed to normoxia (N) or 
IH [14 days (d), 8 h/day, 30 s-O2 21%/30 s-O2 5%] and were supplemented or not 
with citrulline (1 g·kg-1·d-1). After 14 d, BP was measured, and hearts were 
submitted to global ischemia-reperfusion to measure infarct size. Histological 
and biochemical analyses were conducted on hearts and aorta to assess oxidative 
stress. Citrulline significantly reduced BP (-9.92%) and infarct size (-18.22%) 
under IH only. In the aorta, citrulline supplementation significantly decreased 
superoxide anion and nitrotyrosine levels under IH and abolished the IH-induced 
decrease in nitrite. Citrulline supplementation significantly decreased 
myocardial superoxide anion levels and xanthine oxidase enzyme activity under 
IH. Citrulline shows a cardioprotective capacity by limiting IH-induced 
pro-oxidant activity. Our results suggest that citrulline might represent a new 
pharmacological strategy in OSA patients with high cardiovascular risk."
1559,"It has been shown that small doses of oral D-glyceric acid (DGA) activate 
mitochondrial metabolism and reduce inflammation among 50-60-year-old healthy 
volunteers. The present results with the same small doses reveal that after a 
4-day DGA regimen, a dose of DGA activated the HO-1 pathway acutely, while 
enhanced inflammatory status after the 4-day DGA regimen seemed to be able to 
downregulate the HO-1 pathway in non-acute measurement. Blood bilirubin was 
strongly upregulated towards the end of the altogether 21-day study period with 
positive associations towards improved inflammation and reduced blood 
triglycerides. After the 4-day DGA regimen, hepatic inflow of blood bilirubin 
with albumin as the carrier was clearly upregulated in the 
lower-aerobic-capacity persons. At the same time also, blood triglycerides were 
down, pointing possibly to the activation of liver fatty acid oxidation. The 
combination of activated aerobic energy metabolism with transient HO-1 pathway 
activation and the upregulation of blood bilirubin may reduce the risks of 
chronic diseases, especially in aging. Furthermore, there exist certain diseases 
with unsatisfactorily-met medical needs, such as fatty and cholestatic liver 
diseases, and Parkinson's disease, that can be possibly ameliorated with the 
whole-body mechanism of the action of the DGA regimen."
1560,"Researchers recently focused on studying the nutritional and functional 
qualities of sprouts generated from seeds. The current study investigated the 
total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids (TF), total flavonols (TFL), 
antioxidant activity (AOA), specific phenolic acids, and volatile chemicals in 
fennel seeds (FS) and fennel seed sprouts (FSS). The oxidative DNA damage 
prevention activity of selected FS and FSS extracts against DNA was examined. 
Consequently, the antioxidative stress potential of FS and FSS extracts at 300 
and 600 mg kg-1 on CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats weas 
investigated. The liver's functions and oxidative stress biomarkers in rat blood 
were examined. FSS exhibited rich phytochemical content such as TPC, TF, TFL, 
and AOA with altered phenolics and volatiles. HPLC identified nineteen compounds 
of phenolic acids and their derivatives in FS. Thirteen phenolics and six 
flavonoids were predominantly identified as Vanillic acid and Kaempferol, 
respectively. GC-MS analysis identified fifty and fifty-one components in FS and 
FSS, respectively. The predominant component was Benzene, 
[1-(2-propenyloxy)-3-butenyl] (trans-Anethole) (38.41%), followed by 
trans-Anethole (Benzene, 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)) (23.65%), Fenchone (11.18%), 
and 1,7-Octadiene, 2-methyl-6-methylene- Cyclohexene (7.17%). Interestingly, 
α-Pinene, Fenchone, trans-Anethole (Benzene, 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)), 
4-Methoxybenzaldehyde (4-Anisaldehyde), Benzeneacetic acid, α-hydroxy-4-methoxy, 
and Nonacosane contents were increased. While Dillapiole, 7-Octadecenoic acid, 
and methyl ester were newly identified and quantified in FSS. The oxidative DNA 
damage prevention capability of FSS and FS extracts indicated remarkable DNA 
protection. Administrating FS and FSS extracts at 300 and 600 mg kg-1 
ameliorated AST, ALT, and ALP, as well as GSH, CAT, MDA, and SOD, in a 
dose-dependent manner. The most efficient treatment of FS or FSS was using a 
dose of 600 mg Kg-1, which recorded an improvement rate of 20.77 and 24.17, 
20.36 and 24.92, and 37.49 and 37.90% for ALT, AST, and ALP, respectively. While 
an improvement rate of 40.08 and 37.87%, 37.17 and 46.52%, 114.56 and 154.13%, 
and 66.05 and 69.69% for GSH, DMA, CAT, and SOD compared to the CCl4-group, 
respectively. The observed protection is associated with increased phenolics and 
volatiles in F. vulgare. Therefore, FS and FSS are recommended as functional 
foods with bioactive functionality, health-promoting properties, and desired 
prevention capabilities that may help prevent oxidative stress-related diseases."
1561,"Malic acid, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is a 
promising acidifier with strong antioxidant capacity. This study aimed to 
evaluate the effects of bio-fermented malic acid (BFMA) on promoting the body 
health, performance and meat quality of broilers. A total of 288 one-day-old 
Arbor Acres male broiler chicks were randomly divided into four treatments with 
six replicates in each. Every replicate had 12 chicks. Four experimental diets 
contained 0, 4, 8, and 12 g/kg BFMA, respectively. During the 42-day trial, 
mortality was recorded daily, feed intake and body weight of each replicate 
being recorded every week. Blood samples were collected on days 21 and 42 for 
chemical analysis. After slaughter at the age of 42 days, the carcass traits and 
meat quality of the broilers were measured, breast muscle samples were collected 
for the determination of antioxidant capacity, and cecal digesta were pretreated 
for microbiota analysis. Dietary BFMA significantly increased feed intake and 
daily gain, and decreased feed conversion ratio and death and culling ratio of 
the broilers at the earlier stage. The water-holding capacity of breast muscle 
indicated by the indexes of dripping loss and cooking loss was significantly 
increased by BFMA, especially at the addition level of 8 g/kg. Dietary BFMA 
significantly decreased the activity of superoxide dismutase and contents of 
immunoglobulin A and glutathione, and increased contents of immunoglobulin G and 
M in serum of the broilers. The contents of glutathione, inosinic acid, and 
total antioxidant capacity and the activities of glutathione-Px and superoxide 
dismutase were significantly increased by dietary BFMA, with the level of 8 g/kg 
best. The diversity of cecal microbiota of broilers was obviously altered by 
BFMA. In conclusion, as one of several acidifiers, addition of BFMA in diets 
could improve the performance and body health of broilers, probably by 
reinforcing immunity and perfecting cecal microbiota structure. As one of the 
intermediates of the TCA cycle, BFMA increases the water-holding capacity of 
breast muscle of broilers, probably through reducing lactate accumulates and 
enhancing antioxidant capacity."
1562,"Hematological and plasma biochemical examination are crucial in the veterinary 
care of sugar gliders, which are increasingly popular in Taiwan and the United 
States. However, published research of the species' reference interval and 
related influencing factors were rare. The objectives of this study were to 
establish the hematological and plasma biochemical reference values for captive 
sugar gliders in Taiwan and to evaluate the influence of factors including age, 
gender, neuter status, location, season, diet, caging arrangement, and other 
pets in the household. A total of 42 clinically healthy pet sugar gliders were 
recruited. Morphometrical measurements and physiological data were collected, 
and hematological and plasma biochemical examinations were performed. The 
reference value of each index was calculated using Reference Value Advisor (RVA) 
software, following the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology 
(ASVCP) guidelines. Normality of data distribution was tested, and data 
transformation was conducted. The parametric method and robust method were used 
to determine reference limits. Univariate analysis was performed, and multiple 
regression models were built for each hematological and plasma biochemical 
parameter. Red blood cell, hematocrit, and hemoglobin levels were higher in 
males, compared to females, while they were lower in the neutered group, 
compared to the intact group. Relative neutrophil counts were higher in elder 
sugar gliders, while relative lymphocyte counts were lower. Aspartate 
transaminase levels were higher in elder sugar gliders, while albumin levels 
were lower. Blood urea nitrogen levels were highest in spring. The blood profile 
and related effects presented in this study can provide useful information for 
veterinary care in pet sugar gliders."
1563,"Anaplasma infection has not previously been reported as a cause of 
photosensitization. This case presents a five-year-old Holstein cow in her fifth 
month of gestation with skin injury of nonpigmented areas clearly delimited from 
adjacent unaffected pigmented skin. Specific lesions included alopecia, 
localized oedema, desquamation erythema, serous exudation, thick detached skin, 
fissures, crusting, and necrosis, indicating photodermatitis. Hematological 
abnormalities were leukocytosis with neutrophilia and normocytic hypochromic 
anemia. Based on a hemoparasitic examination of blood smears, the organism 
Anaplasma spp. was observed within the red blood cells. Biochemical analyses 
revealed increased serum liver enzyme activity associated with hepatocellular 
damage and cholestasis. This cow was RT-PCR positive for Anaplasma spp. 
infection. After treatment with oxytetracycline started, its condition improved 
within 24 h, and it recovered completely within 30 days. In this case, the 
underlying pathogenic mechanism of Anaplasma spp. infection facilitated the 
impairment of bile flow and liver function, resulting in hepatogenous 
photosensitization."
1564,"This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of oral gavage of dextran sodium 
sulfate (DSS) to establish an enteric inflammation model in broilers. Forty 
1-day-old male, yellow-feathered broilers were randomly divided into 2 groups 
with 5 replicates of 4 birds each for a 42-day trial. The experiment design used 
2 groups: (1) the control group (CT), normal broilers fed a basal diet, and (2) 
the DSS group, DSS-treated broilers fed a basal diet. The DSS group received 1 
mL of 2.5% DSS solution once a day by oral gavage from 21 to 29 days of age. The 
results showed that compared with those in CT, DSS treatment significantly 
increased histological scores for enteritis and mucosal damage at 29 and 42 days 
of age (p &lt; 0.01) and the disease activity index (DAI) from 23 to 29 days of 
age (p &lt; 0.01). DSS-treated broilers showed poor growth performance at 42 
days of age, including decreased body weight and average daily gain and an 
increased feed conversion ratio (p &lt; 0.01). DSS also caused gross lesions and 
histopathological damage in the jejunum of broilers, such as obvious hemorrhagic 
spots, loss of villus architecture, epithelial cell disruption, inflammatory 
cell infiltration, and decreased villus height. These results suggest that oral 
gavage of DSS is an effective method for inducing mild and non-necrotic enteric 
inflammation in broilers."
1565,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus D2/CSL 
(L-1 × 109 cfu/kg feed/day) on biochemical parameters, faecal score (FS), cecal 
pH, gut morphometry, microbiota and cecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) in 
rabbits. Three zootechnical trials were performed and in each trial 30 rabbits 
were allotted to two groups; a probiotic group (L) and a control group (C). At 
slaughter (day 45), samples of blood, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, liver and spleen 
were collected and submitted to histomorphometric analyses. Blood biochemical 
analyses, cecal microbiota and SCFAs determination were also performed. In trial 
1 and 3, L. acidophilus D2/CSL did not affect productive parameters (p &gt; 
0.05). However, L group of trial 1 showed a lower morbidity and mortality 
compared to the control. In trial 2, C group showed a higher daily feed intake 
(p = 0.018) and a positive statistical tendency for live weight and average 
daily gain (p = 0.068). On the contrary, albumin was higher and ALFA-1 globulin 
was lower in the C group compared to L (p &lt; 0.05). In all the trials, FS, 
cecal pH, histomorphometry, microbiota and SCFAs were unaffected. In conclusion, 
L. acidophilus D2/CSL did not impair growth performances, gut and rabbit's 
health, reducing morbidity and mortality."
1566,"An 8-year-old female neutered Labrador retriever was presented for a second 
opinion consultation due to vomiting and lethargy, having failed to respond to 
symptomatic therapy. Blood analysis revealed hyperbilirubinemia and 
hypoalbuminemia, associated with hypocobalaminemia. An abdominal ultrasound 
identified diffused bowel thickening and hypoechoic hepatomegaly. An 
ultrasound-guided liver fine-needle aspiration was performed for cytology and 
also for cell block immunocytochemistry. Gastric and duodenal biopsies were 
collected by gastroduodenoscopy. Liver cytology showed numerous lymphocytes, 
suggesting lymphoma at the hepatic infiltration stage, and immunocytochemistry 
in the cell block of the hepatic aspirate indicated co-expression of CD3 and 
CD20 in the lymphoid cells present. The histopathology of gastric and duodenal 
biopsies supported the hypothesis of gastrointestinal lymphoma due to heavy 
lymphoid infiltration of the gastric epithelium and intestinal mucosa, including 
the villi. Concurrent immunohistochemistry was performed using CD3, CD20, PAX5, 
and CD79αcy antibodies. Immunomarking was positive for CD3 and CD20, which 
overlapped populations of lymphoid cells, and was negative for all other 
antibodies. In the clonality test, lymphocyte co-expression of CD3 and CD20 was 
confirmed by monoclonal rearrangement of T-cell gamma receptors. The final 
diagnosis was type 2 enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma with hepatic 
infiltration. Co-expression was examined in conjunction with the PARR result in 
the presence of T-cell monoclonal rearrangement."
1567,"To determine the optimal timing for performing castration on goats, eighteen 
male Nubian crossbred goats were randomly assigned to two groups and castrated 
at 3 months and 6 months of age, respectively. Daily dry matter intake, biweekly 
body weights, and ultrasonic measurements of longissimus dorsi muscle growth 
were recorded. Results indicated that there was no significant difference 
between the two groups in terms of the blood parameter analysis (except 
testosterone, 0.36 ± 0.26 vs. 3.61 ± 0.27 ng/mL at 25 weeks old), economic 
analysis, and growth performance, including final body weight, total weight 
gain, average daily gain, total dry-matter intake, and feed conversion ratio (p 
&gt; 0.05). However, the longissimus dorsi muscle depth of goats castrated at 6 
months of age was significantly higher than that of goats castrated at 3 months 
of age. In conclusion, castration timing does not have a significant effect on 
the growth performance of goats; therefore, castrating goats at 3 months of age 
may be the best practice considering animal welfare and possible risks 
associated with late castration."
1568,"This study was performed to investigate the effects of apparent metabolizable 
energy (AMEn) and protein levels on laying performance, egg quality, blood 
parameters, blood biochemistry, and apparent total tract digestibility of energy 
and nutrients in diets fed to laying hens in an aviary system. A total of 560 
Hy-Line Brown laying hens (age = 30 week) were distributed in a completely 
randomized experimental design in 2 × 2 factorial arrangements with 2 
metabolizable energy levels (2700 and 2800 kcal AMEn/kg) and 2 protein levels 
(16.5 and 14.5% CP). Four treatments and four replicates of 40 birds each 
(stocking density = 15 birds/m2) were prepared. Results revealed no significant 
interaction between AMEn and CP in the diet in terms of egg production, floor 
eggs, broken and dirty egg production, egg mass, feed intake, and feed 
conversion ratio of laying hens. However, egg weight was affected. As dietary 
energy and CP levels (2800 kcal of AMEn/kg and 16.5% CP) increased, egg weight 
increased (p &lt; 0.05). Egg weight, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio 
significantly differed (p &lt; 0.05) as the energy content in the feed 
increased. Ether extract significantly varied (p &lt; 0.05) as the energy 
content in the feed increased. In conclusion, laying performance and egg quality 
of Hy-Line Brown laying hens in the middle stage of egg production (30 to 50 
weeks) were not affected by different dietary energy and protein levels, but 
feed intake decreased with an increasing level of AMEn in diets. Ether extract 
significantly varied as the energy content in the feed increased."
1569,"A total of 256 male Ross 308 chickens were assigned to four treatments in a 2 × 
2 factorial design with two levels of the anticoccidial vaccine (ACV) Livacox T 
(none or 1 × dose) with or without dietary supplementation with the probiotic 
Protexin® (P). The growth performance parameters for the test periods (1-21, 
22-42, and 1-42 d) and oocyst per gram (OPG) at weekly intervals were analysed. 
Blood samples were collected at 16 post-vaccination (pv) days to measure 
selected haematological, biochemical, redox, and immunological parameters. ACV 
administration worsened the performance parameters of the chickens for 1-21 d 
pv, while supplementation with P reduced this negative effect with a significant 
improvement in 1-21 d body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. ACV 
administration increased % phagocytic cells (%PC), phagocytic index (PI), 
respiratory burst activity, proportion of monocytes, and activities of aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase, while it decreased the 
catalase activity and concentration of malondialdehyde and peroxides. The 
dietary administration of P significantly increased counts of red blood cells 
and white blood cells and increased %PC and PI, while it decreased the 
heterophil proportion, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.059), and alanine 
aminotransferase and AST activities. The oocyst counts were comparable in all 
sampling periods, except on 14 d pv, as supplementation with P significantly 
decreased 14 d OPG, thus indicating a positive influence of P on immunity 
development. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with P led to improved 
performance, better immunity, and benefits in health status in broilers 
vaccinated with the ACV, without interfering with the circulating vaccine 
strains."
1570,"Agriophyllum squarrosum (sand rice), a widespread desert plant, possesses 
anti-hyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory properties, and has been used in 
traditional Chinese medicine for many years. However, its effects on ruminants 
are unknown. To fill this gap, we examined the effects of A. squarrosum on the 
immune and anti-inflammatory responses of lambs. A total of 23, 6-month-old Tan 
ewe-lambs (27.6 ± 0.47 kg) were divided into four groups and offered a basic 
diet (C-control), or a diet that contained 10%, 20%, or 30% A. squarrosum, on a 
dry matter basis, for 128 days. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol were 
lower (p = 0.004) in the 30% supplemented lambs than controls, while 
concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower (p = 0.006) in 
the 10% and 20%, but not in 30% supplemented lambs than controls. Serum-cortisol 
concentrations were lower (p = 0.012) in the 30% supplemented lambs and free 
fatty acid concentrations were higher in the 10% and 20% supplemented lambs than 
in control lambs (p &lt; 0.001). Supplementation with A. squarrosum decreased (p 
&lt; 0.05) the area of adipocytes in subcutaneous adipose tissue, but there was 
no difference between the 20% and 30% diets. Conversely, the area in visceral 
adipose tissue (VAT) increased (p &lt; 0.05), especially for the 10% and 20% 
supplemented diets. Supplementation with A. squarrosum also enriched immune and 
anti-inflammatory related and lipid and glucose-metabolic pathways and 
associated differentially expressed gene expressions in adipose tissue. A total 
of 10 differential triacylglycerol, 34 differential phosphatidylcholines and 
seven differential phosphatidylethanolamines decreased in the diet with 30% 
supplementation, when compared to the other diets. Finally, 
adipocyte-differentiation genes, and immune and inflammatory response-related 
gene expression levels decreased in lamb adipocytes cultured with an aqueous A. 
squarrosum extract. In conclusion, supplementing lamb diets with A. squarrosum 
reduced blood lipids, enhanced immunity and anti-inflammatory capacities, and 
mediated lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and adipocytes of Tan lambs. A level 
of approximately 10% is recommended, but further research is required to 
determine the precise optimal level."
1571,"This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of red cell distribution width 
(RDW) RDW-to-calcium ratio (RDW/Ca), neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio (N/L), 
platelets-to-lymphocytes ratio (P/L) and other easy to obtain and inexpensive 
hematological and biochemical parameters in dogs with acute pancreatitis. This 
is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study including 70 client-owned dogs. The 
accuracy of clinical and laboratory variables to predict short-term death (i.e., 
dead by 14 days) was tested by calculating the area under the receiver-operating 
characteristic curve (AUC). Independent predictors of death were identified 
using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model. The survival 
rate was 72.9% (51 dogs) and 19 dogs died within 14 days of admission from AP. 
RDW and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) had good accuracy to predict short-term dead 
with AUC of 0.74 and 0.70 at the cut-off of &gt;12.7% and &gt;42 mg/dL, 
respectively. According to the multivariable model, RDW (hazard ratio and 95% 
confidence interval [HR, 95% CI] = 5.08, 95% CI = 1.14-22.67; p = 0.03), BUN (HR 
= 1.00, 95% CI = 1.00-1.01; p &lt; 0.01) and bilirubin (HR = 2.46, 95% CI = 
1.38-4.39; p &lt; 0.01) were independent predictors of death. The results 
indicate that RDW, BUN and bilirubin are useful predictors of short-term death 
in dogs with acute pancreatitis."
1572,"this study aimed to investigate the growth mechanism in a local breed of 
chickens by comparing the highest weight (HW) and the lowest weight in their 
microbiota, histological characteristics, and gene expression. Golden Montazah 
chickens, an Egyptian breed, were reared until they were 49 days old. All of the 
birds were fed ad libitum by a starter diet from day 1 until day 21, followed by 
a grower diet from day 21 to the end of the study. At 49 days old, the 
forty-eight birds with the heaviest body weight (HW) and the lightest body 
weight (LW) were chosen. Blood biochemical and histological morphometric 
parameters, electron microscopy, and intestinal nutrient transporter gene 
expression were studied in the sampled jejunum. The microbial composition and 
functions of the content and mucosa in HW and LW chickens were studied using 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing. The histological morphometric parameters were all more 
significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased in the HW chickens than in the LW 
chickens. Total protein, albumin, and triglycerides in serum were significantly 
higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the HW chickens than in the LW chickens. The microbiome 
profile in the gut showed that Microbacterium and Sphingomonas were positively 
correlated with the body weights. In the local breed, there were significant 
differences in the intestinal microstructure which could enhance the growth 
mechanism and body weight. Our findings showed that some microbial components 
were significantly associated with body weight and their interactions with the 
host could be inferred to explain why these interactions might alter the host's 
metabolic responses. Further investigation into combining bioinformatics with 
lab experiments in chickens will help us to understand how gut bacteria can 
change the host's metabolism by special metabolic features in the 
gastrointestinal system."
1573,"This study evaluated the influence of environmental temperature on 
thermoregulation, hormonal, and hematological characteristics in Caracu cattle. 
Blood samples, hair length, coat and muzzle colors, rectal (RT), and surface 
temperatures were collected from 48 males and 43 females before (morning) and 
after sun exposure for eight hours (afternoon). Infrared thermography (IRT) was 
used to identify superficial temperature that exhibits a high correlation with 
RT. Hematological parameters, hormone concentrations, RT, and the superficial 
temperature obtained by IRT that exhibited the highest correlation with RT were 
evaluated by variance analysis. Regarding IRT, the lower left side of the body 
(LS) showed the highest correlation with the RT. Interaction between period and 
sex was observed for LS, cortisol, and eosinophils. Cortisone, progesterone, and 
RT were influenced by period and sex. Neutrophils and segmented neutrophils were 
influenced by the period, which showed the highest concentrations after sun 
exposure. Platelets, leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes were influenced by 
sex. Heat stress changes several physiological characteristics where males and 
females exhibited differences in their responses to heat stress. Furthermore, 
most characteristics evaluated remained within the regular values observed for 
taurine Creole breeds, showing that Caracu is adapted to tropical climates."
1574,"Veterinary facility admissions of wild animals are increasing alongside the 
interest in wildlife diseases. To improve animal welfare, it is therefore 
important to increase veterinarians' knowledge of wild animal medicine and to 
improve the clinical and diagnostic procedures, especially in the case of 
patients affected by trauma or multiple traumas. Blood analysis can be a quick 
and minimally invasive way of gathering useful clinical information for adequate 
treatment and management, and, together with a good clinical examination, to 
help predict hospitalisation outcomes. Few papers have reported reference ranges 
for the haematological and biochemical parameters of roe deer. This study 
evaluates the haematological and biochemical parameters in traumatised roe deer 
in relation to animal hospitalisation outcomes. The study was carried out on a 
cohort of 98 roe deer divided into groups according to their age and 
hospitalisation outcome. For each animal, a panel of haematological and 
biochemical parameters was performed. Significant differences were found between 
unweaned (&lt;4 months old) groups in terms of MCV, MCH, CK, creatinine, total 
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin, and between weaned (&gt;4 
months old) groups for total bilirubin. Creatine kinase, creatinine, and 
bilirubin may be useful indicators to correlate with the severity of trauma and 
help predict prognosis."
1575,"The objective was to evaluate the effects of urea with post-ruminal absorption 
in the supplementation of growing Nellore cattle reared on pasture during a 
seasonal period. For the study, two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, 
rumen and blood parameters were evaluated using eight rumen-cannulated Nellore 
bulls with initial body weight (BW) of 763 ± 44 kg, distributed in a double 
Latin square 4 × 4. In experiment 2, 120 Nellore steers with initial BW of 380 ± 
35 kg were used for performance evaluation, distributed in a randomized block 
design (blocking factor or initial BW). The evaluated treatments were 1: (TP-U) 
(control) = supplement with 24% crude protein (CP) containing urea as a source 
of non-protein nitrogen (NPN; 3%) and soybean meal, 2: (TP-PRU) = 24% CP 
supplement containing post-ruminal urea (PRU; 3.6%) and soybean meal; 3: 
(NPN-U-PRU) = 24% CP supplement containing urea + post-ruminal urea (U = 3% and 
PRU = 3.9%), without soybean meal; 4: (NPN-PRU) = supplement with 24% CP 
containing post-ruminal urea (7.5%), without soybean meal. The supplement was 
offered at 3 g/kg BW per animal, daily, once a day. All animals were kept on 
Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu pasture. Statistical analyses were performed 
using the SAS PROC MIXED, and the data were evaluated by the following 
contrasts: C1 = TP-U/TP-PRU vs. NPN-U-PRU/NPN-PRU (Soybean meal replacement by 
NPN); C2 = TP-U vs. TP-PRU (conventional urea vs. post-immune urea); C3 = 
NPN-U-PRU vs. NPN-PRU (low and high post-ruminal urea-PRU level). The 
digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and NDF was lower when soybean meal 
was replaced by non-protein nitrogen, also being different between the levels of 
post-ruminal urea used in the supplement. Ruminal pH was different when soybean 
meal was replaced by NPN (p = 0.003). Total concentration of short-chain fatty 
acids, concentrations of isobutyrate (p = 0.003), valerate (p = 0.001), and 
isovalerate (p = 0.001) were different, and blood urea was different when 
soybean meal was replaced by NPN (p = 0.006). Simpson's diversity index was 
higher in the rumen of animals supplemented with TP-U than in those supplemented 
with TP-PRU (p = 0.05). A total of 27 phyla, 234 families, and 488 genera were 
identified. Nitrospirota and Gemmatimonadota phyla were detected just in the 
rumen of steers supplemented with TP-PRU. The performance (final BW, weight gain 
and gain per area) of the animals was different, being higher (p = 0.04) in 
animals supplemented with soybean meal, compared to NPN. The removal of soybean 
meal from the supplement and its replacement with either conventional urea plus 
post-ruminal urea or only post-ruminal urea compromises the performance of the 
animals. The lower the post-ruminal urea inclusion level, the lower the apparent 
digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and NDF, when compared to animals 
supplemented with higher levels."
1576,"Infections due to Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Dirofilaria, Mycoplasma, Babesia and 
Hepatozoon continue to be highly prevalent in dogs, especially in tropical and 
subtropical areas, where vectors of many of them are present. However, many 
clinical aspects of dogs have not been characterized in detail, including 
assessing the haematological alterations associated with them, particularly in 
Colombia and Latin America. A group of 100 dogs with Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, 
Dirofilaria, Mycoplasma, Babesia and Hepatozoon infections/exposure were 
assessed by blood smear serology (SNAP4DX) and PCR in Pereira, Colombia. We 
performed blood counts to evaluate anaemia, leukopenia/leukocytosis, 
neutropenia, neutrophilia, lymphopenia/lymphocytosis, monocytosis, eosinophilia, 
and thrombocytopenia, among other alterations. Bivariate analyses were performed 
on Stata®14, with significant p &lt; 0.05. From the total, 85% presented ≥1 
infection (past or present), 66% with coinfections (≥2 pathogens) (Ehrlichia 
75%), and 89% presented clinical alterations. A total of 100% showed anaemia, 
70% thrombocytopenia, 61% monocytosis, and 47% neutropenia, among other 
alterations. Additionally, 11% presented pancytopenia and 59% bicytopenia. The 
median platelet count was lower in infected dogs (126,000 cells/μL) versus 
non-infected (221,000 cells/μL) (p = 0.003). Thrombocytopenia was higher among 
infected dogs (75%) versus non-infected (40%) (p = 0.006), with a 91% positive 
predictive value for infection. Median neutrophil count was lower in infected 
dogs (6591 cells/μL) versus non-infected (8804 cells/μL) (p = 0.013). 
Lymphocytosis occurred only among those infected (27%) (p = 0.022). Leukopenia 
was only observed among infected dogs (13%). Pancytopenia was only observed 
among infected dogs. Ehrlichiosis and other hematic infections have led to a 
significant burden of haematological alterations on infected dogs, including 
pancytopenia in a tenth of them, most with thrombocytopenia and all anemic."
1577,"Animal husbandry conditions, including rodent diet, constitute an example 
highlighting the importance of reporting experimental variables to enhance 
scientific rigor. In the present study, we examine the effects of three common 
rodent diets including two chows (Purina 5015 and Teklad 2019) and one purified 
ingredient diet (AIN-76A) on growth anthropometrics (body weight), behavior 
(nest building, actigraphy, passive avoidance) and blood biomarkers (ketones, 
glucose, amino acid profiles) in male and female C57BL/6J mice. We find 
increased body weight in response to the chows compared to purified ingredient 
diet albeit selectively in male mice. We did not find significantly altered 
behavior in female or male wild type C57BL/6J mice. However, amino acid profiles 
changed as an effect of sex and diet. These data contribute to a growing body of 
knowledge indicating that rodent diet impacts experimental outcomes and needs to 
be considered in study design and reporting."
1578,"Exercise, including resistance exercise with high loads, has positive 
hemodynamic responses such as reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), Pressure Product Rate (PPR), and 
estimated myocardial oxygen volume (MVO2). Caffeine (CA), used to improve 
performance, tends to interfere with BP and HR. This study aimed to analyze the 
effects of CA supplementation on hemodynamic indicators in Paralympic 
weightlifting (PP). The exercise was performed on 14 male athletes (32.4 ± 8.5 
years; 81.7 ± 21.9 kg) for three weeks. Two conditions were evaluated: 
supplementation with CA Anhydrous 9 mg/kg and with placebo (PL). The adapted 
bench press was used, with 5 × 5 at 80% 1RM. We evaluated BP, HR, PPR, and MVO2, 
before, after, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 min, and 24 h later. The CA presented 
higher absolute values in the pressure indicators than the PL, and after 24 h 
there was an inversion. The HR was higher in the CA and showed a reduction after 
10 min. The PPR and MVO2 in the CA presented absolute values greater than the 
PL, and 24 h later there was an inversion. There was no hypotensive effect, but 
the use of CA did not present risks related to PPR and MVO2, demonstrating the 
safe use of this supplement in adapted strength sports."
1579,"Diabetes is a chronic disease with a high mortality rate worldwide and can cause 
other diseases such as kidney damage, narrowing of blood vessels, and heart 
disease. The concomitant use of drugs such as metformin, sulfonylurea, miglitol, 
and acarbose may cause side effects with long-term administration. Therefore, 
natural ingredients are the best choice, considering that their long-term side 
effects are not significant. One of the compounds that can be used as a 
candidate antidiabetic is mangostin; however, information on the molecular 
mechanism needs to be further analyzed through molecular docking, simulating 
molecular dynamics, and testing the in silico antidiabetic potential. This study 
focused on modeling the protein structure, molecular docking, and molecular 
dynamics simulations and analyses. This process produces RMSD values, free 
energies, and intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Based on the analysis results, 
all molecular dynamics simulations can occur under physiological conditions, and 
γ-mangostin is the best among the test compounds."
1580,"BACKGROUND: In children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), volume 
overload (VO) is inevitable, and the right ventricle (RV) pumps blood into the 
systemic circulation. Understanding the molecular differences and their 
different responses to VO between the RV and left ventricle (LV) at the neonatal 
and highly plastic stages may improve the long-term management of children with 
HLHS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A neonatal rat ventricular VO model was established by the 
creation of a fistula between the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta on 
postnatal day 1 (P1) and confirmed by echocardiographic and histopathological 
analyses. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that some of the major 
differences between a normal neonatal RV and LV were associated with the thyroid 
hormone and insulin signaling pathways. Under the influence of VO, the levels of 
insulin receptors and thyroid hormone receptors were significantly increased in 
the LV but decreased in the RV. The transcriptomic analysis also demonstrated 
that under the influence of VO, the top two common enriched pathways between the 
RV and LV were the insulin and thyroid hormone signaling pathways, whereas the 
RV-specific enriched pathways were primarily associated with lipid metabolism 
and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC); further, the 
LV-specific enriched pathways were primarily associated with nucleic acid 
metabolism and microRNAs in cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Insulin and thyroid hormones may play critical roles in the 
differences between a neonatal RV and LV as well as their common responses to 
VO. Regarding the isolated responses to VO, the RV favors an ARVC change and the 
LV favors a reduction in microRNAs in cancer. The current study suggests that 
insulin, thyroid hormone, and cancer-associated microRNAs are potential 
therapeutic targets that should be explored by basic science studies to improve 
the function of the RV to match that of the LV."
1581,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a severe disease mostly caused by asbestos 
exposure. Today, one of the best available biomarkers is the soluble 
mesothelin-related protein (SMRP), also known as mesothelin. Recent studies have 
shown that mesothelin levels are influenced by individual genetic variability. 
This study aimed to investigate the influence of three mesothelin (MSLN) gene 
variants (SNPs) in the 5'-untranslated promoter region (5'-UTR), MSLN rs2235503 
C &gt; A, rs3764246 A &gt; G, rs3764247 A &gt; C, and one (rs1057147 G &gt; A) 
in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the MSLN gene on plasma concentrations 
of mesothelin in 410 asbestos-exposed males without cancer and 43 males with 
prediagnostic MM (i.e., with MM diagnosed later on) from the prospective MoMar 
study, as well as 59 males with manifest MM from Germany. The mesothelin 
concentration differed significantly between the different groups (p &lt; 
0.0001), but not between the prediagnostic and manifest MM groups (p = 0.502). 
Five to eight mutations of the four SNP variants studied were associated with 
increased mesothelin concentrations (p = 0.001). The highest mesothelin 
concentrations were observed for homozygous variants of the three promotor SNPs 
in the 5'-UTR (p &lt; 0.001), and the highest odds ratio for an elevated 
mesothelin concentration was observed for MSLN rs2235503 C &gt; A. The four 
studied SNPs had a clear influence on the mesothelin concentration in plasma. 
Hence, the analysis of these SNPs may help to elucidate the diagnostic 
background of patients displaying increased mesothelin levels and might help to 
reduce false-positive results when using mesothelin for MM screening in 
high-risk groups."
1582,"Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are a family of enzymes synthesizing DNA using RNA 
as a template and serving as indispensable tools in studies related to RNA. 
M-MuLV RT and its analogs are the most commonly used RTs. RTs are widely applied 
in various diagnostics methods, including reverse-transcription loop-mediated 
isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). However, the performance of different RTs in 
LAMP remains relatively unknown. Here, we report on the first direct comparison 
of various M-MuLV RTs in RT-LAMP, including enzymes with a different number of 
mutations and fusions with Sto7d. Several parameters were assessed, namely: 
optimal reaction temperature, enzyme concentration, reverse transcription time, 
a minimal amount of RNA template, and tolerance to inhibitors. Mutations 
increased the optimal reaction temperature from 55 °C to 60-65 °C. All of the 
RTs were suitable for RT-LAMP with RNA templates in the range of 101-106 copies 
per reaction. Highly mutated enzymes were 1.5-3-fold more tolerant to whole 
blood, blood plasma, and guanidinium, but they were two-fold more sensitive to 
high concentrations of NaCl. The comparison of different RTs presented here 
could be helpful for selecting the optimal enzyme when developing novel 
LAMP-based diagnostic tests."
1583,"The molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress tolerance in animals to high 
temperatures remain unclear. This study identified the differentially expressed 
mRNA isoforms which narrowed down the most reliable DEG markers and molecular 
pathways that underlie the mechanisms of thermoregulation. This experiment was 
performed on Sprague Dawley rats housed at 22 °C (control group; CT), and three 
acute heat-stressed groups housed at 42 °C for 30 min (H30), 60 min (H60), and 
120 min (H120). Earlier, we demonstrated that acute heat stress increased the 
rectal temperature of rats, caused abnormal changes in the blood biochemical 
parameters, as well as induced dramatic changes in the expression levels of 
genes through epigenetics and post-transcriptional regulation. Transcriptomic 
analysis using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data obtained previously from blood (CT 
and H120), liver (CT, H30, H60, and H120), and adrenal glands (CT, H30, H60, and 
H120) was performed. The differentially expressed mRNA isoforms (DEIs) were 
identified and annotated by the CLC Genomics Workbench. Biological process and 
metabolic pathway analyses were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. A total of 225, 5764, and 
4988 DEIs in the blood, liver, and adrenal glands were observed. Furthermore, 
the number of novel differentially expressed transcript lengths with annotated 
genes and novel differentially expressed transcript with non-annotated genes 
were 136 and 8 in blood, 3549 and 120 in the liver, as well as 3078 and 220 in 
adrenal glands, respectively. About 35 genes were involved in the heat stress 
response, out of which, Dnaja1, LOC680121, Chordc1, AABR07011951.1, Hsp90aa1, 
Hspa1b, Cdkn1a, Hmox1, Bag3, and Dnaja4 were commonly identified in the liver 
and adrenal glands, suggesting that these genes may regulate heat stress 
response through interactions between the liver and adrenal glands. In 
conclusion, this study would enhance our understanding of the complex underlying 
mechanisms of acute heat stress, and the identified mRNA isoforms and genes can 
be used as potential candidates for thermotolerance selection in mammals."
1584,"The main aim of this study was to compare the performance over different 
distances, the critical velocity (CV), and plasma acylcarnitines/amino acids of 
male and female adolescent swimmers. Moreover, we applied the complex network 
approach to identify which molecules are associated with athletes' performances. 
On the first day under a controlled environment, blood samples were collected 
after 12 h of overnight fasting. Performance trials (100, 200, 400, and 800-m) 
were randomly performed in the subsequent four days in a swimming pool, and CV 
was determined by linear distance versus time mathematical function. Metabolomic 
analyses were carried out on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer performing 
electrospray ionization in the positive ionization mode. No difference was 
observed between the performance of male and female swimmers. Except for 200-m 
distance (p = 0.08), plasma tyrosine was positively and significantly associated 
with the female times during the trials (100-m, p = 0.04; 400-m, p = 0.04; 
800-m, p = 0.02), and inversely associated with the CV (p = 0.02). The complex 
network approach showed that glycine (0.406), glutamine (0.400), arginine 
(0.335), free carnitine (0.355), tryptophan (0.289), and histidine (0.271) were 
the most influential nodes to reach tyrosine. These results revealed a thread 
that must be explored in further randomized/controlled designs, improving the 
knowledge surrounding nutrition and the performance of adolescent swimmers."
1585,"The use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is expanding. This study evaluates the 
modulator effect of eugenol (Eug) on AgNP-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Sixty 
male rats were separated into six groups: control, Eug, AgNPs low-dose, AgNPs 
high-dose, Eug + AgNPs low-dose, and Eug + AgNPs high-dose. After 30 days, 
kidney function, antioxidative and proinflammatory status, histopathological, 
histomorphometrical, and immunohistochemical assessments were performed. AgNPs 
markedly induced oxidative stress in renal tissues, characterized by increased 
levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, kidney injury molecule-1, 
the total oxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-α), and interleukin-6, as well as decreased levels of the total antioxidant 
capacity, superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, and glutathione 
peroxidase. Moreover, the normal renal architecture was destroyed, and the 
thickness of the renal capsules, cortex, and medulla, alongside the diameter and 
quantity of the normal Malpighian corpuscles and the proximal and distal 
convoluted tubules were decreased. Immunoreactivity for P53, caspase-3, and 
TNF-α reactive proteins were significantly increased; however, Bcl-2 
immunoreactivity was decreased. Eug reversed most biochemical, histological, 
histomorphometrical, and immunohistochemical changes in AgNP-treated animals. 
This study demonstrated that nephrotoxicity in AgNP-treated rats was mitigated 
by an Eug supplementation. Eug's antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and 
anti-inflammatory capabilities were the key in modulating AgNPs nephrotoxicity."
1586,"BACKGROUND: Although Flavobacterium psychrophilum is recognized as the causative 
pathogen of rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS), often resulting in high fry 
mortality, it is also responsible for bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) in 
large and older rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). These older fish do not 
experience high mortality, but sustain, through the shedding of bacteria, a 
constant infection pressure at farm level, which exposes fry to an unnecessary 
infection risk. We have produced and assessed the immunogenicity of an 
experimental injection BCWD vaccine, which may be used to decrease the shedding 
of bacteria from older fish.
METHODS: A total of 800 fish were i.p.-injected: 200 fish received the bacterin 
with adjuvant, 200 fish received the bacterin alone, 200 fish received adjuvant 
alone and 200 fish were injected with physiological saline. Blood samples were 
taken at day 0 and at three different time points (4, 8 and 14 weeks) 
post-vaccination. Plasma antibody levels were measured by ELISA for reactivity 
against both the homologous F. psychrophilum vaccine strain (serotype Fd) and 
heterologous strains (serotype Th).
RESULTS: Significantly elevated antibody titers were found against all serotypes 
in vaccinated fish. Welfare parameters associated with the vaccination process 
were evaluated by analyzing trout plasma samples for six different biochemical 
parameters, but no adverse effects associated with injection were indicated.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that an injection vaccine containing 
formalin-inactivated whole cells of F. psychrophilum (serotype Fd), adjuvanted 
with FIA, may also induce protection against heterologous strains. We advocate 
for, as the next step, the performance of field trials evaluating if the 
vaccination of older rainbow trout will (1) reduce the infection pressure in 
farms, (2) elevate the general health level in all groups and (3) minimize F. 
psychrophilum infection in fry at farm level. This may reduce the need for the 
administration of antibiotics in all age classes."
1587,"BACKGROUND: the effect on liver function markers and inflammation of the 
different content of phytosterols in lipid emulsions (LEs) used in the 
parenteral nutrition (PN) regimen of adult home PN (HPN) patients is not clear.
METHODS: plasma phytosterol and cytokine concentrations, fatty acid composition, 
liver function markers, and triglycerides were measured in 58 adult HPN patients 
receiving one of three different LEs (soybean oil-based: Intralipid; olive 
oil-based: ClinOleic; containing fish oil: SMOFLipid).
RESULTS: patients receiving Intralipid had higher plasma campesterol and 
stigmasterol concentrations than those receiving ClinOleic or SMOFLipid. Plasma 
sterol concentrations were not different between patients receiving ClinOleic 
and SMOFLipid. Differences in plasma fatty acids reflected the fatty acid 
composition of the LEs. Markers of liver function did not differ among the three 
groups. Blood triglycerides were higher with ClinOleic than with Intralipid or 
SMOFLipid. Total bilirubin correlated positively with the plasma concentrations 
of two of the phytosterols, ALT correlated positively with one, AST with one, 
and GGT with three.
CONCLUSIONS: liver function markers correlate with plasma plant sterol 
concentrations in adult HPN patients. Adult HPN patients receiving SMOFLipid are 
more likely to have liver function markers and triglycerides within the normal 
range than those receiving ClinOleic or Intralipid. The omega-3 fatty acids in 
SMOFLipid may act to mitigate the adverse effects of plant sterols on liver 
function."
1588,"A new cell line Japanese flounder spleen (JFSP) derived from the spleen of 
Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) was established and characterized in 
this study. The JFSP cells grew rapidly at 29 °C, and the optimum fetal bovine 
serum concentration in the L-15 medium was 15%. Cells were subcultured for more 
than 80 passages. The JFSP cells have a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 68, 
which differs from the chromosome number of normal diploid Japanese flounder. 
The established cells were susceptible to Bohle virus (BIV), Viral hemorrhagic 
septicemia virus (VHSV), Hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV), Infectious hematopoietic 
necrosis virus (IHNV), and Lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV), as evidenced by 
varying degrees of cytopathic effects (CPE). Replication of the virus in JFSP 
cells was confirmed by qRT-PCR and transmission electron microscopy. In 
addition, the expression of four immune-related genes, TRAF3, IL-1β, TNF-α, and 
TLR2, was differentially altered following viral infection. The results 
indicated that the cells underwent an antiviral immune response. JFSP cell line 
is an ideal tool in vitro for virology. The use of fish cell lines to study the 
immune genes and immune mechanism of fish and to clarify the immune mechanism of 
fish has important theoretical significance and practical application value for 
the fundamental prevention and treatment of fish diseases."
1589,"Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy (SAE) is common in sepsis patients, with high 
mortality rates. It is believed that neuroinflammation is an important mechanism 
involved in SAE. High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), as a late 
pro-inflammatory factor, is significantly increased during sepsis in different 
brain regions, including the hippocampus. HMGB1 causes neuroinflammation and 
cognitive impairment through direct binding to advanced glycation end products 
(RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Electroacupuncture (EA) at Baihui (GV20) 
and Zusanli (ST36) is beneficial for neurological diseases and experimental 
sepsis. Our study used EA to treat SAE induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in 
male Sprague-Dawley rats. The Y maze test was performed to assess working 
memory. Immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blotting (WB) were used to determine 
neuroinflammation and the HMGB1 signaling pathway. Results showed that EA could 
improve working memory impairment in rats with SAE. EA alleviated 
neuroinflammation by downregulating the hippocampus's HMGB1/TLR4 and HMGB1/RAGE 
signaling, reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, and relieving 
microglial and astrocyte activation. However, EA did not affect the tight 
junctions' expression of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the hippocampus."
1590,"AIM: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature to 
evaluate the incidence of cranial ultrasound abnormalities (CUAs) amongst 
moderate to late preterm (MLPT) and term infants, affected by fetal growth 
restriction (FGR) or those classified as small for gestational age (SGA).
METHODS: A systematic review methodology was performed, and Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was utilised. 
Descriptive and observational studies reporting cranial ultrasound outcomes on 
FGR/SGA MLPT and term infants were included. Primary outcomes reported was 
incidence of CUAs in MLPT and term infants affected by FGR or SGA, with 
secondary outcomes including brain structure development and growth, and 
cerebral artery Dopplers. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed. 
Risk of Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for case-control and 
cohort studies, and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for 
studies reporting prevalence data. GRADE was used to assess for certainty of 
evidence.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 2085 studies identified through the search, seventeen 
were deemed to be relevant and included. Nine studies assessed CUAs in MLPT 
FGR/SGA infants, seven studies assessed CUAs in late preterm and term FGR/SGA 
infants, and one study assessed CUAs in both MLPT and term FGR/SGA infants. The 
incidence of CUAs in MLPT, and late preterm to term FGR/SGA infants ranged from 
0.4 to 33% and 0 to 70%, respectively. A meta-analysis of 7 studies involving 
168,136 infants showed an increased risk of any CUA in FGR infants compared to 
appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants (RR 1.96, [95% CI 1.26-3.04], I2 = 
68%). The certainty of evidence was very low due to non-randomised studies, 
methodological limitations, and heterogeneity. Another meta-analysis looking at 
4 studies with 167,060 infants showed an increased risk of intraventricular 
haemorrhage in FGR/SGA infants compared to AGA infants (RR 2.40, [95% CI 
2.03-2.84], I2 = 0%). This was also of low certainty.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CUAs in MLPT and term growth-restricted infants 
varied widely between studies. Findings from the meta-analyses suggest the risk 
of CUAs and IVH may indeed be increased in these FGR/SGA infants when compared 
with infants not affected by FGR, however the evidence is of low to very low 
certainty. Further specific cohort studies are needed to fully evaluate the 
benefits and prognostic value of cranial ultrasonography to ascertain the need 
for, and timing of a cranial ultrasound screening protocol in this infant 
population, along with follow-up studies to ascertain the significance of CUAs 
identified."
1591,"The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of simple jaw opening and 
closing task of chewing movements on the activities of the prefrontal cortex 
(PFC) from the viewpoint of stress reduction. We measured cerebral blood flow 
(CBF) in the PFC during a block-tapping task of the jaw in healthy participants. 
Eleven young healthy individuals with normal dentition (7 males and 4 females, 
mean age 28.0 ± 3.7 years) volunteered for this study. CBF was measured using a 
wearable, functional near-infrared spectroscopy device. Measurements were taken 
using the central incisors and first molars at interocclusal distances of 5 and 
10 mm. The participants were asked to bite a hard/soft block. CBF in all 
conditions showed limited variability or decreasing trend compared to resting 
state before the task. The main effect was observed for interocclusal distance 
(p = 0.008), and there were no significant differences for measurement area of 
the PFC, tooth type, and material type. An interaction was found between tooth 
type and material type. In conclusion, these results suggest that simple and 
rhythmical chewing motion has an effect of reducing CBF in the PFC and resting 
the PFC, which is an especially notable aspect of periodontal sensory 
information in the molar."
1592,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown elevations in the 
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal associated with, but insensitive for, 
seizure. Rather than evaluating absolute BOLD signal elevations, assessing 
rhythmic oscillations in the BOLD signal with fMRI may improve the accuracy of 
seizure mapping. We report a case of a patient with non-convulsive, right 
hemispheric seizures who underwent fMRI. Unbiased processing methods revealed a 
map of rhythmically oscillating BOLD signal over the cortical region affected by 
seizure, and synchronous BOLD signal in the contralateral cerebellum. 
High-resolution fMRI may help identify the spatial topography of seizure and 
provide insights into seizure physiology."
1593,"Background: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a severe neurological 
event with limited treatment options, and little is known about its 
pathophysiology. There are few objective tools for predicting outcomes of aSAH 
patients and further aiding in directing clinical therapeutic programs. This 
study aimed to determine whether an elevated serum D-dimer/albumin ratio (DAR) 
reflects disease severity and predicts aSAH outcomes. Methods: We included 178 
patients with aSAH. Data included demographics; clinical severity of aSAH (World 
Federation of Neurological Societies (WFNS) grade and Hunt-Hess grade); levels 
of D-dimer, albumin, and c-reactive protein (CRP); leukocyte counts on 
admission; and three-month outcomes. The outcomes were dichotomized into good 
and poor. The predictive ability of DAR for outcomes was determined using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: Serum DAR 
showed a positive correlation with disease severity. Univariate analysis 
revealed that DAR, WFNS grade, Hunt-Hess grade, delayed cerebral infarction 
(DCI), age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and CRP/albumin ratio (CAR) 
were associated with unfavorable outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis 
further revealed that elevated DAR predicted poor outcomes after adjusting for 
WFNS grade, Hunt-Hess grade, DCI, age, NLR, and CRP/albumin ratio. Receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that DAR predicted outcomes at 
a level comparable with NLR and CAR and had superior predictivity than D-dimer 
alone. Conclusion: DAR is a promising objective tool for aSAH outcome 
prediction. A high content DAR was associated with disease severity and 
unfavorable short-term outcomes."
1594,"BACKGROUND: New trials are planned regularly to provide the highest quality of 
evidence and invade new occlusion territories, which requires a pre-defined 
reporting strategy with consistent, common data elements for more 
straightforward collective evidence synthesis. We sought to review all active 
endovascular thrombectomy trials to investigate their patient selection 
criteria, intervention description, and reported outcomes.
METHODS: A literature search was systematically conducted on clinicaltrials.gov 
for active trials and all intervention, inclusion criteria, and outcomes 
reported were extracted. A qualitative synthesis of the frequency of study 
design types and data elements are graphically and narratively presented.
RESULTS: A total of 32 studies were tagged and included in the final qualitative 
analysis. The inclusion criteria were highly variable, including different 
cut-offs for the last well-known baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke 
Scale, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, and modified Rankin scale (mRS). 
Half of the studies (16/32) mentioned ""thrombectomy"" without defining which 
technique or device was used, and the final thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 
scale was provided in 19 (59.4%) studies. Heterogeneity was also present among 
the studies reporting a first-pass effect, both in how studies defined the 
outcome and in used ranges for mRS. Mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) 
were more homogenous in their presentation and follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a great degree of heterogeneity in the active thrombectomy 
trials concerning inclusion criteria, interventions used, and how outcomes are 
being reported."
1595,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to have the 
potential to improve the motor recovery of the affected upper limbs in patients 
with stroke, and recently, several optimized tDCS methods have been proposed to 
magnify its effectiveness. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of 
personalized tDCS using brain MRI-based electrical field simulation and 
optimization, to enhance motor recovery of the upper limbs in the patients. This 
trial is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in the subacute to chronic 
rehabilitation phase. Forty-two adult stroke patients with unilateral upper limb 
involvement will be randomly allocated to three groups: (1) personalized tDCS 
with MRI-based electrical field simulation and optimized stimulation, (2) 
conventional tDCS with bihemispheric stimulation of the primary motor cortex, 
and (3) sham tDCS. All three groups will undergo 10 intervention sessions with 
30 min of 2-mA intensity stimulation, during a regular upper limb rehabilitation 
program over two weeks. The primary outcome measure for the motor recovery of 
the upper limb impairment is the Fugl-Meyer assessment for the upper extremity 
score at the end of the intervention, and the secondary measures include changes 
in the motor evoked potentials, the frequency power and coherence of the 
electroencephalography, performance in activities of daily living, and adverse 
events with a 1-month follow-up assessment. The primary outcome will be analyzed 
on the intention-to-treat principle. There is a paucity of studies regarding the 
effectiveness of personalized and optimized tDCS that considers individual brain 
lesions and electrical field characteristics in the real world. No feasibility 
or pivotal studies have been performed in stroke patients using brain MRI, to 
determine a lesion-specific tDCS simulation and optimization that considers 
obstacles in the segmentation and analysis of the affected brain tissue, such as 
ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions. This trial will contribute to addressing the 
effectiveness and safety of personalized tDCS, using brain MRI-based electrical 
field simulation and optimization, to enhance the motor recovery of the upper 
limbs in patients with stroke."
1596,"Cerebral ischemia impedes the functional or metabolic demands of the central 
nervous system (CNS), which subsequently leads to irreversible brain damage. 
While recanalization of blocked vessels recovers cerebral blood flow, it can 
also aggravate brain injury, termed as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. 
Exosomes, nanometric membrane vesicles, attracted wide attention as carriers of 
biological macromolecules. In the brain, exosomes can be secreted by almost all 
types of cells, and their contents can be altered during the pathological and 
clinical processes of cerebral I/R injury. Herein, we will review the current 
literature on the possible role of cargos derived from exosomes and 
exosomes-mediated intercellular communication in cerebral I/R injury. The PubMed 
and Web of Science databases were searched through January 2015. The studies 
published in English were identified using search terms including ""exosomes"", 
""cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury"", ""brain ischemia-reperfusion injury"", and 
""stroke"". We will also focus on the potential therapeutic effects of stem 
cell-derived exosomes and underlying mechanisms in cerebral I/R injury. 
Meanwhile, with the advantages of low immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, high 
bioavailability, and the capacity to pass through the blood-brain barrier, 
exosomes also attract more attention as therapeutic modalities for the treatment 
of cerebral I/R injury."
1597,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be the limit between the 
cognitive changes of aging and early dementia; thus, discriminating between 
participants with and without MCI is important. In the present study, we aimed 
to examine the differences in the cerebral oxyhemoglobin signal between 
individuals with and without MCI. The cerebral oxyhemoglobin signal was measured 
when the participants (young and elderly controls as well as patients with MCI) 
performed category fluency, finger tapping, and dual tasks using head-mounted 
near-infrared spectroscopy; the results were compared between the groups. The 
cerebral oxyhemoglobin signal trended toward the highest values during the 
category fluency task in young participants and during the finger-tapping task 
in elderly participants regardless of the MCI status. The area under the curve 
was approximately 0.5, indicating a low discrimination ability between elderly 
participants with and without MCI. The measurement of the blood flow in the 
prefrontal cortex may not accurately quantify cognitive and motor performance to 
detect MCI. Finger tapping may increase cerebral blood flow in individuals with 
and without MCI during the task."
1598,"INTRODUCTION: microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs playing a myriad 
of important roles in regulating gene expression. Of note, recent work 
demonstrated a critical role of miRNAs in the genesis and progression of brain 
arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). Accordingly, here we examine miRNA 
signatures related to bAVMs and associated gene expression. In so doing we 
expound on the potential prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic significance of 
miRNAs in the clinical management of bAVMs.
METHODS: A PRISMA-based literature review was performed using PubMed/Medline 
database with the following search terms: ""brain arteriovenous malformations"", 
""cerebral arteriovenous malformations"", ""microRNA"", and ""miRNA"". All preclinical 
and clinical studies written in English, regardless of date, were selected. For 
our bioinformatic analyses, miRWalk and miRTarBase machine learning algorithms 
were employed; the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was 
quired for associated pathways/functions.
RESULTS: four studies were ultimately included in the final analyses. Sequencing 
data consistently revealed the decreased expression of miR-18a in 
bAVM-endothelial cells, resulting in increased levels of vascular endodermal 
growth factor (VEGF), Id-1, matrix metalloproteinase, and growth signals. Our 
analyses also suggest that the downregulation of miR-137 and miR-195* within 
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) may foster the activation of inflammation, 
aberrant angiogenesis, and phenotypic switching. In the peripheral blood, the 
overexpression of miR-7-5p, miR-629-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-200b-3p, and let-7b-5p 
may contribute to endothelial proliferation and nidus development. The machine 
learning algorithms employed confirmed associations between miRNA-related target 
networks, vascular rearrangement, and bAVM progression.
CONCLUSION: miRNAs expression appears to be critical in managing bAVMs' 
post-transcriptional signals. Targets of microRNAs regulate canonical vascular 
proliferation and reshaping. Although additional scientific evidence is needed, 
the identification of bAVM miRNA signatures may facilitate the development of 
novel prognostic/diagnostic tools and molecular therapies for bAVMs."
1599,"Although cladribine induces sustained reductions in peripheral T and B 
lymphocytes, little is known about its effect on axonal damage reduction in 
multiple sclerosis (MS), which could be demonstrated by assessing the serum 
neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels. We investigated the 
reduction/reconstitution of different lymphocyte subsets (LS) by verifying the 
correlation with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) and the variation in 
sNfL levels during cladribine treatment. We analysed 33 highly active relapsing 
MS patients and followed them up for 12 ± 3.3 months; blood samples were 
collected at treatment start (W0) and after 8, 24 and 48 weeks. Seventeen 
patients (60.7%) showed NEDA during the first treatment. At week 8, we observed 
a significant decrease in B memory cells, B regulatory 1 CD19+/CD38+ and B 
regulatory 2 CD19+/CD25+, a significant increase in T regulatory CD4+/CD25+, a 
slight increase in T cytotoxic CD3+/CD8+ and a non-significant decrease in T 
helper CD3+/CD4+. Starting from week 24, the B subsets recovered; however, at 
week 48, CD19+/CD38+ and CD19+/CD25+ reached values near the baseline, while the 
Bmem were significantly lower. The T cell subsets remained unchanged except for 
CD4+/CD25+, which increased compared to W0. The LS changes were not predictive 
of NEDA achievement. The sNfL levels were significantly lower at week 24 (p = 
0.046) vs. baseline. These results could demonstrate how cladribine, by 
inflammatory activity depletion, can also reduce axonal damage, according to the 
sNfL levels."
1600,"Empagliflozin is a relatively new drug that, as an inhibitor of the 
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), causes increased urinary glucose 
excretion and thus contributes to improved glycemic control, better glucose 
metabolism, reduced glucotoxicity and insulin resistance. Although its original 
use was to induce a hypoglycemic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), empagliflozin has also shown a number of other beneficial 
effects by demonstrating a nephroprotective effect, and it has proven to be a 
breakthrough in the treatment of heart failure (HF). Empagliflozin has been 
shown to reduce hospitalizations for HF and the number of deaths from 
cardiovascular causes. Empagliflozin treatment also reduces the incidence of 
renal events, including death from renal causes, as well as the risk of 
end-stage renal failure. Empagliflozin appears to be a fairly well-tolerated and 
safe drug. In patients with inadequate glycemic control, empagliflozin used in 
monotherapy or as an adjunct to therapy effectively lowers fasting blood 
glucose, postprandial blood glucose, average daily glucose levels, glycated 
hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and also leads to significant weight reduction in 
patients with T2DM. Unfortunately, there are some limitations, e.g., severe 
hypersensitivity reaction to the drug and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
&lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. As with any drug, empagliflozin is also characterized by 
several side effects among which symptomatic hypotension, troublesome genital 
fungal infections, urinary tract infections and rare ketoacidosis are 
characteristic."
1601,"Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are 
commonly observed comorbid occurrences among military service members and 
veterans (SMVs). In this cross-sectional study, SMVs with a history of TBI were 
stratified into symptomatic and asymptomatic PTSD groups based on posttraumatic 
stress checklist-civilian (PCL-C) total scores. Blood-based biomarkers were 
assessed, and significant differential markers were associated with scores from 
multiple neurobehavioral self-report assessments. PCL-C cutoffs were total 
scores &gt;50 (PTSD symptomatic) and &lt;25 (asymptomatic). Cytokines IL6, IL8, 
TNFα, and IL10 were significantly elevated (p &lt; 0.05-0.001) in the TBI+/PTSD 
symptomatic group compared to the TBI+/asymptomatic group. Cytokine levels of 
IL8, TNFα, and IL10 were strongly associated with PCL-C scores (0.356 &lt; r 
&gt; 0.624 for all, p &lt; 0.01 for all), while TNFα and IL10 were additionally 
associated with NSI totals (r = 0.285 and r = 0.270, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). 
This is the first study focused on PTSD symptom severity to report levels of 
circulating pro-inflammatory IL8, specifically in SMVs with TBI. These data 
suggest that within the military TBI population, there are unique cytokine 
profiles that relate to neurobehavioral outcomes associated with TBI and PTSD."
1602,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) alters gut microbiota and tight junctions, causing 
bacterial components to enter the portal vein and induce oxidative 
stress-induced inflammation in the liver. Only corticosteroids and liver 
transplants are treatment options for severe alcoholic hepatitis. ALD's 
pathophysiology is unknown. However, acetaldehyde's toxic effects cause 
oxidative stress and intestinal permeability. This study investigates the 
influence of a synbiotic (a combination of aged garlic extract (AGE) and 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus MTCC1423) on colonic oxidative stress and inflammation 
in ALD male Wistar rats and Caco2 cells. MDA measurement by HPLC in CaCo2 cells, 
blood serum, and colon tissue demonstrated that synbiotic treatment in the ALD 
model reduces oxidative stress. Further, fecal high-throughput 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing revealed the microbiome's shift towards Firmicutes in the synbiotic 
group compared to ethanol. In addition, DCFDA labeling and H/E staining 
demonstrate that the synbiotic is beneficial in inhibiting the development of 
ALD. In the colon, the synbiotic reduces the activation of CYP2E1 and the 
inflammatory markers TNF-a and IL-6 while elevating the mRNA expression of ZO-1, 
occludin, and IL-10. Synbiotics colonize Lactobacillus to restore barrier 
function and microbiota and reduce colon oxidative stress. Thus, a synbiotic 
combination can be used in ALD treatment."
1603,"Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the most common form of CLAD and is 
characterized by airflow limitation and an obstructive spirometric pattern 
without high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) evidence of parenchymal 
opacities. Computed tomography and microCT analysis show abundant small airway 
obstruction, starting from the fifth generation of airway branching and 
affecting up to 40-70% of airways. The pathogenesis of BOS remains unclear. It 
is a multifactorial syndrome that leads to pathological tissue changes and 
clinical manifestations. Because BOS is associated with the worst long-term 
survival in LTx patients, many studies are focused on the early identification 
of BOS. Markers may be useful for diagnosis and for understanding the molecular 
and immunological mechanisms involved in the onset of BOS. Diagnostic and 
predictive markers of BOS have also been investigated in various biological 
materials, such as blood, BAL, lung tissue and extracellular vesicles. The aim 
of this review was to evaluate the scientific literature on markers of BOS after 
lung transplant. We performed a systematic review to find all available data on 
potential prognostic and diagnostic markers of BOS."
1604,"BACKGROUND: In K. pneumoniae KPC (KPC-Kp) bloodstream infections (BSI), 
INCREMENT CPE score &gt;7, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) ≥3 and septic shock 
are recognized predictors of mortality, with a possible beneficial effect of 
combination therapy in seriously ill patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a ten-year retrospective study including all 
KPC-Kp BSI in patients ≥18 years of age with the aim to evaluate the 
characteristics and impact of appropriate empirical therapy, either monotherapy 
or combination therapy, and targeted therapy on mortality. Appropriate therapy 
was defined as at least one active antimicrobial agent with in vitro activity 
against KPC-kp demonstrated by susceptibility testing, administered within 48 h 
from blood culture collection.
RESULTS: The median age of the 435 analyzed patients was 66.09 years (IQR 
54.87-73.98). The median CCI was 4. KPC-Kp colonization was present in 324 
patients (74.48%). The probable origin of the KPC-Kp BSI was not identified in 
136 patients (31.26%), whereas in 120 (27.59%) patients, it was CVC-related, and 
in 118 (27.13%), it was respiratory. Source control was achieved in 87 patients 
(72.5%) with CVC-related KPC-Kp BSI. The twenty-eight-day survival was 70.45% 
for empirical monotherapy, 63.88% for empirical combination therapy and 57.05% 
for targeted therapy (p = 0.0399). A probable source of KPC-Kp BSI other than 
urinary, CVC or abdominal [aHR 1.64 (IC 1.15-2.34) p = 0.006] and deferred 
targeted therapy [HR 1.67 (IC 1.12-2.51), p= 0.013] emerged as predictors of 
mortality, whereas source control [HR 0.62 (IC 0.44-0.86), p = 0.005] and 
ceftazidime/avibactam administration in empirical therapy [aHR 0.37 (IC 
0.20-0.68) p = 0.002] appeared as protective factors.
DISCUSSION: These data underline the importance of source control together with 
timing appropriateness in the early start of empirical therapy over the choice 
of monotherapy or combination therapy and the use of ceftazidime/avibactam 
against KPC-Kp BSI."
1605,"Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a severe complication of the 
advance stage of diabetes. More than 50% of diabetic patients diagnosed with 
peripheral neuropathy will have CAN, with clinical manifestations including 
tachycardia, severe orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and physical exercise 
intolerance. Since the prevalence of diabetes is increasing, a concomitant 
increase in CAN is expected and will reduce quality of life and increase 
mortality. Autonomic dysfunction is associated with reduced baroreflex 
sensitivity and impairment of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation. 
Various autonomic function tests are used to diagnose CAN, a condition without 
adequate treatment. It is important to consider the control of glucose level and 
blood pressure as key factors for preventing CAN progression. However, altered 
biomarkers of inflammatory and endothelial function, increased purinergic 
receptor expression, and exacerbated oxidative stress lead to possible targets 
for the treatment of CAN. The present review describes the molecular alterations 
seen in CAN, diagnosis, and possible alternative treatments."
1606,"Antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism (AIP) is the most common type of 
extrapyramidal side effect (EPS), caused by the blockage of dopamine receptors. 
Since dopamine availability might influence the AIP risk, the dopamine 
transporter (DAT) and serotonin receptors (5-HTRs), which modulate the dopamine 
release, may be also involved in the AIP development. As some of the individual 
differences in the susceptibility to AIP might be due to the genetic background, 
this study aimed to examine the associations of SLC6A3, HTR2C and HTR6 gene 
polymorphisms with AIP in haloperidol-treated schizophrenia patients. The 
Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) was used to evaluate AIP as a 
separate entity. Genotyping was performed using a PCR, following the extraction 
of blood DNA. The results revealed significant associations between HTR6 
rs1805054 polymorphism and haloperidol-induced tremor and rigidity. 
Additionally, the findings indicated a combined effect of HTR6 T and SLC6A3 9R 
alleles on AIP, with their combination associated with significantly lower 
scores of ESRS subscale II for parkinsonism, ESRS-based tremor or hyperkinesia 
and ESRS subscales VI and VIII. These genetic predictors of AIP could be helpful 
in better understanding its pathophysiology, recognizing the individuals at risk 
of developing AIP and offering personalized therapeutic strategies for the 
patients suffering from this EPS."
1607,"(1) Background: T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is a potential 
immunotherapeutic target in a variety of malignant entities, and antibody-based 
treatments are currently under investigation in clinical trials. While promising 
results were observed in patients with lung cancer, the role of TIGIT in oral 
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as a biomarker as well as a therapeutic target 
remains elusive. Therefore, we evaluated the role of TIGIT as a prognostic 
factor in OSCC. (2) Methods: Here, we describe the results of a retrospective 
tissue microarray (TMA) OSCC cohort. Using immunohistochemistry, TIGIT 
expression was correlated with overall and recurrence-free survival (OAS and 
RFS, respectively). Additionally, in silico analysis was performed based on the 
TCGA Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) cohort in order to correlate 
patients' survival with TIGIT and CD274 (encoding for PD-L1) gene expression 
levels. (3) Results: Database analysis revealed a beneficial outcome in OAS for 
tumor patients with high intraepithelial CD3-TIGIT-expression (n = 327). Hereby, 
OAS was 53.9 months vs. 30.1 months for patients with lower TIGIT gene 
expression levels (p = 0.033). In our retrospective OSCC-TMA cohort, elevated 
TIGIT levels on CD3+ cells correlated significantly with improved OAS (p = 
0.025) as well as distant RFS (p = 0.026). (4) Conclusions: This study 
introduces TIGIT as a novel prognostic factor in OSCC, indicating the improved 
outcome of OSCC patients relative to their increased TIGIT expression. TIGIT 
might provide therapeutic implications for future immunotherapy in 
advanced-stage OSCC patients."
1608,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are therapeutic agents to prevent graft 
rejection in organ transplants by modulating inflammation. Herein, the 
immunosuppressive effect of human cord blood MDSCs on corneal allograft models 
was confirmed. CB-MDSCs were locally (subconjuctival, 5 × 105) or systemically 
(intravenous, 1 × 106) injected twice on days 0 and 7. A corneal transplantation 
model was established using C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, and corneal graft opacity 
was measured to evaluate graft rejection up to 6 weeks. Results showed that 
graft survival in the MDSCs groups increased compared to vehicle groups after 42 
days. Systemic and local MDSC administration inhibited the maturation (MHC-IIhi 
CD11c+) of dendritic cells (DCs) and the differentiation of interferon γ+ CD4+ 
Th1 in draining lymph nodes (LNs). However, vehicle groups increased the 
infiltration of CD3+ T cells and F4/80+ macrophages and produced prominent 
neovascular and lymphatic vessels into the graft site with increased mRNA 
expression of VEGF-A/C and VEGFR-1/R-3. Local MDSCs administration showed 
prominent anti-angiogenic/anti-lymphangiogenic effects even at lower MDSCs 
doses. Thus, CB-MDSCs could relatively suppress the infiltration of pathological 
T cells/macrophages into the corneas and the migration of mature DCs into 
draining LNs Therefore, ocular and systemic MDSCs administration showed 
therapeutic potential for preventing corneal allograft rejection."
1609,"(1) Background: Currently, there is no clinically used liquid biomarker in head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. One reason could be the 
limited shedding of tumor material in early disease stages. Molecular 
diagnostics assessing both blood and especially saliva could potentially improve 
the accuracy of biomarkers. In this prospective study, two markers, tissue 
inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 (TIMP-1) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), were 
analyzed in HNSCC patients. The purpose of the study was to evaluate differences 
between saliva and serum as sample material. Further, their prognostic and 
predictive value and usefulness for early detection was assessed. (2) Methods: A 
total of 73 HNSCC patients were prospectively monitored by collecting blood and 
saliva before, during, and after therapy, as well as in the follow-up period 
between 2018 and 2021. In total, 212 serum and 194 saliva samples were 
collected. A control group consisting of 40 subjects (15 patients with local 
infections in the head and neck area and 25 without infections) were examined as 
well. The collected samples were evaluated for the two proteins by using an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). (3) RESULTS: The TIMP-1 concentration 
correlated significantly in blood and saliva, whereas the Hsp70 concentration 
did not. Saliva TIMP-1 was significantly higher in tumor patients compared to 
the control group (p = 0.013). High pretreatment TIMP-1 saliva levels were 
associated with significantly poorer disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.02). A 
high saliva TIMP-1/Hsp70 ratio was significantly associated with poorer DFS (HR: 
1.4; 95% CI: 1.04-1.88; p = 0.026) and a high TIMP-1 serum concentration was 
significantly associated with poorer PFS (HR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 2.8; p = 0.003) 
and poorer overall survival (OS) (HR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.4, 5.9; p = 0.003) in the 
Cox proportional hazards model. The saliva TIMP-1 to Hsp70 ratio was 
significantly higher at the time of recurrence (p = 0.015). Conclusion: TIMP-1 
in serum is a promising prognostic marker for HNSCC. Saliva TIMP-1 and the 
saliva TIMP-1 to Hsp70 ratio provides additional information on the disease-free 
survival."
1610,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and Dupuytren's disease (DD) are fibrotic 
conditions that affect the connective tissue of the hand and limit its 
functionality. The exact molecular mechanism underlying the fibrosis is unknown, 
and only some profibrotic factors have been investigated. In this 
cross-sectional study, we analyzed the expression of FGF signaling pathway 
molecules associated with fibrotic changes in the palmar fascia and the flexor 
retinaculum of 15 CTS patients and both clinically affected and unaffected 
palmar fascia of 15 DD patients, using immunofluorescence techniques. The 
expression of FGFR1, FGFR2, and CTGF in the blood vessel walls and surrounding 
connective tissue cells differed significantly between the analyzed groups, with 
changes in expression present even in clinically unremarkable tissues from DD 
patients. We also found altered expression of the analyzed factors, as well as 
TGF-β1 and syndecan-1 in DD-associated sweat glands, possibly implicating their 
role in the pathophysiology of the disease. The increased expression of 
profibrotic factors in the clinically unaffected palmar fascia of DD patients 
may indicate that more extensive excision is needed during surgical treatment, 
while the profibrotic factors could be potential targets for developing 
pharmacological therapeutic strategies against DD-associated fibrosis."
1611,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the peri-operative and 
functional results between trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and 
holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) in the treatment of benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) 
in middle-old patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective single-center study included patients 
over 75 years old treated with B-TURP or HoLEP for BPH associated with LUTS with 
prostate volume (PV) &lt;100 mL. Primary endpoints were the intra-operative 
blood loss, percentage of loss of hemoglobin, blood transfusion, complications, 
and the comparison of functional outcomes. All patients were evaluated at 1, 3, 
6, and 12 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Overall, 96 patients undergoing HoLEP and 104 B-TURP were eligible and 
enrolled for the study. Post-operative results showed statistically significant 
differences between the two groups, all in favor of HoLEP group, specifically in 
terms of removed prostate tissue, PV reduction rate, hemoglobin values at 24 h, 
hemoglobin loss, operative time, length of hospitalization, days of 
catheterization, and urinary flow rates. There was no significant difference in 
terms of postvoid residual urine volume, perioperative complication, blood 
transfusion, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and IPSS quality of 
life scores. Conclusions: In middle-old patients, the HoLEP technique represents 
a prostate size-independent treatment option with a more favorable safety 
profile defined by less bleeding, lower blood transfusions, and a significantly 
lower hemoglobin drop than B-TURP."
1612,"The safety profile of hydroxyurea (HU) in patients with sickle-cell disease 
(SCD) is relatively well known. However, despite the suspected association of HU 
with myeloid neoplasms in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and the 
publication of sporadic reports of myeloid malignancies in SCD patients treated 
with HU, the possible excess risk imparted by HU in this population having an 
increasing life expectancy has failed to be demonstrated. Herein, we report one 
case of myelodysplastic syndrome emanating from the results on safety and 
effectiveness of HU on the largest European cohort of 1903 HU-treated adults and 
children who were followed-up prospectively in an observational setting over 10 
years, accounting for a total exposure of 7309.5 patient-years. A comparison of 
this single case with previously published similar cases did not allow us to 
draw any significant conclusions due to the paucity of these events."
1613,"Signal joint T cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECs) are a promising marker 
for age estimation and immunosenescence in different ethnic groups. Several 
limitations are expected to overshadow their use as accurate markers for age 
prediction. The current study was conducted to determine the influence of 
immunologic disorders, such as autoimmune diseases and COVID-19, on the accuracy 
of sjTRECs as molecular markers for age estimation and immunosenescence among 
living Egyptians. Peripheral blood sjTRECs level was measured by qPCR in 90 
autoimmune patients, 58 COVID-19 patients, and 85 healthy controls. The mean dCt 
values were significantly (p = 0.0002) different between the three groups, with 
the highest values in healthy subjects, followed by autoimmune and COVID-19 
patients. A significant negative correlation was identified between the sjTRECs 
levels and ages in all studied cases. There were significant positive 
correlations between chronological age and predicted age for healthy 
individuals, autoimmune, and COVID-19 patients with mean absolute deviations 
(MAD) of 9.40, 11.04, and 9.71, respectively. The two patients' groups exhibited 
early immunosenescence, which was more noticeable among the young adults with 
COVID-19 and autoimmune patients of age range (18-49 years). Autoimmunity may 
represent a critical factor impacting the accuracy of sjTRECs quantitation for 
age prediction."
1614,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease 
worldwide, causing progressive cognitive decline, memory impairment, and 
neurological deficits. Methylene blue (MB), an antioxidant, has emerged as a 
potential drug for the treatment of AD owing to its cognitive improvement and 
neuroprotective functions. Despite the small molecular size of MB, which can 
cross the BBB, the therapeutic effective dosage using a BBB-permeable delivery 
system in a specific brain localization remains unclear. In this study, we 
presented magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as a delivery 
system to enhance BBB permeability for the effective treatment of AD. MRgFUS 
using two ultrasound intensities (0.25 and 0.32 MPa) was used to intravenously 
deliver MB to the hippocampal region. Compared with treatment with 0.25 MPa FUS, 
treatment with 0.32 MPa FUS significantly enhanced MB brain accumulation. 
Deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neural cell damage was significantly 
reduced in 0.32 MPa FUS/MB-treated APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, aquaporin-4 
expression increased significantly in the 0.32 MPa FUS and 0.32 MPa FUS/MB 
groups without glial fibrillary acidic protein activation. The results from this 
study demonstrate that FUS improved MB delivery to the brain, and FUS/MB 
combination treatment reduced the number of Aβ plaques. This study revealed the 
potential of FUS-BBBD as an effective strategy to enhance the efficacy of 
therapeutic drugs for AD."
1615,"Angiopathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. Vascular endothelium 
is among the first targets to experience blood-borne metabolic alterations, such 
as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes. To 
explore mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and eventual damage brought by these 
pathologic conditions and to find ways to protect vasculature in diabetic 
patients, various research approaches are used including in vitro endothelial 
cell-based models. We present an analysis of the data available from these 
models that identifies early endothelial cell apoptosis associated with 
oxidative stress as the major outcome of mimicking hyperglycemia and 
hyperlipidemia in vitro. However, the fate of endothelial cells observed in 
these studies does not closely follow it in vivo where massive endothelial 
damage occurs mainly in the terminal stages of diabetes and in conjunction with 
comorbidities. We propose that the discrepancy is likely in missing essentials 
that should be available to cultured endothelial cells to adjust the metabolic 
state and withstand the immediate apoptosis. We discuss the role of carnitine, 
creatine, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in suiting the endothelial 
metabolism for long-term function in diabetic type milieu in vitro. Engagement 
of these essentials is anticipated to expand diabetes research options when 
using endothelial cell-based models."
1616,"The rhizomatous plant turmeric, which is frequently used as a spice and coloring 
ingredient, yields curcumin, a bioactive compound. Curcumin inhibits platelet 
activation and aggregation and improves platelet count. Platelets dysfunction 
results in several disorders, including inflammation, atherothrombosis, and 
thromboembolism. Several studies have proved the beneficial role of curcumin on 
platelets and hence proved it is an important candidate for the treatment of the 
aforementioned diseases. Moreover, curcumin is also frequently employed as an 
anti-inflammatory agent in conventional medicine. In arthritic patients, it has 
been shown to reduce the generation of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and to 
reduce edema, morning stiffness, and other symptoms. Curcumin taken orally also 
reduced rats' acute inflammation brought on by carrageenan. Curcumin has also 
been proven to prevent atherosclerosis and platelet aggregation, as well as to 
reduce angiogenesis in adipose tissue. In the cerebral microcirculation, 
curcumin significantly lowered platelet and leukocyte adhesion. It largely 
modulated the endothelium to reduce platelet adhesion. Additionally, P-selectin 
expression and mice survival after cecal ligation and puncture were improved by 
curcumin, which also altered platelet and leukocyte adhesion and blood-brain 
barrier dysfunction. Through regulating many processes involved in platelet 
aggregation, curcuminoids collectively demonstrated detectable antiplatelet 
activity. Curcuminoids may therefore be able to prevent disorders linked to 
platelet activation as possible therapeutic agents. This review article proposes 
to highlight and discuss the regulatory effects of curcumin on platelets."
1617,"BACKGROUND: With anti-inflammatory properties, cannabinoids may be a potential 
strategy to reduce immune activation in people living with HIV (PLWH) but more 
information on their safety and tolerability is needed.
METHODS: We conducted an open-label interventional pilot study at the McGill 
University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada. PLWH were randomized to oral 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): cannabidiol (CBD) combination (THC 2.5 mg/CBD 2.5 
mg) or CBD-only capsules (CBD 200 mg). Individuals titrated doses as tolerated 
to a maximum daily dose THC 15 mg/CBD 15 mg or 800 mg CBD, respectively, for 12 
weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants without any 
significant toxicity based on the WHO toxicity scale (Grades 0-2 scores).
RESULTS: Out of ten individuals, eight completed the study. Two from the 
CBD-only arm were withdrawn for safety concerns: phlebotomy aggravating 
pre-existing anemia and severe hepatitis on 800 mg CBD with newly discovered 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma, respectively. Seven did not have any significant 
toxicity. Cannabinoids did not alter hematology/biochemistry profiles. CD4 
count, CD4/CD8 ratio, and HIV suppression remained stable. Most adverse effects 
were mild-moderate.
CONCLUSIONS: In PLWH, cannabinoids seem generally safe and well-tolerated, 
though larger studies are needed. Screening for occult liver pathology should be 
performed and hepatic enzymes monitored, especially with high CBD doses."
1618,"BACKGROUND: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are approved for 
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer harboring 
deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA1 and/or 2 mutations. Identifying 
patients with prostate cancer harboring these mutations may be challenging. 
Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides an avenue for an easier detection of 
these mutations. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the concordance of BRCA mutations 
in the tumor tissue and cfDNA in patients with metastatic prostate cancer in the 
real-world setting.
METHODS: Somatic genomic profiling results were obtained from a clinical cohort 
of patients at our institution who had at least two samples tested. One of the 
samples needed to be from either primary or metastatic tissue. Concordance was 
adjusted to not include mutation types that the cfDNA platforms were not 
designed to detect.
RESULTS: The presence or absence of mutations in the BRCA gene was assessed in a 
total of 589 samples, including 327 cfDNA samples, from 260 patients with 
metastatic prostate cancer. The median time between the first test and any 
subsequent test was 22.8 (0.0-232) months. BRCA mutation was present in the 
patient's original prostate tissue in 23 samples (3.9%) of patients. The 
adjusted concordance between prostate tumor tissue and cfDNA was 97.9% [95% CI, 
95.3-99.1%]. The adjusted concordance between metastatic samples and cfDNA was 
93.5% [95% CI, 86.4-97.3%]. Of the patients who had a BRCA mutation detected in 
their prostate tissue, there was a 70% probability of detecting a BRCA mutation 
in the patient's cfDNA as well. For patients who did not have a detectable BRCA 
mutation in their primary prostate tissue, the probability of detecting a 
subsequent one later in the disease course was less than 0.9%.
CONCLUSION: There is a high level of concordance between tissue and blood for 
BRCA mutations. Testing cfDNA can provide reliable information on BRCA 
mutational status and is a viable alternative to solid tissue sequencing when 
unavailable. The development of a new BRCA mutation later in the disease course 
is a rare event."
1619,"The research into and production of hematological reference samples used to 
implement an external quality assessment (EQA) to check the quality of 
hematology tests are necessary for hematology laboratories in Vietnam. In this 
research, the study team determined the assessment values of blood cell count 
(human RBCs, pseudo-leucocytes, and pseudo-platelets) by the impedance method 
used in hematology EQA programs. The hematological reference samples were 
controlled at three concentration levels: low, normal, and high. Determination 
of the assigned value (mean ± 2SD) was performed for the following hematology 
analyzer series by impedance method: ABX Micros 60, Celldyn 1700, and Mindray BC 
2000. Each device was sent to 10 different laboratories for evaluation. Research 
results for assigned values of each model (ABX Micros 60, Celldyn 1700, and 
Mindray BC 2000) were determined at the three concentrations. For the ABX Micros 
60 and Celldyn 1700 series, 80% of laboratories had analytical results within 
assigned values. For the Mindray BC 2000 series, 100% of laboratories had 
analytical results within assigned values. The measurement results for the 
number of human RBCs, pseudo-leucocytes, and pseudo-platelets on each analyzer 
were similar between the 10 laboratories; the results of the three hematology 
analyzer series using the impedance method were different and the difference was 
statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Thus, hematological reference samples 
for measuring the number of blood cells meeting the standards so that they can 
evaluate the results of laboratories using the impedance method: ABX, Celldyn 
1700, Mindray BC 2000."
1620,"Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer, has an organ protective profile through the 
inhibition of inflammatory mediators and cytokines in critical conditions, such 
as heart failure, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and sepsis. The survival effect 
of levosimendan for acute liver failure has not been examined yet. Male 
Sprague-Dawley rats were examined in the D-galactosamine hydrochloride and 
lipopolysaccharide (GalN/LPS) model. Levosimendan was injected intraperitoneally 
before GalN/LPS treatment. Survival was monitored for 7 days. For biochemical 
analyses, liver and blood samples were collected from the rats at 1 and 8 h 
after GaIN/LPS treatment. The pretreatment of levosimendan at 4 mg/kg 
significantly increased survival in GalN/LPS rats. In the liver specimen, 
levosimendan significantly inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) 
at 1 h, and significantly decreased the mRNA expression of inflammatory 
mediators, including inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), at 8 h. In serum, levosimendan decreased the levels of nitrite, a 
metabolite of nitric oxide, and TNF-α protein, as well as aspartate 
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. These results indicated that 
Levosimendan ameliorated liver dysfunction and survival in acute liver failure 
model rats through the suppression of NF-κB activation."
1621,"New more effective lipid-lowering therapies have made it important to accurately 
determine Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) at both high and low 
levels. LDL-C was measured by the β-quantification reference method (BQ) (N = 
40,346) and compared to Friedewald (F-LDL-C), Martin (M-LDL-C), extended Martin 
(eM-LDL-C) and Sampson (S-LDL-C) equations by regression analysis, error-grid 
analysis, and concordance with the BQ method for classification into different 
LDL-C treatment intervals. For triglycerides (TG) &lt; 175 mg/dL, the four LDL-C 
equations yielded similarly accurate results, but for TG between 175 and 800 
mg/dL, the S-LDL-C equation when compared to the BQ method had a lower mean 
absolute difference (mg/dL) (MAD = 10.66) than F-LDL-C (MAD = 13.09), M-LDL-C 
(MAD = 13.16) or eM-LDL-C (MAD = 12.70) equations. By error-grid analysis, the 
S-LDL-C equation for TG &gt; 400 mg/dL not only had the least analytical errors 
but also the lowest frequency of clinically relevant errors at the low (&lt;70 
mg/dL) and high (&gt;190 mg/dL) LDL-C cut-points (S-LDL-C: 13.5%, F-LDL-C: 
23.0%, M-LDL-C: 20.5%) and eM-LDL-C: 20.0%) equations. The S-LDL-C equation also 
had the best overall concordance to the BQ reference method for classifying 
patients into different LDL-C treatment intervals. The S-LDL-C equation is both 
more analytically accurate than alternative equations and results in less 
clinically relevant errors at high and low LDL-C levels."
1622,"BACKGROUND: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an enzyme responsible 
for producing an active form of folate. The MTHFR T677T genotype may have 
adverse health effects associated with weight gain and a reduction in folate 
availability.
AIM: In this study, we examined the influence of the MTHFR C677T variant on BMI 
and determined its role as a risk factor for obesity. We also assessed the 
relationships between the MTHFR C677T genotype and folate and vitamin B12 
concentrations in subjects before and after radical weight loss.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 1712 Caucasian adults of Polish 
nationality with a wide range of body mass indexes (BMIs). DNA was extracted 
from the blood, and the C677T variant was tested with RFLP-PCR and 
real-time-PCR.
RESULTS: There was no significant influence found for the MTHFR 677 TT genotype 
on BMI or the obesity risk in codominant, dominant or recessive inheritance 
models. Individuals with obesity and the TT genotype had significantly lower 
folate concentrations. After radical weight reduction, the impact of the risk 
genotype, as well as homeostasis between folate and vitamin B12 in TT 
homozygotes, seems to be attenuated.
CONCLUSION: Although the MTHFR 677TT genotype is not directly related to a 
higher BMI in Polish adults, it has a detrimental effect on folate 
concentrations in individuals with high BMI values."
1623,"Recently, it was found that when confronted with major vessel occlusion and 
vascular failure, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy might rapidly 
functionally improve minor vessels to take over the function of disabled major 
vessels, reorganize blood flow, and compensate failed vessel function. We 
focused on the BPC 157 therapy effect obtained by giving 10 ng/kg ip to rats 5 
min before sacrifice on the rat thoracic aorta, which we assessed with Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 90 min thereafter. We applied a principal 
component analysis (PCA). The PCA model showed, with a clear distinction being 
mostly due to the PC1 score, differences between the spectra of BPC 157- and 
saline-treated rats. The comparison of the averaged spectra of these two groups 
with their differential spectrum and PC loadings allowed us to identify the 
parts of the FTIR spectra that contributed the most to the spectral separation 
of the two observed groups. The PC1 loadings and the differential spectrum 
showed that the main bands affecting the separation were the amid I band around 
1650 cm-1, the amid II band around 1540 cm-1, and the vibrational band around 
1744 cm-1. Fitting the spectral range between 1450 and 1800 cm-1 showed changes 
in protein conformation and confirmed the appearance of the vibrational band at 
1744 cm-1. Controls had a substantially more intense vibrational band at 1744 
cm-1. These spectral results showed the cells from saline-treated (control) rats 
to be in the early stage of cell death, while the samples from BPC 157-rats were 
protected. Thus, BPC 157 therapy changed the lipid contents and protein 
secondary structure conformation, with a rapid effect on vessels, within a short 
time upon application."
1624,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central 
nervous system (CNS), which leads to disturbances in the conduction of nerve 
impulses, cognitive impairment, sensory and motor disturbances, as well as 
depressive symptoms. MS remains an incurable disease with a difficult diagnosis 
and unclear etiology. The aim of the analysis was to identify SNPs that may 
potentially be associated with an increased risk of developing MS. Blood samples 
were obtained from patients with MS (194 subjects) and age-matched healthy 
controls (188 subjects). The polymorphic variant frequencies of rs197412 T&gt;C 
in GEMIN3, rs7813 G&gt;A in GEMIN4, rs1106042 G&gt;A in HIWI, rs10719 A&gt;C in 
DROSHA, rs3742330 A&gt;G in DICER1, rs11077 T&gt;G in XPO5, rs14035 C&gt;T in 
RAN, rs636832 G&gt;A in AGO1 were determined in DNA using real-time PCR TaqMan® 
SNP Genotyping Assay. Our findings indicate that the GG AGO1 rs636832 and AA 
GEMIN4 rs7813 genotypes were associated with an increased risk of MS. Although 
our findings provide a clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of MS, further 
investigations are needed to better understand their potential for the 
evaluation of other miRNA processing genes believed to be associated with MS 
etiology."
1625,"Currently, sensitive and specific methods for the detection and prognosis of 
early stage PCa are lacking. To establish the diagnosis and further identify an 
appropriate treatment strategy, prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test 
followed by tissue biopsy have to be performed. The combination of tests is 
justified by the lack of a highly sensitive, specific, and safe single test. 
Tissue biopsy is specific but invasive and may have severe side effects, and 
therefore is inappropriate for screening of the disease. At the same time, the 
PSA blood test, which is conventionally used for PCa screening, has low 
specificity and may be elevated in the case of noncancerous prostate tumors and 
inflammatory conditions, including benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. 
Thus, diverse techniques of liquid biopsy have been investigated to supplement 
or replace the existing tests of prostate cancer early diagnosis and 
prognostics. Here, we provide a review on the advances in diagnosis and 
prognostics of non-metastatic prostate cancer by means of various biomarkers 
extracted via liquid biopsy, including circulating tumor cells, exosomal miRNAs, 
and circulating DNAs."
1626,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, highly pruritic, relapsing-remitting 
inflammatory skin disease. The etiology of AD has not been fully explained yet 
and complex interactions of various small molecules are still being taken into 
account. The aim of this research was to investigate the serum 
eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), platelet activating factor (PAF) and 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations in relation to the 
disease severity and pruritus intensity in adult patients with AD. This pilot 
study was performed on 30 participants (15 patients with AD and 15 healthy 
controls). Blood samples were taken to examine the serum levels of EDN, PAF and 
VEGF using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. The severity of 
disease was assessed by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. The 
intensity of pruritus, as a subjective symptom, was determined by the Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS). Obtained results revealed that the EDN (p = 0.016) and 
VEGF (p = 0.032), but not PAF (p = 0.841) concentrations were significantly 
higher in patients with AD compared with those of the control group. There was 
positive correlation between the EDN level and the SCORAD index in patients with 
AD (r = -0.9, p = 0.037) which was not found for the PAF and VEGF levels. 
Circulating EDN, PAF and VEGF levels were not significantly correlated with the 
severity of pruritus. Our results suggest that the END and VEGF serum levels are 
significantly increased in patients with AD compared to control group. Moreover, 
EDN might be useful to reflect the severity of symptoms."
1627,"Periodontal disease is predominantly caused by the pathogenic bacterium 
Porphyromonas gingivalis that produces inflammation-inducing factors in the 
host. Eucommia ulmoides is a plant native to China that has been reported to 
reduce blood pressure, promote weight loss, and exhibit anti-inflammatory 
effects. Geniposidic acid (GPA) is the major component of E. ulmoides. Herein, 
we investigated the effects of GPA on P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis by 
measuring the inflammatory responses in human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs) 
after P. gingivalis stimulation and GPA addition in a P. gingivalis-induced 
periodontitis mouse model. We found that GPA addition suppressed interleukin 
(IL)-6 mRNA induction (33.8% suppression), IL-6 production (69.2% suppression), 
toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 induction, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) phosphorylation in HGECs stimulated by P. gingivalis. Inoculation of mice 
with GPA inhibited P. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone resorption (25.6% 
suppression) by suppressing IL-6 and TLR2 production in the serum and gingiva. 
GPA suppressed osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow cells induced by M-CSF 
and sRANKL in mice (56.7% suppression). GPA also suppressed the mRNA expression 
of OSCAR, NFATc1, c-Fos, cathepsin K, and DC-STAMP. In summary, GPA exerts an 
anti-inflammatory effect on periodontal tissue and may be effective in 
preventing periodontal disease."
1628,"Therapy options for advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) include 
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) 
with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE, however further optimization in the therapeutic 
landscape is required as response rates are still low. In this study, we 
investigated the synergistic and potentially enhanced efficacy of a combined 
treatment with everolimus and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in a mouse model. Baseline 
[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET scans were obtained five days after athymic CD1 mice were 
inoculated with AR42J tumor cells, before separating the animals into four 
groups. Group 1 received a placebo, group 2 everolimus, group 3 a placebo and 
PRRT, and group 4 everolimus and PRRT. The treatment response was monitored by 
manually measuring the tumor volumes (manual tumor volume, MTV) and conducting 
sequential [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET scans at one, two, and four weeks after 
treatment induction. The biological tumor volume (BTV) was derived from PET 
scans using threshold-based volume of interest (VOI) measurements. Tracer uptake 
was measured semi-quantitatively as a tumor to background ratio (TBR). Mice were 
euthanized due to excessive tumor growth according to the ethics protocol; blood 
samples were drawn for the preparation of full blood counts and kidneys were 
obtained for histological analysis. For the histological assessment, a 
standardized score (renal damage score, RDS) was used. Full blood counts showed 
significantly increased numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the groups 
receiving PRRT. All other parameters did not differ relevantly. In the 
histological analysis, groups receiving PRRT had a significantly higher RDS, 
whereas everolimus only tended to cause an increase in the RDS. Mice in groups 1 
and 2 had to be euthanized due to excessive tumor growth two weeks after the 
start of the therapy, whereas follow-up in groups 3 and 4 comprised four weeks. 
PRRT significantly inhibited tumor growth; the administration of everolimus did 
not induce an additional effect. A good correlation existed between MTV and BTV. 
PRRT significantly reduced the TBR. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET is suitable for 
monitoring tumor growth in the applied model. The high efficacy of 
[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE is not enhanced by the combination with everolimus."
1629,"To date, there have been no new drugs or adjuvants able to decrease both 
morbidity and mortality in the context of sepsis and septic shock. Our objective 
was to evaluate the use of thiosulfinate-enriched Allium sativum and black 
garlic extracts as adjuvants in the management of sepsis. An experimental in 
vivo study was carried out with male Sprague-Dawley® rats. Animals were 
randomized in four treatment groups: antibiotic (ceftriaxone) treatment (group 
I), ceftriaxone plus thiosulfinate-enriched extract (TASE, group II), 
ceftriaxone plus thiosulfinate-enriched extract and black garlic extracts (TASE 
+ BGE, group III), and ceftriaxone plus black garlic extract (BGE, group IV). 
All animals were housed and inoculated with 1 × 1010 CFU/15 mL of 
intraperitoneal Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Subsequently, they received a daily 
treatment according to each group for 7 days. Clinical, analytical, 
microbiological, and histopathological parameters were evaluated. Statistically 
significant clinical improvement was observed in rats receiving garlic extracts 
in weight (groups II and III), ocular secretions, and piloerection (group IV). 
Moreover, less liver edema, vacuolization, and inflammation were observed in 
groups receiving adjuvant support (groups II, III, and IV). When comparing 
interleukins 24 h after bacteria inoculum, we found statistically significant 
differences in TNF-alpha levels in groups receiving BGE (groups III and IV, p ≤ 
0.05). Blood and peritoneal liquid cultures were also analyzed, and we detected 
a certain level of Enterococcus faecalis in peritoneal cultures from all 
treatment groups and less bacteria presence in blood cultures in rats receiving 
garlic extracts (groups II, III, and IV). In conclusion, TASE and BGE could be 
promising nutraceutical or medicinal agents as coadjuvants in the treatment of 
sepsis because of its effects in modulating the inflammatory response."
1630,"One key feature of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is that its 
prevalence increases exponentially with age. DNA methylation clocks have become 
powerful biomarkers to detect accelerated aging in a variety of diseases and can 
help prognose outcomes in severe COPD. This study investigated which DNA 
methylation clock could best reflect airway epigenetic age when used in more 
accessible blood samples. Our analyses showed that out of six DNA methylation 
clocks investigated, DNAmGrimAge demonstrated the strongest correlation and the 
smallest difference between the airway epithelium and blood. Our findings 
suggests that blood DNAmGrimAge accurately reflects airway epigenetic age of 
individuals and that its elevation is highly associated with COPD."
1631,"Angiogenesis is an essential process by which new blood vessels develop from 
existing ones. While adequate angiogenesis is a physiological process during, 
for example, tissue repair, insufficient and excessive angiogenesis stands on 
the pathological side. Fine balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors in 
the tissue environment regulates angiogenesis. Identification of these factors 
and how they function is a pressing topic to develop angiogenesis-targeted 
therapeutics. During the last decade, exciting data highlighted non-metabolic 
functions of intermediates of the mitochondrial Krebs cycle including succinate. 
Among these functions is the contribution of succinate to angiogenesis in 
various contexts and through different mechanisms. As the concept of targeting 
metabolism to treat a wide range of diseases is rising, in this review we 
summarize the mechanisms by which succinate regulates angiogenesis in normal and 
pathological settings. Gaining a comprehensive insight into how this metabolite 
functions as an angiogenic signal will provide a useful approach to understand 
diseases with aberrant or excessive angiogenic background, and may provide 
strategies to tackle them."
1632,"Atherosclerosis, the major cause of vascular disease, is an inflammatory process 
driven by entry of blood monocytes into the arterial wall. LDL normally enters 
the wall, and stimulates monocyte adhesion by forming oxidation products such as 
oxidised phospholipids (oxPLs) and malondialdehyde. Adhesion molecules that bind 
monocytes to the wall permit traffic of these cells. CD14 is a monocyte surface 
receptor, a cofactor with TLR4 forming a complex that binds oxidised 
phospholipids and induces inflammatory changes in the cells, but data have been 
limited for monocyte adhesion. Here, we show that under static conditions, CD14 
and TLR4 are implicated in adhesion of monocytes to solid phase oxidised LDL 
(oxLDL), and also that oxPL and malondialdehyde (MDA) adducts are involved in 
adhesion to oxLDL. Similarly, monocytes bound to heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), 
but this could be through contaminating lipopolysaccharide. Immunohistochemistry 
on atherosclerotic human arteries demonstrated increased endothelial MDA adducts 
and HSP60, but endothelial oxPL was not detected. We propose that monocytes 
could bind to MDA in endothelial cells, inducing atherosclerosis. Monocytes and 
platelets synergized in binding to oxLDL, forming aggregates; if this occurs at 
the arterial surface, they could precipitate thrombosis. These interactions 
could be targeted by cyclodextrins and oxidised phospholipid analogues for 
therapy."
1633,"Adaptor molecules play a crucial role in signal transduction in immune cells. 
Several adaptor molecules, such as the linker for the activation of T cells 
(LAT) and SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), are 
essential for T cell development and activation following T cell receptor (TCR) 
aggregation, suggesting that adaptor molecules are good therapeutic targets for 
T cell-mediated immune disorders, such as autoimmune diseases and allergies. 
Signal-transducing adaptor protein (STAP)-2 is a member of the STAP family of 
adaptor proteins. STAP-2 functions as a scaffold for various intracellular 
proteins, including BRK, signal transducer, and activator of transcription 
(STAT)3, STAT5, and myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88). In 
T cells, STAP-2 is involved in stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α-induced 
migration, integrin-dependent cell adhesion, and Fas-mediated apoptosis. We 
previously reported the critical function of STAP-2 in TCR-mediated T cell 
activation and T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here, we review how STAP-2 
affects the pathogenesis of T cell-mediated inflammation and immune diseases in 
order to develop novel STAP-2-targeting therapeutic strategies."
1634,"In recent years, research has emphasized the significance of mild clinical and 
biochemical presentations of primary aldosteronism (PA) that do not meet current 
diagnostic criteria of the syndrome. In this study, we assessed the prevalence 
of autonomous aldosterone (Ald) secretion (AAS), defined as a positive (&gt;1.2 
ng/dL/mIU/L) Ald-to-renin ratio (ADRR) combined with unsuppressed Ald (&gt;4 
ng/dL), and its associations with blood pressure (BP), cardiac function, and 
common carotid artery (CCA) intima-media thickness (IMT) in patients with 
incidentally discovered adrenal adenomas (AI), who were either normo- or 
hypertensive but had no other cardiovascular disease. Among 332 AI patients 
hospitalized between November 2018 and December 2019, 63 study participants were 
recruited (26 normo- and 37 hypertensive), who underwent hormonal examinations, 
24 h ambulatory BP measurement, transthoracic echocardiography, and CCA IMT 
assessment without altering chronic medications. AAS was found in approximately 
25% of subjects (seven normo- and nine hypertensive); urinary aldosterone 
excretion (UAldE) exceeded 10 ug/day in none of the subjects. The left 
ventricular mass index correlated positively with UAldE in non-diabetic patients 
(n = 50), and negatively with renin in those without beta blocker therapy (n = 
38). The study shows that a pragmatic approach to hormonal assessment (no 
chronic therapy modification) may reveal patients with AAS. Screening for this 
subclinical PA presentation is probably more effective with a permissive ADRR 
than UAldE in such a setting."
1635,"The COVID-19 outbreak had a strong impact on people's lives all over the world. 
Patients with hematologic diseases have been heavily affected by the pandemic, 
because their immune system may be compromised due to anti-cancer or 
immunosuppressive therapies and because diagnosis and treatment of their 
baseline conditions were delayed during lockdowns. Hematologic malignancies 
emerged very soon as risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection, increasing the 
mortality rate. SARS-CoV2 can also induce or exacerbate immune-mediated 
cytopenias, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemias, complement-mediated anemias, 
and immune thrombocytopenia. Active immunization with vaccines has been shown to 
be the best prophylaxis of severe COVID-19 in hematologic patients. However, the 
immune response to vaccines may be significantly impaired, especially in those 
receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or immunosuppressive agents. Recently, 
antiviral drugs and monoclonal antibodies have become available for pre-exposure 
and post-exposure prevention of severe COVID-19. As adverse events after 
vaccines are extremely rare, the cost-benefit ratio is largely in favor of 
vaccination, even in patients who might be non-responders; in the hematological 
setting, all patients should be considered at high risk of developing 
complications due to SARS-CoV2 infection and should be offered all the therapies 
aimed to prevent them."
1636,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, comprising 70% of 
dementia diagnoses worldwide and affecting 1 in 9 people over the age of 65. 
However, the majority of its treatments, which predominantly target the 
cholinergic system, remain insufficient at reversing pathology and act simply to 
slow the inevitable progression of the disease. The most recent 
neurotransmitter-targeting drug for AD was approved in 2003, strongly suggesting 
that targeting neurotransmitter systems alone is unlikely to be sufficient, and 
that research into alternate treatment avenues is urgently required. 
Neuromodulators are substances released by neurons which influence 
neurotransmitter release and signal transmission across synapses. 
Neuromodulators including neuropeptides, hormones, neurotrophins, ATP and metal 
ions display altered function in AD, which underlies aberrant neuronal activity 
and pathology. However, research into how the manipulation of neuromodulators 
may be useful in the treatment of AD is relatively understudied. Combining 
neuromodulator targeting with more novel methods of drug delivery, such as the 
use of multi-targeted directed ligands, combinatorial drugs and encapsulated 
nanoparticle delivery systems, may help to overcome limitations of conventional 
treatments. These include difficulty crossing the blood-brain-barrier and the 
exertion of effects on a single target only. This review aims to highlight the 
ways in which neuromodulator functions are altered in AD and investigate how 
future therapies targeting such substances, which act upstream to classical 
neurotransmitter systems, may be of potential therapeutic benefit in the 
sustained search for more effective treatments."
1637,"Fibroblasts have an important role in the maintenance of the extracellular 
matrix of connective tissues by producing and remodelling extracellular matrix 
proteins. They are indispensable for physiological processes, and as such also 
associate with many pathological conditions. In recent years, a number of 
studies have identified donor-derived fibroblasts in various tissues of bone 
marrow transplant recipients, while others could not replicate these findings. 
In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the current literature 
regarding the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into fibroblasts in 
various tissues. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (Core Collection) were 
systematically searched for original articles concerning fibroblast origin after 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in collaboration with a medical 
information specialist. Our search found 5421 studies, of which 151 were 
analysed for full-text analysis by two authors independently, resulting in the 
inclusion of 104 studies. Only studies in animals and humans, in which at least 
one marker was used for fibroblast identification, were included. The results 
were described per organ of fibroblast engraftment. We show that nearly all 
mouse and human organs show evidence of fibroblasts of hematopoietic stem cell 
transfer origin. Despite significant heterogeneity in the included studies, most 
demonstrate a significant presence of fibroblasts of hematopoietic lineage in 
non-hematopoietic tissues. This presence appears to increase after the 
occurrence of tissue damage."
1638,"Numerous studies on the effects of antihypertensive treatment in young 
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) have shown that early-onset therapy may 
effectively reduce their blood pressure (BP) even to normotensive values. In 
contrast, only a few studies investigated the effects of treatment started at an 
advanced age. These studies revealed that antihypertensive effects are lower in 
adult or even in senescent SHRs compared with young SHRs. Even more, prevention 
of cardiac sequelae of hypertension such as hypertrophy and fibrosis is less 
effective when treatment starts late in life. Because, in patients, combination 
therapies with calcium antagonists are favored, we studied the efficacy of a 
combination therapy with captopril and nifedipine in young and old SHRs. We 
directly compared the treatment effects on BP as well as on cardiac hypertrophy 
and remodeling between these two animal cohorts. With antihypertensive 
treatment, significantly lower BP values were achieved in young SHRs despite a 
shorter treatment period compared with old SHRs. Although treatment effects on 
cardiac hypertrophy were greater in old than in young SHRs, cardiac fibrosis was 
significantly attenuated only in young but not in old SHRs. The results 
emphasize the value of antihypertensive therapy and particularly accentuate the 
importance of an early-onset therapy. With respect to problems such as late 
diagnosis and poor therapy adherence, these results may have great importance 
for the treatment of human hypertension."
1639,"The authors carried out the study of the state of systemic and cerebral 
hemodynamics in normal conditions and in various neurosurgical pathologies using 
modern signal processing methods. The results characterize the condition for the 
mechanisms of cerebral circulation Institute of Computer Science and Control, 
Higher School of Cyber-Physical Systems and Control regulation, which allows for 
finding a solution to fundamental and specific clinical problems for the 
effective treatment of patients with various pathologies. The proposed method is 
based on the continuous wavelet transform of systemic arterial pressure and 
blood flow velocity signals in the middle cerebral artery recorded by 
non-invasive methods of photoplethysmography and transcranial doppler 
ultrasonography. The study of these signals in real-time in the frequency range 
of Mayer waves makes it possible to determine the cerebral autoregulation state 
in certain diseases before and after surgical interventions. The proposed method 
uses a cross-wavelet spectrum, which helps obtain wavelet coherence and a phase 
shift between the wavelet coefficients of systemic arterial pressure signals and 
blood flow velocity in the Mayer wave range. The obtained results enable 
comparing the proposed method with that based on the short-time Fourier 
transform. The comparison showed that the proposed method has higher sensitivity 
to changes in cerebral autoregulation and better localization of changes in time 
and frequency."
1640,"Establishing an objective quality assessment of an organ prior to 
transplantation can help prevent unnecessary discard of the organ and reduce the 
probability of functional failure. In this regard, normothermic machine 
perfusion (NMP) offers new possibilities for organ evaluation. However, to date, 
few studies have addressed the identification of markers and analytical tools to 
determine graft quality. In this study, function and injury markers were 
measured in blood and urine during NMP of 26 porcine kidneys and correlated with 
ex vivo inulin clearance behavior. Significant differentiation of kidneys 
according to their function could be achieved by oxygen consumption, oxygen 
delivery, renal blood flow, arterial pressure, intrarenal resistance, kidney 
temperature, relative urea concentration, and urine production. In addition, 
classifications were accomplished with supervised learning methods and 
histological analysis to predict renal function ex vivo. Classificators (support 
vector machines, k-nearest-neighbor, logistic regression and naive bayes) based 
on relevant markers in urine and blood achieved 75% and 83% accuracy in the 
validation and test set, respectively. A correlation between histological damage 
and function could not be detected. The measurement of blood and urine markers 
provides information of preoperative renal quality, which can used in future to 
establish an objective quality assessment."
1641,"NLRP3-inflammasome-mediated signaling is thought to significantly contribute to 
the extent of myocardial damage after myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of 
this study was to investigate the effects of the NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitor 
IZD334 on cardiac damage in a pig model of myocardial infarction. Prior to in 
vivo testing, in vitro, porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells and whole 
blood were treated with increasing dosages of IZD334, a novel NLRP3-inflammasome 
inhibitor, and were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP). After determination of the pharmacological profile in 
healthy pigs, thirty female Landrace pigs were subjected to 75 min of 
transluminal balloon occlusion of the LAD coronary artery and treated with 
placebo or IZD334 (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg once daily) in a blinded 
randomized fashion. In vitro, NLRP3-inflammasome stimulation showed the 
pronounced release of interleukin (IL)-1β that was attenuated by IZD334 (p &lt; 
0.001). In vivo, no differences were observed between groups in serological 
markers of inflammation nor myocardial IL-1β expression. After 7 days, the 
ejection fraction did not differ between groups, as assessed with MRI (placebo: 
45.1 ± 8.7%, 1 mg/kg: 49.9 ± 6.1%, 3 mg/kg: 42.7 ± 3.8%, 10 mg/kg: 44.9 ± 6.4%, 
p = 0.26). Infarct size as a percentage of the area at risk was not reduced 
(placebo: 73.1 ± 3.0%, 1 mg/kg: 75.5 ± 7.3%, 3 mg/kg: 80.3 ± 3.9%, 10 mg/kg: 
78.2 ± 8.0%, p = 0.21). In this pig MI model, we did not observe attenuation of 
the inflammatory response after NLRP3-inflammasome inhibition in vivo. 
Consecutively, no difference was observed in IS and cardiac function, while in 
vitro inhibition successfully reduced IL-1β release from stimulated porcine 
blood cells."
1642,"The monolayer of cells that line both the heart and the entire vasculature is 
the endothelial cell (EC). These cells respond to external and internal signals, 
producing a wide array of primary or secondary messengers involved in 
coagulation, vascular tone, inflammation, and cell-to-cell signaling. 
Endothelial cell activation is the process by which EC changes from a quiescent 
cell phenotype, which maintains cellular integrity, antithrombotic, and 
anti-inflammatory properties, to a phenotype that is prothrombotic, 
pro-inflammatory, and permeable, in addition to repair and leukocyte trafficking 
at the site of injury or infection. Pathological activation of EC leads to 
increased vascular permeability, thrombosis, and an uncontrolled inflammatory 
response that leads to endothelial dysfunction. This pathological activation can 
be observed during ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and sepsis. Shear stress 
(SS) and pulsatile shear stress (PSS) are produced by mechanical frictional 
forces of blood flow and contraction of the heart, respectively, and are 
well-known mechanical signals that affect EC function, morphology, and gene 
expression. PSS promotes EC homeostasis and cardiovascular health. The archetype 
of inducing PSS is exercise (i.e., jogging, which introduces pulsations to the 
body as a function of the foot striking the pavement), or mechanical devices 
which induce external pulsations to the body (Enhanced External Pulsation 
(EECP), Whole-body vibration (WBV), and Whole-body periodic acceleration (WBPA 
aka pGz)). The purpose of this narrative review is to focus on the 
aforementioned noninvasive methods to increase PSS, review how each of these 
modify specific diseases that have been shown to induce endothelial activation 
and microcirculatory dysfunction (Ischemia reperfusion injury-myocardial 
infarction and cardiac arrest and resuscitation), sepsis, and 
lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis syndrome (LPS)), and review current evidence 
and insight into how each may modify endothelial activation and how these may be 
beneficial in the acute and chronic setting of endothelial activation and 
microvascular dysfunction."
1643,"Gram-negative fermenting and non-fermenting bacteria are important etiological 
factors of nosocomial and community infections, especially those that produce 
carbapenemases. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa are the most frequently-detected carbapenemase-producing 
microorganisms. The predominant type of resistance is metallo-β-lactamase (MBL). 
These bacteria are predominantly isolated from bronchial alveolar lavage, urine, 
and blood. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) strains are always 
multi-drug-resistant. This significantly limits the treatment options for this 
type of infection, extends the time of patient hospitalization, and increases 
the risk of a more severe and complicated disease course. Preventing the 
transmission of these microorganisms should be a major public health initiative. 
New antibiotics and treatment regimens offer hope against these infections."
1644,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), previously known as primary biliary 
cirrhosis, is an autoimmune liver disease that mostly affects women. A 
progressive disorder in the processes of bile secretion and enterohepatic bile 
salts circulation in patients with PBC already in its early stages, leading to 
an insufficient release of bile acids into the bowel and their entry into the 
systemic circulation. Insufficient bile acids released into the duodenum 
contributes to the development of malabsorption, energy malnutrition, and slowly 
progressive weight loss. The pathophysiological mechanisms of weight loss and 
its slow progression are associated with the deterioration of the fat 
emulsification processes and with the reduced absorption of hydrolyzed products, 
such as fatty acids and monoglycerides, with steatorrhea in patients with PBC, 
as well as in those with gut dysbiosis. Just in the early stages of the disease, 
this results in accelerated fatty acid β-oxidation that is aimed at compensating 
for progressive energy malnutrition. The entry of bile acids into the systemic 
circulation in PBC is accompanied by dyslipidemia. The mechanism of 
hyperlipidemia in patients with PBC differs from that in other conditions 
because along with an increase in total cholesterol (TC), there are elevated 
high-density lipoprotein levels and the appearance of unusual lipoprotein X 
(Lp-X). The appearance of Lp-X is most likely to be the body's protective 
reaction to inactivate the detergent effect of bile acids on the membrane 
structures of blood corpuscles and vascular endothelial cells. It is bile acids, 
rather than TC levels, that correlate with the content of Lp-X and determine its 
formation. Concomitant hypercholesterolemia in patients with PBC is also aimed 
at neutralizing the detergent effect of bile acids that have entered the 
systemic circulation and is most likely a compensatory reaction of the body. 
""Anomalous"" hypercholesterolemia in PBC can serve as a model system for the 
search and development of new methods for the treatment of dyslipidemia since it 
occurs without an increase in the incidence of cardiovascular events."
1645,"Hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy results from the interruption of oxygen delivery 
and blood flow to the brain. In the developing brain, it can lead to a brain 
injury, which is associated with high mortality rates and comorbidities. The 
hippocampus is one of the brain regions that may be affected by hypoxia-ischemia 
with consequences on cognition. Unfortunately, clinically approved therapeutics 
are still scarce and limited. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to test three 
repurposed drugs with good pharmacological properties to evaluate if they can 
revert, or at least attenuate, the deleterious effects of hypoxia-ischemia in an 
in vitro model. Edaravone, perampanel, and metformin are used for the treatment 
of stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, some forms of epileptic status, and 
diabetes type 2, respectively. Through cell viability assays, morphology 
analysis, and detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in two 
different cell lines (HT-22 and SH-SY5Y), we found that edaravone and low 
concentrations of perampanel are able to attenuate cell damage induced by 
hypoxia and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Metformin did not attenuate 
hypoxic-induced events, at least in the initial phase. Among these repurposed 
drugs, edaravone emerged as the most efficient in the attenuation of events 
induced by hypoxia-ischemia, and the safest, since it did not exhibit 
significant cytotoxicity, even in high concentrations, and induced a decrease in 
ROS. Our results also reinforce the view that ROS and overexcitation play an 
important role in the pathophysiology of hypoxia-ischemia brain injury."
1646,"(1) Background: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication in 
cirrhosis patients, and recently, clinical evidence indicates that a higher risk 
of HE is associated with the usage of proton pump inhibitors. However, the 
cortical mechanism underlying this neurological disorder of HE remains unknown. 
(2) Methods: We review the medical recordings of 260 patients diagnosed with 
liver cirrhosis between January 2021 and March 2022 in one tertiary hospital. 
Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factor of HE 
development. To examine the relationship between cortical dynamics and the 
administration of proton pump inhibitors, resting-state electroencephalograms 
(EEGs) were conducted in cirrhosis patients who were treated with proton pump 
inhibitors. (3) Results: About 28.5% (74 out of 260) of participants developed 
secondary HE in this study. The logistics regression model indicated that 
multiple risk factors were associated with the incidence of secondary HE, 
including proton pump inhibitors usage, white blood cell and neutrophil counts, 
hemoglobin, prothrombin time activity, and blood urea nitrogen. A total of 
twelve cirrhosis patients who were scheduled to use proton pump inhibitors 
consented to performing electroencephalogram recordings upon admission, and 
eight of twelve participants were diagnosed with HE. Spectral analysis revealed 
that the decrease in alpha oscillation activities was potentially associated 
with the development of HE. (4) Conclusions: Our data support the susceptibility 
of secondary HE in cirrhosis patients treated by proton pump inhibitors. One 
potential cortical mechanism underlying the neurological disease is the 
suppression of alpha oscillations in the brain."
1647,"The prognosis for patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to 
regional lymph nodes or distant sites remains poor with limited treatment 
options, especially after the failure of first-line chemotherapy. Clinical 
trials evaluating the use of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, or the use of 
checkpoint inhibitor therapy with stereotactic body radiation therapy for the 
treatment of metastatic penile squamous cell carcinoma, are currently 
unavailable. In this case report, we present a patient with relapsed advanced 
penile squamous cell carcinoma and an unknown (human papilloma virus) HPV status 
and borderline programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L)1 status who was treated with 
pembrolizumab and stereotactic body radiation therapy. This patient achieved a 
complete durable treatment response despite having genomic features of an 
immunologically ""cold"" tumor. This case highlights the importance of 
investigating more into the treatment of these tumors that lack genomic features 
that classically have been observed to be susceptible to treatment with 
immunotherapy or immunotherapy augmented with stereotactic body radiation 
therapy in solid tumors, particularly in metastatic penile squamous cell 
carcinoma."
1648,"Comprehensive genomic profiling examinations (CGPs) have recently been 
developed, and a variety of tumor-agnostic mutations have been detected, leading 
to the development of new molecular-targetable therapies across solid tumors. In 
addition, the elucidation of hereditary tumors, such as breast and ovarian 
cancer, has pioneered a new age marked by the development of new treatments and 
lifetime management strategies required for patients with potential or presented 
hereditary cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, few tumor-agnostic 
or hereditary mutations have been the focus of investigation, with associated 
molecular-targeted therapies remaining poorly developed. We focused on 
representative tumor-agnostic mutations such as the TP53, KIT, KRAS, BRCA1, ATM, 
JAK2, NTRK3, FGFR3 and EGFR genes, referring to a CGP study conducted in Japan, 
and we considered the possibility of developing molecular-targeted therapies for 
AML with tumor-agnostic mutations. We summarized the frequency, the prognosis, 
the structure and the function of these mutations as well as the current 
treatment strategies in solid tumors, revealed the genetical relationships 
between solid tumors and AML and developed tumor-agnostic molecular-targeted 
therapies and lifetime management strategies in AML."
1649,"The aim of this study was, firstly, to analyze the histopathological 
characteristics of placentas in women with uneventful pregnancies and affected 
by COVID-19 at the time of delivery; and secondly, to correlate histological 
findings to maternal and neonatal characteristics. In our single-center 
prospective observational study, 46 placentas from term uncomplicated singleton 
pregnancies of patients with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of 
delivery underwent histological examination. Despite a normal feto-maternal 
outcome, most of the placentas (82.6%) presented signs of maternal vascular 
malperfusion, while features of fetal vascular malperfusion were found in 54% of 
cases. No correlation was detected between maternal and neonatal characteristics 
and the severity of blood circulation disease, and abnormal findings were also 
described in asymptomatic patients. Moreover, we did not find any maternal 
symptoms or clinical details allowing for the prediction of abnormal placental 
findings in pregnancy complicated by COVID-19 infection. Our results suggest 
that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy could lead to acute placental 
dysfunction."
1650,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third among all cancers in terms of prevalence. 
There is growing evidence that gut microbiota has a role in the development of 
colorectal cancer. Fusobacterium nucleatum is overrepresented in the 
gastrointestinal tract and tumor microenvironment of patients with CRC. This 
suggests the role of F. nucleatum as a potential risk factor in the development 
of CRC. Hence, we aimed to explore whole genomes of F. nucleatum strains related 
to CRC to predict potential therapeutic markers through a pan-genome integrated 
subtractive genomics approach. In the current study, we identified 538 proteins 
as essential for F. nucleatum survival, 209 non-homologous to a human host, and 
12 as drug targets. Eventually, riboflavin synthase (RiS) was selected as a 
therapeutic target for further processing. Three different inhibitor libraries 
of lead-like natural products, i.e., cyanobactins (n = 237), streptomycins (n = 
607), and marine bacterial secondary metabolites (n = 1226) were screened 
against it. After the structure-based study, three compounds, i.e., CMNPD3609 
(-7.63) &gt; Malyngamide V (-7.03) &gt; ZINC06804365 (-7.01) were prioritized as 
potential inhibitors of F. nucleatum. Additionally, the stability and 
flexibility of these compounds bound to RiS were determined via a molecular 
dynamics simulation of 50 ns. Results revealed the stability of these compounds 
within the binding pocket, after 5 ns. ADMET profiling showed compounds as 
drug-like, non-permeable to the blood brain barrier, non-toxic, and HIA 
permeable. Pan-genomics mediated drug target identification and the virtual 
screening of inhibitors is the preliminary step towards inhibition of this 
pathogenic oncobacterium and we suggest mouse model experiments to validate our 
findings."
1651,"Autologous stem cell transplantation is routinely used in the management of 
several hematological diseases, solid tumors, and immune disorders. Peripheral 
blood stem cell (PBSC) collection performed by apheresis is the preferred source 
of stem cells. In this study, the potential impact of mobilization regimens on 
the performance of the Spectra Optia® continuous mononuclear cell collection 
system was evaluated. We performed a retrospective data analysis for patients 
undergoing autologous PBSC collection at the Medical University Vienna, Vienna 
General Hospital between September 2016 and June 2018. Collections were divided 
into two main groups according to the mobilization regimen received: without 
(210 collections) or with (99 collections) plerixafor. Assessed variables 
included product characteristics and collection efficiency (CE). Overall, 
product characteristics were similar between the groups. Median CD34+ CE2 was 
50.1% versus 53.0%, and CE1 was 66.9% versus 69.9% following mobilization 
without and with plerixafor, respectively; the difference was not statistically 
significant. Simple linear regression showed a very weak positive correlation 
between the mobilization method and CE1 or CE2 (mobilization with plerixafor 
increased CE2 by 4.106%). In conclusion, the Spectra Optia® apheresis system led 
to high CE and a good quality of PBSC products when mobilization regimens with 
or without plerixafor were used."
1652,"The limited treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer with brain 
metastasis (TNBC-BM) have left the door of further drug development for these 
patients wide open. Although immunotherapy via monoclonal antibodies has shown 
some promising results in several cancers including TNBC, it cannot be 
considered the most effective treatment for brain metastasis. This is due to the 
protective role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which limits the entrance of 
most drugs, especially the bulky ones such as antibodies, to the brain. For a 
drug to traverse the BBB via passive diffusion, various physicochemical 
properties should be considered. Since natural medicine has been a key 
inspiration for the development of the majority of current medicines, in this 
paper, we review several naturally-derived molecules which have the potential 
for immunotherapy via blocking the interaction of programmed cell death 
protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1. The mechanism of action, physicochemical 
properties and pharmacokinetics of these molecules and their theoretical 
potential to be used for the treatment of TNBC-BM are discussed."
1653,"Central nervous system (CNS) metastatic spread in neuroblastoma (NB) is rare and 
occurs more often at relapse/progression. We report on CNS involvement in high 
risk (HR) NB over 25 years. For this retrospective study, we reviewed the CNS 
imaging of all the patients treated at Bambino Gesù Children Hospital from 1 
July 1996 to 30 June 2022. A total of 128 patients with HR NB were diagnosed 
over 26 years. Out of 128 patients, CNS metastatic spread occurred in 6 
patients: 3 patients presented a metastatic spread at diagnosis, while in 3 
patients, CNS was involved at relapse. Overall, the rate of occurrence of CNS 
spread is 4.7% with the same distribution at diagnosis and at relapse, namely 
2.3%. Interestingly, CNS spread at diagnosis was observed only before 2012, 
whereas CNS was observed at relapse only after 2012, in the immunotherapy era. 
CNS metastases presented similar imaging features at diagnosis and at relapse, 
with a peculiar hemorrhagic aspect and mainly hemispheric localization in 
patients with bone skull involvement at the time of diagnosis. The outcome is 
dismal, and 3 out of 6 patients died for progressive disease."
1654,"An improved understanding of relapse kinetics is required to optimize detection 
and treatment strategies for the post-transplant relapse of myeloid neoplasms. 
Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed data from 91 patients allografted for MDS 
(n = 54), AML-MRC (n = 29) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML, n = 8), 
who relapsed after transplant. Patients with early (&lt;12 months, n = 56) and 
late relapse (&gt;12 months, n = 35) were compared regarding patient-, disease- 
and transplant-related factors, including karyotype analyses at diagnosis and 
relapse. After a median follow-up of 17.4 months after relapse, late relapses 
showed improved outcomes compared with early relapses (2-yr OS 67% vs. 32%, p = 
0.0048). Comparing frequency of distinct patient-, disease- and 
transplant-related factors among early and late relapses, complex karyotype (p = 
0.0004) and unfavorable disease risk at diagnosis (p = 0.0008) as well as clonal 
evolution at relapse (p = 0.03) were more common in early than in late relapses. 
Furthermore, patients receiving transplant without prior cytoreduction or in 
complete remission were more frequently present in the group of late relapses. 
These data suggest that cytogenetics rather than disease burden at diagnosis and 
transplant-related factors determine the timepoint of post-transplant relapse 
and that upfront transplantation may be favored in order to delay relapse."
1655,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that accounts for ~20% 
of all childhood leukemias, and more than 40% of children with AML relapse 
within three years of diagnosis. Although recent efforts have focused on 
developing a precise medicine-based approach towards treating AML in adults, 
there remains a critical gap in therapies designed specifically for children. 
Here, we present ex vivo drug sensitivity profiles for children with de novo AML 
using an automated flow cytometry platform. Fresh diagnostic blood or bone 
marrow aspirate samples were screened for sensitivity in response to 78 dose 
conditions by measuring the reduction in leukemic blasts relative to the 
control. In pediatric patients treated with conventional chemotherapy, 
comprising cytarabine, daunorubicin and etoposide (ADE), ex vivo drug 
sensitivity results correlated with minimal residual disease (r = 0.63) and one 
year relapse-free survival (r = 0.70; AUROC = 0.94). In the de novo ADE analysis 
cohort of 13 patients, AML cells showed greater sensitivity to 
bortezomib/panobinostat compared with ADE, and comparable sensitivity between 
venetoclax/azacitidine and ADE ex vivo. Two patients showed a differential 
response between ADE and bortezomib/panobinostat, thus supporting the 
incorporation of ex vivo drug sensitivity testing in clinical trials to further 
evaluate the predictive utility of this platform in children with AML."
1656,"BACKGROUND: Loco-regional therapy (LRT) in de novo metastatic breast cancer 
(MBC) has been investigated in several clinical trials, with heterogeneous and 
conflicting results.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of de novo MBC patients treated with 
front-line chemotherapy (FLC) followed by LRT of the primary tumor. Our aims 
were to evaluate the characteristics, treatment, and oncological outcomes in 
terms of progression-free survival (PFS), distant progression-free survival 
(DPFS), and overall survival (OS) of de novo MBC. We also investigated possible 
subgroups of patients with better outcomes according to menopausal status, 
biological sub-type, location, number of metastases, and radiologic complete 
response after FLC.
RESULTS: We included 61 patients in the study. After a median follow-up of 55 
months, disease progression occurred in 60.7% of patients and 49.2% died. There 
were no significant differences in PFS, DPFS, and OS between different subgroups 
of de novo MBC patients. A trend toward better PFS and DPFS was observed in 
triple-positive tumors, without a statistically significant difference in OS.
CONCLUSIONS: No specific subgroup of de novo MBC patients showed a statistically 
significant survival advantage after FLC followed by LRT of the primary tumor."
1657,"Inflammatory reactions play a crucial role in cancer progression and may 
contribute to systemic inflammation. In routine clinical practice, some 
inflammatory biomarkers can be utilized as valuable predictors for colorectal 
cancer (CRC). This study aims to determine the usefulness of a novel 
cancer-inflammation prognostic index (CIPI) marker derived from calculating 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) multiplied by the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) values established for non-metastatic CRCs. Between January 1995 and 
December 2018, 12,092 patients were diagnosed with stage I to III primary CRC 
and had radical resection-they were all included in this study for further 
investigation. There were 5996 (49.6%) patients in the low-CIPI group and 6096 
(50.4%) patients in the high-CIPI group according to the cutoff value of 8. For 
long-term outcomes, the high-CIPI group had a significantly higher incidence of 
recurrence (30.6% vs. 16.0%, p &lt; 0.001) and worse relapse-free survival (RFS) 
and overall survival (OS) rates (p &lt; 0.001). High CIPI was an independent 
prognostic factor for RFS and OS in univariate and multivariate analyses. This 
research is the first to document the independent significance of CIPI as a 
prognostic factor for CRC. To ensure that it works, this CIPI needs to be tested 
on more CRC prediction models."
1658,"Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1MUT) gene occur in various 
types of malignancies, including ~60% of chondrosarcomas, ~30% of intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinomas and &gt;80% of low-grade gliomas. IDH1MUT are causal in the 
development and progression of these types of cancer due to neomorphic 
production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Intracellular 
accumulation of D-2HG has been implicated in suppressing homologous 
recombination and renders IDH1MUT cancer cells sensitive to 
DNA-repair-inhibiting agents, such as poly-(adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) 
polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Hyperthermia increases the efficacy of 
DNA-damaging therapies such as radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy, 
mainly by inhibition of DNA repair. In the current study, we investigated the 
additional effects of hyperthermia (42 °C for 1 h) in the treatment of IDH1MUT 
HCT116 colon cancer cells and hyperthermia1080 chondrosarcoma cancer cells in 
combination with radiation, cisplatin and/or a PARPi on clonogenic cell 
survival, cell cycle distribution and the induction and repair of DNA 
double-strand breaks. We found that hyperthermia in combination with radiation 
or cisplatin induces an increase in double-strand breaks and cell death, up to 
10-fold in IDH1MUT cancer cells compared to IDH1 wild-type cells. This 
vulnerability was abolished by the IDH1MUT inhibitor AGI-5198 and was further 
increased by the PARPi. In conclusion, our study shows that IDH1MUT cancer cells 
are sensitized to hyperthermia in combination with irradiation or cisplatin and 
a PARPi. Therefore, hyperthermia may be an efficacious sensitizer to cytotoxic 
therapies in tumors where the clinical application of hyperthermia is feasible, 
such as IDH1MUT chondrosarcoma of the extremities."
1659,"Current imaging modalities frequently misjudge disease stage in colorectal, 
gastric and pancreatic cancer. As treatment decisions are dependent on disease 
stage, incorrect staging has serious consequences. Previous preclinical research 
and case reports indicate that prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA)-targeted PET/CT imaging might provide a solution to some of these 
challenges. This prospective clinical study aims to assess the feasibility of 
[18F]DCFPyL PET/CT imaging to target and visualize primary colon, gastric and 
pancreatic cancer. In this prospective clinical trial, patients with colon, 
gastric and pancreatic cancer were included and underwent both [18F]DCFPyL and 
[18F]FDG PET/CT scans prior to surgical resection or (for gastric cancer) 
neoadjuvant therapy. Semiquantitative analysis of immunohistochemical PSMA 
staining was performed on the surgical resection specimens, and the results were 
correlated to imaging parameters. The results of this study demonstrate 
detection of the primary tumor by [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT in 7 out of 10 patients 
with colon, gastric and pancreatic cancer, with a mean tumor-to-blood pool ratio 
(TBR) of 3.3 and mean SUVmax of 3.6. However, due to the high surrounding 
uptake, visual distinction of these tumors was difficult, and the SUVmax and TBR 
on [18F]FDG PET/CT were significantly higher than on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT. In 
addition, no correlation between PSMA expression in the resection specimen and 
SUVmax on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT was found. In conclusion, the detection of several 
gastrointestinal cancers using [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT is feasible. However, low 
tumor expression and high uptake physiologically in organs/background hamper the 
clear distinction of the tumor. As a result, [18F]FDG PET/CT was superior in 
detecting colon, gastric and pancreatic cancers."
1660,"In metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), the clinical response to immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is limited in a subset of patients and the need 
exists to identify non-invasive, blood-based, predictive biomarkers for 
responses. We performed RNA sequencing using whole-blood samples prospectively 
collected from 49 patients with mRCC prior to the administration of ipilimumab 
(IPI) and/or nivolumab (NIVO) to determine whether gene expression profiles were 
associated with responses. An analysis from 33 mRCC patients with complete 
responses (n = 5), partial responses (n = 14), and progressive disease (n = 14) 
showed 460 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to immune responses 
between the responder and non-responder groups with significant differences. A 
set of 14 genes generated from the initial 460 DEGs accurately classified 
responders (sensitivity 94.7% and specificity 50.0%) while consensus clustering 
defined clusters with significantly differing response rates (92.3% and 35.0%). 
These clustering results were replicated in a cohort featuring 16 additional SD 
patients (49 total patients): response rates were 95.8% and 48.0%. Collectively, 
whole-blood gene expression profiles derived from mRCC patients treated with 
ICIs clearly differed by response and hierarchical clustering using immune 
response DEGs accurately classified responder patients. These results suggest 
that such screening may serve as a predictor for ICI responses in mRCC patients."
1661,"Locked nucleic acid quantitative Real-Time PCR (LNA-qPCR) for IDH1/2 mutations 
in AML measurable residual disease (MRD) detection is rarely reported. LNA-qPCR 
was applied to quantify IDH1/2 mutants MRD kinetics in bone marrow from 88 
IDH1/2-mutated AML patients, and correlated with NPM1-MRD, clinical 
characteristics, and outcomes. The median normalized copy number (NCN) of IDH1/2 
mutants decreased significantly from 53,228 (range 87-980,686)/ALB × 106 at 
diagnosis to 773 (range 1.5-103,600)/ALB × 106 at first complete remission (CR). 
IDH1/2 LNA-qPCR MRD was concordant with remission status or NPM1-MRD in 79.5% 
(70/88) of patients. Younger patients and patients with FLT3 mutations had 
higher concordance. The Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) and concordance 
rate between the log reduction of IDH1/2 LNA-qPCR and NPM1-MRD were 0.68 and 81% 
(K = 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.74), respectively. IDH1/2-MRD &gt; 2 log reduction at 
first CR predicted significantly better relapse-free survival (3-year RFS rates 
52.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.007) and cumulative incidence of relapse (3-year CIR 
rates 44.5% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.012) compared to IDH1/2-MRD ≤ 2 log reduction. 
IDH1/2-MRD &gt; 2 log reduction during consolidation is also associated with a 
significantly lower CIR rate than IDH1/2-MRD ≤ 2 log reduction (3-year CIR rates 
42.3% vs. 68.8%, p = 0.019). LNA-qPCR for IDH1/2 mutation is a potential MRD 
technique to predict relapse in IDH1/2-mutated AML patients, especially for 
those with IDH1/2 MRD &gt; 2 log reduction at first CR or a concurrent FLT3 
mutation."
1662,"OBJECTIVES: Combined immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy and chemotherapy 
has become the standard treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Pleural effusion (PE) is associated with poor outcomes among patients 
with NSCLC undergoing chemotherapy. However, minimal data exists on PE for 
patients undergoing combined ICI and chemotherapy. Therefore, we investigated 
how PE affects survival outcomes in patients with NSCLC undergoing this combined 
therapy.
METHODS: We identified patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing chemotherapy and 
ICI therapy from the Okayama Lung Cancer Study Group-Immune Chemotherapy 
Database (OLCSG-ICD) between December 2018 and December 2020; the OLCSG-ICD 
includes the clinical data of patients with advanced NSCLC from 13 institutions. 
Then, we analyzed the treatment outcomes based on the presence of PE.
RESULTS: We identified 478 patients who underwent combined ICI therapy and 
chemotherapy; 357 patients did not have PE, and 121 patients did have PE. 
Patients with PE had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) than those without PE (median PFS: 6.2 months versus 9.1 
months; p &lt; 0.001; median OS: 16.4 months versus 27.7 months; p &lt; 0.001). 
The negative effect of PE differed based on the patient's programmed cell 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression status; with the effect being more evident in 
patients with high PD-L1 expression. In addition, PFS and OS did not differ 
between patients who did and did not undergo bevacizumab treatment; thus, 
bevacizumab-containing regimens did not improve the survival outcomes for 
patients with PE.
CONCLUSION: PE is associated with poor outcomes among patients with NSCLC 
undergoing combined ICI therapy and chemotherapy."
1663,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential for facilitating the detection 
and classification of tumors. In patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 
distinguishing between the most common subtypes, adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 
squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), is crucial for the development of an effective 
treatment plan. This task, however, may still present challenges in clinical 
routine. We propose a two-modality, AI-based classification algorithm to detect 
and subtype tumor areas, which combines information from matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data and digital 
microscopy whole slide images (WSIs) of lung tissue sections. The method 
consists of first detecting areas with high tumor cell content by performing a 
segmentation of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E-stained) WSIs, and 
subsequently classifying the tumor areas based on the corresponding MALDI MSI 
data. We trained the algorithm on six tissue microarrays (TMAs) with tumor 
samples from N = 232 patients and used 14 additional whole sections for 
validation and model selection. Classification accuracy was evaluated on a test 
dataset with another 16 whole sections. The algorithm accurately detected and 
classified tumor areas, yielding a test accuracy of 94.7% on spectrum level, and 
correctly classified 15 of 16 test sections. When an additional quality control 
criterion was introduced, a 100% test accuracy was achieved on sections that 
passed the quality control (14 of 16). The presented method provides a step 
further towards the inclusion of AI and MALDI MSI data into clinical routine and 
has the potential to reduce the pathologist's work load. A careful analysis of 
the results revealed specific challenges to be considered when training neural 
networks on data from lung cancer tissue."
1664,"This study reports characteristics and outcomes in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) receiving nivolumab 
in second-line or later (2L+) in France and Germany between 2015 and 2020. 
Patients with aNSCLC (stage IIIB-C/IV) receiving nivolumab in 2L+ were included 
from the retrospective Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics of 
Advanced and Metastatic Lung Cancer cohort (ESME-AMLC, France; 2015-2019) and 
Clinical Research platform Into molecular testing, treatment and outcome of 
non-Small cell lung carcinoma Patients (CRISP, Germany; 2016-2020). Overall, 
2262 ESME-AMLC and 522 CRISP patients were included. Median treatment duration 
(95% confidence intervals) was 2.8 months (2.5-3.2) in squamous and 2.5 months 
(2.3-2.8) in non-squamous/others patients in ESME-AMLC, and 2.3 months (1.4-3.1) 
and 2.3 months (2.0-2.8), respectively in CRISP. One-year and two-year overall 
survival (OS) were 47.2% and 26.7% in squamous and 50.8% and 32.8% in 
non-squamous/others patients in ESME-AMLC, and 43.1% and 20.9%, and 37.7% and 
18.9%, respectively in CRISP. Poorer performance score and shorter time from 
start of previous line of therapy initiation were significantly associated with 
shorter treatment duration and OS. This study confirms, in real-world clinical 
databases, the efficacy of nivolumab previously observed in clinical trials."
1665,"According to the World Health Organization's 2018 Global Cancer Survey, cancer 
is the second leading cause of death. From this survey, the third most common is 
breast cancer, the fifth is melanoma malignum and pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
ranks twentieth. Undoubtedly, the early diagnosis and monitoring of these tumors 
and related research is important for aspects of patient care. The aim of our 
present review was to explain an impressive methodology that is deemed suitable 
in reference to studying blood sample deviations in the case of solid tumors. 
Essentially, we compared the heat denaturation responses of blood plasma 
components through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the control, 
between five and seven separable components can be detected, in which the 
primary component was albumin, while in the case of tumorous patients, the peaks 
of immunoglobulins were dominant. Moreover, the shape of the plasma DSC curves 
changed with a shift in the higher temperature ranges; thus, their pattern can 
be used as a suitable marker of direct immunological responses. The further 
development of the analysis of DSC curves raises the possibility of the early 
diagnosis of a potential tumor, the monitoring of diseases, or testing the 
efficacy of the therapy from a single drop of blood."
1666,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) accounts for 15% of childhood ALL. 
The early T-precursor (ETP-ALL) subset is characterized by an immature T-cell 
phenotype, chemoresistance, and high rates of induction failure. MERTK receptor 
tyrosine kinase is ectopically expressed in half of T-ALLs, particularly those 
with an immature T-cell phenotype, suggesting a role in ETP-ALL. The 
anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) is essential for ETP-ALL cell 
survival. Here, we show that MERTK and BCL-2 mRNA and protein are preferentially 
expressed in ETP-ALL patient samples. The dual MERTK/FLT3 inhibitor MRX-2843 
decreased MERTK activation and downstream signaling, inhibited cell expansion, 
and induced cell death in ETP-ALL cell lines. Further, 54% (21/39) of primary 
T-ALL patient samples were sensitive to MERTK inhibition. Treatment with 
MRX-2843 significantly reduced leukemia burden and prolonged survival in 
cell-line-derived T-ALL and ETP-ALL xenograft models. In a patient-derived 
ETP-ALL xenograft model, treatment with MRX-2843 markedly reduced peripheral 
blood leukemia and spleen weight compared to vehicle-treated mice and prolonged 
survival. MRX-2843 also synergized with venetoclax to provide enhanced 
anti-leukemia activity in ETP-ALL cell cultures, with a dose ratio of 1:20 
MRX-2843:venetoclax providing optimal synergy. These data demonstrate the 
therapeutic potential of MRX-2843 in patients with T-ALL and provide rationale 
for clinical development. MRX-2843 monotherapy is currently being tested in 
patients with relapsed leukemia (NCT04872478). Further, our data indicate that 
combined MERTK and BCL-2 inhibition may be particularly effective for treatment 
of ETP-ALL."
1667,"The in-frame internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 
(FLT3) gene is an important negative prognostic marker in acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML). FLT3-ITD monitoring is essential for patients at relapse or those 
receiving FLT3-targeted therapies. Fragment analysis (FA) is commonly used to 
detect and quantify FLT3-ITDs; however, detecting low-burden FLT3-ITDs after a 
treatment is challenging. We, therefore, developed a customized, next-generation 
sequencing (NGS)-based FLT3-ITD assay that includes a new ITD-tracing algorithm, 
""SEED"", optimized for measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring. NGS-SEED 
showed an enhanced sensitivity (0.001%) and has a superior performance over 
conventional fragment analysis. We further investigated the prognostic impact of 
MRD analyzed by NGS-SEED in AML patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Our assay showed that the MRD assessed before 
and after HSCT were significantly associated with a risk of relapse and a poor 
overall survival, respectively, in a time-dependent analysis. Thus, this report 
highlighted the prognostic value of serial MRD monitoring using a sensitive 
method in a clinical setting of AML patients with FLT3-ITD."
1668,"The incidence of cancer in children living with HIV (CLWH) is high and lymphomas 
are the most common type of cancer in this population. The combined 
antiretroviral therapy (cART) changed the natural history of HIV infection. To 
determine the incidence and profile of these CLWH malignancies in Rio de Janeiro 
(RJ), Brazil, we conducted a retrospective and observational study of vertically 
infected CLWH, ranging from 0-20 incomplete years, from 1995 to 2018, at five 
reference centers. The study period was divided into three eras in accordance 
with the widespread use of cART in Brazil. 1306 patients were included. Of the 
25 lymphomas found, 19 were AIDS-defining malignancies (ADM); 6 were 
non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADM). The incidence rate (IR) of lymphoma 
developing was 1.70 per 1000 children-year (95% CI 1.09-2.50). ADM development 
IR decreased from 2.09-1.75-0.19 per 1000 children-year (p &lt; 0.001) through 
cART eras. Cumulative Nelson-Aalen hazards of developing ADM over a 20-year 
period were 3.73% in the Early-cART era, 3.07% in the Mid-cART era, and 0.32% in 
the Late-cART era (p = 0.013). This study demonstrates the IR of lymphoma in 
CLWH in RJ, Brazil, as well as the benefit of cART in reducing ADM and death 
occurrence in the Post-cART era."
1669,"Hereditary gastric cancers (HGCs) are supposed to be rare and difficult to 
identify. Nonetheless, many cases of young patients with gastric cancer (GC) 
fulfill the clinical criteria for considering this diagnosis but do not present 
the defined pathogenic mutations necessary to meet a formal diagnosis of HGC. 
Moreover, GC in young people is a challenging medical situation due to the usual 
aggressiveness of such cases and the potential risk for their relatives when 
related to a germline variant. Aiming to identify additional germline 
alterations that might contribute to the early onset of GC, a complete exome 
sequence of blood samples from 95 GC patients under 50 and 94 blood samples from 
non-cancer patients was performed and compared in this study. The number of 
identified germline mutations in GC patients was found to be much higher than 
that from individuals without a cancer diagnosis. Specifically, the number of 
high functional impact mutations, including those affecting genes involved in 
medical diseases, cancer hallmark genes, and DNA replication and repair 
processes, was much higher, strengthening the hypothesis of the potential causal 
role of such mutations in hereditary cancers. Conversely, classically related 
HGC mutations were not found and the number of mutations in genes in the CDH1 
pathway was not found to be relevant among the young GC patients, reinforcing 
the hypothesis that existing alternative germline contributions favor the early 
onset of GC. The LILRB1 gene variants, absent in the world's cancer datasets but 
present in high frequencies among the studied GC patients, may represent 
essential cancer variants specific to the Amerindian ancestry's contributions. 
Identifying non-reported GC variants, potentially originating from under-studied 
populations, may pave the way for additional discoveries and translations to 
clinical interventions for GC management. The newly proposed approaches may 
reduce the discrepancy between clinically suspected and molecularly proven 
hereditary GC and shed light on similar inconsistencies among other cancer 
types. Additionally, the results of this study may support the development of 
new blood tests for evaluating cancer risk that can be used in clinical 
practice, helping physicians make decisions about strategies for surveillance 
and risk-reduction interventions."
1670,"A reliable prognostic stratification of patients with locally advanced 
hypopharyngeal cancer who had been treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy 
(CCRT) is crucial for informing tailored management strategies. The purpose of 
this retrospective study was to develop robust and objective magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) radiomics-based models for predicting overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) in this patient population. The study 
participants included 198 patients (median age: 52.25 years (interquartile range 
= 46.88-59.53 years); 95.96% men) who were randomly divided into a training 
cohort (n = 132) and a testing cohort (n = 66). Radiomic parameters were 
extracted from post-contrast T1-weighted MR images. Radiomic features for model 
construction were selected from the training cohort using least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regression models. Prognostic performances 
were assessed by calculating the integrated area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (iAUC). The ability of radiomic models to predict OS (iAUC 
= 0.580, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.558-0.591) and PFS (iAUC = 0.625, 95% 
CI = 0.600-0.633) was validated in the testing cohort. The combination of 
radiomic signatures with traditional clinical parameters outperformed clinical 
variables alone in the prediction of survival outcomes (observed iAUC increments 
= 0.279 [95% CI = 0.225-0.334] and 0.293 [95% CI = 0.232-0.351] for OS and PFS, 
respectively). In summary, MRI radiomics has value for predicting survival 
outcomes in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer treated with CCRT, especially 
when combined with clinical prognostic variables."
1671,"BACKGROUND: In breast, prostate, and other epithelial tumors, circulating tumor 
cells (CTC) in peripheral blood may predict survival. Our study evaluated the 
prognostic significance of baseline and postoperative CTC in patients with early 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through a meta-analytic approach.
METHODS: Prospective studies comparing survival outcomes between positive (CTC+) 
and negative CTC (CTC-) patients were systematically searched. Primary outcomes 
were overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) with hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) as the effect measure. Pooled HR determined the 
prognostic role under a fixed-effect or random-effect model depending on 
heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 1321 patients were eligible. CTC+ patients were 
associated with an increased risk of death (HR 3.53, 95% CI 2.51-4.95; p &lt; 
0.00001) and relapse (HR 2.97, 95% CI 2.08-4.22; p &lt; 0.00001). Subgroup 
analysis results were consistent in different subsets, including time points 
(baseline and postoperative) and sources (peripheral and pulmonary vein) of 
blood collection, detection methods (label-free, label-dependent, and RT-PCR), 
and follow-up duration.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis revealed that CTC is a promising predictive 
biomarker for stratifying survival outcomes in patients with early-stage NSCLC. 
However, future studies are required to validate these findings and standardize 
detection methods."
1672,"The aim of this review is to evaluate the present status of the use of cell-free 
DNA and its fraction of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) because this year July 
2022, an ESMO guideline was published regarding the application of ctDNA in 
patient care. This review is for clinical oncologists to explain the concept, 
the terms used, the pros and cons of ctDNA; thus, the technical aspects of the 
different platforms are not reviewed in detail, but we try to help in navigating 
the current knowledge in liquid biopsy. Since the validated and adequately 
sensitive ctDNA assays have utility in identifying actionable mutations to 
direct targeted therapy, ctDNA may be used for this soon in routine clinical 
practice and in other different areas as well. The cfDNA fragments can be 
obtained by liquid biopsy and can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, and 
selecting among treatment options in cancer patients. A great proportion of 
cfDNA comes from normal cells of the body or from food uptake. Only a small part 
(&lt;1%) of it is related to tumors, originating from primary tumors, metastatic 
sites, or circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Soon the data obtained from ctDNA may 
routinely be used for finding minimal residual disease, detecting relapse, and 
determining the sites of metastases. It might also be used for deciding 
appropriate therapy, and/or emerging resistance to the therapy and the data 
analysis of ctDNA may be combined with imaging or other markers. However, to 
achieve this goal, further clinical validations are inevitable. As a result, 
clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the assays. Of course, several 
open questions are still under research and because of it cfDNA and ctDNA 
testing are not part of routine care yet."
1673,"Extramedullary relapse of multiple myeloma (MM) is often resistant to existing 
treatments, and has an extremely poor prognosis, but our understanding of 
extramedullary relapse is still limited. The incidence, clinical 
characteristics, impact on the prognosis of extramedullary relapse, and the risk 
factors for extramedullary relapse in NDMM patients were analyzed. Among the 471 
NDMM patients, a total of 267 patients had disease relapse during follow-up, 
including 64 (24.0%) patients with extramedullary relapse. Extramedullary 
relapse was more common in patients with younger age, IgD subtype, elevated LDH, 
extensive osteolytic lesions, extramedullary involvement, and spleen enlargement 
at the time of MM diagnosis. Survival analysis showed that extramedullary 
relapse patients had significantly worse median OS than patients with relapse 
but without extramedullary involvement (30.8 months vs. 53.6 months, p = 0.012). 
Multivariate analysis confirmed that elevated LDH (OR = 2.09, p = 0.023), &gt;2 
osteolytic lesions (OR = 3.70, p &lt; 0.001), extramedullary involvement (OR = 
3.48, p &lt; 0.001) and spleen enlargement (OR = 2.27, p = 0.011) at the time of 
MM diagnosis were independent risk factors for extramedullary relapse in NDMM 
patients. Each of the above four factors was assigned a value of 1 to form the 
extramedullary relapse prediction score, and the 3-year extramedullary relapse 
rates of patients in the 0-2 and 3-4 score groups were 9.0 % and 76.7 %, 
respectively. This study suggested that extramedullary relapse was associated 
with poor clinical characteristics and poor prognosis in NDMM patients. The 
extramedullary relapse prediction score model composed of LDH, osteolytic 
lesions, extramedullary involvement and spleen enlargement has a better ability 
to predict extramedullary relapse than the existing ISS and R-ISS stages."
1674,"To prospectively investigate the prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET/MRI in patients 
with oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OHSCC) treated by 
chemoradiotherapy. The study cohort consisted of patients with OHSCC who had 
undergone integrated PET/MRI prior to chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy. Imaging 
parameters derived from intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), dynamic 
contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and 18F-FDG PET were analyzed in relation to 
overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). In multivariable 
analysis, T classification (p &lt; 0.001), metabolic tumor volume (p = 0.013), 
and pseudo-diffusion coefficient (p = 0.008) were identified as independent risk 
factors for OS. The volume transfer rate constant (p = 0.015), initial area 
under the curve (p = 0.043), T classification (p = 0.018), and N classification 
(p = 0.018) were significant predictors for RFS. The Harrell's c-indices of OS 
and RFS obtained from prognostic models incorporating clinical and PET/MRI 
predictors were significantly higher than those derived from the traditional TNM 
staging system (p = 0.001). The combination of clinical risk factors with 
functional parameters derived from IVIM and DCE-MRI plus metabolic PET 
parameters derived from 18F-FDG PET in integrated PET/MRI outperformed the 
information provided by traditional TNM staging in predicting the survival of 
patients with OHSCC."
1675,"Various neurological complications, affecting both the central and peripheral 
nervous system, can frequently be experienced by cancer survivors after exposure 
to conventional chemotherapy, but also to modern immunotherapy. In this review, 
we provide an overview of the most well-known adverse events related to 
chemotherapy, with a focus on chemotherapy induced peripheral neurotoxicity, but 
we also address some emerging novel clinical entities related to cancer 
treatment, including chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment and 
immune-mediated adverse events. Unfortunately, efficacious curative or 
preventive treatment for all these neurological complications is still lacking. 
We provide a description of the possible mechanisms involved to drive future 
drug discovery in this field, both for symptomatic treatment and 
neuroprotection."
1676,"Lung cancer ranks second worldwide after breast cancer and third in Europe after 
breast and colorectal cancers when both sexes and all ages are considered. In 
this context, the aim of this study was to emphasize the power of dual analysis 
of the molecular profile both in tumor tissue and plasma by NGS assay as a 
liquid biopsy approach with impact on prognosis and therapy modulation in NSCLC 
patients. NGS analysis was performed both from tissue biopsies and from cfNAs 
isolated from peripheral blood samples. Out of all 29 different mutations 
detectable by both NGS panels (plasma and tumor tissue), seven different 
variants (24.13%; EGFR L858R in two patients, KRAS G13D and Q61H and TP53 G244D, 
V197M, R213P, and R273H) were detected only in plasma and not in the tumor 
itself. These mutations were detected in seven different patients, two of them 
having known distant organ metastasis. Our data show that NGS analysis of cfDNA 
could identify actionable mutations in advanced NSCLC and, therefore, this 
analysis could be used to monitor the disease progression and the treatment 
response and even to modulate the therapy in real time."
1677,"Despite the advances in understanding the biology of hematologic neoplasms which 
has resulted in the approval of new drugs, the therapeutic options are still 
scarce for relapsed/refractory patients. Eribulin is a unique microtubule 
inhibitor that is currently being used in the therapy for metastatic breast 
cancer and soft tissue tumors. Here, we uncover eribulin's cellular and 
molecular effects in a molecularly heterogeneous panel of hematologic neoplasms. 
Eribulin reduced cell viability and clonogenicity and promoted apoptosis and 
cell cycle arrest. The minimal effects of eribulin observed in the normal 
leukocytes suggested selectivity for malignant blood cells. In the molecular 
scenario, eribulin induces DNA damage and apoptosis markers. The ABCB1, ABCC1, 
p-AKT, p-NFκB, and NFκB levels were associated with responsiveness to eribulin 
in blood cancer cells, and a resistance eribulin-related target score was 
constructed. Combining eribulin with elacridar (a P-glycoprotein inhibitor), but 
not with PDTC (an NFkB inhibitor), increases eribulin-induced apoptosis in 
leukemia cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that eribulin leads to mitotic 
catastrophe and cell death in blood cancer cells. The expression and activation 
of MDR1, PI3K/AKT, and the NFκB-related targets may be biomarkers of the 
eribulin response, and the combined treatment of eribulin and elacridar may 
overcome drug resistance in these diseases."
1678,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a typical tumour of childhood but can occur at any 
age. Several studies have reported that adolescent and young adult (AYA) 
patients with RMS have poorer survival than do younger patients. This review 
discusses the specific challenges in AYA patients with pediatric-type RMS, 
exploring possible underlying factors which may influence different outcomes. 
Reasons for AYA survival gap are likely multifactorial, and might be related to 
differences in tumor biology and intrinsic aggressiveness, or differences in 
clinical management (that could include patient referral patterns, time to 
diagnosis, enrolment into clinical trials, the adequacy and intensity of 
treatment), as well as patient factors (including physiology and comorbidity 
that may influence treatment tolerability, drug pharmacokinetics and efficacy). 
However, improved survival has been reported in the most recent studies for AYA 
patients treated on pediatric RMS protocols. Different strategies may help to 
further improve outcome, such as supporting trans-age academic societies and 
national/international collaborations; developing specific clinical trials 
without upper age limit; defining integrated and comprehensive approach to AYA 
patients, including the genomic aspects; establishing multidisciplinary tumor 
boards with involvement of both pediatric and adult oncologists to discuss all 
pediatric-type RMS patients; developing dedicated projects with specific 
treatment recommendations and registry/database."
1679,"Neuroblastoma (NBL) and medulloblastoma (MB) are aggressive pediatric cancers 
which can benefit from therapies targeting gangliosides. Therefore, we compared 
the ganglioside profile of 9 MB and 14 NBL samples by thin layer chromatography 
and mass spectrometry. NBL had the highest expression of GD2 (median 0.54 nmol 
GD2/mg protein), and also expressed complex gangliosides. GD2-low samples 
expressed GD1a and were more differentiated. MB mainly expressed GD2 (median 
0.032 nmol GD2/mg protein) or GM3. Four sonic hedgehog-activated (SHH) as well 
as one group 4 and one group 3 MBs were GD2-positive. Two group 3 MB samples 
were GD2-negative but GM3-positive. N-glycolyl neuraminic acid-containing GM3 
was neither detected in NBL nor MB by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, a 
GD2-phenotype predicting two-gene signature (ST8SIA1 and B4GALNT1) was applied 
to RNA-Seq datasets, including 86 MBs and validated by qRT-PCR. The signature 
values were decreased in group 3 and wingless-activated (WNT) compared to SHH 
and group 4 MBs. These results suggest that while NBL is GD2-positive, only some 
MB patients can benefit from a GD2-directed therapy. The expression of genes 
involved in the ganglioside synthesis may allow the identification of 
GD2-positive MBs. Finally, the ganglioside profile may reflect the 
differentiation status in NBL and could help to define MB subtypes."
1680,"OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer is well known to express high levels of somatostatin 
receptors and preliminary data suggests that PET imaging with the somatostatin 
analog, [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE, may allow for whole body staging of patients with 
metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and neuroendocrine 
prostate cancer (NePC). This study explores the utility of [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE 
PET-CT to identify metastatic deposits in men with mCRPC and NePC and 
prognosticate disease progression.
METHODS: [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT was performed in 17 patients with mCRPC and of 
those, 2/17 had NePC. A semiquantitative analysis with standardized uptake 
values (SUV) (e.g., SUVmax, SUVmean) was performed for each metastatic lesion 
and reference background tissues. [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE uptake in metastatic 
deposits was further classified as: mild (less than liver), moderate (up to 
liver average), or marked (greater than liver). Serial prostate-specific antigen 
measurements and patient survival were followed up to 3 years after PET imaging 
to assess response to standard of care treatment.
RESULTS: All patients had at least one metastatic lesion with identifiable 
[68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE uptake. Marked [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE uptake was found in 7/17 
patients, including both NePC patients, and all were non-responders to systemic 
therapy and died within the follow up period, with a mean time to death of 8.1 
months. Three patients had mild [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE uptake, and all were 
responders to systemic therapy and were alive 36 months after [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE 
imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE is able to identify mCRPC and NePC metastatic 
deposits, and lesions with [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE uptake &gt; liver may portend poor 
outcomes in patients with mCRPC."
1681,"Background: For patients with Richter's Syndrome (RS), a durable response is 
rarely achieved with standard therapies. Significant efforts have focused on the 
development of novel treatments with reduced toxicity. We describe our 
experience using the novel combination of obinutuzumab, high-dose 
methylprednisolone (HDMP) and lenalidomide (len) in patients with RS. Patients 
and Methods: Eligible patients included adults with biopsy-proven RS. Patients 
received obinutuzumab 1000 mg × 8 doses. All patients received HDMP 1000 mg/m2 
on days 1-5 of cycles 1-4. Patients were administered len PO daily, starting at 
a dose of 5 mg. Starting on C2D1, the dose increased every 2 weeks in 5 mg 
increments to a maximum of 25 mg PO daily. Results: Seven patients were treated. 
The median dose of len was 10 mg and the median number of cycles of treatment 
completed was 2. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (29%) 
and pulmonary embolism (29%). The overall response rate for the entire cohort 
was 43% (95% CI, 10-82%). All patients who achieved a response underwent 
consolidative autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant and remain in 
remission to date. Conclusions: The combination of obinutuzumab, HDMP, and len 
is a well-tolerated, outpatient regimen that could serve as a bridge to 
transplantation, or as palliation for transplant-ineligible patients with RS."
1682,"Recent technological advances have facilitated the detection of numerous 
non-canonical human peptides derived from regulatory regions of mRNAs, long 
non-coding RNAs, and other cryptic transcripts. In this review, we first give an 
overview of the classification of these novel peptides and summarize recent 
improvements in their annotation and detection by ribosome profiling, mass 
spectrometry, and individual experimental analysis. A large fraction of the 
novel peptides originates from translation at upstream open reading frames 
(uORFs) that are located within the transcript leader sequence of regular mRNA. 
In humans, uORF-encoded peptides (uPeptides) have been detected in both healthy 
and malignantly transformed cells and emerge as important regulators in cellular 
and immunological pathways. In the second part of the review, we focus on 
various functional implications of uPeptides. As uPeptides frequently act at the 
transition of translational regulation and individual peptide function, we 
describe the mechanistic modes of translational regulation through ribosome 
stalling, the involvement in cellular programs through protein interaction and 
complex formation, and their role within the human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-associated immunopeptidome as HLA uLigands. We delineate how malignant 
transformation may lead to the formation of novel uORFs, uPeptides, or HLA 
uLigands and explain their potential implication in tumor biology. Ultimately, 
we speculate on a potential use of uPeptides as peptide drugs and discuss how 
uPeptides and HLA uLigands may facilitate translational inhibition of oncogenic 
protein messages and immunotherapeutic approaches in cancer therapy."
1683,"Metastatic ovarian cancer is the main reason for treatment failures and 
consequent deaths. Ovarian cancer is predisposed to intraperitoneal 
dissemination. In comparison to the transcoelomic route, distant metastasis via 
lymph vessels and blood is less common. The mechanisms related to these two 
modes of cancer spread are poorly understood. Nevertheless, the presence of 
tumor cells circulating in the blood of OC patients is a well-established 
phenomenon confirming the significant role of lymphatic and hematogenous 
metastasis. Thus, the detection of CTCs may provide a minimally invasive tool 
for the identification of ovarian cancer, monitoring disease progression, and 
treatment effectiveness. This review focuses on the biology of ovarian CTCs and 
the role they may play in cancer diagnosis and therapy."
1684,"The mainstay treatment for locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic prostate 
cancer (PrCa) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT causes prostate cancers 
to shrink in volume, or regress, by inducing epithelial tumor cell apoptosis. In 
normal, non-neoplastic murine prostate, androgen deprivation via castration 
induces prostate gland regression that is dependent on TNF signaling. In 
addition to this direct mechanism of action, castration has also been implicated 
in an indirect mechanism of prostate epithelial cell death, which has been 
described as vascular regression. The initiating event is endothelial cell 
apoptosis and/or increased vascular permeability. This subsequently leads to 
reduced blood flow and perfusion, and then hypoxia, which may enhance epithelial 
cell apoptosis. Castration-induced vascular regression has been observed in both 
normal and neoplastic prostates. We used photoacoustic, power Doppler, and 
contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging, and CD31 immunohistochemical staining of 
the microvasculature to assess vascular integrity in the period immediately 
following castration, enabling us to test the role of TNF signaling in vascular 
regression. In two mouse models of androgen-responsive prostate cancer, TNF 
signaling blockade using a soluble TNFR2 ligand trap reversed the functional 
aspects of vascular regression as well as structural changes in the 
microvasculature, including reduced vessel wall thickness, cross-sectional area, 
and vessel perimeter length. These results demonstrate that TNF signaling is 
required for vascular regression, most likely by inducing endothelial cell 
apoptosis and increasing vessel permeability. Since TNF is also the critical 
death receptor ligand for prostate epithelial cells, we propose that TNF is a 
multi-purpose, comprehensive signal within the prostate cancer microenvironment 
that mediates prostate cancer regression following androgen deprivation."
1685,"Bacterial central nervous system (CNS) infections are serious and carry 
significant morbidity and mortality. They encompass many syndromes, the most 
common being meningitis, which may occur spontaneously or as a consequence of 
neurosurgical procedures. Many classes of antimicrobials are in clinical use for 
therapy of CNS infections, some with established roles and indications, others 
with experimental reporting based on case studies or small series. This review 
delves into the specifics of the commonly utilized antibacterial agents, 
updating their therapeutic use in CNS infections from the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic perspectives, with a focus on the optimization of dosing and 
route of administration that have been described to achieve good clinical 
outcomes. We also provide a concise synopsis regarding the most focused, 
clinically relevant information as pertains to each class and subclass of 
antimicrobial therapeutics. CNS infection morbidity and mortality remain high, 
and aggressive management is critical in ensuring favorable patient outcomes 
while averting toxicity and upholding patient safety."
1686,"Oropharyngeal candidiasis/candidosis is a common and recurrent opportunistic 
fungal infection. Fluconazole (FLZ), one of the most used and effective 
antifungal agents, has been associated with a rise of resistant Candida species 
in immunocompromised patients undergoing prophylactic therapy. Sulforaphane 
(SFN), a compound from cruciferous vegetables, is an antimicrobial with yet 
controversial activities and mechanisms on fungi. Herein, the in silico and 
antifungal activities of SFN against C. albicans were investigated. In silico 
analyzes for the prediction of the biological activities and oral 
bioavailability of SFN, its possible toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters, as 
well as the estimates of its gastrointestinal absorption, permeability to the 
blood-brain barrier and skin, and similarities to drugs, were performed by using 
different software. SFN in vitro anti-Candida activities alone and in 
combination with fluconazole (FLZ) were determined by the broth microdilution 
method and the checkerboard, biofilm and hyphae formation tests. Amongst the 
identified probable biological activities of SFN, nine indicated an 
antimicrobial potential. SFN was predicted to be highly absorbable by the 
gastrointestinal tract, to present good oral availability, and not to be 
irritant and/or hepatotoxic. SFN presented antifungal activity against C. 
albicans and prevented both biofilm and hyphae formation by this microorganism. 
SFN was additive/synergistic to FLZ. Overall, the data highlights the 
anti-Candida activity of SFN and its potential to be used as an adjuvant therapy 
to FLZ in clinical settings."
1687,"The use of rapid molecular tests may anticipate the identification of causative 
agents and resistance determinants in the blood of critically ill patients with 
sepsis. From April to December 2021, all intensive care unit patients with 
sepsis or septic shock who were tested with the T2Bacteria and T2Resistance 
assays were included in a retrospective, single center study. The primary 
descriptive endpoints were results of rapid molecular tests and concomitant 
blood cultures. Overall, 38 combinations of T2Bacteria and T2Resistance tests 
were performed. One or more causative agent(s) were identified by the T2Bacteria 
assay in 26% of episodes (10/38), whereas negative and invalid results were 
obtained in 66% (25/38) and 8% (3/38) of episodes, respectively. The same 
pathogen detected by the T2Bacteria test grew from blood cultures in 30% of 
cases (3/10). One or more determinant(s) of resistance were identified by the 
T2Resistance assay in 11% of episodes (4/38). Changes in therapy based on 
T2Bacteria and/or T2Resistance results occurred in 21% of episodes (8/38). In 
conclusion, T2Bacteria/T2Resistance results can influence early treatment 
decisions in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock in real-life 
practice. Large, controlled studies remain necessary to confirm a favorable 
impact on patients' outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship interventions."
1688,"Cryptococcosis is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The 
limited number of antifungal agents, their toxicity, and the difficulty of these 
molecules in crossing the blood-brain barrier have made the exploration of new 
therapeutic candidates against Cryptococcus neoformans a priority task. To 
optimize the antimicrobial functionality and improve the physicochemical 
properties of AMPs, chemical strategies include combinations of peptide 
fragments into one. This study aimed to evaluate the binding of the minimum 
activity motif of bovine lactoferricin (LfcinB) and buforin II (BFII) against C. 
neoformans var. grubii. The antifungal activity against these chimeras was 
evaluated against (i) the reference strain H99, (ii) three Colombian clinical 
strains, and (iii) eleven mutant strains, with the aim of evaluating the 
possible antifungal target. We found high activity against these strains, with a 
MIC between 6.25 and 12.5 µg/mL. Studies were carried out to evaluate the effect 
of the combination of fluconazole treatments, finding a synergistic effect. 
Finally, when fibroblast cells were treated with 12.5 µg/mL of the chimeras, a 
viability of more than 65% was found. The results obtained in this study 
identify these chimeras as potential antifungal molecules for future therapeutic 
applications against cryptococcosis."
1689,"The incidence of invasive fungal infection in ICUs has increased over time, and 
Candida spp. is the most common cause. Critical care patients are a particular 
set of patients with a higher risk of invasive fungal infections; this 
population is characterized by extensive use of medical devices such as central 
venous lines, arterial lines, bladder catheters, hemodialysis and mechanical 
intubation. Blood cultures are the gold standard diagnosis; still, they are not 
an early diagnostic technique. Mannan, anti-mannan antibody, 1,3-β-D-glucan, 
Candida albicans germ tube antibody, Vitek 2, PNA-FISH, MALDI-TOF, PCR and 
T2Candida panel are diagnostic promising microbiological assays. Scoring systems 
are tools to distinguish patients with low and high risk of infection. They can 
be combined with diagnostic tests to select patients for pre-emptive treatment 
or antifungal discontinuation. Candidemia is the focus of this narrative review, 
an approach to contributing factors and diagnosis, with an emphasis on critical 
care patients."
1690,"Blood cultures have been the gold standard for identifying pathogens in 
infective endocarditis (IE). Blood culture-negative endocarditis (BCNE), 
however, occurs in 40% or more of IE cases with the bulk of them due to recent 
antibiotic exposure prior to obtaining blood cultures. Increasingly, molecular 
techniques are being used for pathogen identification in cases of BCNE and more 
recently has included metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). We 
therefore performed a literature search on August 31, 2022, that assessed the 
mNGS in IE and 13 publications were identified and included in a systematic 
review. Eight (61.5%) of them focused only on IE with mNGS performed on cardiac 
valve tissue in four studies, plasma in three studies and cardiac implantable 
electronic devices (CIED) in one study. Gram-positive cocci, including 
Staphylococcus aureus (n = 31, 8.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 61, 
17.6%), streptococci (n = 130, 37.5%), and Enterococcus&amp;nbsp;faecalis (n = 
23, 6.6%) were the predominant organisms identified by mNGS. Subsequent 
investigations are needed to further define the utility of mNGS in BCNE and its 
impact on patient outcomes. Despite some pitfalls, mNGS seems to be of value in 
pathogen identification in IE cases, particularly in those with BCNE. This study 
was registered and on the Open Science Framework platform."
1691,"Previous studies indicated that the use of a phage cocktail, composed of 
bacteriophages vB_SenM-2 and vB_Sen-TO17, is effective in killing cells of 
Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis in vitro and in the 
Galleria mellonella animal model as efficiently as antibiotics (enrofloxacin or 
colistin) and induced fewer deleterious changes in immune responses. Here, we 
investigated the effects of this phage cocktail on the hematological parameters 
and selected biochemical markers in chickens infected with S. enterica serovar 
Typhimurium, in comparison to those caused by enrofloxacin or colistin. We found 
that treatment with antibiotics (especially with enrofloxacin) caused 
nonbeneficial effects on red blood cell parameters, including hematocrit, MCV, 
MCH, and MCHC. However, Salmonella-induced changes in the aforementioned 
parameters were normalized by the use of the phage cocktail. Importantly, 
hepatotoxicity was suggested to be induced by both antibiotics on the basis of 
increased alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
activities, in contrast to the phage cocktail, which did not influence these 
enzymes. We conclude that phage therapy with the cocktail of vB_SenM-2 and 
vB_Sen-TO17 in Salmonella-infected chickens is not only as effective as 
antibiotics but also significantly safer for the birds than enrofloxacin and 
colistin."
1692,"Tuberculosis is a highly contagious disease caused by the Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Although TB is treatable, multidrug-resistant, 
extensively drug-resistant, and totally drug-resistant forms of M. tuberculosis 
have become a new life-threatening concern. New anti-TB drugs that are capable 
of curing these drug-resistant strains are urgently needed. The purpose of this 
study is to determine the antimycobacterial activity of D-enantiomer human 
lactoferricin 1-11 (D-hLF 1-11) against mycobacteria in vitro using a 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dephenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay, 
resazurin microplate assay, and microscopic observation drug susceptibility 
assay. Three previously described antimicrobial peptides, protegrin-1, AK 15-6, 
and melittin, with potent anti-TB activity, were included in this study. The 
findings suggest that D-hLF 1-11 can inhibit the growth of M. tuberculosis with 
a minimum inhibitory concentration of 100-200 µg/mL in susceptible, isoniazid 
(INH)-monoresistant, rifampicin (RF)-monoresistant, and MDR strains. The peptide 
can also inhibit some nontuberculous mycobacteria and other MTBC in similar 
concentrations. The antibiofilm activity of D-hLF 1-11 against the 
biofilm-forming M. abscessus was determined by crystal violet staining, and no 
significant difference is observed between the treated and untreated biofilm 
control. The checkerboard assay was subsequently carried out with M. 
tuberculosis H37Rv and the results indicate that D-hLF 1-11 displays an additive 
effect when combined with INH and a synergistic effect when combined with RF, 
with fractional inhibitory concentration indices of 0.730 and 0.312, 
respectively. The red blood cell hemolytic assay was initially applied for the 
toxicity determination of D-hLF 1-11, and negligible hemolysis (&lt;1%) was 
observed, despite a concentration of up to 4 mg/mL being evaluated. Overall, 
D-hLF 1-11 has potential as a novel antimycobacterial agent for the future 
treatment of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis infections."
1693,"The antibiotic spectrum is not reflected in conventional antimicrobial metrics. 
Days of antibiotic spectrum coverage (DASC) is a novel quantitative metric for 
antimicrobial consumption developed with consideration of the antibiotic 
spectrum. However, there were no data regarding disease and pathogen-specific 
DASC. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the DASC trend in patients with 
bloodstream infections (BSIs). DASC and days of therapy (DOT) of in-patients 
with positive blood culture results during a 2-year interval were evaluated. 
Data were aggregated to calculate the DASC, DOT, and DASC/DOT per patient 
stratified by pathogens. During the 2-year study period, 1443 positive blood 
culture cases were identified, including 265 suspected cases of contamination. 
The overall DASC, DASC/patient, DOT, DOT/patient, and DASC/DOT metrics were 
226,626; 157.1; 28,778; 19.9; and 7.9, respectively. A strong correlation was 
observed between DASC and DOT, as well as DASC/patient and DOT/patient. 
Conversely, DASC/DOT had no correlation with other metrics. The combination of 
DASC and DOT would be a useful benchmark for the overuse and misuse evaluation 
of antimicrobial therapy in BSIs. Notably, DASC/DOT would be a robust metric to 
evaluate the antibiotic spectrum that was selected for patients with BSIs."
1694,"The effects of bismuth toxicity on the kidney-the main organ responsible for 
blood filtration-were systematically reviewed. This review was motivated by 
availability of several sources of bismuth in contact with humans including 
environmental, medications, dental materials, and cosmetics, potentially leading 
to kidney filtration of this chemical. No previous studies have systematically 
reviewed the literature considering this association. A total of 22 studies with 
a total of 46 individuals met the inclusion criteria, 19 being case reports with 
only one patient enrolled. The included studies publication dates ranged from 
1961 to 2021 and the countries of publication were the United States of America, 
United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Switzerland, and Canada. Bismuth sources 
affecting the kidneys were uniquely reported as from medical purposes and mostly 
associated to overdoses with several symptoms, apparently with dose-dependent 
consequences. Patient history of renal impairment seemed to affect the outcome 
of the case. Several therapies were conducted following bismuth intoxication, 
and few studies performed renal biopsies describing its histological findings. 
It is crucial to reconsider the nephrotoxicity of bismuth compounds, mainly in 
patients with previous history of renal impairment."
1695,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse class of short, often cationic 
biological molecules that present promising opportunities in the development of 
new therapeutics to combat antimicrobial resistance. Newly developed in silico 
methods offer the ability to rapidly discover numerous novel AMPs with a variety 
of physiochemical properties. Herein, using the rAMPage AMP discovery pipeline, 
we bioinformatically identified 51 AMP candidates from amphibia and insect 
RNA-seq data and present their in-depth characterization. The studied AMPs 
demonstrate activity against a panel of bacterial pathogens and have undetected 
or low toxicity to red blood cells and human cultured cells. Amino acid sequence 
analysis revealed that 30 of these bioactive peptides belong to either the 
Brevinin-1, Brevinin-2, Nigrocin-2, or Apidaecin AMP families. Prediction of 
three-dimensional structures using ColabFold indicated an association between 
peptides predicted to adopt a helical structure and broad-spectrum antibacterial 
activity against the Gram-negative and Gram-positive species tested in our 
panel. These findings highlight the utility of associating the diverse sequences 
of novel AMPs with their estimated peptide structures in categorizing AMPs and 
predicting their antimicrobial activity."
1696,"Hospitalized patients are likely to have chronic illnesses and are at an 
increased risk of mortality due to infection caused by MDR bacteria. We aimed to 
identify carbapenem-resistant genes carrying Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. 
pneumoniae) isolates and their risk factors recovered from adult patients with 
comorbidities. A cross-sectional study was carried out between April 2021 and 
December 2021 at King Abdullah Hospital (KAH) in Bisha province, Saudi Arabia. 
Seventy-one multi-drug resistant K. pneumoniae recovered from clinical samples 
and screened for carbapenemase genes of blaOXA-48-like, blaNDM-1, blaKPC, 
blaVIM, and blaIMP. Of 71 MDR K. pneumoniae examined, 47 (66.2%) isolates 
harbored various carbapenemase genes. The most prevalent single resistance gene 
was blaOXA-48-like (62.5%; n = 25), and 33.3% of them were recovered from sputum 
isolates. The blaNDM-1 gene was detected in 12 (30.0%) isolates, and eight of 
them were recovered from urine (n = 4) and blood (n = 4). Two (5.0%) single 
blaKPC genes were recovered from the sputum (n = 1) and blood (n = 1) isolates. 
In contrast, no blaIMP- and blaVIM-carrying isolates were detected. The 
co-existence of two resistance genes between blaOXA-48-like and blaNDM-1 was 
found in six strains, whereas only one strain was found to be produced in the 
three genes of blaNDM-1, blaKPC, and blaOXA-48-like. There were statistically 
significant associations between the presence of carbapenem-gene-carrying K. 
pneumoniae and patients' gender (χ2(1) = 5.94, p = 0.015), intensive care unit 
admission (χ2(1) = 7.649, p = 0.002), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(χ2(1) = 4.851, p = 0.028). The study highlighted the existence of 
carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae, particularly blaOXA-48-like and blaNDM-1, 
in patients with comorbidities. Our findings emphasize the importance of the 
molecular characterization of resistance-determinant-carrying bacterial 
pathogens as a part of infection control and prevention in hospital settings."
1697,"Blood cultures should be collected within an hour in the setting of 
sepsis/septic shock. The contamination rate should be below 3%. Worldwide 
reports have described an increase in blood contamination rates during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a retrospective analysis of the blood cultures 
collected during a 10-month period (March-December 2020) at NIID ""Prof. Dr. 
Matei Balș"". The results were compared with data from the pre-pandemic period 
(March-December 2016) and with the existing data in the literature. During the 
pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the number of blood cultures 
collected (1274 blood cultures in 2020 vs. 5399 in 2016). The contamination rate 
was higher in 2020 (11.7%) compared to 2016 (8.2%), p &lt; 0.001. The rate of 
infectious episodes in which the etiological agent was identified was constant: 
11% in 2020 versus 11.9% in 2016, p = 0.479, but there were fewer invasive 
bacterial/fungal infections: 0.95/1000 patient days in 2020 vs. 2.39/1000 
patient days in 2016, p &lt; 0.001. We observed a change in the species 
distribution. The Gram-negative isolate's proportion increased from 50.6% to 
63.1% and the gram-positive isolate's proportion decreased from 31.8% to 19%. 
Collection of a low number of blood cultures and a high contamination rate was 
identified in our clinic. In order to improve the usefulness of blood cultures 
as a diagnostic method, at least two sets should be collected in aseptic 
conditions."
1698,"The increasing number of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria presents a 
serious threat to global health. However, colistin-resistant Acinetobacter junii 
has rarely been reported. We identified a colistin-resistant A. junii clinical 
isolate, AJ6079, in blood. The colony of AJ6079 presented a dry phenotype, and 
it was difficult to form a bacterial suspension, whilst transmission electron 
microscopy revealed that AJ6079 possessed a thick outer membrane. The phenotypic 
and genomic comparisons were conducted with one colistin-susceptible A. junii, 
which had the same antibiotic susceptibility profile except for colistin, and 
had the same KL25 capsule biosynthesis locus. The AJ6079 exhibited a slower 
growth rate, indicating that colistin-resistant A. junii possesses a higher 
fitness cost. The genome of AJ6079 had a G+C content of 38.7% and contained one 
3,362,966 bp circular chromosome with no plasmid or mobile colistin resistance 
(mcr) gene. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the AJ6079 contained 
several previously unreported point mutations in colistin-resistance-related 
genes involving amino acid substitutions in PmrB (N5K, G147C), LpxA (I107F, 
H131Y), and LpxD (F20I, K263R), which might be correlated with colistin 
resistance in A. junii. Further research is needed for verification as the 
genetic background was not exactly the same between the two isolates."
1699,"This study aimed to prove that pre-emptive antimicrobial locks in patients at 
risk of bacteremia decrease infection. We performed a non-randomized prospective 
pilot study of hemodialysis patients with tunneled central venous catheters. We 
drew quantitative blood cultures monthly to detect colonization. Patients with a 
critical catheter colonization by coagulase-negative staphylococci (defined as 
counts of 100-999 CFU/mL) were at high risk of developing a catheter-related 
bloodstream infection. We recommended antimicrobial lock for this set of 
patients. The nephrologist in charge of the patient decided whether to follow 
the recommendation or not (i.e., standard of care). We compared bloodstream 
infection rates between patients treated with antimicrobial lock therapy versus 
patients treated with the standard of care (i.e., heparin). We enrolled 149 
patients and diagnosed 86 episodes of critical catheter colonization by 
coagulase-negative staphylococci. Patients treated with antimicrobial lock had a 
relative risk of bloodstream infection of 0.19 when compared with heparin lock 
(CI 95%, 0.11-0.33, p &lt; 0.001) within three months of treatment. We avoided 
one catheter-related bloodstream infection for every ten catheter-critical 
colonizations treated with antimicrobial lock [number needed to treat 10, 95% 
CI, 5.26-100, p = 0.046]. In conclusion, pre-emptive antimicrobial locks 
decrease bloodstream infection rates in hemodialysis patients with critical 
catheter colonization."
1700,"Polysaccharides isolated from Lentinula edodes are bioactive compounds with 
immunomodulatory properties. In our previous studies from L. edodes mycelium, we 
have isolated a selenium(Se)-enriched fraction (named Se-Le-30), a mixture of 
linear 1,4-α-glucan and linear 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucans. In this study, we 
analyzed the effects of Se-Le-30 on the activation and proliferation of human T 
lymphocytes stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies (Abs) and on the 
production of cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Se-Le-30 
had effects on T cell proliferation induced by Abs against CD3 and CD28. It 
significantly inhibited the proliferation of CD3-stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells and enhanced the proliferation of CD4+ T cells stimulated with 
anti-CD3/CD28 Ab. Moreover, Se-Le-30 downregulated the number of CD3-stimulated 
CD4+CD69+ cells, CD4+CD25+ cells, as well as CD8+CD25+ cells, and upregulated 
the expression of CD25 marker on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells activated with 
anti-CD3/CD28 Abs. Furthermore, Se-Le-30 enhanced the synthesis of IFN-γ by the 
unstimulated and anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMCs, inhibited synthesis of IL-2 and 
IL-4 by CD3-stimulated cells, and augmented the synthesis of IL-6 and IL-10 by 
unstimulated, CD3-stimulated, and CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMCs. Together, we 
demonstrated that Se-Le-30 exerts immunomodulatory effects on human T 
lymphocytes. These observations are of importance for the prospective use of 
Se-Le-30 in research or as a therapeutic compound."
1701,"GPR15 plays an important role in lymphocyte homing and is a key immune molecule 
to maintain organ immune homeostasis. Yet, no study on the association between 
GPR15 and Graves' disease (GD) is available. In this study, we systematically 
investigated the expression of GPR15 in different types of immune cells and 
different tissues of GD patients. We found that the expressions of GPR15 and 
GPR15L in peripheral blood of GD patients were increased compared with those in 
healthy controls. A flow cytometry analysis showed that GPR15 positive cells 
were mainly CD14+ monocytes and CD56+ natural killer cells (NK cells) of innate 
immunity, T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells of adaptive immunity. We also 
found that the expressions of GPR15 and GPR15L in the PBMC of GD patients were 
positively correlated with the Tfh-specific cytokines IL21 and IL4. In addition, 
immunohistochemistry showed that the level of GPR15 in thyroid tissue of GD 
patients was higher than that of the control group. Our results demonstrate for 
the first time that GPR15 is highly expressed in various immune cells in GD 
patients, suggesting that GPR15-GPR15L is associated with the activation and 
infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells in the thyroid tissue of GD 
patients."
1702,"The misuse and abuse of antibiotics in livestock and poultry seriously endanger 
both human health and the continuously healthy development of the livestock and 
poultry breeding industry. Plant-derived bioactive compounds (curcumin, 
capsaicin, quercetin, resveratrol, catechin, lignans, etc.) have been widely 
studied in recent years, due to their extensive pharmacological functions and 
biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antistress, 
antitumor, antiviral, lowering blood glucose and lipids, and improving insulin 
sensitivity. Numerous studies have demonstrated that plant-derived bioactive 
compounds are able to enhance the host's ability to resist or diminish diseases 
by regulating the abundance of its gut microbiota, achieving great potential as 
a substitute for antibiotics. Recent developments in both humans and animals 
have also highlighted the major contribution of gut microbiota to the host's 
nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and neurological functions. Changes in gut 
microbiota composition are closely related to the development of obesity and can 
lead to numerous metabolic diseases. Mounting evidence has also demonstrated 
that plant-derived bioactive compounds, especially curcumin, can improve 
intestinal barrier function by regulating intestinal flora. Furthermore, 
bioactive constituents can be also directly metabolized by intestinal flora and 
further produce bioactive metabolites by the interaction between the host and 
intestinal flora. This largely enhances the protective effect of bioactive 
compounds on the host intestinal and whole body health, indicating that the 
bidirectional regulation between bioactive compounds and intestinal flora has 
great application potential in maintaining the host's intestinal health and 
preventing or treating various diseases. This review mainly summarizes the 
latest research progress in the bioregulation between gut microbiota and 
plant-derived bioactive compounds, together with its application potential in 
humans and animals, so as to provide theoretical support for the application of 
plant-derived bioactive compounds as new feed additives and potential 
substitutes for antibiotics in the livestock and poultry breeding industry. 
Overall, based on this review, it can be concluded that plant-derived bioactive 
compounds, by modulating gut microbiota, hold great promise toward the healthy 
development of both humans and animal husbandry."
1703,"Absent or reduced physical activity and spontaneous movement over days, weeks, 
or even years may lead to problems in almost every major organ/system in the 
human body. In this study, we investigated whether the dysregulation and 
alteration of plasma protein inflammatory profiling can stratify chronic 
bedridden conditions observed in 22 elderly chronic bedridden (CBR) individuals 
with respect to 11 age-matched active (OLD) controls. By using a combination of 
immune-assay multiplex techniques, a complex of 27 inflammatory mediators was 
assessed in the plasma collected from the two groups. A specific plasma protein 
signature is indeed able to distinguish IPO individuals from age-matched OLD 
controls; while significantly (p < 0.001) higher protein levels of IL-2, IL-7, 
and IL-12p70 were measured in the plasma of CBR with respect to OLD individuals, 
significantly (p < 0.01) higher levels of seven inflammatory mediators, 
including IL-9, PDGF-b, CCL4 (MIP-1b), CCL5 (RANTES), IL-1Ra, CXCL10 (IP10), and 
CCL2 (MCP-1), were identified in OLD individuals with respect to CBR 
individuals. These data suggest that the chronic absence of physical activity 
may contribute to the dysregulation of a complex molecular pattern occurring 
with ageing and that specific plasma protein signatures may represent potential 
biomarkers as well as new potential therapeutic targets for new treatments aimed 
at improving health expectancy."
1704,"Eosinophil infiltration in esophageal muscularis propria is common in achalasia 
(AC). This study aims to evaluate the effect of eosinophil infiltration in 
muscularis propria of the esophagus on esophageal motility in mice. A mouse 
model with eosinophil infiltration in the esophageal muscle layer was 
established by long term Ovalbumin (OVA) exposure. The histopathology features 
of esophageal muscularis propria as well as parameters of esophageal motility, 
such as lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) and esophageal emptying, were 
compared between model and control group. In addition, the histopathology and 
motility of esophagus at each time point in the model group were compared. The 
esophageal motor function severely deteriorated in the model group, mimicking 
the abnormal esophageal motility of AC, with more eosinophils and fewer 
SOX-10-IR cells in esophageal muscularis propria in the model group, compared 
with control. With the prolongation of OVA treatment, esophageal motility 
disorder was aggravated, accompanied by increased eosinophils in the the muscle 
layer of esophagus and decreased SOX-10-IR cells in the model group. In 
addition, the eosinophil count was negatively correlated with SOX-10-IR cells. 
Long-term exposure to OVA assisted by alum may induce eosinophil infiltration in 
esophageal muscularis propria, reduced SOX-10-IR cells and abnormal esophageal 
motility, which simulates the functional and histopathological features of some 
AC patients. This suggests that eosinophil infiltration in esophageal muscularis 
propria may play a role in the pathogenesis of a subgroup of AC."
1705,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of sporadic young-onset colorectal cancer (yCRC) is 
increasing. Compared with old-onset colorectal cancer (oCRC), yCRC has different 
clinical and molecular characteristics. However, the difference in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) between yCRC and oCRC remains unclear.
METHODS: Fourteen untreated CRC tumor samples were subjected to single-cell RNA 
sequencing analysis.
RESULTS: B cells and naïve T cells are enriched in yCRC, while effector T cells 
and plasma cells are enriched in oCRC. Effector T cells of yCRC show decreased 
interferon-gamma response and proliferative activity; meanwhile, Treg cells in 
yCRC show stronger oxidative phosphorylation and TGF-β signaling than that in 
oCRC. The down-regulated immune response of T cells in yCRC may be regulated by 
immune and malignant cells, as we observed a downregulation of antigen 
presentation and immune activations in B cells, dendritic cells, and 
macrophages. Finally, we identified malignant cells in yCRC and oCRC with high 
heterogeneity and revealed their interactions with immune cells in the TME.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal significant differences of TME between yCRC and 
oCRC, of which the TME of yCRC is more immunosuppressive than oCRC. Malignant 
cells play an essential role in the formation of the suppressive tumor immune 
microenvironment."
1706,"Molecular heterogeneity has great significance in the disease biology of 
multiple myeloma (MM). Thus, the analysis combined single-cell RNA-seq 
(scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data were performed to investigate the clonal 
evolution characteristics and to find novel prognostic targets in MM. The 
scRNA-seq data were analyzed by the Seurat pipeline and Monocle 2 to identify MM 
cell branches with different differentiation states. Marker genes in each branch 
were uploaded to the STRING database to construct the Protein-Protein 
Interaction (PPI) network, followed by the detection of hub genes by Cytoscape 
software. Using bulk RNA-seq data, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis was then 
carried out to determine prognostic biomarkers in MM. A total of 342 marker 
genes in two branches with different differentiation states were identified, and 
the top 20 marker genes with the highest scores in the network calculated by the 
MCC algorithm were selected as hub genes in MM. Furthermore, K-M survival 
analysis revealed that higher NDUFB8, COX6C, NDUFA6, USMG5, and COX5B expression 
correlated closely with a worse prognosis in MM patients. Moreover, ssGSEA and 
Pearson analyses showed that their expression had a significant negative 
correlation with the proportion of Tcm (central memory cell) immune cells. Our 
findings identified NDUFB8, COX6C, NDUFA6, USMG5, and COX5B as novel prognostic 
biomarkers in MM, and also revealed the significance of genetic heterogeneity 
during cell differentiation in MM prognosis."
1707,"Analysis of plasma and serum provides valuable information on the amounts of 
polar phenols' circulating after ingestion. In the present study, protein 
precipitation (PPT), liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), solid phase extraction 
(SPE), enzymatic hydrolysis and their combinations were meticulously evaluated 
for the extraction of a variety of polar phenolic moieties from plasma and 
serum. The recovery values of the above methods were compared; satisfactory 
recoveries (>60%) were attained for most analytes. Polar phenol aglycones 
undergo degradation with enzymatic hydrolysis; however, their extended phase II 
metabolism makes enzymatic hydrolysis a mandated process for their analysis in 
such biofluids. Hence, enzymatic hydrolysis followed by LLE was used for the 
identification of polar phenols in rats' serum, after the long-term oral 
consumption of Corinthian Currant. Corinthian Currant is a Greek dried vine 
product rich in bioactive polar phenolics. Flavonoids and phenolic acids, 
detected as aglycones, ranged from 0.57 ± 0.08 to 181.66 ± 48.95 and 3.45 ± 1.20 
to 897.81 ± 173.96 ng/mL, respectively. The majority of polar phenolics were 
present as phase II metabolites, representing their fasting state in the blood 
stream. This is the first study evaluating the presence of polar phenolics in 
the serum of rats following a long-term diet supplemented with Corinthian 
Currant as a whole food."
1708,"BACKGROUND: Vascular anomalies comprise a diverse group of rare diseases with 
altered blood flow and are often associated with coagulation disorders. The most 
common example is a localized intravascular coagulopathy in venous malformations 
leading to elevated D-dimers. In severe cases, this may progress to a 
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with subsequent consumption of 
fibrinogen and thrombocytes predisposing to serious bleeding. A separate 
coagulopathy is the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon in kaposiform 
hemangioendothelioma characterized by platelet trapping leading to 
thrombocytopenia and eventually consumptive coagulopathy. Our previous work 
showed impaired von Willebrand factor and platelet aggregometry due to abnormal 
blood flow, i.e., in ventricular assist devices or extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation. With altered blood flow also present in vascular anomalies, we 
hypothesized that, in particular, the von Willebrand factor parameters and the 
platelet function may be similarly impacted.
METHODS: We prospectively recruited 73 patients with different vascular anomaly 
entities and analyzed their coagulation parameters.
RESULTS: Acquired von Willebrand syndrome was observed in both of our patients 
with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon. In six out of nine patients with complex 
lymphatic anomalies, both the vWF antigen and activity were upregulated. 
Platelet aggregometry was impaired in both patients with Kasabach-Merritt 
phenomenon and in seven out of eight patients with an arteriovenous 
malformation.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of coagulation parameters in our patients with 
vascular anomalies advanced our understanding of the underlying 
pathophysiologies of the observed coagulopathies. This may lead to new treatment 
options for the, in part, life-threatening bleeding risks in these patients in 
the future."
1709,"Trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR1-TAAR9) are a family of G-protein-coupled 
monoaminergic receptors which might have great pharmacological potential. It has 
now been well established that TAAR1 plays an important role in the central 
nervous system. Interestingly, deletion of TAAR9 in rats leads to alterations in 
the periphery. Previously, we found that knockout of TAAR9 in rats (TAAR9-KO 
rats) decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the blood. TAAR9 
was also identified in intestinal tissues, and it is known that it responds to 
polyamines. To elucidate the role of TAAR9 in the intestinal epithelium, we 
analyzed TAAR9-co-expressed gene clusters in public data for cecum samples. As 
identified by gene ontology enrichment analysis, in the intestine, TAAR9 is 
co-expressed with genes involved in intestinal mucosa homeostasis and function, 
including cell organization, differentiation, and death. Additionally, TAAR9 was 
co-expressed with genes implicated in dopamine signaling, which may suggest a 
role for this receptor in the regulation of peripheral dopaminergic 
transmission. To further investigate how TAAR9 might be involved in colonic 
mucosal homeostasis, we analyzed the fecal microbiome composition in TAAR9-KO 
rats and their wild-type littermates. We identified a significant difference in 
the number of observed taxa between the microbiome of TAAR9-KO and wild-type 
rats. In TAAR9-KO rats, the gut microbial community became more variable 
compared with the wild-type rats. Furthermore, it was found that the family 
Saccharimonadaceae, which is one of the top 10 most abundant families in 
TAAR9-KO rat feces, is almost completely absent in wild-type animal fecal 
samples. Taken together, these data indicate a role of TAAR9 in intestinal 
function."
1710,"Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) 
of liquid biofluids enables the probing of biomolecular markers for disease 
diagnosis, characterized as a time and cost-effective approach. It remains 
poorly understood for fast and deep diagnosis of digestive tract cancers (DTC) 
to detect abundant changes and select specific markers in a broad spectrum of 
molecular species. Here, we present a diagnostic protocol of DTC in which the 
in-situ blood-based ATR-FTIR spectroscopic data mining pathway was designed for 
the identification of DTC triages in 252 blood serum samples, divided into the 
following groups: liver cancer (LC), gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer 
(CC), and their different three stages respectively. The infrared molecular 
fingerprints (IMFs) of DTC were measured and used to build a 2-dimensional 
second derivative spectrum (2D-SD-IR) feature dataset for classification, 
including absorbance and wavenumber shifts of FTIR vibration peaks. By 
comparison, the Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and 
backpropagation (BP) neural networks are suitable to differentiate DTCs and 
pathological stages with a high sensitivity and specificity of 100% and averaged 
more than 95%. Furthermore, the measured IMF data was mutually validated via 
clinical blood biochemistry testing, which indicated that the proposed 
2D-SD-IR-based machine learning protocol greatly improved DTC classification 
performance."
1711,"The strong interaction of blood with the foreign surface of membrane oxygenators 
during ECMO therapy leads to adhesion of immune cells on the oxygenator 
membranes, which can be visualized in the form of image sequences using confocal 
laser scanning microscopy. The segmentation and quantification of these image 
sequences is a demanding task, but it is essential to understanding the 
significance of adhering cells during extracorporeal circulation. The aim of 
this work was to develop and test a deep learning-supported image processing 
tool (Deetect), suitable for the analysis of confocal image sequences of cell 
deposits on oxygenator membranes at certain predilection sites. Deetect was 
tested using confocal image sequences of stained (DAPI) blood cells that adhered 
to specific predilection sites (junctional warps and hollow fibers) of a 
phosphorylcholine-coated polymethylpentene membrane oxygenator after patient 
support (>24 h). Deetect comprises various functions to overcome difficulties 
that occur during quantification (segmentation, elimination of artifacts). To 
evaluate Deetects performance, images were counted and segmented manually as a 
reference and compared with the analysis by a traditional segmentation approach 
in Fiji and the newly developed tool. Deetect outperformed conventional 
segmentation in clustered areas. In sections where cell boundaries were 
difficult to distinguish visually, previously defined post-processing steps of 
Deetect were applied, resulting in a more objective approach for the resolution 
of these areas."
1712,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a multifunctional endogenous phospholipid, plays a 
vital role in cellular homeostasis and the malignant behavior of cancer cells 
through G-protein-coupled receptors. However, the role of LPA in 
β-catenin-mediated gastric cancer is unknown. Here, we have noted the high 
expression of LPAR2 in human gastric cancer tissues, and that LPA treatment 
significantly increased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human 
gastric cancer cells. Results from our biochemical experiments showed that an 
LPA exposure increased the expression of β-catenin and its nuclear localization, 
increased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), decreased 
the expression of Axin2, and increased the expression of the target genes of the 
β-catenin signaling pathway. The LPA2 receptor (LPAR2) antagonist significantly 
reduced the LPA-induced nuclear localization of β-catenin, the primary signaling 
event. The knockdown of LPAR2 in the gastric cancer cell lines robustly reduced 
the LPA-induced β-catenin activity. An LPA exposure increased the ATP production 
by both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, and this effect was abrogated 
with the addition of an LPAR2 antagonist and XAV393, which stabilizes the Axin 
and inhibits the β-catenin signaling pathway. Based on our findings, the 
possibility that LPA contributes to gastric cancer initiation and progression 
through the β-catenin signaling pathway as well as by the dysregulation of the 
energy metabolism via the LPAR2 receptor and Axin2, respectively, provides a 
novel insight into the mechanism of and possible therapeutic targets of gastric 
cancer."
1713,"The inner shell of the chestnut (Castanea crenata) has long been used in Asia as 
a medicinal herb for improving digestion and blood circulation, and treating 
diarrhea. However, most chestnut shells are now treated as waste materials in 
industrial peeling processes. In this study, we examined the metabolite 
variation among major cultivars of C. crenata shells using mass spectrometry. 
Among five representative cultivars, Okkwang, Porotan, and Ishizuuchi had higher 
levels of bioactive compounds, such as ellagic acid derivatives, ellagitannins, 
flavonoids, and gallic acid derivatives. Their antioxidant capacity was 
positively correlated with their chemical composition. The byproducts (whole 
shells) from the industrial peeling process were re-evaluated in comparison with 
the inner shell, a rich source of phenolic compounds. The phenolic acids and 
flavonoid glucoside derivatives were significantly higher in the whole shells, 
whereas the levels of flavonoids were higher in the inner shells. In addition, 
the whole shell extracts significantly reduced cellular reactive oxygen species 
production compared to the inner shell extracts. This study demonstrated the 
different biochemical benefits of different C. crenata cultivars through 
metabolic profiling and suggests that the whole shell could be used as a 
functional ingredient, as it has the highest levels of bioactive products and 
antioxidant effects."
1714,"The aim of this study was to demonstrate that pseudocholinesterase (CHE) serum 
level is a useful diagnostic biomarker for untreated Wilson's disease (WD). 
Between 2013 and 2019, about 75 patients were referred to the outpatient 
department of the University of Düsseldorf with suspected Wilson's disease. In 
31 patients with suspected Wilson's disease (WD-SUS-group), WD was excluded by 
means of investigations other than analysis of blood and urine. A total of 27 
parameters of blood and urine in these 31 patients were compared to those of 20 
de novo patients with manifest WD (WD-DEF-group), which parameter showed the 
highest significance level of difference between the WD-DEF-group and the 
WD-SUS-group. Thereafter, receiver operating characteristics (ROC-curves) were 
analyzed to evaluate which parameter showed the largest area under the curve 
(AUC) to detect WD. Finally, a logistic regression analysis was performed to 
analyze which combination of parameters allowed the best classification of the 
51 patients either into the WD-DEF-group or into the WD-SUS-group. CHE showed 
the highest significance level for a difference between the WD-DEF- and 
WD-SUS-group, had the highest AUC, and, in combination with ceruloplasmin, 
allowed 100% correct classification. Without CHE, no other combination of 
parameters reached this level of correct classification. After the initiation of 
treatment, which regularly results in an improvement in CHE, the high diagnostic 
accuracy of this biomarker was lost. Cholinesterase turns out to be an excellent 
biomarker for differentiation between untreated de novo patients with manifest 
WD and heterozygotic gene carriers."
1715,"Today's sedentary lifestyle with too much food and too little exercise has made 
metabolic syndrome a pandemic. Metabolic syndrome is a major risk factor for 
type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. New knowledge of medical and 
nutraceutical intervention in the early stages of metabolic syndrome is central 
to prevent these deadly complications. People who eat chili pepper on a regular 
basis seem to stay healthier and live longer than those who do not. Animal 
experiments suggest a therapeutic potential for dietary capsaicin, the active 
principle in hot chili pepper, to reduce the risk of developing metabolic 
syndrome. This is an attractive theory since capsaicin has been a culinary 
staple for thousands of years, and is generally deemed safe when consumed in 
hedonically acceptable doses. The broad expression of the capsaicin receptor 
TRPV1 in metabolically active tissues lends experimental support to this theory. 
This review critically evaluates the available experimental and clinical 
evidence for and against dietary capsaicin being an effective dietary means to 
improve cardio-metabolic health. It comes to the conclusion that although a 
chili pepper-rich diet is associated with a reduced risk of dying due to 
cardiovascular disease, dietary capsaicin has no clear effect on blood glucose 
or lipid profiles. Therefore, the reduced mortality risk may reflect the 
beneficial action of digested capsaicin on gut microbiota."
1716,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the main cause of mortality in the western 
population and requires surgical intervention with the use of vascular 
substitutes, such as autologous veins or Dacron or PTFE prostheses. When this is 
not possible, it progresses to limb amputation. For cases where there is no 
autologous vascular substitute, tissue engineering with the production of 
neovessels may be a promising option. Previous experimental studies have shown 
in vitro that rabbit vena cava can be decellularized and serve as a scaffold for 
receiving mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), with subsequent differentiation into 
endothelial cells. The current study aimed to evaluate the behavior of a 3D 
product structure based on decellularized rabbit inferior vena cava (IVC) 
scaffolds seeded with adipose-tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) and implanted in 
rabbits dorsally subcutaneously. We evaluated the induction of the inflammatory 
response in the animal. We found that stem cells were positive in reducing the 
inflammatory response induced by the decellularized scaffolds."
1717,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common complication of diabetes. It is 
also the main cause of blindness caused by multicellular damage involving 
retinal endothelial cells, ganglial cells, and pigment epithelial cells in 
adults worldwide. Currently available drugs for DR do not meet the clinical 
needs; thus, new therapeutic targets are warranted. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), a 
new type of biomarkers, have attracted increased attention in recent years owing 
to their crucial role in the occurrence and development of DR. NcRNAs mainly 
include microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and circular RNAs, all of which regulate 
gene and protein expression, as well as multiple biological processes in DR. 
NcRNAs, can regulate the damage caused by various retinal cells; abnormal 
changes in the aqueous humor, exosomes, blood, tears, and the formation of new 
blood vessels. This study reviews the different sources of the three 
ncRNAs-microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and circular RNAs-involved in the 
pathogenesis of DR and the related drug development progress. Overall, this 
review improves our understanding of the role of ncRNAs in various retinal cells 
and offers therapeutic directions and targets for DR treatment."
1718,"Reports of eosinophilic pneumonia (EP) as a side effect of dupilumab 
administration are limited in previous studies. Herein, we report two cases in 
which EP developed subsequent to the administration of dupilumab for 
eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS). Case 1: A 55-year-old woman 
presented with ECRS, eosinophilic otitis media, and bronchial asthma, and was 
treated with dupilumab for ECRS. Five weeks later, fever and dyspnea developed, 
and infiltration shadows were observed in her lungs. The peripheral blood 
eosinophil count (PBEC) was 3848/μL (26%), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed 
eosinophilic infiltration, and EP was subsequently diagnosed. Her condition 
improved following prednisolone treatment. Case 2: A 59-year-old man presented 
with fatigue and dyspnea after receiving dupilumab for ECRS. He had infiltrative 
shadows throughout his left lung field, and his PBEC was 4850/μL (26.5%). 
Prednisolone was initiated, and his condition improved. EP developed in both 
patients during the period of elevated PBEC after dupilumab administration, and 
dupilumab was suspected to be the causative agent in their EP. Hence, EP should 
be considered as a differential diagnosis when fever and dyspnea appear 
following dupilumab administration."
1719,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an inflammatory disease associated with a 
compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neurodegeneration. One of the 
consequences of inflammation is an elevated blood level of fibrinogen (Fg), a 
protein that is mainly produced in the liver. The inflammation-induced changes 
in the BBB result in Fg extravasation into the brain parenchyma, creating the 
possibility of its contact with neurons. We have previously shown that 
interactions of Fg with the neuronal intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and 
cellular prion protein induced the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
oxidative damage, increased apoptosis, and cell death. However, the 
transcription pathway involved in this process was not defined. The association 
of Fg with the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the resultant 
expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-C chemokine ligand-2 (CCL2) were 
studied in cultured primary mouse brain cortex neurons. Fg-induced gene 
expression of CCL2 and IL-6 and the expression of NF-κB protein were increased 
in response to a specific interaction of Fg with neurons. These data suggest 
that TBI-induced neurodegeneration can involve the direct interaction of 
extravasated Fg with neurons, resulting in the overexpression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines through the activation of transcription factor NF-κB. 
This may be a mechanism involved in vascular cognitive impairment during 
neuroinflammatory diseases."
1720,"Extensive bone defect healing is an important health issue not yet completely 
resolved. Different alternative treatments have been proposed but, in face of a 
critical bone defect, it is still very difficult to reach a complete 
regeneration, with the new-formed bone presenting all morphological and 
physiological characteristics of a normal, preinjury bone. Topical melatonin use 
has shown as a promising adjuvant for bone regeneration due to its positive 
effects on bone metabolism. Thus, to search for new, safe, biological techniques 
that promote bone repair and favor defect healing, we hypothesized that there is 
a synergistic effect of melatonin treatment associated with rhBMP-2 to guide 
bone regeneration. This study aimed to investigate bone repair effects of 
topical melatonin administration in different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 
µg), associated or not with rhBMP-2. Surgical-induced bone defect healing was 
qualitatively evaluated through histopathological analysis by light microscopy. 
Additionally, quantitative stereology was performed in 
immunohistochemistry-prepared tissue to identify angiogenic, osteogenic, and 
osteoclastogenic factors. Quantification data were compared between groups by 
the ANOVA/Tukey test and differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. 
Our results showed that the presence of the scaffold in the bone defect hindered 
the process of bone repair because in the group treated with ""blood clot + 
scaffold"" the results of bone formation and immunolabeling were reduced in 
comparison with all other groups (treated with melatonin alone or in association 
with rhBMP-2). Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between 
the control group (bone defect + blood clot), and groups treated with different 
concentrations of melatonin in association with rhBMP-2, indicating a positive 
effect of the association for bone repair. This treatment is promising once it 
becomes a new safe alternative technique for the clinical treatment of 
fractures, bone defects, and bone grafts. Our results support the hypothesis of 
the safe use of the association of melatonin and rhBMP-2 and have established a 
safe and effective dose for this experimental treatment."
1721,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 has become a major concern for people's lives and 
health all around the world. COVID-19 patients in various phases and severity 
require individualized treatment given that different patients may develop 
different symptoms. We employed machine learning methods to discover biomarkers 
that may accurately classify COVID-19 in various disease states and severities 
in this study. The blood gene expression profiles from 50 COVID-19 patients 
without intensive care, 50 COVID-19 patients with intensive care, 10 
non-COVID-19 individuals without intensive care, and 16 non-COVID-19 individuals 
with intensive care were analyzed. Boruta was first used to remove irrelevant 
gene features in the expression profiles, and then, the minimum redundancy 
maximum relevance was applied to sort the remaining features. The generated 
feature-ranked list was fed into the incremental feature selection method to 
discover the essential genes and build powerful classifiers. The molecular 
mechanism of some biomarker genes was addressed using recent studies, and 
biological functions enriched by essential genes were examined. Our findings 
imply that genes including UBE2C, PCLAF, CDK1, CCNB1, MND1, APOBEC3G, TRAF3IP3, 
CD48, and GZMA play key roles in defining the different states and severity of 
COVID-19. Thus, a new point of reference is provided for understanding the 
disease's etiology and facilitating a precise therapy."
1722,"The transfer of acyl chains to proteins and lipids from acyl-CoA donor molecules 
is achieved by the actions of diverse enzymes and proteins, including the 
acyl-CoA binding domain-containing protein ACBD6. N-myristoyl-transferase (NMT) 
enzymes catalyze the covalent attachment of a 14-carbon acyl chain from the 
relatively rare myristoyl-CoA to the N-terminal glycine residue of myr-proteins. 
The interaction of the ankyrin-repeat domain of ACBD6 with NMT produces an 
active enzymatic complex for the use of myristoyl-CoA protected from competitive 
inhibition by acyl donor competitors. The absence of the ACBD6/NMT complex in 
ACBD6.KO cells increased the sensitivity of the cells to competitors and 
significantly reduced myristoylation of proteins. Protein palmitoylation was not 
altered in those cells. The specific defect in myristoyl-transferase activity of 
the ACBD6.KO cells provided further evidence of the essential functional role of 
the interaction of ACBD6 with the NMT enzymes. Acyl-CoAs bound to the acyl-CoA 
binding domain of ACBD6 are acyl donors for the lysophospholipid 
acyl-transferase enzymes (LPLAT), which acylate single acyl-chain lipids, such 
as the bioactive molecules LPA and LPC. Whereas the formation of acyl-CoAs was 
not altered in ACBD6.KO cells, lipid acylation processes were significantly 
reduced. The defect in PC formation from LPC by the LPCAT enzymes resulted in 
reduced lipid droplets content. The diversity of the processes affected by ACBD6 
highlight its dual function as a carrier and a regulator of acyl-CoA dependent 
reactions. The unique role of ACBD6 represents an essential common feature of 
(acyl-CoA)-dependent modification pathways controlling the lipid and protein 
composition of human cell membranes."
1723,"Sclerotherapy is among the least invasive and most commonly utilised treatment 
options for varicose veins. Nonetheless, it does not cure varicosities 
permanently and recurrence rates are of up to 64%. Although sclerosing foams 
have been extensively characterised with respect to their bench-top properties, 
such as bubble size distribution and half-life, little is known about their flow 
behaviour within the venous environment during treatment. Additionally, current 
methods of foam characterisation do not recapitulate the end-point 
administration conditions, hindering optimisation of therapeutic efficacy. Here, 
a therapeutically relevant apparatus has been used to obtain a clinically 
relevant rheological model of sclerosing foams. This model was then correlated 
with a therapeutically applicable parameter-i.e., the capability of foams to 
displace blood within a vein. A pipe viscometry apparatus was employed to obtain 
a rheological model of 1% polidocanol foams across shear rates of 6 s-1 to 400 
s-1. Two different foam formulation techniques (double syringe system and 
Tessari) and three liquid-to-gas ratios (1:3, 1:4 and 1:5) were investigated. A 
power-law model was employed on the rheological data to obtain the apparent 
viscosity of foams. In a separate experiment, a finite volume of foam was 
injected into a PTFE tube to displace a blood surrogate solution (0.2% w/v 
carboxymethyl cellulose). The displaced blood surrogate was collected, weighed, 
and correlated with foam's apparent viscosity. Results showed a decreasing 
displacement efficacy with foam dryness and injection flowrate. Furthermore, an 
asymptotic model was formulated that may be used to predict the extent of blood 
displacement for a given foam formulation and volume. The developed model could 
guide clinicians in their selection of a foam formulation that exhibits the 
greatest blood displacement efficacy."
1724,"Hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death from trauma. Accurate 
monitoring of hemorrhage and resuscitation can significantly reduce mortality 
and morbidity but remains a challenge due to the low sensitivity of traditional 
vital signs in detecting blood loss and possible hemorrhagic shock. Vital signs 
are not reliable early indicators because of physiological mechanisms that 
compensate for blood loss and thus do not provide an accurate assessment of 
volume status. As an alternative, machine learning (ML) algorithms that operate 
on an arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform have been shown to provide an 
effective early indicator. However, these ML approaches lack physiological 
interpretability. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the performance of ML 
models trained on nine ABP-derived features that provide physiological insight, 
using a database of 13 human subjects from a lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) 
model of progressive central hypovolemia and subsequent progressive restoration 
to normovolemia (i.e., simulated hemorrhage and whole blood resuscitation). Data 
were acquired at multiple repressurization rates for each subject to simulate 
varying resuscitation rates, resulting in 52 total LBNP collections. This work 
is the first to use a single ABP-based algorithm to monitor both simulated 
hemorrhage and resuscitation. A gradient-boosted regression tree model trained 
on only the half-rise to dicrotic notch (HRDN) feature achieved a 
root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 13%, an R2 of 0.82, and area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.97 for detecting decompensation. This 
single-feature model's performance compares favorably to previously reported 
results from more-complex black box machine learning models. This model further 
provides physiological insight because HRDN represents an approximate measure of 
the delay between the ABP ejected and reflected wave and therefore is an 
indication of cardiac and peripheral vascular mechanisms that contribute to the 
compensatory response to blood loss and replacement."
1725,"In this work, immobilizing anti-GFAP antibodies via covalent attachment onto 
L-cysteine/gold nanoparticles that were modified with screen-printed carbon 
electrodes (Anti-GFAP/L-cys/AuNps/SPCE) resulted in the development of a 
sensitive label-free impedance immunosensor for the detection of Glial 
Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP). The immunosensor's stepwise construction was 
studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 
(EIS). L-cysteine was chosen as the linker between GFAP antibodies and Au 
NPs/SPCE because it enables the guided and stable immobilization of GFAP 
antibodies, thus resulting in increased immunosensor sensitivity. As a redox 
probe, 5 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- was used to measure the electron-transfer 
resistance (Ret), which was raised by the binding of antigens to the immobilized 
anti-GFAP on the surface of the modified electrode. A linear correlation between 
Rct and GFAP concentration was achieved under optimum conditions in the range of 
1.0-1000.0 pg/mL, with an extraordinarily low detection limit of 51.0 fg/mL. The 
suggested immunosensor was successfully used to detect the presence of GFAP in 
human blood serum samples, yielding good findings. As a result, the proposed 
platform may be utilized to monitor central nervous system injuries."
1726,"Lactate, a crucial product of the anaerobic metabolism of carbohydrates in the 
human body, is of enormous significance in the diagnosis and treatment of 
diseases and scientific exercise management. The level of lactate in the 
bio-fluid is a crucial health indicator because it is related to diseases, such 
as hypoxia, metabolic disorders, renal failure, heart failure, and respiratory 
failure. For critically ill patients and those who need to regularly control 
lactate levels, it is vital to develop a non-invasive wearable sensor to detect 
lactate levels in matrices other than blood. Due to its high sensitivity, high 
selectivity, low detection limit, simplicity of use, and ability to identify 
target molecules in the presence of interfering chemicals, biosensing is a 
potential analytical approach for lactate detection that has received increasing 
attention. Various types of wearable lactate biosensors are reviewed in this 
paper, along with their preparation, key properties, and commonly used flexible 
substrate materials including polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET), paper, and textiles. Key performance indicators, including 
sensitivity, linear detection range, and detection limit, are also compared. The 
challenges for future development are also summarized, along with some 
recommendations for the future development of lactate biosensors."
1727,"Blood testing is a clinical diagnostic tool to evaluate physiological 
conditions, the immune system response, or the presence of infection from whole 
blood samples. Although conventional blood testing can provide rich biological 
information, it usually requires complicated and tedious whole blood processing 
steps operated by benchtop instruments and well-experienced technicians, 
limiting its usage in point-of-care (POC) settings. To address the above 
problems, we propose a microfluidic platform for on-chip plasma extraction 
directly from whole blood and in situ biomarker detection. Herein, we chose 
C-reactive protein (CRP) as the target biomarker, which can be used to predict 
fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) events such as heart attacks and strokes. To 
achieve a rapid, undiluted, and high-purity on-chip plasma extraction, we 
combined two whole blood processing methods: (1) anti-D immunoglobulin-assisted 
sedimentation, and (2) membrane filtration. To perform in situ CRP detection, we 
fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) microchannel with an embedded 
electrochemical (EC) sensor, which has a modular design to attach the blood 
collector and buffer reservoir with standard Luer connectors. As a proof of 
concept, we first confirmed that the dual plasma extraction design achieved the 
same purity level as the standard centrifugation method with smaller sample (100 
µL of plasma extracted from 400 µL of whole blood) and time (7 min) 
requirements. Next, we validated the functionalization protocol of the EC 
sensor, followed by evaluating the detection of CRP spiked in plasma and whole 
blood. Our microfluidic platform performed on-chip plasma extraction directly 
from whole blood and in situ CRP detection at a 0.1-10 μg/mL concentration 
range, covering the CVD risk evaluation level of the high-sensitivity CRP 
(hs-CRP) test. Based on the above features, we believe that this platform 
constitutes a flexible way to integrate the processing of complex samples with 
accurate biomarker detection in a sample-to-answer POC platform, which can be 
applied in CVD risk monitoring under critical clinical situations."
1728,"We describe a control system for operating valve-enabled microfluidic devices 
and leverage this control system to carry out a complex workflow of plasma 
separation from 8 μL of whole blood followed by on-chip mixing of plasma with 
assay reagents for biomarker detection. The control system incorporates pumps, 
digital pressure sensors, a microcontroller, solenoid valves and off-the-shelf 
components to deliver high and low air pressure in the desired temporal sequence 
to meter fluid flow and actuate microvalves. Importantly, our control system is 
portable, which is suitable for operating the microvalve-enabled microfluidic 
devices in the point-of-care setting."
1729,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive form of thermotherapy with 
great potential in cancer care, having the capability of selectively ablating 
tumoral masses with a surface area of several cm2. When performing RFA in the 
proximity of a blood vessel, the heating profile changes due to heat 
dissipation, perfusion, and impedance changes. In this work, we provide an 
experimental framework for the real-time evaluation of 2D thermal maps in RFA 
neighboring a blood vessel; the experimental setup is based on simultaneous 
scanning of multiple fibers in a distributed sensing network, achieving a 
spatial resolution of 2.5 × 4 mm2 in situ. We also demonstrate an increase of 
ablating potential when injecting an agarose gel in the tissue. Experimental 
results show that the heat-sink effect contributes to a reduction of the ablated 
region around 30-60% on average; however, the use of agarose significantly 
mitigates this effect, enlarging the ablated area by a significant amount, and 
ablating an even larger surface (+15%) in the absence of blood vessels."
1730,"OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this investigation is to provide data about the 
accuracy of total hemoglobin concentration measurements with respect to clinical 
settings, and to devices within the categories of point-of-care and reference 
systems. In particular, tolerance of hemoglobin concentrations below 9 g/dL that 
have become common in clinical practice today determines the need to demonstrate 
the limits of measurement accuracy in patient care.
METHODS: Samples extracted from six units of heparinized human blood with total 
hemoglobin concentrations ranging from 3 to 18 g/dL were assigned to the test 
devices in a random order. The pool of test devices comprised blood gas 
analyzers, an automatic hematology analyzer, a laboratory reference method, and 
the point-of-care system HemoCue. To reduce the pre-analytic error, each sample 
was measured three times. Due to the characteristics of the tested devices and 
methods, we selected the mean values of the data from all these devices, 
measured at the corresponding total hemoglobin concentrations, as the reference.
MAIN RESULTS: The measurement results of the test devices overlap within strict 
limits (R2 = 0.999). Only the detailed analysis provides information about minor 
but systematic deviations. In the group of clinically relevant devices, which 
are involved in patient blood management decisions, the relative differences 
were within the limit of +/- 5 % for values down to 3 g/dL.
CONCLUSIONS: A clinically relevant change of +/- 0.5 g/dL of total hemoglobin 
concentration can be detected with all selected devices and methods. Compliance 
with more stringent definitions-these are the relative differences of 5 % in 
relation to the corresponding reference values and the clinically adapted 
thresholds in the format of a tolerance level analysis-was achieved by the 
clinical devices assessed here."
1731,"Anisotropic gold nanostructures have fascinated with their exceptional 
electronic properties, henceforth exploited for the fabrication of 
electrochemical sensors. However, their synthesis approaches are tedious and 
often require a growth template. Modern lifestyle has caused an upsurge in the 
risk of heart attack and requires urgent medical attention. Cardiac troponin I 
can serve as a biomarker in identification of suspected myocardial infection 
(heart attack). Hence the present work demonstrates the fabrication of a sensing 
platform developed by assimilating anisotropic gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with 
anti cTnI antibody (acTnI) for the detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The 
uniqueness and ease of synthesis by a template-free approach provides an extra 
edge for the fabrication of AuNC coated electrodes. The template-free growth of 
anisotropic AuNCs onto the indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates offers high 
sensitivity (2.2 × 10-4 A ng-1 mL cm-2) to the developed sensor. The 
immunosensor was validated by spiking different concentrations of cTnI in 
artificial serum with negligible interference under optimized conditions. The 
sensor shows a wide range of detection from 0.06-100 ng/mL with an ultralow 
detection limit. Thus, it suggests that the template-free immunosensor can 
potentially be used to screen the traces of cTnI present in blood serum samples, 
and the AuNCs based platform holds great promise as a transduction matrix, hence 
it can be exploited for broader sensing applications."
1732,"Epirubicin is prescribed as an essential drug for treating breast, prostate, 
uterine, and gastrointestinal cancers. It has many side effects, such as heart 
failure, mouth inflammation, abdominal pain, fever, and shortness of breath. Its 
measurement is necessary by straightforward and cheap methods. The application 
of aptamer-based electrochemical sensors is accounted as a selective option for 
measuring different compounds. In this work, a thiol-modified aptamer was 
self-assembled on the surface of the gold electrode (AuE) boosted with carbon 
nano-onions (CNOs), and coupled with methylene blue (MB) as an electroactive 
tracker to achieve a sensitive and selective aptasensor. In the absence of the 
epirubicin, CNOs binds to the aptamer through a π-π interaction enhancing the MB 
electrochemical signal. When epirubicin binds to the aptamer, the adsorption of 
CNOs and MB to the aptamer is not well established, so the electrochemical 
signal is reduced, consequently, the epirubicin value can be measured. The 
prepared aptasensor demonstrated an excellent sensitivity with a curve slope of 
0.36 μI/nM, and 3 nM limit of detection in the linear concentration range of 
1-75 nM. The prepared aptasensor was accurately capable of measuring epirubicin 
in blood serum samples."
1733,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) 
are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The development of 
electrochemical biosensors for CVD markers detection, such as cardiac troponin I 
(cTnI), becomes an important diagnostic strategy. Thus, a glassy carbon 
electrode (GCE) was modified with columnar liquid crystal (LCcol) and gold 
nanoparticles stabilized in polyallylamine hydrochloride (AuNPs-PAH), and the 
surface was employed to evaluate the interaction of the cTnI antibody 
(anti-cTnI) and cTnI for detection in blood plasma. Morphological and 
electrochemical investigations were used in the characterization and 
optimization of the materials used in the construction of the immunosensor. The 
specific interaction of cTnI with the surface of the immunosensor containing 
anti-cTnI was monitored indirectly using a redox probe. The formation of the 
immunocomplex caused the suppression of the analytical signal, which was 
observed due to the insulating characteristics of the protein. The 
cTnI-immunosensor interaction showed linear responses from 0.01 to 0.3 ng mL-1 
and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.005 ng mL-1 for linear sweep voltammetry 
(LSV) and 0.01 ng mL-1 for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), showing 
good diagnostic capacity for point-of-care applications."
1734,"Separation and clonal culture and growth kinetics analysis of target cells in a 
mixed population is critical for pathological research, disease diagnosis, and 
cell therapy. However, long-term culture with time-lapse imaging of the isolated 
cells for clonal analysis is still challenging. This paper reports a 
microfluidic device with four-level filtration channels and a pneumatic 
microvalve for size sorting and in situ clonal culture of single cells. The 
valve was on top of the filtration channels and used to direct fluid flow by 
membrane deformation during separation and long-term culture to avoid 
shear-induced cell deformation. Numerical simulations were performed to evaluate 
the influence of device parameters affecting the pressure drop across the 
filtration channels. Then, a droplet model was employed to evaluate the impact 
of cell viscosity, cell size, and channel width on the pressure drop inducing 
cell deformation. Experiments showed that filtration channels with a width of 7, 
10, 13, or 17 μm successfully sorted K562 cells into four different size ranges 
at low driving pressure. The maximum efficiency of separating K562 cells from 
media and whole blood was 98.6% and 89.7%, respectively. Finally, the trapped 
single cells were cultured in situ for 4-7 days with time-lapse imaging to 
obtain the lineage trees and growth curves. Then, the time to the first 
division, variation of cell size before and after division, and cell fusion were 
investigated. This proved that cells at the G1 and G2 phases were of 
significantly distinct sizes. The microfluidic device for size sorting and 
clonal expansion will be of tremendous application potential in single-cell 
studies."
1735,"Three-dimensional (3D) handheld photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound (US) imaging 
performed using mechanical scanning are more useful than conventional 2D PA/US 
imaging for obtaining local volumetric information and reducing operator 
dependence. In particular, 3D multispectral PA imaging can capture vital 
functional information, such as hemoglobin concentrations and hemoglobin oxygen 
saturation (sO2), of epidermal, hemorrhagic, ischemic, and cancerous diseases. 
However, the accuracy of PA morphology and physiological parameters is hampered 
by motion artifacts during image acquisition. The aim of this paper is to apply 
appropriate correction to remove the effect of such motion artifacts. We propose 
a new motion compensation method that corrects PA images in both axial and 
lateral directions based on structural US information. 3D PA/US imaging 
experiments are performed on a tissue-mimicking phantom and a human wrist to 
verify the effects of the proposed motion compensation mechanism and the 
consequent spectral unmixing results. The structural motions and sO2 values are 
confirmed to be successfully corrected by comparing the motion-compensated 
images with the original images. The proposed method is expected to be useful in 
various clinical PA imaging applications (e.g., breast cancer, thyroid cancer, 
and carotid artery disease) that are susceptible to motion contamination during 
multispectral PA image analysis."
1736,"In this study, the personal glucose meter (PGM) was first used as a fast and 
user-friendly meter for analyzing catechol (CA) based on the reduction of the 
mediator K3[Fe(CN)6] to K4[Fe(CN)6] in the glucose test strip. Then, an easy, 
low-cost, and convenient PGM-based method for detecting tyrosinase (TYR) 
activity and sodium benzoate (SBA) was developed on the basis of the 
TYR-catalyzed reaction. In this method, CA is oxidized to form o-benzoquinone by 
TYR, thereby reducing the residual amount of CA and the PGM readout. On the 
other hand, SBA can inhibit the oxidation of CA catalyzed by TYR and increase 
the residual amount of CA after the enzymatic reaction. Therefore, the activity 
of TYR is proportional to the difference in the PGM readout of CA, and the 
concentration of SBA is positively correlated with the residual amount of CA. 
After the relevant experimental conditions were systematically optimized, the 
proposed PGM-based method for the detection of TYR and SBA was successfully 
validated. The liner ranges are 1.0-103.3 U/mL and 6.25-1000 ppm, and the 
quantification limits are 1.0 U/mL and 6.25 ppm for TYR and SBA, respectively. 
Moreover, the spiked recovery tests in normal human serum and carbonate 
beverages (i.e., Cola, Sprite, and Fanta) were performed, and the recoveries 
(91.6-106.8%) further confirm the applicability of the PGM-based method in real 
sample analysis."
1737,"The blood ammonia (NH3) level is one of the most important hepatic biomarkers 
for the diagnosis and monitoring of liver pathologies and infections. In this 
work, we developed an optimized optical biosensing method to extract and 
quantify the ammonia contained in complex-matrix samples emulating the blood 
serum. First, the approach was tested with solutions of phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS) and ammonia chloride. Then, further trials were carried out with 
solutions of fetal bovine serum (FBS). The ammonia was extracted from the tested 
samples through a customized cell, and it was optically quantified by exploiting 
the indophenol reaction. The extraction cell included a cation-exchange membrane 
in Nafion, which was chemically pre-treated through cleaning procedures of 
sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide to keep a basic pH in the ammonia solution 
and to avoid contaminants in the membrane. From the NH3 solution, the indophenol 
reaction produced light-reactive indophenol dye molecules, which were used as 
colorimetric indicators. Through absorbance measurements of the indophenol dye 
solution at 670 nm wavelength, we were able to detect and quantify the ammonia 
level in the samples both with a spectrophotometer and a customized miniaturized 
read-out system, obtaining a detection limit of 0.029 µmol/mL."
1738,"Diagnostic blood cell counting is of limited use in monitoring a minimal number 
of leukaemia cells, warranting further research to develop more sensitive and 
reliable techniques to identify leukaemia cells in circulation. In this work, a 
hemin-graphene nanocomposite-based aptasensor was developed for ultrasensitive 
colorimetric detection of leukaemia cells (CEM) using magnetic enrichment. 
Hemin-conjugated graphene oxide nanocomposites (HGNs) were prepared by hydrazine 
reduction using graphene oxide nanosheets and hemins. Hence, the prepared HGNs 
become able to absorb single-stranded DNA and acquire peroxidase-like activity. 
The aptamer sgc8c, which recognizes a specific target on leukaemia cells, was 
absorbed onto HGNs to capture the target CEM cancer cells. The captured target 
cells that associated with the HGNs were then concentrated and separated by 
magnetic beads (MBs) coated with sgc8c aptamers, forming a HGN-cell-MB sandwich 
structure. These sandwich structures can be quantified via an oxidation reaction 
catalysed by HGNs. By utilizing dual signal amplification effects generated by 
magnetic enrichment and the improved peroxidase activity of HGNs, the biosensor 
allowed for highly sensitive detection of 10 to 105 CEM cells with an ultra-low 
limit of detection (LOD) of 10 cells under optimal conditions. It is expected 
that the proposed aptasensor can be further employed in monitoring the minimal 
residual disease during the treatment of leukaemia."
1739,"Several musculoskeletal conditions are triggered by inflammatory processes that 
occur along with imbalances between anabolic and catabolic events. Platelet-rich 
plasma (PRP) is an autologous product derived from peripheral blood with 
inherent immunomodulatory and anabolic properties. The clinical efficacy of PRP 
has been evaluated in several musculoskeletal conditions, including 
osteoarthritis, tendinopathy, and osteonecrosis. When used in combination with 
hyaluronic acid (HA), a common treatment alternative, the regenerative 
properties of PRP are significantly enhanced and may provide additional benefits 
in terms of clinical outcomes. Recently, a new PRP-derived product has been 
reported in the literature and is being referred to as ""plasma gel"". Plasma gels 
are obtained by polymerizing plasmatic proteins, which form solid thermal 
aggregates cross-linked with fibrin networks. Plasma gels are considered to be a 
rich source of growth factors and provide chemotactic, migratory, and 
proliferative properties. Additionally, clot formation and the associated 
fibrinolytic reactions play an additional role in tissue repair. There are only 
a few scientific articles focusing on plasma gels. Historically, they have been 
utilized in the fields of aesthetics and dentistry. Given that the combination 
of three products (PRP, HA, and plasma gel) could enhance tissue repair and 
wound healing, in this technical note, we propose a novel regenerative approach, 
named ""PRP-HA cellular gel matrix"" (PRP-GM), in which leukocyte-rich PRP 
(LR-PRP) is mixed with a plasma gel (obtained by heating the plasma up) and HA 
in one syringe using a three-way stopcock. The final product contains a 
fibrin-albumin network entangled with HA's polymers, in which the cells and 
biomolecules derived from PRP are attached and released gradually as 
fibrinolytic reactions and hyaluronic acid degradation occur. The presence of 
leukocytes, especially monocytes and macrophages, promotes tissue regeneration, 
as type 2 macrophages (M2) possess an anti-inflammatory feature. In addition, HA 
promotes the viscosuplementation of the joint and induces an anti-inflammatory 
response, resulting in pain relief. This unique combination of biological 
molecules may contribute to the optimization of regenerative protocols suitable 
for the treatment of degenerative musculoskeletal diseases."
1740,"The waveform of chest compressions directly affects the blood circulation of 
patients with cardiac arrest. Currently, few pieces of research have focused on 
the influence of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) device's mechanical 
waveform on blood circulation. This study investigates the effect of the 
mechanical waveform from a novel CPR prototype on blood circulation and explores 
the optimal compression parameters of the mechanical waveform to optimize blood 
circulation. A novel CPR prototype was designed and built to establish a kinetic 
model during compressions. The prototype's mechanical waveforms at various 
operating conditions were obtained for comparison with manual waveforms and the 
investigation of the optimal compression parameters. The novel CPR prototype can 
complete chest compressions quickly and stably. The cardiac output (CO), 
coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), and cerebral flow (CF) obtained by mechanical 
waveform compressions (1.22367 ± 0.00942 L/min, 30.95083 ± 0.24039 mmHg, 0.31992 
± 0.00343 L/min, respectively) were significantly better than those obtained by 
manual waveform compressions (1.10783 ± 0.03601 L/min, 21.39210 ± 1.42771 mmHg, 
0.29598 ± 0.01344 L/min, respectively). With the compression of the prototype, 
the blood circulation can be optimized at the compression depth of 50 mm, 
approximately 0.6 duty cycle, and approximately 110 press/min, which is of 
guiding significance for the practical use of CPR devices to rescue patients 
with cardiac arrest."
1741,"A brain stroke is a life-threatening medical disorder caused by the inadequate 
blood supply to the brain. After the stroke, the damaged area of the brain will 
not operate normally. As a result, early detection is crucial for more effective 
therapy. Computed tomography (CT) images supply a rapid diagnosis of brain 
stroke. However, while doctors are analyzing each brain CT image, time is 
running fast. This circumstance may lead to result in a delay in treatment and 
making errors. Therefore, we targeted the utilization of an efficient artificial 
intelligence algorithm in stroke detection. In this paper, we designed hybrid 
algorithms that include a new convolution neural networks (CNN) architecture 
called OzNet and various machine learning algorithms for binary classification 
of real brain stroke CT images. When we classified the dataset with OzNet, we 
acquired successful performance. However, for this target, we combined it with a 
minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) method and Decision Tree (DT), 
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naïve Bayes (NB), 
and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In addition, 4096 significant features were 
obtained from the fully connected layer of OzNet, and we reduced the dimension 
of features from 4096 to 250 using the mRMR method. Finally, we utilized these 
machine learning algorithms to classify important features. As a result, 
OzNet-mRMR-NB was an excellent hybrid algorithm and achieved an accuracy of 
98.42% and AUC of 0.99 to detect stroke from brain CT images."
1742,"This study tested the anticoagulant effect of cyclodextrin (CD) 
hyper-branched-based polymers (HBCD-Pols). These polymers were synthesized and 
tested for their coagulant characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Due to their 
polymeric structure and anionic nature, the polymers can chelate Ca2+, reducing 
the free quantity in blood. HBCD-Pol increased the blood clotting time, PT, and 
aPTT 3.5 times over the control, showing a better effect than even 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), as occured with recalcification time as 
well. A titration of HBCD-Pol and EDTA showed exciting differences in the 
ability to complex Ca2+ between both materials. Before executing in vivo 
studies, a hemocompatibility study was carried out with less than 5% red blood 
cell hemolysis. The fibrinogen consumption and bleeding time were analyzed in 
vivo. The fibrinogen was considerably decreased in the presence of HBCD-Pol in a 
higher grade than EDTA, while the bleeding time was longer with HBCD-Pols. The 
results demonstrate that the anticoagulant effect of this HBCD-Pol opens novel 
therapy possibilities due to the possible transport of drugs in this carrier. 
This would give combinatorial effects and a potential novel anticoagulant 
therapy with HBCD-Pol per se."

1744,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) ablation has been 
proposed as a non-thermal energy to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) by epicardial 
ablation of ganglionated plexi (GP), which are embedded within epicardial fat. 
Our objective was to study the distribution of the electric field through the 
involved tissues (fat, GPs, myocardium and blood) during epicardial PEF 
ablation.
METHODS: A two-dimensional model was built considering different tissue layers 
below the ablation device which consists of an irrigated electrode. The 1000 
V/cm threshold was used to estimate the 'PEF-zone'.
RESULTS: The PEF-zone was almost 100% circumscribed in the epicardial fat layer, 
with very little incidence in the myocardium. The presence of the saline on the 
epicardial fat causes the PEF-zone to spread laterally around the electrode from 
~5 mm to ~15 mm, relatively independently of how embedded the electrode is in 
the saline layer. For a saline layer well spread over the tissue surface and an 
electrode fully embedded in the saline layer, the PEF-zone width decreases as 
the fat layer thickens: from ~15 mm for fat thickness of 1 and 2 mm, down to ~10 
mm for fat thickness of 5 mm. The presence of a GP in the center of the fat 
layer hardly affects the size of the PEF-zone, but significantly alters the 
distribution of the electric field around the GP, resulting in progressively 
lower values than in the surrounding adipose tissue as the fat layer thickness 
increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest how some procedural (irrigation) and anatomical 
parameters (fat thicknesses and presence of GPs) could be relevant in terms of 
the size of the tissue area affected by pulsed field ablation."
1745,"Type 1 diabetes results from the loss of pancreatic β cells, reduced insulin 
secretion and dysregulated blood glucose levels. Replacement of these lost β 
cells with stem cell-derived β cells, and protecting these cells within 
macro-device implants is a promising approach to restore glucose homeostasis. 
However, to achieve this goal of restoration of glucose balance requires work to 
optimise β cell function within implants. We know that native β cell function is 
enhanced by cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions within the 
islets of Langerhans. Reproducing these interactions in 2D, such as culture on 
matrix proteins, does enhance insulin secretion. However, the impact of matrix 
proteins on the 3D organoids that would be in implants has not been widely 
studied. Here, we use native β cells that are dispersed from islets and 
reaggregated into small spheroids. We show these β cell spheroids have enhanced 
glucose-dependent insulin secretion when embedded into softer alginate hydrogels 
conjugated with RGD peptide (a common motif in extracellular matrix proteins). 
Embedding into alginate-RGD causes activation of integrin responses and 
repositioning of liprin, a protein that controls insulin secretion. We conclude 
that insulin secretion from β cell spheroids can be enhanced through 
manipulation of the surrounding environment."
1746,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by the development of 
hyperglycemia and insulin resistance during the second or third trimester of 
pregnancy, associated with considerable risks to both the mother and developing 
fetus. Although emerging evidence suggests an association between the altered 
gut microbiota and GDM, remarkably little is known about the microbial and 
metabolic mechanisms that link the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota to the 
development of GDM. In this study, a metagenome-wide association study and serum 
metabolomics profiling were performed in a cohort of pregnant women with GDM and 
pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). We identified gut microbial 
alterations associated with GDM and linked to the changes in circulating 
metabolites. Blood metabolite profiles revealed that GDM patients exhibited a 
marked increase in 2-hydroxybutyric acid and L-alpha-aminobutyric acid, but a 
decrease in methionine sulfoxide, allantoin, and dopamine and dopaminergic 
synapse, when compared with those in NGT controls. Short-chain fatty 
acid-producing genera, including Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, and 
Streptococcus, and species Bacteroides coprophilus, Eubacterium siraeum, 
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Prevotella copri, and Prevotella stercorea, were 
significantly reduced in GDM patients relative to those in NGT controls. 
Bacterial co-occurrence network analysis revealed that pro-inflammatory bacteria 
were over-represented as the core species in GDM patients. These microbial and 
metabolic signatures are closely associated with clinical parameters of glucose 
metabolism in GDM patients and NGT controls. In conclusion, we identified 
circulating dopamine insufficiency, imbalanced production of SCFAs, and 
excessive metabolic inflammation as gut microbiota-driven multiple parallel hits 
linked to GDM development. This work might explain in part the mechanistic link 
between altered gut microbiota and GDM pathogenesis, and suggest that gut 
microbiota may serve as a promising target to intervene in GDM."
1747,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and complex subtype of 
breast cancer that lacks targeted therapy. TNBC manifests characteristic, 
extensive intratumoral heterogeneity that promotes disease progression and 
influence drug response. Single-cell techniques in combination with 
next-generation computation provide an unprecedented opportunity to identify 
molecular events with therapeutic potential. Here, we describe the generation of 
a comprehensive mass cytometry panel for multiparametric detection of 23 
phenotypic markers and 13 signaling molecules. This single-cell proteomic 
approach allowed us to explore the landscape of TNBC heterogeneity, with 
particular emphasis on the tumor microenvironment. We prospectively profiled 
freshly resected tumors from 26 TNBC patients. These tumors contained 
phenotypically distinct subpopulations of cancer and stromal cells that were 
associated with the patient's clinical status at the time of surgery. We further 
classified the epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity of tumor cells, and molecularly 
defined phenotypically diverse populations of tumor-associated stroma. 
Furthermore, in a retrospective tissue-microarray TNBC cohort, we show that the 
level of CD97 at the time of surgery has predictive potential."
1748,"The peripartum period is both a highly vulnerable stage and a significant 
indicator of a population's health status. Interest is increasing in Human 
T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) transmission due to its adverse health 
impacts. However, nationally representative data on HTLV-1 that are important 
for health planning are unavailable for this subpopulation. This study aimed to 
conduct a pooled estimate of HTLV-1 prevalence among pregnant women in Nigeria 
to quantify its clinical burden and public health implications. This systematic 
review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis 2020 statement. After a systematic review 
of the Nigerian literature, 12 studies (2821 pregnant or postnatal women) were 
included in the final evidence synthesis. The estimated HTLV-1 prevalence in 
Nigerian peripartum women following a positive screening test by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay was 5.44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.16-9.20%). A 
subgroup analysis of the two major regions showed a slightly higher prevalence 
in the Western versus Southern region (5.55% [95% CI, 2.49-11.87%]; and 4.91% 
[95% CI, 2.11-11.02]; P = 0.84). However, a subgroup analysis by geopolitical 
zone revealed that Southwestern and Northwestern Nigeria had the highest 
prevalence (9.23% [95% CI, 4.35-18.55; I2, 93%] and 7.15% [95% CI, 1.54-27.54]; 
I2, 92%). Our decade-old subgroup analysis found inconsistencies in the HTLV-1 
prevalence. Furthermore, our literature review revealed a prevalence of HTLV 
infection among patients with various clinical types of lymphomas/leukemias and 
myelopathy of 2-22%. These findings have important implications in defining the 
epidemiological patterns of HTLV-1 infection in Nigeria. They also suggest the 
presence of HTLV-endemic clusters near low-endemic areas, even within the same 
geopolitical zones."
1749,"Preventing or overcoming resistance to the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax is an 
emerging unmet clinical need in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL). The upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members through signaling 
pathways within the tumor microenvironment appears as a major factor leading to 
resistance to venetoclax. Previously, we reported that T cells can drive 
resistance through CD40 and non-canonical NF-κB activation and subsequent Bcl-XL 
induction. Moreover, the T cell-derived cytokines IL-21 and IL-4 differentially 
affect Bcl-XL expression and sensitivity to venetoclax via unknown mechanisms. 
Here, we mechanistically dissected how Bcl-XL is regulated in the context of 
JAK-STAT signaling in primary CLL. First, we demonstrated a clear antagonistic 
role of IL-21/STAT3 signaling in the NF-κB-mediated expression of Bcl-XL, 
whereas IL-4/STAT6 further promoted the expression of Bcl-XL. In comparison, 
Bfl-1, another NF-κB target, was not differentially affected by either cytokine. 
Second, STAT3 and STAT6 affected Bcl-XL transcription by binding to its promoter 
without disrupting the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Third, in situ proximity 
ligation assays (isPLAs) indicated crosstalk between JAK-STAT signaling and 
NF-κB, in which STAT3 inhibited canonical NF-κB by accelerating nuclear export, 
and STAT6 promoted non-canonical NF-κB. Finally, NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) 
inhibition interrupted the NF-κB/STAT crosstalk and re-sensitized CLL cells to 
venetoclax. In conclusion, we uncovered distinct crosstalk mechanisms that shape 
the NF-κB response in CLL towards venetoclax sensitivity or resistance via 
Bcl-XL, thereby revealing new potential therapeutic targets."
1750,"BACKGROUND: Enteric fever remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
Nepal. The emergence of multi-drug resistant Salmonella is a challenge to the 
clinician to care for patients with enteric fever. This study assessed the 
antibiotic susceptibility of Salmonella Typhi isolated from enteric fever and 
the presence of gyrA? ?gene mutation at ser83 of S. Typhi.
METHODS: Blood samples (n = 834) from suspected enteric fever patients were 
collected and cultured to identify Salmonella Typhi. Antimicrobial sensitivity 
test was performed by the modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. The 
minimum ?inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests for ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin 
were examined by the agar dilution method. The gyrA gene was amplified by PCR 
and restriction enzyme digestion was performed to evaluate the ser83 mutation.
RESULTS: Among 824 blood samples analyzed, 5.1% (42/824) were culture positive 
for S. Typhi. First-line antibiotics chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole showed 
higher in-vitro efficacy compared to amoxicillin. Macrolides (azithromycin) and 
third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefixime, and cefotaxime) were 
highly effective against S. Typhi. Nalidixic acid resistance (NAR) was observed 
in 95.2% (40/42) isolates, among them, all (40/40) isolates harbored mutant gyrA 
gene at ser83. However, none of the nalidixic acid-sensitive Salmonella? 
isolates was positive for gyrA? mutation at ser83.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and 
the presence of gyrA? mutation at ser83 position in majority of S. Typhi 
isolates which highlights the importance of alternate drugs as empirical therapy 
for the treatment of enteric fever patients. So, the clinician should focus on 
prescribing conventional first-line antibiotics for the treatment of typhoid 
patients after higher cohort and extended follow-up studies."
1751,"BACKGROUND: The use of face masks has been associated with physiological changes 
in body. This study aims to know the changes in pulse rate and blood pressure 
components after wearing face masks during stairs climbing.
METHODS: An experimental study was conducted among 60 apparently healthy young 
adults between 18-35 years of age. The pulse rate and blood pressure of the 
participants were recorded during rest at ground floor and after climbing the 
stairs till 5th floor at brisk and regular pace without wearing the face masks. 
The uniform KN95 masks were distributed and proper coverage of nose, mouth and 
chin were ensured. After 5 minutes interval, the pulse rate and blood pressure 
were recorded again at rest in ground floor and after climbing stairs with use 
of KN95 masks.
RESULTS: At rest, the difference in mean pulse rate was statistically 
significant after wearing masks in participants between 21-25 years of age 
(86.46±14.59 bpm, p=0.014). After climbing the stairs, the mean pulse rate 
(131.16±18.48 bpm), mean systolic blood pressure (137.67±16.13 mmHg) and mean 
rate pressure product (182.87±41.70) were higher in participants (age group: 
26-30 years) wearing masks and the difference was statistically significant 
(p=0.001; 0.013; 0.001respectively). During stairs climbing, the change in mean 
systolic blood pressure (32.66±16.73 mmHg), mean pulse pressure (43.77±24.64 
mmHg) and mean rate pressure product (96.58±37.23) were higher in participants 
(age group: 26-30 years) and the difference was statistically significant 
(p=0.036; 0.047 and 0.009 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The changes in systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and rate 
pressure product are found to increase after wearing face masks during stairs 
climbing. It can be suggestive of increase workload to the heart by wearing face 
masks in addition to climbing the stairs."
1752,"BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder caused due to a 
point mutation at the sixth codon of the ?-globin gene of both alleles. Sickle 
cell traits occur when the mutation is in one of the two alleles of the ?-globin 
genes. This study was carried out in the Tharu community, which is an indigenous 
and minority group mostly residing in the Terai region of Nepal. They are also 
considered as the most vulnerable group for inheriting Sickle cell anemia.
METHODS: Purposive sampling, which included 130 Tharu individuals of Kanchanpur 
district of Nepal, was considered for the study. The survey was conducted using 
a descriptive questionnaire that contained relevant information including the 
family history of Sickle cell anemia. This was followed by the analysis of blood 
samples to determine the prevalence of Sickle cell anemia and Sickle cell 
traits. Primer-mediated enzymatic amplification of target sequences in genomic 
DNA followed by restriction endonuclease assay with an enzyme DdeI was carried 
out for the confirmation.
RESULTS: Among 130 individuals, only 55.4% had basic knowledge about Sickle cell 
anemia. After screening for sickle cell anemia from 60 participants, 27 (45%) of 
them were found to be in the heterozygous state (carrier, Hb AS) and 28 (46.7%) 
were in the homozygous (normal, AA Hb) state with 5 (8.3%) having the diseased 
hemoglobin (Hb SS) variant of Sickle cell anemia.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a high prevalence of Sickle cell anemia and 
Sickle cell traits in the Tharu community. This study may be beneficial for 
concerned personnel policymakers to reduce sickle cell cases by improving 
genetic literacy among the Tharu community."
1753,"BACKGROUND: Venereal syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease, involving 
pathological activities mediating tissue destruction by extensive tissue 
necrosis. As such, the goal amongst researchers has been set to the 
identification of effective laboratory biomarkers that can reflect the broad 
spectrum of disease and ultimately aid in timely diagnosis and effective 
treatment of syphilis. This research aimed to study the applications of 
hematological biomarkers associated with syphilitic patients visiting a tertiary 
care hospital.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the syphilitic 
patients attending KIST Medical College and Teaching Hospital, Lalitpur, Nepal. 
A total of 25 syphilitic patients and 41 non-syphilitic participants were 
included. The rapid plasma reagin test and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination 
assay were used for the screening and confirmation of syphilis respectively. The 
hematological investigation was performed using a hematology analyzer. 
Statistical Package for Social Science version 17.0 was used for data analysis. 
A P value <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Syphilitic patients showed significantly elevated levels of lymphocytes 
(39.8±11.5) (p=0.025), monocyte (1.9±0.8) (p=0.002), mean corpuscular volume 
(MCV) (92.6±12.9) (p=0.005), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) (31.9±4.6) 
(p=0.008) and lowered levels of red blood cell (RBC) (4.2±0.3) (p=0.005) and 
platelets (237.2±628.6) (p=0.048) as compared to the lymphocytes (32.9±11.9), 
monocyte (0.6±1.2), MCV (83.9±8.8), MCH (34.3±1.5), RBC (4.6±0.7), and platelets 
(280.9±113.3) of the non-syphilitic participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the elevated levels of lymphocyte, 
monocyte, MCV, and MCH and lowered levels of RBC and platelets are highly 
specific hematological biomarkers for the diagnosis of patients with syphilis."
1754,"BACKGROUND: Hysterectomy is one of the most common operations performed by the 
gynecologists second to caesarean section. Hysterectomies are done vaginally, 
laparoscopically or abdominally. This study has been conducted to compare the 
complications of abdominal hysterectomy with non-descent vaginal hysterectomy 
with an aim to establish a safer, superior and lesser complication for the 
patients.
METHODS: This is a cross sectional study conducted at Kathmandu Model Hospital 
over the period of one year among 70 women. Women according to inclusion 
criteria were randomly allocated into two groups; 35 women in group 1 underwent 
non-descent vaginal hysterectomy and 35 in group 2 underwent total abdominal 
hysterectomy. Demographic data, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative 
complications, operation time, postoperative complications, pain, and hospital 
stay was recorded and analyzed using statistical tool..  Results: The average 
age of the women was 45.77±6.33 years. Median blood loss (p=0.033) and hospital 
stay (p=0.005) was significantly low in group 1 as compare to group 2. Mean pain 
score at discharge (p=0.0005) and follow-up (p=0.0005) was also significantly 
less in group 1 as compared to group 2. Overall rate of complication was rare 
and not statistically significant between groups (p=0.643). Rate of wound 
infection was 5.7% that was observed in group 2, Vault infection 5.7% in group 
1, UTI in 2 cases (5.7%) and paralytic ileus was found in 1 case in group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-descent vaginal hysterectomy is safe, effective and feasible 
procedure compared with abdominal hysterectomy. Less complications, faster 
operating time and easy recovery post operatively makes this a patient friendly 
mode of hysterectomy."
1755,"BACKGROUND: Nepal has progressed gradually in reducing under-5 mortality and 
neonatal mortality; however, they are still high at 30.8 and 19.8 per 1000 live 
births, respectively. Neonatal mortality constituted about 64% of the under-5 
mortality in 2019, higher than the global average of 47%.
METHODS: This is a prospective study among pregnant women and their newborn 
babies in Siddhi Memorial Hospital, Bhaktapur, Nepal, from October 2017 to April 
2018. Demographic and clinical data, high vaginal swabs of pregnant mothers, and 
umbilical cord blood were collected. High vaginal swabs were cultured, and 
umbilical cord blood samples were cultured and tested for inflammatory markers. 
After discharge to home, neonates were followed for 28 days of life by weekly 
phone calls.
RESULTS: Total number of pregnant mothers enrolled was 151. The median age was 
26 years (IQR: 18-40), and the proportion of adolescent mothers was 4.7%. Half 
of the deliveries were done by the caesarian section, and 8.6% had gestational 
age <37 weeks. High vaginal swab cultures were positive in 8.2% of the samples 
(n=135), and Escherichia coli was the most common bacteria. Out of 153 newborn 
babies (2 were twins), 8 (5.2%) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care 
unit. The proportion of low birth weight was 13%, and it was independently 
associated with neonatal intensive care unit admission (adjusted OR=9.4, 95%CI 
1.8-50.1; P value= 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent pregnancies and Low Birth Weight babies were commonly 
observed. Both of these issues need to be addressed by effective measures that 
would improve the current situation of maternal and child health in Nepal."
1756,"BACKGROUND: Incorrect use of inhalers in patients with asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease is prevalent internationally. This review aims to 
determine the prevalence and associated factors of incorrect inhaler use and 
effectiveness of intervention to improve the correct use among Nepalese patients 
with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
METHODS: The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Systematic literature search 
was performed in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL,and Google Scholar using predefined 
search terms. Studies in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, reporting at least one overall or critical error, using dry powder 
inhalers and pressurized metered dose inhalers were included. The quality of 
included studies was assessed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Quality 
Assessment Tools. A descriptive narrative synthesis was undertaken.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were eligible for analysis. At least one overall and 
critical step of the inhaler technique was performed incorrectly by the large 
number of patients, ranging from 64-100% and 9-100%, respectively. The incorrect 
use was associated with factors related to patients, inhalers, and health care 
professionals. The interventions included a combination of verbal instruction, 
physical demonstration, and/or face-to-face training on correct inhaler use. 
Following the intervention, an improvement of 23-37% in the overall inhaler 
technique and 7-42% in the critical steps was achieved.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing literature suggests that Nepalese patients with asthma and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have high overall and critical error rates 
in the use of dry powder inhalers and pressurized metered dose inhalers. A 
well-designed educational intervention is necessary to improve the correct use 
of inhalers in this population."
1757,"OBJECTIVES: Being COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) a therapeutic option that 
can have a potential impact on the normalization of immunological parameters of 
COVID-19 affected patients, a detailed analysis of post-infusion immunological 
changes was conducted in CCP treated patients, aiming to identify possible 
predictive hallmarks of disease prognosis.
METHODS: This prospective observational study describes a cohort of 28 patients 
who received CCP shortly after being hospitalized for COVID-19 and diagnosed for 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. All patients were subjected to a detailed 
flow cytometry based evaluation of immunological markers at baseline and on days 
+3 and +7 after transfusion.
RESULTS: At baseline almost all patients suffered from lymphopenia (25/28 on 
T-cells and 16/28 on B-cells) coupled with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio exceeding 
normal values (26/28). Lymphocyte subsets were generally characterized by 
increased percentages of CD19+CD20-CD38hiCD27+ plasmablasts and reduction of 
CD4+CD45RA+CCR7+CD31+ recent thymic emigrants, while monocytes presented a 
limited expression of CD4 and HLA-DR molecules. Amelioration of immunological 
parameters began to be evident from day +3 and became more significant at day +7 
post-CCP transfusion in 18 patients who recovered within 30 days from 
hospitalization. Conversely, baseline immunological characteristics generally 
persisted in ten critical patients who eventually progressed to death (6) or 
long-term care (4).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that proper immunophenotyping panels can be 
potentially useful for monitoring CCP treated patients from the first days after 
infusion in order to presume higher risk of medical complications."
1758,"Haemothorax is presence of blood in pleural cavity and is usually caused by 
chest trauma. Spontaneous rib fractures leading to haemothorax due to excessive 
coughing has seldom been described in the literature. We report an unusual case 
with asthma exacerbation who developed intense coughing followed by chest pain, 
breathlessness, and widespread bruising, without trauma or coagulopathy. Initial 
chest X-ray (CXR) and CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed no significant 
abnormality. CT scan on subsequent presentation showed left sided haemothorax 
with rib fractures. The patient was managed successfully with chest tube 
drainage. On follow up imaging, haemothorax resolved but he was found to have 
malunited rib fractures with chest wall hernia due to wide separation between 
ribs. He was referred to cardiothoracic surgeons for rib fixation and chest wall 
repair."
1759,"BACKGROUND: The ideal urological method for treating complex, large renal 
calculi is Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Its instruments, surgical 
techniques, and positions have all been adjusted as a result of its 
ever-changing nature. In PCNL, the supine position is advantageous compared to 
the prone position due to its several advantages, including the absence of 
cardiopulmonary risks, fewer post operative complications and shorter operative 
time. This study was designed for comparison of PCNL in prone and supine 
positions.
METHODS: After receiving ethical and research committee approval, this 
retrospective review from secondary data was conducted from April 2015 to 
December 2021. Out of 623 patients, PCNL in prone position was performed on 258 
patients and365 patients inmodifiedsupine position. The patients' demographics, 
stone size and location, number of tracts, operating time, hospital stay, stone 
clearance rate, and post-operative complications were all compared.
RESULTS: The gender and age of the patients, the size and number of tracts, and 
location of the stones were all comparable (p>0.05). Operative time for prone 
position was 82 min ±2.49 SD VS 65 min ±2.95 SD, for modified supine position, 
p<0.001), hospital stay was 58 hrs. ±1.66 SD for prone VS 51 Hrs. ±1.65 SD, for 
modified supine position, p<0.01) and analgesia requirements for prone position 
was 41% VS 23% for modified supine position, p<0.001). The stone clearance rate 
was 87% in supine position and 89% in the prone positioning group (p=0.47). 
Urinary leakage from tract site was 0.38% in prone vs. 0% in supine position and 
temperature >99 °F was 12.4% in prone vs. 11.3% in supine position were the most 
common post-operative complications. Angioembolization was not observed in 
either group. Blood transfusions were given to 4.26% in prone position and in 
3.58% of cases in supine PCNL.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the supine position had a short 
operating time, short hospital stays, and less analgesia requirements than PCNL 
in the prone position. In view of the above findings, supine PCNL is easy, quick 
to perform and having less complications rate as compare to Prone PCNL."
1760,"BACKGROUND: Pakistan has got a very high prevalence of myocardial infarction 
(MI). MI presents at pretty young age in this country. The objective of present 
study was to determine the frequency of common risk factors associated with 
early development of MI in middle aged adults of less than 45 years.
METHODS: It was a cross sectional study conducted in the Cardiology department 
of Ayub Teaching Hospital (ATH) Abbottabad from 23rd June 2015 - 10th July 2016. 
A total of 255 consecutive patients diagnosed with MI admitted to the Cardiology 
Unit of ATH, Abbottabad. A detailed medical history and general physical 
examination of the patients was carried out with an emphasis on recording the 
presence or absence of common risk factors of MI in these patients. All routine 
investigations (Blood Complete Picture, Urea, Creatinine, Blood Sugar & Lipid 
Profile) were done.
RESULTS: Mean age of the subjects was 39.98±4.61 SD. The frequency of risk 
factors in descending order was smoking in (38.8%), obesity in (29.4%) and 
essential hypertension in (21.6%) of the patients. Other risk factors of MI in 
this study were diabetes mellitus (19.2%), family history of ischemic heart 
disease (IHD) was (18.8%) and disproportionate dyslipidemias in (12.9%). Sex of 
patients (male predominance) was found to be significantly associated with 
diabetes, smoking and dyslipidemia (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Male sex, smoking, hypertension and obesity confer an increased risk 
of myocardial infarction in patients younger than 45 years of age."
1761,"BACKGROUND: Aplastic Anaemia (AA) is characterized by pancytopenia and 
hypocellular marrow. Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) SHOWS impressive 
haematological response; however, risk of relapse and clonal evolution persists. 
The objective of the study is to assess response to IST in patients with 
aplastic anaemia.
METHODS: A retrospective single centre study at AFBMTC / NIBMT for patients of 
acquired AA was conducted from January 2005 to December 2019.Inclusion criteria 
included diagnosed cases of acquired AA receiving IST for at least 12 weeks and 
age >2 years. IST included cyclosporine (CsA) alone, CsA + androgens, CsA + 
rabbit anti thymocyte globulin (rATG), CsA + horse anti thymocyte globulin 
(hATG). Primary outcome measure was response to IST; secondary outcome measure 
was overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: A total of 513 patients received IST. Median age was 23 years (range 
2-97 years). In study cohort, 155 (30.2%) patients responded to the IST, 63 
(12.3%) achieved complete response (CR) while 92 (17.9%) achieved partial 
response (PR). The ORR of CsA in NSAA, SAA and VSAA was 52.6%, 28.10% and 10% 
respectively; whereas ORR of CsA + rATG in NSAA, SAA and VSAA was 50%, 35.1% and 
22.5% respectively. OS was 38% at a median follow up of 36 months. There was a 
significant difference in the survival distributions of different treatment 
modalities (p=0.016). Median survival time 60 months (CsA), 9 months (CsA+ 
androgens) and 39 months (CsA+ rATG/hATG.) .
CONCLUSION: In resource constrained settings, single agent CsA remains a 
reasonable alternative with modest activity and acceptable side effect profile."
1762,"BACKGROUND: This study was carried out to determine the frequency of CD34 
positivity in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) in our population and to 
report its association with the clinicopathological profile at the time of 
diagnosis.
METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted at National Institute of Blood 
Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan, from March 2020 
till December 2020.Newly diagnosed patients were selected, from both genders and 
all age groups. Relevant history and findings of physical examination were 
recorded. Immunohistochemistry was done on trephine biopsy and molecular studies 
were carried on bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood samples.
RESULTS: Out of 105 patients enrolled, 67 (63.8%) were males, with a male to 
female ratio (M: F) 1.8:1. Of the total patients, 62 (59.04%) were above 15 
years of age. CD34 was expressed in 73 (69.5%) cases. Lymphadenopathy, 
splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly were separately noted in context to CD 34 
expression in 22 (66.6%), 24 (64.8%), and 14 (58.3%) patients, respectively. CNS 
disease was seen in a total of 3(2.75%) subjects, in which 2 (66.6%) of the 
patients had CD34 expression. Total 81 patients in our study fall into the 
high-risk group out of which CD 34 expression was seen in 58(71.6%) subjects. 
Cytogenetic analysis, BCR-ABL p190, and MLL gene rearrangement were investigated 
in all participants. Cytogenetic analysis revealed an abnormality in 20 (19%) 
cases out of which 13 (17.8%) cases were from CD34 positive group.
CONCLUSION: Our study reported CD34 expression in more than two-thirds of cases. 
High-risk disease was significantly associated with CD34 expression."
1763,"BACKGROUND: Acquired uterine vascular abnormalities are a rare cause of 
potentially life threatening bleeding. These include uterine artery 
pseudoaneurysms (UAP)and acquired arteriovenous malformations. The objective of 
this study was to describe our experience with the diagnosis of acquired uterine 
vascular abnormalities and its treatment with uterine preservation. It was a 
retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Eight patients were enrolled from the hospital database who presented 
to our Interventional Radiology department from April 2017 to March 2021 for 
uterine artery embolisation (UAE) with a history of iatrogenic/acquired uterine 
vascular abnormalities confirmed on imaging. These included two patients with 
uterine artery pseudoaneurysm (PA) concurrently with arteriovenous malformation 
(AVM), one with uterine artery PA and five having uterine AVMs. Embolisation 
agents used were histoacryl glue, lipiodol, PVA particles, and gelfoam slurry. 
Medical records, imaging studies, and telephonic contact with patients were 
assessed for patient presentation, intraprocedural details, and follow up to 
record treatment success. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive 
statistics.
RESULTS: Bilateral UAE was performed in six patients, while two patients 
underwent unilateral UAE. Three of the patients presented with life-threatening 
bleeds requiring multiple transfusions. Clinical as well as angiographic success 
was achieved in all patients with immediate control of haemorrhage. No 
complications were observed during follow-up. Two of the patients were able to 
conceive normally within one year, though it resulted in a miscarriage.
CONCLUSION: Acquired/iatrogenic uterine vascular abnormalities are a rare but 
important cause of life-threatening haemorrhage that can be expertly managed and 
successfully treated using UAE, which is rapid, safe, and minimally invasive, 
with the added advantage fertility preservation."
1764,"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is characterized by the presence of 
more than or equal to 20% lymphoblast (early lymphoid precursors) in peripheral 
blood and/or in bone marrow. Lymphoblast can infiltrate different organs and 
clinically patients can present with fatigue, pallor, fever, bone pain, bleeding 
or bruises and lymphadenopathy. ALL is the most common type of malignancy in 
children. To determine the cytogenetic abnormalities in patients of Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukaemia as a predictor of response to induction chemotherapy. It 
was a descriptive cross-sectional study.
METHODS: This study was conducted at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, 
Rawalpindi over a period of six months from June to November 2019. Bone marrow 
and peripheral blood samples of newly diagnosed 80 patients of all the age 
groups and either gender, who received one month treatment for ALL,were analyzed 
for cytogenetic study. Patients who were previously diagnosed with ALL, who 
presented with relapse and those who required induction treatment outside the 
trial hospital were excluded. UK ALL 2011 treatment protocol was adopted for 
patients up to 25 years old and for patients above 25years old UK ALL 2014 
treatment protocol as induction chemotherapy was adopted. Evaluation for 
remission was carried out at the termination of initial induction chemotherapy 
on day 29 of treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were enrolled in the study, comprising 36 (45%) 
females & 44 (55%) males. The median age of paediatric patients was 5years (<19 
years) who were 56/80 (70%) in number whereas the median age of adults was 27 
years (>19 years) who constituted 24/80 (30%) of the participants. Cytogenetic 
of 51 (63.75%) patients revealed hyperdiploidy (chromosome number 51-66) whereas 
29(36.25%) of the participants had miscellaneous mutations [(Hypodiploidy, t (9; 
22), t (1; 19) and t (12; 21)]. On immunophenotyping 51/80 (63.7%) of the 
leukemias were of B cell origin and 29 (36.25%) of T-cell origin.
CONCLUSION: Patients with hyperdiploidy, t (12;21) ETV6/RUNX1 and 
t(1;19)TCF3/PBX1 had better prognosis and higher remission rate compared to 
those with the other mutations like t(9;22)Ph+ and hypodiploid which were 
associated with poor prognosis. Association of gender with remission was not 
statistically significant."
1765,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated low first-time donor return rates 
(DRR) following catastrophic events. Little is known, however, about the 
influence of demographic factors on the DRR of first-time donors during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including the unique motivation of COVID-19 convalescent 
plasma (CCP) donors as compared to non-CCP donors.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirteen blood collection organizations submitted 
deidentified data from first-time CCP and non-CCP donors returning for regular 
(non-CCP) donations during the pandemic. DRR was calculated as frequencies. 
Demographic factors associated with returning donors: race/ethnicity, gender, 
and generation (Gen Z: 19-24, Millennial: 25-40, Gen X: 41-56, and Boomer: 
≥57 years old), within the CCP and non-CCP first-time cohorts were compared 
using chi-square test at p < .05 statistical significance.
RESULTS: From March 2020 through December 2021, there were a total of 44,274 
first-time CCP and 980,201 first-time non-CCP donors. DRR were 14.6% (range 
11.9%-43.3%) and 46.6% (range 10.0%-76.9%) for CCP and non-CCP cohorts, 
respectively. Age over 40 years (Gen X and Boomers), female gender, and White 
race were each associated with higher return in both donor cohorts (p < .001). 
For the non-CCP return donor cohort, the Millennial and Boomers were comparable.
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate differences in returning donor trends 
between the two donor cohorts. The motivation of a first-time CCP donor may be 
different than that of a non-CCP donor. Further study to improve first-time 
donor engagement would be worthwhile to expand the donor base with a focus on 
blood donor diversity emphasizing engagement of underrepresented minorities and 
younger donors."
1766,"BACKGROUND: Aspirin resistance (AR) results in major adverse cardiovascular 
events, and DNA methylation might participate in the regulation of this 
pathological process.
METHODS: In present study, a sum of 35 patients with AR and 35 non-AR (NAR) 
controls were enrolled. Samples from 5 AR and 5 NAR were evaluated in an 850 
BeadChip DNA methylation assay, and another 30 AR versus 30 NAR were evaluated 
to validate the differentially methylated CpG loci (DML). Then, qRT-PCR was used 
to investigate the target mRNA expression of genes at CpG loci. Finally, Gene 
Ontology (GO) as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses 
were performed to reveal the enriched pathways.
RESULTS: The AR and NAR groups displayed significant differences in DNA 
methylation at 7707 positions, with 270 hypermethylated sites (e.g., cg09555818 
located in APOC2) and 7437 sites hypomethylated sites (e.g., cg26828689 located 
in SLC12A5). Six DML were validated by pyrosequencing, and it was confirmed that 
DNA methylation (cg16391727, cg21008208, cg21293749, and cg13945576) was related 
to the increasing risk of AR. The relative mRNA expression of the ROR1 gene was 
also associated with AR (p = 0.007), suggesting that the change of cg21293749 in 
DNA methylation might lead to differential ROR1 mRNA expression, ultimately 
resulting in AR. Furthermore, the identified differentially methylated sites 
were associated with the molecular pathways such as circadian rhythms and 
insulin secretion.
CONCLUSION: Hence, the distinct DNA methylation might play a vital role in the 
biological regulation of AR through the pathways such as circadian rhythms."
1767,"INTRODUCTION: White matter injury (WMI) significantly affects neurobehavioral 
recovery in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients. Gut dysbiosis plays an 
important role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Oxymatrine (OMT) 
has therapeutic effects on inflammation-mediated diseases. Whether OMT exerts 
therapeutic effects on WMI after ICH and the role of gut microbiota involved in 
this process is largely unknown.
METHODS: Neurological deficits, WMI, gut microbial composition, intestinal 
barrier function, and systemic inflammation were investigated after ICH. Fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to elucidate the role of gut 
microbiota in the pathogenesis of ICH.
RESULTS: OMT promoted long-term neurological function recovery and ameliorated 
WMI in the peri-hematoma region and distal corticospinal tract (CST) region 
after ICH. ICH induced significant and persistent gut dysbiosis, which was 
obviously regulated by OMT. In addition, OMT alleviated intestinal barrier 
dysfunction and systemic inflammation. Correlation analysis revealed that gut 
microbiota alteration was significantly correlated with inflammation, intestinal 
barrier permeability, and neurological deficits after ICH. Moreover, OMT-induced 
gut microbiota alteration could confer protection against neurological deficits 
and intestinal barrier disruption.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that OMT ameliorates ICH-induced WMI and 
neurological deficits by modulating gut microbiota."
1768,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) related chronic visceral pain affects 
20% of people worldwide. The treatment options are very limited. Although the 
scholarly reviews have appraised the potential effects of the intestinal 
microbiota on intestinal motility and sensation, the exact mechanism of 
intestinal microbiota in IBS-like chronic visceral pain remains largely unclear. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Folic Acid (FA) attenuated 
visceral pain and its possible mechanisms.
METHODS: Chronic visceral hyperalgesia was induced in rats by neonatal colonic 
inflammation (NCI). 16S rDNA analysis of fecal samples from human subjects and 
rats was performed. Patch clamp recording was used to determine synaptic 
transmission of colonic-related spinal dorsal horn.
RESULTS: Alpha diversity of intestinal flora was increased in patients with IBS, 
as well as the obviously increased abundance of Clostridiales order (a main 
bacteria producing hydrogen sulfide). The hydrogen sulfide content was positive 
correlation with visceral pain score in patients with IBS. Consistently, NCI 
increased Clostridiales frequency and hydrogen sulfide content in feces of adult 
rats. Notably, the concentration of FA was markedly decreased in peripheral 
blood of IBS patients compared with non-IBS human subjects. FA supplement 
alleviated chronic visceral pain and normalized the Clostridiales frequency in 
NCI rats. In addition, FA supplement significantly reduced the frequency of 
sEPSCs of neurons in the spinal dorsal horn of NCI rats.
CONCLUSION: Folic Acid treatment attenuated chronic visceral pain of NCI rats 
through reducing hydrogen sulfide production from Clostridiales in intestine."
1769,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current 
recommendations for management of perioperative anaemia in patients undergoing 
thoracic surgery, present the impact of anaemia on outcomes in this patient 
population and suggest an algorithm for evaluating and treating anaemia 
preoperatively.
RECENT FINDINGS: Anaemia is a common medical issue noted preoperatively in 
patients presenting for thoracic surgery and carries significant morbidity. 
Preoperative anaemia increases the likelihood of receiving a perioperative 
transfusion, which represents a significant risk factor for morbidity and 
reduced disease-free survival in lung cancer patients presenting for thoracic 
surgery. It is also associated with longer hospital lengths of stay and 
increased risk for reoperation following lung transplantation. An 
algorithm-based approach to management of anaemia is beneficial and treatment 
with iron has been shown to reduce transfusions.
SUMMARY: Patients undergoing thoracic surgery have a high incidence of 
preoperative anaemia that increases the risk of transfusion and postoperative 
morbidity. Preoperative evaluation and tailored treatment based on the 
underlying cause of anaemia reduces the incidence of anaemia prior to surgery 
and decreases transfusion rates."
1770,"In the ischemic brain, hypoxia leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, insufficient 
energy production, and astrocyte activation. Yet, most studies investigating 
mitochondrial dysfunction in cerebral ischemia have focused exclusively on 
neurons. This review will highlight the importance of the morphological, 
molecular, and functional heterogeneity of astrocytes in their role in brain 
injuries and explore how activated astrocytes exhibit calcium imbalance, 
reactive oxygen species overproduction, and apoptosis. In addition, special 
focus will be given to the role of the mitochondrial protein frataxin in 
activated astrocytes during ischemia and its putative role in the 
pharmacological management of cerebral ischemia."
1771,"PURPOSE: Temporal (TA) and axillary (AXA) arteries Color Doppler Ultrasonography 
(CDUS) is the most reliable diagnostic technique for the diagnosis of giant cell 
arteritis (GCA), displaying high sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, CDUS 
is still poorly performed in the common clinical practice, being employed only 
by rheumatologists with a relevant expertise in this field. Color Doppler Eye 
Ultrasound (CDEUS) is a procedure variously employed in ophthalmology and 
preliminary findings have displayed a possible role also in the diagnostic 
work-up of GCA. Aim of this study was to assess whether CDEUS may play a role in 
the differential diagnosis between arteritic and non-arteritic blindness.
METHODS: We prospectively included all patients evaluated since September 2021 
to May 2022 by our Ophthalmology Unit for sudden blindness and referred to our 
Vasculitis Clinic in the suspicion of GCA. All patients underwent complete 
ophthalmological evaluation, routine blood tests, AxA and TA CDUS and CDEUS. 
According to the definite diagnosis, patients were divided in the following 
subgroups: (A) patients suffering from arteritic central retinal artery 
occlusion (CRAO), (B) patients suffering from non-arteritic CRAO, (C) patients 
suffering from arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), (D) patients 
suffering from non-arteritic AION.
RESULTS: During the observational period, we included a total of 25 patients 
suffering from sudden blindness and referred to Vasculitis Clinic for ruling out 
GCA. Patients belonging to group A showed no flow or reduced flow within the 
territory of central retinal artery (CRA), no ""spot sign"" and positive TA CDUS; 
on the other hand, patients from group B presented normal TA CDUS, no flow or 
reduced flow within the territory of CRA and the presence of ""spot sign"". 
Conversely, no relevant difference was evidenced at CDEUS in patients with and 
without arteritic AION.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data displayed a good reliability of CDEUS in 
distinguishing between arteritic and non-arteritic CRAO, while no difference was 
assessed between arteritic and non-arteritic AION. Since AION represents the 
most common presentation of cranial GCA, CDEUS does not seem a reliable 
procedure in the diagnostic work-up of GCA and should be restricted only to the 
exclusion of thrombo-embolic occlusions within the territory of central retinal 
artery."
1772,"BACKGROUND: The association between blood lead (PbB) and uric acid (SUA) remains 
unclear in US adults without a high level of lead exposure. Additionally, the 
effects of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) modifying this 
association are still unclear. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect 
of modification of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on the association 
between PbB and SUA.
METHOD: This research analyzed National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) data from 2005 to 2016. Through several screenings, 18,578 participants 
over the age of 20 were eligible for the analysis. Multivariable linear 
regression was used to evaluate the association between PbB and SUA. By having 
stratified participants based on the HDL-C intake category (low HDL-C 
intake < 50 mg/dl; high HDL-C intake ≥ 50 mg/dl), effect modification by HDL-C 
was assessed through a likelihood ratio test between PbB and SUA.
RESULT: Multivariable linear regression indicated that PbB positively affects 
SUA (β = 0.19, 95% CI 0.16-0.22). The relationship between PbB and SUA was 
different in the low and high HDL-C intake group (β 0.12 95% Cl 0.08-0.16 vs. β 
0.26 95% Cl 0.22 ~ - 0.30). Furthermore, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
significantly modified the relationship between PbB and SUA in all models which 
indicates that the interaction of lead exposure and HDL-C is more dangerous than 
the sum of the individual effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood 
lead have an interactive effect on increasing uric acid, which may have great 
importance for clinical medication."
1773,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify factors related to the incidence of 
post-thrombectomy subarachnoid hemorrhage (PTSAH).
METHODS: This retrospective, observational cohort study enrolled consecutive 
patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to the internal carotid artery 
(IC) top or middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 or M2 segment occlusion who 
underwent single-pass stent retriever (SR) treatment between January 2015 and 
May 2022 at two acute care hospitals.
RESULTS: Of the 54 included patients, 10 were in the PTSAH group (18.5%). The 
occlusion sites were IC top (31.5%), M1 segment (48.1%), and M2 segment (20.4%). 
Aspiration catheters (ACs) were used in 32 (59.3%) patients; however, the 
combined technique (AC advancement at least to the most proximal marker of SR) 
was actually used in 26 (48.1%) patients because a ledge effect at the 
ophthalmic artery origin from the IC interfered with distal navigation of the 
ACs. The baseline patient characteristics did not differ between the groups. M2 
segment occlusion in the PTSAH and non-PTSAH groups were 40.0% and 15.9%, 
respectively (p = 0.19). More ACs were used in the non-PTSAH group (65.9% vs. 
30.0%, p = 0.07). Significantly fewer combined techniques were performed in the 
PTSAH group (10.0% vs. 56.8%, p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis adjusted by 
variables with M2 segment occlusion and the combined technique, the combined 
technique (odds ratio 0.098; 95% confidence interval, 0.011-0.887; p = 0.039) 
was identified as a significantly associated factor for PTSAH. There was one 
PTSAH case (1.9%) with symptom worsening.
CONCLUSION: The combined technique significantly influenced PTSAH occurrence as 
a preventive factor."
1774,"The Ambu Aura-i laryngeal mask is considered to be a device for blind intubation 
as well as for fiberoptic guided intubation. The novel video laryngeal airway 
mask SaCoVLM is a supraglottic airway device that allows intubation under direct 
vision. We hypothesized that success rates for device placement and tracheal 
intubation with the SaCoVLM would be comparable with the Ambu Aura-i mask. A 
prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 2021 to December 
2021. One hundred and twenty patients were enrolled and randomized in the study. 
Direct intubation was performed with the SaCoVLM, and fiberoptic guided 
intubation was performed with the Ambu Aura-i mask. The primary outcome measure 
was the first success rate of LMA placement. Secondary outcome measures were the 
time from device placement and time from endotracheal intubation (as well as the 
time for LMA removal after successful intubation), differences in airway leak 
pressure, fiberoptic grade of the laryngeal view, and incidence of blood 
staining. The first success rate of LMA placement was similar for the two 
devices. There was no difference in the time for successful endotracheal 
intubation between the Ambu Aura-i and SaCoVLM groups (24.1 s ± 6.3 versus 
25.7 s ± 2.1; p > 0.05). The time for removal was slower in the SaCoVLM group 
than in the Ambu Aura-i group (20.8 s ± 0.8 versus 14.7 s ± 6.1; p < 0.01). The 
airway leak pressure was higher in the SaCoVLM group than in the Ambu Aura-i 
group (27.0 s ± 1.0 versus 22.3 s ± 3.6; p < 0.01), and the incidence of blood 
staining was higher in the SaCoVLM group (16.7%). The SaCoVLM has an overall 
comparable performance to the Ambu Aura-i mask. However, the SaCoVLM is better 
relative to direct intubation without the assistance of a flexible intubation 
scope, which reduces the device's demand."
1775,"Expressed on epidermal Langerhans cells, CD1a presents a range of self-lipid 
antigens found within the skin; however, the extent to which CD1a presents 
microbial ligands from bacteria colonizing the skin is unclear. Here we 
identified CD1a-dependent T cell responses to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a 
ubiquitous bacterial membrane phospholipid, as well as to lysylPG, a modified 
PG, present in several Gram-positive bacteria and highly abundant in 
Staphylococcus aureus. The crystal structure of the CD1a-PG complex showed that 
the acyl chains were buried within the A'- and F'-pockets of CD1a, while the 
phosphoglycerol headgroup remained solvent exposed in the F'-portal and was 
available for T cell receptor contact. Using lysylPG and PG-loaded CD1a 
tetramers, we identified T cells in peripheral blood and in skin that respond to 
these lipids in a dose-dependent manner. Tetramer+CD4+ T cell lines secreted 
type 2 helper T cell cytokines in response to phosphatidylglycerols as well as 
to co-cultures of CD1a+ dendritic cells and Staphylococcus bacteria. The 
expansion in patients with atopic dermatitis of CD4+ CD1a-(lysyl)PG tetramer+ T 
cells suggests a response to lipids made by bacteria associated with atopic 
dermatitis and provides a link supporting involvement of PG-based 
lipid-activated T cells in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis."
1776,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences and outcomes of surgical procedures, 
clinical effect, complications and patients' satisfaction between disposable 
oval-shaped circumcision device (Modified Chinese ShangRing series, Kiddie 
love®) and conventional circumcision in the treatment of children with phimosis 
or redundant prepuce.
METHODS: The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed in 114 children with 
phimosis or redundant foreskin undergone circumcision using a disposable 
oval-shaped circumcision device, a modified Chinese ShangRing series, Kiddie 
Love® (Kiddie Love group) in our hospital between January 2018 and February 
2020, and another 114 children with similar conditions circumcised by 
conventional surgical procedure before January 2018 (conventional group). The 
two groups were compared regarding the operative time, intraoperative blood 
loss, postoperative pain scores, healing time, the incidence of complications 
and guardian's satisfaction.
RESULTS: Circumcision was successfully completed in children in both groups. The 
operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain scoring in 24 h by 
VAS, pain at the removal of the device or stitches and wound healing were 
(6.4 ± 1.6) min, (34.1 ± 6.4) min; (0.7 ± 0.2) ml, (2.6 ± 0.6) ml; (2.2 ± 1.0) 
points, (1.3 ± 0.5) points; (23.7 ± 3.9)day, (15.9 ± 2.8)day, respectively for 
Kiddie Love group and conventional group(either P < 0.05 or P > 0.05). The two 
groups were significantly different in the incidence of hematoma, edema and 
incision dehiscenceyet were insignificant in incision infection. Children in 
both groups were followed up from 6 to 31 months (mean: 23 months), and the 
satisfaction rate was 94.7% (108/114) in parents of the children circumcised by 
the ShangRing and 83.3% (95/114) in those of children treated by conventional 
circumcision (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Modified Chinese ShangRing, Kiddie Love®, has superiorities, 
including simpler procedure, shorter operative time, less blood loss, fewer 
complications, better cosmetic results and higher satisfaction of patients over 
conventional circumcision in the treatment of children with phimosis or 
redundant foreskin, and worthy of wider clinical recommendation."
1777,"BACKGROUND: There is no consensus regarding thromboprophylaxis after Fontan 
procedure, and novel tools to assess thrombogenicity are needed to establish 
optimal thromboprophylaxis. The Total Thrombus-formation Analysis System (T-TAS) 
was developed for the quantitative analysis of thrombus formation using 
microchips with thrombogenic surfaces. This prospective study evaluated the 
utility of T-TAS in the assessment of thrombogenicity in pediatric Fontan 
patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The participants included 20 consecutive Fontan patients 
who underwent cardiac catheterization and 30 healthy controls. Blood samples 
collected without and with antithrombotic therapy (aspirin or aspirin and 
warfarin) were used for T-TAS to compute the area under the curve (AUC) in the 
atheroma (AR10-AUC30) and platelet (PL18-AUC10) chips. A higher AUC indicates 
higher thrombogenicity. T-TAS values showed that patients in the Fontan group 
without antithrombotic therapy had lower thrombogenicity than those in the 
control group [PL18-AUC10, median (interquartile range) 356 (313-394) vs. 408 
(392-424); AR10-AUC30, median (interquartile range) 1270 (1178-1351) vs. 1382 
(1338-1421)]. Aspirin and warfarin therapies significantly decreased PL18-AUC10 
and AR10-AUC30, respectively, compared with those of patients without 
antithrombotic therapy (P < 0.001 for each comparison). Subgroup analysis 
divided by low (< 9 mmHg) or high (≥ 9 mmHg) central venous pressure (CVP) 
showed that CVP affects the reduction in AR10-AUC30 with antithrombotic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: T-TAS may be a useful tool for monitoring thrombogenicity and 
antithrombotic therapy in Fontan patients."
1778,"BACKGROUND: Techniques and devices for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided 
hepaticoenterostomy (EUS-HES) procedures, including EUS-guided 
hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) and EUS-guided hepaticojejunostomy (EUS-HJS), have 
been developed; however, the optimal timing to begin oral intake after EUS-HES 
remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of early oral intake 
after EUS-HES.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated patients who underwent EUS-HES (EUS-HGS 
or EUS-HJS) between March 2015 and March 2022. Patients who had no problems with 
the results of blood tests and computed tomography examinations on the morning 
of day 1 after EUS-HES were classified as either the early intake group (started 
oral intake on day 1 after EUS-HES) or the late intake group (started oral 
intake on day 2 or later after EUS-HES). Patients' characteristics, procedure 
characteristics, and early postprocedural adverse events (within 14 days after 
the procedure) were compared between groups.
RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled in this study. Forty-three patients had no 
problems with the results of examinations performed on the morning of day 1 
after EUS-HES. Twenty-one patients comprised the early intake group and 22 
comprised the late intake group. Adverse events that developed within 14 days 
after EUS-HES were not significantly different between groups (early 4.7% vs. 
late 9.0%; odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.0080-10.49; P = 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: Starting oral intake on day 1 after EUS-HES did not increase 
postprocedural adverse events compared with starting oral intake on day 2 or 
later after EUS-HES."
1779,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, initiates 
in the outer-blood-retina-barrier (oBRB) formed by the retinal pigment 
epithelium (RPE), Bruch's membrane, and choriocapillaris. The mechanisms of AMD 
initiation and progression remain poorly understood owing to the lack of 
physiologically relevant human oBRB models. To this end, we engineered a 
native-like three-dimensional (3D) oBRB tissue (3D-oBRB) by bioprinting 
endothelial cells, pericytes, and fibroblasts on the basal side of a 
biodegradable scaffold and establishing an RPE monolayer on top. In this 3D-oBRB 
model, a fully-polarized RPE monolayer provides barrier resistance, induces 
choriocapillaris fenestration, and supports the formation of 
Bruch's-membrane-like structure by inducing changes in gene expression in cells 
of the choroid. Complement activation in the 3D-oBRB triggers dry AMD phenotypes 
(including subRPE lipid-rich deposits called drusen and choriocapillaris 
degeneration), and HIF-α stabilization or STAT3 overactivation induce 
choriocapillaris neovascularization and type-I wet AMD phenotype. The 3D-oBRB 
provides a physiologically relevant model to studying RPE-choriocapillaris 
interactions under healthy and diseased conditions."
1780,"BACKGROUND: Aortic Regurgitation (AR) produces the entrance of an abnormal 
amount of blood in the left ventricle. This disease is responsible for high 
morbidity and mortality worldwide and may be caused by an aortic valve 
dysfunction. Surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are the 
current options for treating AR. They have replaced older procedures such as 
Hufnagel's one. However, some physicians have reconsidered this procedure as a 
less aggressive alternative for patients not eligible for surgical or TAVR. 
Although Hufnagel suggested a 75% regurgitation reduction when a valve is placed 
in the descending aorta, a quantification of this value has not been reported.
METHODS: In this paper, CFD/FSI numerical simulation is conducted on an 
idealized geometry. We quantify the effect of placing a bileaflet mechanical 
heart valve in the descending aorta on a moderate-severe AR case. A 
three-element Windkessel model is employed to prescribe pressure outlet boundary 
conditions. We calculate the resulting flow rates and pressures at the aorta and 
first-generation vessels. Moreover, we evaluate several indices to assess the 
improvement due to the valve introduction.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Regurgitation fraction (RF) is reduced from 37.5% 
(without valve) to 18.0% (with valve) in a single cardiac cycle. This reduction 
clearly shows the remarkable efficacy of the rescued technique. It will further 
ameliorate the left ventricle function in the long-term. Moreover, the 
calculations show that the implantation in that location introduces fewer 
incompatibilities' risks than a conventional one. The proposed methodology can 
be extended to any particular conditions (pressure waveforms/geometry) and is 
designed to assess usual clinical parameters employed by physicians."
1781,"Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) play an active role in the immunological 
homeostasis of the urogenital tract. In the epididymis, a finely tuned balance 
between tolerance to antigenic sperm and immune activation is required to 
maintain epididymal function while protecting sperm against pathogens and 
stressors. We previously characterized a subset of resident MPs that express the 
CX3CR1 receptor, emphasizing their role in antigen sampling and processing 
during sperm maturation and storage in the murine epididymis. 
Bacteria-associated epididymitis is the most common cause of intrascrotal 
inflammation and frequently leads to reproductive complications. Here, we 
examined whether the lack of functional CX3CR1 in homozygous mice 
(CX3CR1EGFP/EGFP, KO) alters the ability of MPs to initiate immune responses 
during epididymitis induced by LPS intravasal-epididymal injection. Confocal 
microscopy revealed that CX3CR1-deficient MPs located in the initial segments of 
the epididymis displayed fewer luminal-reaching membrane projections and 
impaired antigen capture activity. Moreover, flow cytometry showed a reduction 
of epididymal KO MPs with a monocytic phenotype under physiological conditions. 
In contrast, flow cytometry revealed an increase in the abundance of MPs with a 
monocytic signature in the distal epididymal segments after an LPS challenge. 
This was accompanied by the accumulation of CD103+ cells in the interstitium, 
and the prevention or attenuation of epithelial damage in the KO epididymis 
during epididymitis. Additionally, CX3CR1 deletion induced downregulation of 
Gja1 (connexin 43) expression in KO MPs. Together, our study provides evidence 
that MPs are gatekeepers of the immunological blood-epididymis barrier and 
reveal the role of the CX3CR1 receptor in epididymal mucosal homeostasis by 
inducing MP luminal protrusions and by regulating the monocyte population in the 
epididymis at steady state as well as upon infection. We also uncover the 
interaction between MPs and CD103+ dendritic cells, presumably through connexin 
43, that enhance immune responses during epididymitis. Our study may lead to new 
diagnostics and therapies for male infertility and epididymitis by identifying 
immune mechanisms in the epididymis."
1782,"Incorporating genetics into risk-stratification for treatment of childhood 
B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) has contributed significantly 
to improved survival. In about 30% B-ALL (B-other-ALL) without well-established 
chromosomal changes, new genetic subtypes have recently emerged, yet their true 
prognostic relevance largely remains unclear. We integrated next generation 
sequencing (NGS): whole genome sequencing (WGS) (n = 157) and bespoke targeted 
NGS (t-NGS) (n = 175) (overlap n = 36), with existing genetic annotation in a 
representative cohort of 351 B-other-ALL patients from the childhood ALL trail, 
UKALL2003. PAX5alt was most frequently observed (n = 91), whereas PAX5 P80R 
mutations (n = 11) defined a distinct PAX5 subtype. DUX4-r subtype (n = 80) was 
defined by DUX4 rearrangements and/or ERG deletions. These patients had a low 
relapse rate and excellent survival. ETV6::RUNX1-like subtype (n = 21) was 
characterised by multiple abnormalities of ETV6 and IKZF1, with no reported 
relapses or deaths, indicating their excellent prognosis in this trial. An 
inferior outcome for patients with ABL-class fusions (n = 25) was confirmed. 
Integration of NGS into genomic profiling of B-other-ALL within a single 
childhood ALL trial, UKALL2003, has shown the added clinical value of NGS-based 
approaches, through improved accuracy in detection and classification into the 
range of risk stratifying genetic subtypes, while validating their prognostic 
significance."
1783,"Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Flt3-TKI) have 
improved outcomes for patients with Flt3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
but are limited by resistance and relapse, indicating persistence of leukemia 
stem cells (LSC). Here utilizing a Flt3-internal tandem duplication (Flt3-ITD) 
and Tet2-deleted AML genetic mouse model we determined that FLT3-ITD AML LSC 
were enriched within the primitive ST-HSC population. FLT3-ITD LSC showed 
increased expression of the CXCL12 receptor CXCR4. CXCL12-abundant reticular 
(CAR) cells were increased in Flt3-ITD AML marrow. CXCL12 deletion from the 
microenvironment enhanced targeting of AML cells by Flt3-TKI plus chemotherapy 
treatment, including enhanced LSC targeting. Both treatment and CXCL12 deletion 
partially reduced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) signaling in AML 
cells and further reduction was seen after treatment in CXCL12 deleted mice. p38 
inhibition reduced CXCL12-dependent and -independent maintenance of both murine 
and human Flt3-ITD AML LSC by MSC and enhanced their sensitivity to treatment. 
p38 inhibition in combination with chemotherapy plus TKI treatment leads to 
greater depletion of Flt3-ITD AML LSC compared with CXCL12 deletion. Our studies 
support roles for CXCL12 and p38 signaling in microenvironmental protection of 
AML LSC and provide a rationale for inhibiting p38 signaling to enhance Flt3-ITD 
AML targeting."
1784,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasia (BPDCN) is a rare myeloid 
malignancy with a generally poor prognosis. Although preliminary evidence 
suggests that hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) could improve outcome in 
patients with BPDCN, the individual contributions of conditioning and 
graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects to HCT success are undefined. We present a 
retrospective study of 162 adult patients who underwent a first HCT (allogeneic 
146, autologous 16) between 2009 and 2017, and were registered with the EBMT. 
Median age was 57 (range 20-73) years, and disease status at HCT was first 
complete remission (CR1) in 78%. Among patients receiving allogeneic HCT 
(alloHCT), myeloablative conditioning (MAC), reduced intensity conditioning 
(RIC) and in-vivo T-cell depletion (TCD) were used in 54%, 46%, and 59% 
respectively. Total body irradiation (TBI) was the conditioning backbone in 61% 
of MAC and 26% of RIC transplants. One-year overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) rates were comparable after alloHCT and 
autologous HCT (autoHCT). Among alloHCT recipients, MAC with TBI significantly 
improved OS and PFS, independently of CR1, age, Karnofsky index and TCD. 
Accordingly, MAC (ideally based on TBI) should be preferred for alloHCT 
recipients with BPDCN. In patients who are not elegible for MAC alloHCT, autoHCT 
could be considered."
1785,"AIM: Few data are available regarding the management of anorectal abscess in 
patients with leukopenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of 
leukopenia among patients undergoing incision and drainage for anorectal 
abscess.
METHOD: A retrospective review of the American College of Surgeons National 
Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database identified patients 
from 2015 to 2020. Perianal fistulas and supralevator abscesses were excluded. 
Patients were grouped based on white blood cell (WBC) count: WBC < 4.5 cells/μl, 
WBC = 4.5-11.0 cells/μl and WBC > 11.0 cells/μl. The 30-day overall 
complications and outcomes were compared using regression models, accounting for 
demographics and comorbidities.
RESULTS: Ten thousand two hundred and forty (70.3% male) patients were 
identified. Univariate analysis showed that, compared with patients with 
leukocytosis (WBC > 11.0 cells/μl) and normal WBC count (WBC = 4.5-11.0 
cells/μl), patients with leukopenia (WBC <4.5 cells/μl) had higher rates of 
overall (p < 0.001), pulmonary (p < 0.001) and haematological complications 
(p < 0.001). They also had higher rates of readmission (p < 0.001), reoperation 
(p = 0.005), discharge to a care facility (p = 0.003), increased length of 
hospital stay (p = 0.004) and death (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis 
identified leukopenia as an independent risk factor for overall complications 
[odds ratio (OR) 2.31, 95% CI 1.65-3.24; p < 0.001], pulmonary complications (OR 
5.65, 95% CI 1.88-16.97; p = 0.002), haematological complications (OR 4.30, 95% 
CI 2.94-6.28; p < 0.001), unplanned readmission (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.43-3.40; 
p < 0.001), reoperation (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.10-2.93; p = 0.019) and death (OR 
2.77, 95% CI 1.02-7.52; p = 0.046). Discharge to a care facility and length of 
stay were not significant on multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSION: Leukopenia is associated with increased risk for pulmonary and 
haematological complications, readmissions, reoperations, discharge to a care 
facility and death after incision and drainage for anorectal abscess."
1786,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The incorporation of point of care ultrasound into the field 
of anesthesiology and perioperative medicine is growing at rapid pace. The 
benefits of this modality align with the acuity of patient care and 
decision-making in anesthetic care of a trauma patient.
RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiac ultrasound can be used to diagnose cardiac tamponade or 
investigate the inferior vena cava to assess volume status in patients who may 
suffer from hemorrhagic shock. Thoracic ultrasound may be used to rapidly 
identify pneumothorax or hemothorax in a patient suffering chest wall trauma. In 
addition, investigators are exploring the utility of ultrasonography in 
traumatic airway management and elevated intracranial pressure. In addition, the 
utility of gastric ultrasound on trauma patients is briefly discussed.
SUMMARY: Incorporation of point of care ultrasound techniques into the practice 
of trauma anesthesiology is important for noninvasive, mobile and expeditious 
assessment of trauma patients. In addition, further large-scale studies are 
needed to investigate how point of care ultrasound impacts outcomes in trauma 
patients."
1787,"Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a group of RNA molecules that cannot encode

1788,"Platelet microparticles (PMPs) are vesicles that are released by platelets into 
the extracellular space and play a role in antiphospholipid antibody syndromes. 
PMPs have recently been recognized as a new and viable cell. There is growing 
evidence that the anti-β2 glycoprotein (GPI)/β2GPI complex is associated with 
aberrant activation of PMPs. Although studies suggest that aberrant activation 
of PMPs may lead to inflammatory necrosis of endothelial cells, the underlying 
mechanisms remain unclear. We found that although the difference in the number 
of PMPs was not statistically significant, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 
(NLRP3) within PMPs was increased during stimulation of anti-β2GPI/β2GPI 
complexes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that anti-β2GPI/β2GPI complex-induced 
PMPs effectively stimulated endothelial cell pyroptosis via the NLRP3/nuclear 
factor (NF)-κB/gasdermin D (GSDMD) signaling pathway as well as the 
NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway. Additionally, inhibition of NLRP3 expression 
in PMPs effectively reduced the inflammatory response and pyroptosis in 
endothelial cells. Our data suggest that PMPs aberrantly activated by 
anti-β2GPI/β2GPI complexes play a vital role in endothelial cell pyroptosis, and 
these studies provide major insights into the mechanisms of thrombosis during 
the treatment of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome."
1789,"Thrombus formation is highly dependent upon the physico-chemical environment in 
which it is triggered. Our ability to understand how thrombus formation is 
initiated, regulated, and resolved in the human body is dependent upon our 
ability to replicate the mechanical and biological properties of the arterial 
wall. Current in vitro thrombosis models principally use reductionist approaches 
to model the complex biochemical and cellular milieu present in the arterial 
wall, and so researcher have favored the use of in vivo models. The field of 
vascular tissue engineering has developed a range of techniques for culturing 
artificial human arteries for use as vascular grafts. These techniques therefore 
provide a basis for developing more sophisticated 3D replicas of the arterial 
wall that can be used in in vitro thrombosis models. In this review, we consider 
how tissue engineering approaches can be used to generate 3D models of the 
arterial wall that improve upon current in vivo and in vitro approaches. We 
consider the current benefits and limitations of reported 3D tissue engineered 
models and consider what additional evidence is required to validate them as 
alternatives to current in vivo models."
1790,"AIM: To investigate the effect of family-centred education on treatment 
adherence, glycosylated haemoglobin and blood glucose level in patients with 
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Sixty patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus were randomly allocated 
into the intervention and control group. Data were collected using demographic 
and Modanloo Adherence to Treatment Questionnaires. The patients received 12 
family-centred educational sessions in the intervention group.
RESULTS: A significant difference was found in the mean score of treatment 
adherence between the two groups after the intervention (p < 0.001). The mean 
score of treatment adherence significantly increased in the intervention group 
after family-centred education. The mean score of Fasting Blood Glucose and 
Glycosylated Haemoglobin A1C significantly decreased in the intervention group 
after the intervention (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Relevant authorities need to consider family-centred education as 
one of the most important education methods in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus 
patients.

1791,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: With the development of HER2-directed therapies, 
identifying non-invasive imaging biomarkers of HER2 expression in breast cancer 
brain metastases has become increasingly important. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate whether relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) from dynamic 
susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion MR could help identify the HER2 
status of breast cancer brain metastases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: With IRB approval for this HIPAA-compliant 
cross-sectional study and a waiver of informed consent, we queried our 
institution's electronic medical record to derive a cohort of 14 histologically 
proven breast cancer brain metastases with preoperative DSC perfusion MR and 
HER2 analyses of the resected/biopsied brain specimens from 2011-2021. The rCBV 
of the lesions was measured and compared using Mann-Whitney tests. Receiver 
operating characteristic analyses were performed to evaluate the performance of 
rCBV in identifying HER2 status.
RESULTS: The study cohort was comprised of 14 women with a mean age of 56 years 
(range: 32-81 years) with a total of 14 distinct lesions. The rCBV of 
HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases was significantly greater than the 
rCBV of HER2-negative lesions (8.02 vs 3.97, U=48.00, p=0.001). rCBV 
differentiated HER2-positive lesions from HER2-negative lesions with an area 
under the curve of 0.98 (standard error=0.032, p<0.001). The accuracy-maximizing 
rCBV threshold (4.8) was associated with an accuracy of 93% (13/14), a 
sensitivity of 100% (7/7), and a specificity of 86% (6/7).
CONCLUSION: rCBV may assist in identifying the HER2 status of breast cancer 
brain metastases, if validated in a large prospective trial."
1792,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications of surgical incisions are frequent in

surgical incision of the liver transplantation. The primary endpoint was 
surgical site infection incidence 30 days postoperatively. The secondary 
endpoints included surgical site events (ie, surgical site infection, 
dehiscence, hematoma, and seroma) and wound quality of life.
RESULTS: Between December 2018 and September 2021, 108 patients (54 in the 
incisional negative pressure wound therapy group and 54 in the control group) 
were enrolled in this study. The incidence of surgical site infection at 30 days 
postoperatively was 7.4% in the treatment group and 13% in the control group 
(P = .34). The rate of surgical site events was similar in the treatment in the 
and control group (27.8% vs 29.6%, P = .83). In relation to wound quality of 
life, the mean score was 75.20 ± 7.27 in the incisional negative pressure wound 
therapy group and 72.82 ± 10.57 in the control group (P = .23).
CONCLUSION: The prophylactic use of negative pressure wound therapy on primarily 
closed incisions did not significantly reduce incisional surgical site infection 
and surgical site event rates after liver transplantation compared with standard 
surgical dressings."
1793,"Venetoclax is a highly selective B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor, which, 
combined with a DNA hypomethylating agent or low dose cytarabine, results in 
high rates of initial responses in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 
However, the disease relapses in most patients. Mechanisms of resistance to 
venetoclax-based therapy include TP53 gene mutations or inactivation of p53 
protein, activating kinase mutations such as FLT3 and RAS, and upregulation of 
other BCL-2 family apoptotic proteins. Current clinical trials are exploring 
strategies such as doublet or triplet regimens incorporating a p53 activator, an 
anti-CD47 antibody, or other novel agents that target genes and proteins 
responsible for resistance to venetoclax. Further studies should focus on 
identifying predictive biomarkers of response to venetoclax-based therapy and 
incorporating immunotherapeutic approaches such as checkpoint inhibitors, 
bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and CAR T-cell therapy to 
improve outcomes for patients with AML."
1794,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a disease of the elderly 
mostly because its development from preneoplastic lesions depends on the 
accumulation of gene mutations and epigenetic alterations over time. How aging 
of non-cancerous tissues of the host affects tumor progression, however, remains 
largely unknown.
METHODS: We took advantage of a model of accelerated aging, uncoupling protein 
2-deficient (Ucp2 knockout, Ucp2 KO) mice, to investigate the growth of 
orthotopically transplanted Ucp2 wild-type (WT) PDAC cells (cell lines Panc02 
and 6606PDA) in vivo and to study strain-dependent differences of the PDAC 
microenvironment.
RESULTS: Measurements of tumor weights and quantification of proliferating cells 
indicated a significant growth advantage of Panc02 and 6606PDA cells in WT mice 
compared to Ucp2 KO mice. In tumors in the knockout strain, higher levels of 
interferon-γ mRNA despite similar numbers of tumor-infiltrating T cells were 
observed. 6606PDA cells triggered a stronger stromal reaction in Ucp2 KO mice 
than in WT animals. Accordingly, pancreatic stellate cells from Ucp2 KO mice 
proliferated at a higher rate than cells of the WT strain when they were 
incubated with conditioned media from PDAC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Ucp2 modulates PDAC microenvironment in a way that favors tumor 
progression and implicates an altered stromal response as one of the underlying 
mechanisms."
1795,"OBJECTIVES: Exercise-induced hyperglycemia is recognized in type 1 diabetes 
(T1D) clinical guidelines, but its association with high-intensity intermittent 
exercise (HIIE) in acute studies is inconsistent. In this meta-analysis we 
examined the available evidence of blood glucose responses to HIIE in adults 
with T1D. The secondary aim was to examine predictors of blood glucose responses 
to HIIE. We hypothesized that there would be no consistent effect on blood 
glucose from HIIE, unless examined in the context of participant prandial 
status.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search using keywords related to T1D and 
HIIE. Studies were required to include at least 6 participants with T1D with a 
mean age >18 years, involve an HIIE intervention and contain pre- and 
postexercise measures of blood glucose. Analyses of extracted data were 
performed using a general inverse variance statistical method with a random 
effects model and a weighted multiple regression.
RESULTS: Nineteen interventions from 15 reports were included in the analysis. A 
mean overall blood glucose decrease of -1.3 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 
[CI], -2.3 to -0.2 mmol/L) was found during exercise, albeit with high 
heterogeneity (I2=84%). When performed after an overnight fast, exercise 
increased blood glucose by +1.7 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.4 to 3.0 mmol/L), whereas 
postprandial exercise decreased blood glucose by -2.1 mmol/L (95% CI, -2.8 
to -1.4 mmol/L), with a statistically significant difference between groups 
(p<0.0001). No associations with fitness (p=0.4), sex (p=0.4), age (p=0.9), 
exercise duration (p=0.9) or interval duration (p=0.2) were found.
CONCLUSION: The effect of HIIE on blood glucose is inconsistent, but partially 
explained by prandial status."
1796,"Early identification of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who 
are likely to experience disease recurrence or refractory disease after 
rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone 
(R-CHOP) would be useful for improving risk-adapted treatment strategies. We 
aimed to assess the prognostic value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) parameters at baseline, interim, and 
end of treatment (EOT). Methods: We analyzed the prognostic impact of FDG-PET/CT 
in 166 patients with DLBCL treated with a risk-adapted immunochemotherapy 
regimen. Scans were performed at baseline, after four cycles of R-CHOP (interim) 
and six weeks after completing therapy (EOT). Progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier and the impact of 
clinical/PET factors assessed with Cox models. We also assessed the predictive 
ability of the recently proposed International Metabolic Prognostic Index 
(IMPI). Results: The median follow-up was 7.9 years. International Prognostic 
Index (IPI), baseline metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and change in maximum 
standardized uptake value (∆SUVmax) at interim scans were statistically 
significant predictors for OS. Baseline MTV, interim ∆SUVmax, and EOT Deauville 
score were statistically significant predictors of PFS. Combining interim PET 
parameters demonstrated that patients with Deauville 4-5 and positive ∆SUVmax ≤ 
70% at restaging (approximately 10% of the cohort) had extremely poor prognosis. 
The IMPI had limited discrimination and slightly overestimated the event rate in 
our cohort. Conclusion: Baseline MTV and interim ∆SUVmax predicted both PFS and 
OS with this sequential immunochemotherapy program. Combining interim Deauville 
score with interim ∆SUVmax may identify an extremely high-risk DLBCL population."
1797,"Rationale: Accurate differentiation between tumor progression (TP) and 
pseudoprogression remains a critical unmet need in neuro-oncology. 
18F-fluciclovine is a widely available synthetic amino acid PET radiotracer. In 
this study, we aimed to assess the value of 18F-fluciclovine PET for 
differentiating pseudoprogression from TP in a prospective cohort of patients 
with suspected radiographic recurrence of glioblastoma. Methods: We enrolled 30 
glioblastoma patients with radiographic progression after first-line 
chemoradiotherapy who were planned for surgical resection. Patients underwent 
pre-operative 18F-fluciclovine PET and MRI. Relative percentages of viable tumor 
and therapy-related changes observed in histopathology were quantified and 
categorized as TP (≥50% viable tumor), mixed TP (<50% and >10% viable tumor), or 
pseudoprogression (≤10% viable tumor). Results: Eighteen patients had TP, 4 
mixed TP, and 8 pseudoprogression. Patients with TP/mixed TP had significantly 
higher 40-50 minutes SUVmax (6.64+ 1.88 vs 4.11± 1.52, P = 0.009) compared to 
patients with pseudoprogression. A 40-50 minutes SUVmax cut-off of 4.66 provided 
90% sensitivity and 83% specificity for differentiation of TP/mixed TP from 
pseudoprogression (Area under the curve (AUC)=0.86). Relative cerebral blood 
volume (rCBVmax) cut-off 3.672 provided 90% sensitivity and 71% specificity for 
differentiation of TP/mixed TP from Pseudoprogression (AUC=0.779). Combining a 
40-50 minutes SUVmax cut-off of 4.66 and a rCBVmax cut-off of 3.67 on MRI 
provided 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity for differentiating TP/mixed TP 
from Pseudoprogression (AUC=0.95). Conclusion: 18F-fluciclovine PET uptake can 
accurately differentiate pseudoprogression from TP in glioblastoma, with even 
greater accuracy when combined with multi-parametric MRI. Given the wide 
availability of 18F-fluciclovine, larger, multicenter studies are warranted to 
determine whether amino acid PET with 18F-fluciclovine should be used in the 
routine assessment of post-treatment glioblastoma."
1798,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Perihematomal edema (PHE) contributes to poor outcome 
after deep intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), which is characterized by 
neuroinflammation and an influx of peripherally derived innate immune cells. We 
previously identified soluble ST2 (sST2) as a candidate for immune-mediated 
secondary brain injury. Leveraging prospectively collected cohorts from two 
centers, we sought to determine if sST2 was associated with functional outcome, 
PHE and the immune response following IPH.
METHODS: Patients with deep IPH were enrolled within 36 hours of ictus and blood 
was collected for sST2 and immune cell measurement. Hematoma volume and PHE were 
measured on serial CT scans. Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale 
0-3 at 90 days. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the 
relationship between sST2 and PHE over time. Flow cytometry was used to identify 
shifts in immune cell populations associated with sST2. Immunohistochemistry of 
human brain tissue was used to identify ST2-expressing cells in the 
perihematomal region.
RESULTS: The 55 included patients had median admission GCS of 14 [IQR 9-15], ICH 
score of 1 [IQR 1-2], and hematoma volume of 8.6mL [IQR 3.4-13.8]. Receiver 
operating curve analysis found sST2 level to be predictive of poor outcome with 
an area under the curve of 0.763 (95% CI 0.632 - 0.894) and Youden's optimum cut 
point of 61.8ng/mL (p < 0.001). sST2 remained an independent predictor after 
adjustment for ICH score (adjusted OR 2.53 [95% CI 1.03-6.19], p = 0.042). 
Measurement of PHE found those patients with high sST2 to have greater edema 
volume over time (β = 1.07 [95% CI 0.51-1.63], p < 0.001). High sST2 was 
associated with a shift towards an innate peripheral immune response (monocytes 
and NK cells; 68.6±5.1% vs. 47.5±4.0%; p = 0.003).
DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that elevated sST2 links the peripheral 
innate immune response to PHE volume and outcome after IPH. This knowledge is 
relevant to future studies that seek to identify IPH patients at highest risk 
for immune-mediated injury or limit injury through targeted interventions."
1799,"Symptomatic nonstenotic carotid artery disease has been increasingly recognized 
as a thromboembolic source in patients who would otherwise be classified as 
having embolic stroke of undetermined source. Evidence suggests that certain 
plaque features seen on sonography, CT, and MR imaging in nonstenotic carotid 
artery disease may predispose to recurrent stroke in patients with embolic 
stroke of undetermined source. We performed a focused literature review to 
further study plaque features in the context of embolic stroke of undetermined 
source and to determine which plaque features may be associated with ipsilateral 
ischemic events in such patients. Plaque thickness as seen on both ultrasound 
and CT appears to have a consistent association with ipsilateral stroke in 
patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source across multiple studies. 
Intraplaque hemorrhage as seen on MR imaging is now understood to have a strong 
association with ipsilateral stroke in patients with embolic stroke of 
undetermined source. Continued study of various plaque features as seen on 
different modalities is warranted to uncover other potential associations."
1800,"Paraplegia after an operation for acute aortic dissection Stanford type A (AADA) 
is fairly uncommon, and there is no consensus about optimal treatment. We 
present a case in which cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD) and permissive 
hypertension were used for treatment of paraplegia. When the patient showed 
complete bilateral paraplegia after operation for AADA, we immediately began 
CSFD and maintained mean arterial blood pressure at over 90 mmHg. His 
neurological deficit gradually recovered, and he was eventually able to walk 
without support. The combination of CSFD and permissive hypertension could be a 
first-line emergent treatment for postoperative paraplegia after AADA surgery."
1801,"The sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor tofogliflozin is a 
glucose-lowering drug that causes the excretion of surplus glucose by inhibiting 
SGLT2. Because of tofogliflozin's osmotic diuresis mechanism, patients' serum 
electrolytes, body fluid levels, and cardiac function must be monitored. We 
retrospectively analyzed the cases of 64 elderly Japanese patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who received tofogliflozin for 3 months. Their HbA1c, 
serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), hematocrit, brain natriuretic 
peptide (cardiac volume load marker) and renin and aldosterone (RAA; an index of 
regulatory hormones involved in body fluid retention) were continuously 
monitored during the investigation period. Renal function and cardiac function 
(by echocardiography) were assessed throughout the period. HbA1c significantly 
decreased (β1=-0.341, p<0.0001, linear regression analysis [LRA]). Most of the 
hormonal, electrolyte, and physiological parameters were maintained throughout 
the study period. In these circumstances, E/e' tended to decrease (β1=-0.382, 
p=0.13, LRA). Compared to the baseline, E/e' was significantly decreased at 1 
and 3 months (p<0.01, p<0.05). In the higher E/e' group (E/e'≥10, n=34), E/e' 
decreased significantly (β1=-0.63, p<0.05, LRA). ΔE/e' was correlated with 
body-weight change during treatment (r=0.64, p<0.01). The 3-month tofogliflozin 
treatment improved glycemic control and diastolic function represented by E/e' 
in T2DM patients, without affecting serum electrolytes, renal function, or RAA. 
No negative impacts on the patients were observed. Three-month tofogliflozin 
treatment lowered glucose and improved cardiac diastolic function."
1802,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-exacerbated respiratory disease 
(N-ERD) comprises the triad of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, 
and intolerance to NSAIDs. Dupilumab treatment, targeting the IL-4 receptor 
alpha, significantly reduces polyp burden as well as asthma symptoms. Here we 
aimed to investigate the effect of dupilumab on aspirin intolerance, burden of 
disease, as well as on nasal cytokine profiles in patients suffering from N-ERD. 
In this open-label trial, adult patients with confirmed N-ERD were treated with 
dupilumab for six months. Clinical parameters (e.g., total polyp scores, quality 
of life questionnaires, smell test, spirometry), oral aspirin provocation 
testing, blood, nasal and urine sampling were monitored up to six months after 
starting dupilumab therapy at regular intervals. Of the thirty-one patients 
included in the study, thirty completed both aspirin provocation testing. After 
six months of treatment with dupilumab, 23.3% (n=7/30) of patients developed 
complete aspirin tolerance and an additional 33.3% of patients (n=10/30) 
tolerated higher doses. Polyp burden was significantly reduced (total polyp 
score: -2.68±1.84, p<0.001) and pulmonary symptoms (asthma control test: 
+2.34±3.67, p<0.001), as well as olfactory performance improved (UPSIT: 
+11.16±9.54, p<0.001) in all patients after therapy. Patients with increased 
aspirin tolerance showed a significant decrease in urine leukotriene E4 levels 
and their improvement in clinical parameters was associated with the reduction 
of eotaxin-1, CCL17, IL-5, IL-17A and IL-6. 57% of N-ERD patients tolerated 
higher doses of aspirin under dupilumab therapy."
1803,"Metal cations have been exploited for their precipitation properties in a wide 
variety of studies, ranging from differentiating proteins from serum and blood 
to identifying the protein targets of drugs. Despite widespread recognition of 
this phenomenon, the mechanisms of metal-induced protein aggregation have not 
been fully elucidated. Recent studies have suggested that Cu's ability to induce 
protein aggregation may be a main contributor to Cu-induced cell death. Here, we 
provide the first proteome-wide analysis of the relative sensitivities of 
proteins across the Escherichia coli proteome to Cu-induced aggregation. We 
utilize a Metal-induced Protein Precipitation methodology that relies on 
quantitative bottom-up proteomics to define the metal concentration-dependent 
precipitation properties of proteins on a proteomic scale. Our results establish 
that Cu far surpasses other metals in promoting protein aggregation and that the 
protein aggregation is reversible upon metal chelation. The bulk of the Cu bound 
in the protein aggregates is Cu1+, regardless of the Cu2+ source. Analysis of 
our Metal-induced Protein Precipitation data allows us to investigate underlying 
biophysical characteristics that determine a protein's sensitivity to Cu-induced 
aggregation, which is independent of the relative concentration of protein in 
the lysate. Overall, this analysis provides new insights into the mechanism 
behind Cu cytotoxicity, as well as metal cation induced protein aggregation."
1804,"BACKGROUND: The Nuss repair involves implants designed for removal after 2-3 
years. Although rare, significant complications can occur with bar removal and 
may be higher in adults. This study was performed to review complications and 
risk factors associated with bar removal and discuss strategies to improve 
operative safety.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed including all patients post pectus 
excavatum repair who underwent Nuss implant removal at Mayo Clinic Arizona from 
2013-2022.
RESULTS: In total, 1,555 bars were removed (683 patients; 71% men; median age 34 
(range 15-71)). Of removals, 12.45% of patients had bars placed at outside 
institutions. Major complications were rare with bleeding most common (2.05%), 
followed by pneumothorax (0.88%), infection (0.59%), and effusions (0.44%). Most 
major bleeding (85.71%) occurred from the bar track during removal and was 
controlled by packing the track, with one patient requiring subsequent hematoma 
evacuation/transfusion. Bleeding secondary to lung injury was also successfully 
controlled with packing. Removal in one patient with significantly displaced 
bars required sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass due to aortic injury. Risk 
factors identified for bleeding included sternal erosion (p<.001), bar migration 
(p<.001), higher number of bars (p=.037), and revision of a prior pectus repair 
(p=0.001). Bar migration was additionally associated with major complications 
(p<.001). Older age, although a risk for overall complications (p=0.001), was 
not for bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Bar removal can be safely performed in most patients, however, 
significant complications including bleeding may occur. Identifying potential 
risk factors and being prepared for rescue maneuvers is critical to prevent 
catastrophic outcomes."
1805,"BACKGROUND: There is little knowledge on the association of changes over time in 
adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) with changes in modifiable 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and of markers of low-grade 
inflammation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between long-term changes in MD adherence 
and concurrent changes in established CVD risk factors and in markers of 
low-grade inflammation among adult Italians.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was conducted. Dietary and health data were 
obtained both at baseline (2005-2010) and at follow-up (2017-2020). Adherence to 
MD was estimated by a Mediterranean Diet Score ranging from 0 to 9 points, and 
the exposure was change in this score measured after a median 12.7-y period.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: This study included a sub-group of 897 men and 1,126 women 
aged ≥35 years at enrolment in the Moli-sani Study (n=24,325).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in two composite z-scores including 9 established 
CVD risk factors (e.g. serum lipids, blood pressure) and 4 inflammatory markers 
(including C-reactive protein), respectively, were measured both at enrolment 
and after the same 12.7-y period.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models 
were used.
RESULTS: In a multivariable-adjusted analysis, an increased Mediterranean Diet 
Score over time was associated with decreased levels in the Inflammatory score 
(β=-0.372; 95%CI -0.720 -0.025), but had little or no impact on the CVD risk 
score (β=-0.200; 95%CI -0.752, 0.351), as compared to individuals who had 
decreased their MD adherence. Among individual food groups/nutrients included in 
the Mediterranean Diet Score, an increased intake of monounsaturated over 
saturated fats over time was associated with lower CVD risk score, whereas 
increased consumption of cereals was inversely linked to the Inflammatory score, 
as compared to the reduced consumption group.
CONCLUSIONS: An increased adherence to a traditional Mediterranean Diet over 
time was associated with reduced low-grade inflammation. These findings suggest 
the potential of a traditional Mediterranean eating pattern to help reduce the 
long-term risk of inflammation-related chronic diseases in an ageing population."
1806,"Synthetic high-density lipoproteins nanomedicine (sHDL) composed of 
apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) mimetic peptides and lipids have shown very 
promising results for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases. Numerous 
efforts have also been made to design different ApoA-I mimetic peptides to 
improve the potency of sHDL, especially the efficiency of reverse cholesterol 
transport. However, the way in which ApoA-I mimetic peptides affect the 
properties of sHDL, including stability, cholesterol efflux, cholesterol 
esterification, elimination in vivo, and the relationship of these properties, 
is still poorly understood. Revealing the effect of these factors on the potency 
of sHDL is important for the design of better ApoA-I mimetic peptides. In this 
study, three widely used ApoA-I mimetic peptides with different sequences, 
lengths, LCAT activation and lipid binding affinities were used for the 
preparation of sHDL and were evaluated in terms of physical/chemical properties, 
cholesterol efflux, cholesterol esterification, remodeling, and 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. Our results showed that ApoA-I mimetic 
peptides with the highest cholesterol efflux and cholesterol esterification in 
vitro did not exhibit the highest cholesterol mobilization in vivo. Further 
analysis indicated that other factors, such as pharmacokinetics and remodeling 
of sHDL, need to be considered in order to predict the efficiency of cholesterol 
mobilization in vivo. Thus, our study highlights the importance of using the 
overall performance, rather than in vitro results alone, as the blueprint for 
the design and optimization of ApoA-I mimetic peptides."
1807,"INTRODUCTION: Infective native extracranial carotid artery aneurysms are rare, 
and their management is variable due to a lack of evidence assessing outcomes.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines 
to identify all reported cases of infective native extracranial carotid artery 
aneurysms between January 1970 and March 2021.
RESULTS: This study identified 193 infective native aneurysms of the 
extracranial carotid artery from 154 sources. Patients were predominantly male 
(71.4%), and age ranged from 6 months to 89 years old. The most common 
presenting features were a neck mass and fever, but also included haemorrhage, 
respiratory distress and neurological symptoms. Most aneurysms were located in 
the internal carotid artery (47.4%). Staphylococcus (23.3%) was the most 
commonly identified causative pathogen, followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(20.9%). Most appeared to become infected by direct local spread. Treatment 
strategies involved open surgical methods in 101 cases and an endovascular 
approach in 41 cases. In four cases, a hybrid method involving concurrent 
endovascular and open surgical management was undertaken. In five cases there 
was antibiotic treatment alone. In the open surgery treated group, the 
complication rate was 20.8% compared to 13.2% in the endovascular group. 
Mortality rate was 5.6%.
CONCLUSION: Our review identified 193 cases of infective native extracranial 
carotid artery aneurysms. Direct local spread of a staphylococcus infection was 
the commonest cause. Endovascular management was associated with fewer early 
complications than open surgical management."
1808,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with early-onset colorectal cancer (eoCRC) are 
managed according to guidelines that are not age-specific. A multidisciplinary 
international group (DIRECt), comprised of 69 experts, was convened to develop 
the first evidence-based consensus recommendations for eoCRC.
METHODS: After reviewing the published literature, a Delphi methodology was 
employed to draft and respond to clinically relevant questions. Each statement 
underwent 3 rounds of voting and reached a consensus level of agreement of ≥80%.
RESULTS: The DIRECt group produced 31 statements in 7 areas of interest: 
diagnosis, risk factors, genetics, pathology-oncology, endoscopy, therapy, and 
supportive care. There was strong consensus that all individuals younger than 50 
should undergo CRC risk stratification and prompt symptom assessment. All newly 
diagnosed eoCRC patients should receive germline genetic testing, ideally before 
surgery. Based on current evidence, endoscopic, surgical, and oncologic 
treatment of eoCRC should not differ from later onset CRC, except for 
individuals with pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants. The evidence 
on chemotherapy is not sufficient to recommend changes to established 
therapeutic protocols. Fertility preservation and sexual health are important to 
address in eoCRC survivors.The DIRECt group highlighted areas with knowledge 
gaps that should be prioritized in future research efforts, including age at 
first screening for the general population, use of fecal immunochemical tests, 
chemotherapy, endoscopic therapy, and post-treatment surveillance for eoCRC 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The DIRECt group produced the first consensus recommendations on 
eoCRC. All statements should be considered together with the accompanying 
comments and literature reviews. We highlighted areas where research should be 
prioritized. These guidelines represent a useful tool for clinicians caring for 
patients with eoCRC."
1809,"A series of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) systems have been engineered for 
genome editing. The most widely used Cas9 is SpCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes 
and SaCas9 from Staphylococcus aureus. However, a comparison of their detailed 
gene editing outcomes is still lacking. By characterizing the editing outcomes 
of 11 sites in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and K562 cells, we 
found that SaCas9 could edit the genome with greater efficiency than SpCas9. We 
also compared the spacer lengths of single-guide RNA (sgRNA, 18-21 nt for SpCas9 
and 19-23 nt for SaCas9) and found that the optimal spacer lengths were 20 nt 
and 21 nt for SpCas9 and SaCas9, respectively. However, the optimal spacer size 
for a particular guide RNA ranged from 18-21 nt or 21-22 nt for SpCas9 and 
SaCas9, respectively. Furthermore, SpCas9 exhibited a more substantial bias than 
SaCas9 for nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) +1 insertion at the fourth 
nucleotide upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), characteristic of a 
staggered cut. Accordingly, editing with SaCas9 led to higher knock-in 
efficiencies of NHEJ-mediated double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (dsODN) 
insertion or adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) donor-mediated 
homology-directed repair (HDR). Finally, GUIDE-seq analysis revealed that SaCas9 
exhibited significantly reduced off-target effects compared with SpCas9. Our 
work indicates the superior performance of SaCas9 to SpCas9 in transgene 
integration-based therapeutic gene editing and the necessity to identify the 
optimal spacer length to achieve desired editing results."
1810,"Prediabetes affects 1 in 3 American adults and is characterized by insulin 
resistance, insulin hypersecretion, and impaired glucose tolerance. Weanling 
LEW.1WR1 (1WR1) rats have increased blood insulin concentrations, so we 
hypothesized that young adult 1WR1 rats would develop impaired glucose tolerance 
due to the poor regulation of insulin. We monitored glucose tolerance, insulin 
tolerance, and weight gain for 10 weeks to assess if there was a decline in 
glucose processing over time. 1WR1 rats were significantly more glucose 
intolerant after 8 weeks. 1WR1 rats had increased body mass, yet abdominal fat 
mass was not significantly increased. Although the 1WR1 rats had increased 
circulating insulin and glucagon protein levels, 1WR1 rat beta cell area was 
significantly reduced. There may be underlying insulin resistance as evidenced 
by dysfunctional insulin regulation during fasting. Understanding the metabolic 
phenotype of this rat model can provide insight into the human 
pathophysiological changes that increase susceptibility to glucose intolerance 
and prediabetes."
1811,"BACKGROUND: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive 
treatment option for intracranial tumors which are challenging to treat via 
traditional methods; however, its safety and efficacy are not yet well-validated 
in the literature.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the available evidence on the indications, adverse events 
(AEs) of LITT and progression-free (1Y-PFS) and overall survival (1Y-OS) in the 
treatment of primary and secondary brain tumors.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through the databases 
PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through October 2021. Comparative and 
descriptive studies, except for case reports, were included in the 
meta-analysis. Separate analyses by tumor type (high-grade gliomas, including 
WHO grade 4 astrocytomas [which include glioblastomas] as a specific subgroup; 
low-grade gliomas; and brain metastases) were conducted. Pooled effect sizes and 
their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated via random-effects models.
RESULTS: Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria, yielding 826 patients for 
meta-analysis. There were 829 lesions total of which 361 lesions were classified 
as high-grade gliomas, 116 as low-grade gliomas, 337 as metastatic brain tumors, 
and 15 as non-glial tumors. Indications for offering LITT included: 
deep/inaccessible tumor (12 studies), salvage therapy post-failed radiosurgery 
(9), failures of two or more treatment options (3), in pediatrics patients (4), 
patient preference (1); indications were non-specific in 12 studies. Pooled 
incidence of all (minor or major) procedure-related AEs was 30% (95% CI: 27-40%) 
for all tumors. Pooled incidence of neurological deficits (minor or major) was 
16% (12-22%); post-procedural edema 14% (8-22%); seizure 6% (4-9%); hematoma 20% 
(14-29%); deep vein thrombosis 19% (11-30%); hydrocephalus 8% (5-12%); and wound 
infection 5% (3-7%). 1Y-PFS was 18.6% (11.3-29.0%) in high-grade gliomas, 16.9% 
(11.6-24.0%) among the Grade 4 astrocytomas; and 51.2% (36.7-65.5%) in brain 
metastases. 1Y-OS was 43.0% (36.0-50.0%) among high-grade glioma, 45.9% (95% CI: 
37.9-54%) in Grade 4 astrocytomas; 93.0% (42.3-100%) for low-grade gliomas, and 
56.3% (47.0-65.3%) in brain metastases.
CONCLUSION: New neurological deficits and post-procedural edema were the most 
reported adverse events following LITT, albeit mostly transient. This 
meta-analysis provides the best statistical estimates of progression and 
survival outcomes based on currently available information. LITT is generally a 
safe procedure for selected patients, and future well-designed comparative 
studies on its outcomes versus the current standard-of-care should be performed."
1812,"BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) can be treated with conventional 
surgery or middle meningeal artery embolization (MMAE). The cost profiles of 
open surgery versus MMAE have never been studied.
OBJECTIVE: Comparing costs of surgical and MMAE treatment of cSDH.
METHODS: Patients treated with open surgery (2006-2019) and MMAE (2018-2020) 
were identified from the institutional database. Propensity score-matching 
analysis was used to assemble a balanced group of subjects. Detailed 
hospitalization costs in each group were collected and compared.
RESULTS: A total of 341 conventionally treated and 52 MMAE cases were 
identified. After propensity score matching, 33 patients in each group, in total 
66 patients were included for analysis. Direct procedural cost was significantly 
higher in MMAE group compared with open surgery group ($38255±$11859 vs 
$11206±$7888; P<0.001). Medication cost was also higher in the MMAE group 
($6888±$6525 vs $4291±$3547; P=0.048). No significant difference was found in 
costs for ICU care, pharmacy, therapy, labs and emergency unit. Imaging costs 
and other miscellaneous costs (e.g. wound care, pre-op and PACU) were higher in 
the open surgery group (P<0.05). Total hospitalization cost was not 
significantly different between the two groups ($60598±$61315 vs $71569±$37813 
for open surgery and MMAE respectively, P=0.385). No significant differences in 
number of follow ups or total costs for follow up were found (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Open surgery and MMAE offer an overall equivalent cost-profile for 
cSDH treatment when matching for potential cost confounders. Direct procedural 
costs are higher in MMAE; however, total hospitalization costs and follow up 
costs are not significantly different."
1813,"The early and massive vaccination campaign in Israel with the mRNA-LNP 
Comirnaty® (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus made available 
large amounts of data regarding the efficacy and safety of this vaccine. Adverse 
reactions to mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are rare events, but due to large 
mediatic coverage they became feared and acted as a potential source of delay 
for the vaccination of the Israeli population. The experience with the 
reactogenicity of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety of PEGylated liposomes, 
PEGylated proteins and other PEGylated drugs raised the fear that similar 
adverse effects can be associated with the PEG lipid which is an essential 
component of currently used mRNA-LNP vaccines against COVID-19. In this study we 
quantified the levels of anti-PEG IgG, IgM and IgE present in the blood of 79 
volunteers immediately before and 3 weeks after receiving a first dose of 
Comirnaty® vaccine. Our in vitro results show that different humanized anti-PEG 
antibodies bind the PEGylated nano-liposomes in a concentration-dependent 
manner, but they bind with a lower affinity to the Comirnaty vaccine, despite it 
having a high mole% of neutral PEG2000-lipid on its surface. We found an 
increase in IgG concentration in the blood 3 weeks after the first vaccine 
administration, but no increase in IgM or IgE. In addition, no severe signs of 
adverse reactions to the Comirnaty vaccine were observed in the population 
studied despite the significant pre-existing high titers of IgG before the first 
dose of vaccine in 2 donors."
1814,"The M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) is the major autoantigen of primary 
membranous nephropathy (MN). Despite many studies on B-cell epitopes recognized 
by antibodies, little is known about T-cell epitopes. Herein, we synthesized 123 
linear peptides, each consisting of 15-22 amino acids with 8-12 amino acid 
overlaps, across ten domains of PLA2R. Their binding capacity to risk 
(DRB1∗1501, DRB1∗0301) and protective (DRB1∗0901, DRB1∗0701) HLA molecules was 
then assessed by flow cytometry. Proliferation of CD4+ T cells from patients 
with anti-PLA2R positive MN was analyzed after peptide stimulation. Cytokines 
produced by activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured by 
cytometric bead arrays. We identified 17 PLA2R peptides that bound to both 
DRB1∗1501 and DRB1∗0301 molecules with high capacity. Some of these peptides 
showed decreased binding to heterozygous DRB1∗1501/0901 and DRB1∗0301/0701. Ten 
of the 17 peptides (CysR1, CysR10, CysR12, FnII-3, CTLD3-9, CTLD3-10, CTLD3-11, 
CTLD5-2-1, CTLD7-1 and CTLD7-2) induced significant proliferation of CD4+ T 
cells from patients with MN than cells from healthy individuals. Upon activation 
by these peptides, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with MN 
produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, predominantly IL-6, TNF-α, 
IL-10, IL-9 and IL-17. Thus, we mapped and identified ten peptides in the CysR, 
FnII, CTLD3, CTLD5, and CTLD7 domains of PLA2R as potential T-cell epitopes of 
MN. These findings are a first step towards developing peptide-specific 
immunotherapies."
1815,"Purpose: The present study aimed to examine the association between the stage of 
pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and the risk of fracture in postmenopausal 
women.Methods: A cross-sectional design was used, which included 133 women with 
POP over 50 years of age. The participants were classified according to their 
POP stage, underwent blood tests (hemogram, biochemistry, bone remodeling 
markers, and hormone tests), and completed a sociodemographic and lifestyle 
questionnaire along with densitometry, FRAX, and FRIDEX tests.Results: Of the 
133 women studied, 66 presented stages I-II POP (49.6%) and 67 III-IV POP 
(50.4%). The mean age of the participants was 64.47 years. Women with a high POP 
stage showed higher FRAX scores for major osteoporotic and hip fracture (p .001 
and p < .001p). Bivariate analysis revealed that higher scores on the FRIDEX 
scale were associated with a higher POP stage (p = .032). In addition, there was 
a marginally significant negative association between bone mineral density (BMD) 
and POP stage (p = .054).Conclusions: High-stage POP can be considered an 
independent predictor of osteoporotic fracture risk, as measured using the FRAX 
and FRIDEX scales."
1816,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the interplay between neutrophil 
heterogeneity in neonates in health and disease states. Olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4) 
marks a subset of neutrophils that have been described in adults and pediatric 
patients but not neonates, and this subset is thought to play a role in 
modulating the host inflammatory response.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of neonates who were born between June 
2020 and December 2021 at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center NICU. 
Olfactomedin-4-positive (OLFM4+) neutrophils were identified in the peripheral 
blood using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: OLFM4+ neutrophil percentage was not correlated with gestational age or 
developmental age. Neonates with sepsis had a higher percentage than those 
without the condition, 66.9% (IQR 24.3-76.9%) versus 21.5% (IQR 10.6-34.7%), 
respectively, p = 0.0003. At birth, a high percentage of OLFM4+ neutrophils was 
associated with severe chorioamnionitis at 49.1% (IQR 28.2-61.5%) compared to 
those without it at 13.7% (IQR 7.7-26.3%), p < 0.0001. Among neonates without 
sepsis, the percentages of OLFM4+ neutrophils were lower in the BPD/early death 
group compared to those without BPD, 11.8% (IQR 6.3-29.0%) versus 32.5% (IQR 
18.5-46.1%), p = 0.003, and this retained significance in a multiple logistic 
regression model that included gestational age, birthweight, and race.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study describing OLFM4+ neutrophils in neonates 
and it shows that this neutrophil subpopulation is not influenced by gestational 
age but is elevated in inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and severe 
chorioamnionitis, and lower percentage at birth is associated with developing 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia."
1817,"BACKGROUND: Both pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and cigarette smoke (CS) exposure 
may lead to lung damage. The potential impact of CS exposure on 
tuberculosis-associated lung damage and the disturbance of immune cells and 
mediators involved, need to be further elucidated.
METHODS: We firstly evaluated the chest X-ray (CXR) scores of a retrospective 
cohort of male patients with active PTB, followed for 6 months, and compared the 
scores between smoker (≥10 pack-years) and non-smoker patients. In a 
cross-sectional study, we measured the peripheral blood NK cell subsets and 
plasma inflammatory cytokines in male smoker and non-smoker patients with active 
PTB before anti-tuberculosis therapy, and the proportions of NK cell subsets and 
the levels of cytokines were analyzed for correlation with the CXR scores.
RESULTS: In the retrospective cohort, male smoker patients with active PTB 
showed a higher CXR score, characterized by more cavitary lesions, enlarged 
lymph nodes and emphysema, as compared to non-smokers. The cross-sectional study 
revealed that the CXR score in smoker patients was correlated inversely with the 
percentages of blood CD107a+, NKP46+, and TIGIT+ NK cells.
CONCLUSION: In patients with active PTB, CS exposure was associated with more 
severe lung lesions, which were correlated with peripheral NK cell subsets."
1818,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative mortality for oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma 
(OPSCC) with transoral robotic surgery (TORS) varies from 0.2% to 6.5% on 
trials; the real-world rate is unknown.
METHODS: NCDB study from 2010 to 2017 for patients with cT1-2N0-2M0 OPSCC with 
Charleson-Deyo score 0-1. Ninety-day mortality assessed from start and end of 
treatment at Commission on Cancer-accredited facilities.
RESULTS: 3639 patients were treated with TORS and 1937 with radiotherapy. TORS 
cohort had more women and higher income, was younger, more often treated at 
academic centers, and more likely to have private insurance (all p < 0.05). 
Ninety-day mortality was 1.3% with TORS and 0.7% or 1.4% from start or end of 
radiotherapy, respectively. From end of therapy, there was no significant 
difference on MVA between treatment modality.
CONCLUSIONS: There is minimal difference between 90-day mortality in patients 
treated with TORS or radiotherapy for early-stage OPSCC. While overall rates are 
low, for patients with expectation of cure, work is needed to identify optimal 
treatment."
1819,"OBJECTIVE: Robot-assisted rehabilitation training is an effective way to assist 
rehabilitation therapy. So far, various robotic devices have been developed for 
automatic training of central nervous system following injury. Multimodal 
stimulation such as visual and auditory stimulus and even virtual reality (VR) 
technology were usually introduced in these robotic devices to improve the 
effect of rehabilitation training. This may need to be explained from a 
neurological perspective, but there are few relevant studies.
APPROACH: In this study, ten participants performed right arm rehabilitation 
training tasks using an upper limb rehabilitation robotic device. The tasks were 
completed under four different feedback conditions including multiple 
combinations of visual and auditory components: auditory feedback (AF); visual 
feedback (VF); visual and auditory feedback (VAF); non-feedback (NonF). The 
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) devices record blood oxygen 
signals in bilateral motor, visual and auditory areas. Using hemoglobin 
concentration as an indicator of cortical activation, the effective connectivity 
of these regions was then calculated through Granger causality.
MAIN RESULTS: We found that overall stronger activation and effective 
connectivity between related brain regions were associated with VAF. When 
participants completed the training task without visual and auditory feedback, 
the trends in activation and connectivity were diminished.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed cerebral cortex activation and interacting 
networks of brain regions in robot-assisted rehabilitation training with 
multimodal stimulation, which is expected to provide indicators for further 
evaluation of the effect of rehabilitation training, and promote further 
exploration of the interaction network in the brain during a variety of external 
stimuli, and to explore the best sensory combination."
1820,"Purpura fulminans is a rare and rapidly progressive septic process characterized 
by the development of hemorrhagic and ecchymotic lesions and skin necrosis. In 
this work, we report a case of a 52-year-old woman admitted to the Department of 
Emergency due to progressive purpura. The physical examination demonstrated a 
decreased skin temperature, unpalpable dorsalis pedis arteries and ecchymoses 
covering both lower extremities. Laboratory tests indicated DIC with prolonged 
aPTT, low PT, elevated D-dimer levels and a low platelet count. A diagnosis of 
purpura fulminans was made, and steroids, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and 
empiric therapy, including antibiotic and anticoagulation therapy, were 
initiated immediately. Our treatment resulted in a good and sustained clinical 
response, as evidenced by the receding of blood blisters and the normalization 
of the patient's coagulation factors, but bilateral below-knee amputation was 
inevitable. Finally, the patient recovered well and was discharged home without 
any complications other than amputation."
1821,"The emergence and rapid development of single cell technologies marks a paradigm 
shift in cancer research. Various technology implementations represent powerful 
tools to understand cellular heterogeneity, identify minor cell populations that 
were previously hard to detect and define, and to make inferences about 
cell-to-cell interactions at single cell resolution. Applied to lymphoma, recent 
advances in single cell RNA sequencing have broadened opportunities to delineate 
previously underappreciated heterogeneity of malignant cell differentiation 
states and presumed cell of origin, and to describe the composition and cellular 
subsets in the ecosystem of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Clinical 
deployment of an expanding armamentarium of immunotherapy options that rely on 
targets and immune cell interactions in the TME, emphasizes the requirement for 
a deeper understanding of immune biology in lymphoma. In particular, classic 
Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) can serve as a study paradigm due to its unique TME, 
featuring infrequent tumor cells among numerous non-malignant immune cells with 
significant inter- and intra-patient variability. Synergistic to advances in 
single cell sequencing, multiplexed imaging techniques have added a new 
dimension to describing cellular crosstalk in various lymphoma entities. Here, 
we comprehensively review recent progress utilizing novel single cell 
technologies with an emphasis on TME biology of CHL as an application field. The 
described technologies, that are applicable to peripheral blood, fresh tissues 
and formalin-fixed samples, hold the promise to accelerate biomarker discovery 
for novel immunotherapeutic approaches, and to serve as future assay platforms 
for biomarker-informed treatment selection including immunotherapies."
1822,"Metabolic rewiring and cellular reprogramming are trademarks of neoplastic 
initiation and progression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Metabolic alteration 
in leukemia cells is often genotype-specific, with associated changes in 
epigenetic and functional factors resulting in the downstream upregulation or 
facilitation of oncogenic pathways. Targeting abnormal or disease-sustaining 
metabolic activities in AML provides a wide range of therapeutic opportunities, 
ideally with enhanced therapeutic windows and robust clinical efficacy. This 
review highlights the dysregulation of amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, and 
carbohydrate metabolism in AML, explores the role of key vitamins and enzymes 
that regulate these processes, and provides an overview of metabolism-directed 
therapies currently in use or development."
1823,"The central nervous system (CNS) is the most important site of extramedullary 
disease in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While CNS disease is 
identified only in a minority of patients at the time of diagnosis, subsequent 
CNS relapses (either isolated or concurrent with other sites) will occur in some 
patients, even after delivery of prophylactic therapy targeted to the CNS. 
Historically, prophylaxis against CNS disease has included intrathecal (IT) 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), although the latter is being used with 
decreasing frequency. Treatment of a CNS relapse usually involves intensive 
systemic therapy and cranial or craniospinal RT along with IT therapy, and 
consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). However, short- 
and long-term toxicities can make these interventions prohibitively risky, 
particularly for older adults. As new antibody-based immunotherapy agents have 
been approved for relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL, their use specifically in 
patients with CNS disease is an area of keen interest, both because of the 
potential for efficacy but also concerns of unique toxicity to the CNS. In this 
review, we discuss data-driven approaches for these common and challenging 
clinical scenarios, as well as highlight how recent findings potentially support 
the use of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for CNS disease."
1824,"Extensive studies in the last few decades have led to the establishment of CO as 
an endogenous signaling molecule and subsequently to the exploration of CO's 
therapeutic roles. In the current state, there is a critical conundrum in 
CO-related research: the extensive knowledge of CO's biological effects and yet 
an insufficient understanding of the quantitative correlations between the CO 
concentration and biological responses of various natures. This conundrum is 
partially due to the difficulty in examining precise concentration-response 
relationships of a gaseous molecule. Another reason is the need for appropriate 
tools for the sensitive detection and concentration determination of CO in the 
biological system. We herein report a new chemical approach to the design of 
fluorescent CO probes through de novo construction of fluorophores by a CO 
insertion-initiated lactamization reaction, which allows for ultra-low 
background and exclusivity in CO detection. Two series of CO detection probes 
have been designed and synthesized using this strategy. Using these probes, we 
have extensively demonstrated their utility in quantifying CO in blood, tissue, 
and cell culture and in cellular imaging of CO from exogenous and endogenous 
sources. The probes described will enable many biology and chemistry labs to 
study CO's functions in a concentration-dependent fashion with very high 
sensitivity and selectivity. The chemical and design principles described will 
also be applicable in designing fluorescent probes for other small molecules."
1825,"Soft and stretchable strain sensors have been attracting significant attention. 
However, the trade-off between the sensitivity (gauge factor) and the sensing 
range has been a major challenge. In this work, we report a soft stretchable 
resistive strain sensor with an unusual combination of high sensitivity, large 
sensing range, and high robustness. The sensor is made of a silver nanowire 
network embedded below the surface of an elastomeric matrix (e.g., 
poly(dimethylsiloxane)). Periodic mechanical cuts are applied to the top surface 
of the sensor, changing the current flow from uniformly across the sensor to 
along the conducting path defined by the open cracks. Both experiment and finite 
element analysis are conducted to study the effect of the slit depth, slit 
length, and pitch between the slits. The stretchable strain sensor can be 
integrated into wearable systems for monitoring physiological functions and body 
motions associated with different levels of strain, such as blood pressure and 
lower back health. Finally, a soft three-dimensional (3D) touch sensor that 
tracks both normal and shear stresses is developed for human-machine interfaces 
and tactile sensing for robotics."
1826,"PURPOSE: Infant and young childhood medulloblastoma (iMB) is usually treated 
without craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to avoid neurocognitive late effects. 
Unfortunately, many children relapse. The purpose of this study was to assess 
salvage strategies and prognostic features of patients with iMB who relapse 
after CSI-sparing therapy.
METHODS: We assembled a large international cohort of 380 patients with relapsed 
iMB, age younger than 6 years, and initially treated without CSI. Univariable 
and multivariable Cox models of postrelapse survival (PRS) were conducted for 
those treated with curative intent using propensity score analyses to account 
for confounding factors.
RESULTS: The 3-year PRS, for 294 patients treated with curative intent, was 
52.4% (95% CI, 46.4 to 58.3) with a median time to relapse from diagnosis of 11 
months. Molecular subgrouping was available for 150 patients treated with 
curative intent, and 3-year PRS for sonic hedgehog (SHH), group 4, and group 3 
were 60%, 84%, and 18% (P = .0187), respectively. In multivariable analysis, 
localized relapse (P = .0073), SHH molecular subgroup (P = .0103), CSI use after 
relapse (P = .0161), and age ≥ 36 months at initial diagnosis (P = .0494) were 
associated with improved survival. Most patients (73%) received salvage CSI, and 
although salvage chemotherapy was not significant in multivariable analysis, its 
use might be beneficial for a subset of children receiving salvage CSI < 35 Gy 
(P = .007).
CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of patients with relapsed iMB are salvaged 
after initial CSI-sparing approaches. Patients with SHH subgroup, localized 
relapse, older age at initial diagnosis, and those receiving salvage CSI show 
improved PRS. Future prospective studies should investigate optimal CSI doses 
and the role of salvage chemotherapy in this population."
1827,"PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer (PC) has an overall 5-year survival rate of 10%. The 
use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation is debated in resectable disease. The purpose 
of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of neoadjuvant 
chemoradiation followed by pancreaticoduodenectomy (NACRT) versus upfront 
pancreaticoduodenectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy (USR) in resectable PC.
METHODS: A decision tree model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
NACRT versus USR. Values from the published literature populate the tree: costs 
from Medicare (FY2021) reimbursements, and morbidity and survival data for 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Patients with resectable pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma who qualified for resection were included. The ICER was the 
primary outcome. The model was validated using one-way and two-way 
deterministic, as well as probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The base case was modeled using a 65-year-old male. NACRT yielded 1.61 
QALYs at $45,483.52 USD. USR yielded 1.47 QALYs at a discount of $6,840.96 USD. 
The ICER was $48,130 USD, which favors NACRT. One-way sensitivity analyses 
upheld these results except when ≤ 21.0% of NACRT patients proceeded to surgery 
and when ≤ 85.4% of NACRT patients were resectable at surgery. Two-way 
sensitivity analyses also favored NACRT except in cases when the proportion of 
resected disease after NACRT decreased. NACRT was favored in 94.3% of 100,000 
random-sampling simulations.
CONCLUSION: It is more cost-effective to administer NACRT before surgery for 
patients with resectable PC. On the basis of sensitivity analyses, USR with 
adjuvant therapy is only favored if rates of resection and eligibility for 
resection after NACRT decrease. NACRT should be considered in all patients 
unless there is an absolute contraindication."
1828,"PURPOSE: Epcoritamab is a subcutaneously administered CD3xCD20 T-cell-engaging, 
bispecific antibody that activates T cells, directing them to kill malignant 
CD20+ B cells. Single-agent epcoritamab previously demonstrated potent antitumor 
activity in dose escalation across B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the dose-expansion cohort of a phase I/II study 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03625037), adults with relapsed or refractory 
CD20+ large B-cell lymphoma and at least two prior therapy lines (including 
anti-CD20 therapies) received subcutaneous epcoritamab in 28-day cycles (once 
weekly step-up doses in weeks 1-3 of cycle 1, then full doses once weekly 
through cycle 3, once every 2 weeks in cycles 4-9, and once every 4 weeks in 
cycle 10 and thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The 
primary end point was overall response rate by the independent review committee.
RESULTS: As of January 31, 2022, 157 patients were treated (median age, 64 years 
[range, 20-83]; median of three [range, 2-11] prior therapy lines; primary 
refractory disease: 61.1%; prior chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell 
exposure: 38.9%). At a median follow-up of 10.7 months, the overall response 
rate was 63.1% (95% CI, 55.0 to 70.6) and the complete response rate was 38.9% 
(95% CI, 31.2 to 46.9). The median duration of response was 12.0 months (among 
complete responders: not reached). Overall and complete response rates were 
similar across key prespecified subgroups. The most common treatment-emergent 
adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (49.7%; grade 1 or 2: 47.1%; grade 
3: 2.5%), pyrexia (23.6%), and fatigue (22.9%). Immune effector cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 6.4% of patients with one fatal event.
CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous epcoritamab resulted in deep and durable responses and 
manageable safety in highly refractory patients with large B-cell lymphoma, 
including those with prior CAR T-cell exposure."
1829,"BACKGROUND: Due to intrinsic differences in data formatting, data structure, and 
underlying semantic information, the integration of imaging data with clinical 
data can be non-trivial. Optimal integration requires robust data fusion, i.e., 
the process of integrating multiple data sources to produce more useful 
information than captured by individual data sources. Here, we introduce the 
concept of fusion quality for deep learning problems involving imaging and 
clinical data. We first provide a general theoretical framework and numerical 
validation of our technique. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we then 
apply our technique to optimize the fusion of CT imaging and hepatic blood 
markers to estimate portal venous hypertension, which is linked to prognosis in 
patients with cirrhosis of the liver.
PURPOSE: Develop a method to measure optimal data fusion quality in deep 
learning problems utilizing both imaging data and clinical data.
METHODS: Our approach is based on modeling the fully connected layer (FCL) of a 
convolutional neural network (CNN) as a potential function whose distribution 
takes the form of the classical Gibbs measure. The features of the FCL are then 
modeled as random variables governed by state functions, which are interpreted 
as the different data sources to be fused. The probability density of each 
source, relative to the probability density of the FCL, represents a 
quantitative measure of source-bias. To minimize this source-bias and optimize 
CNN performance, we implement a vector-growing encoding scheme called positional 
encoding, where the low-dimensional blood markers are transcribed into a rich 
feature space that complements the high-dimensional imaging features. We first 
provide a numerical validation of our approach based on simulated Gaussian 
processes. We then applied our approach to patient data, where we optimized the 
fusion of CT images with blood markers to predict portal venous hypertension in 
patients with cirrhosis of the liver. This patient study was based on a modified 
ResNet-152 model that incorporates both images and blood markers as input. These 
two data sources were processed in parallel, fused into a single FCL, and 
optimized based on our fusion quality framework.
RESULTS: Numerical validation of our approach confirmed that the probability 
density function of a fused feature vector converges to a source-specific 
probability density function when source data are improperly fused. Our 
numerical results demonstrate that this phenomenon can be quantified as a 
measure of fusion quality. On patient data, the fused model consisting of both 
imaging data and positionally encoded blood markers at the theoretically optimal 
fusion quality metric achieved an AUC of 0.74 and an accuracy of 0.71. This 
model was statistically better than the imaging-only model (AUC = 0.60; accuracy 
= 0.62), the blood marker-only model (AUC = 0.58; accuracy = 0.60), and a 
variety of purposely sub-optimized fusion models (AUC = 0.61 - 0.70; accuracy = 
0.58 - 0.69).
CONCLUSIONS: We introduced the concept of data fusion quality for multi-source 
deep learning problems involving both imaging and clinical data. We provided a 
theoretical framework, numerical validation, and real-world application in 
abdominal radiology. Our data suggests that CT imaging and hepatic blood markers 
provide complementary diagnostic information when appropriately fused. This

with psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD) and depression. We 
aimed to evaluate the relationship between clinical specifiers of BD, mainly 
seasonal pattern (SP), and the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) variant of 
the PERIOD3 (PER3) gene (rs57875989) in BD patients by comparing genotype 
distributions with healthy controls considering clinical parameters.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A sample of 98 BD patients and 97 healthy volunteers were 
included in the study. The Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders 
(SCID-I) was administered to all participants. The patients were evaluated with 
some scales (Sociodemographic and Clinical Data Form, The Young Mania Rating 
Scale (YMRS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and The Clinical 
Global Impression Scale (CGI)) in terms of clinical features and symptom 
severity. Blood samples were obtained from participants to isolate their DNA. 
PCR-RFLP was used to determine the PER3 gene variant.
RESULTS: The PER3 genotype (4/4, 4/5, 5/5) distribution of BD was found to be 
significantly different from the control group. There was a statistically 
significant difference in the PER3 genotype distribution between BD patients 
with SP and BD patients without SP. Again, the PER3 allele (4, 5) distributions 
of BD patients with the SP were statistically different from the control group. 
The BD patients' PER3 genotype distributions with a family history of BD were 
significantly different from the BD patients without family history or control 
group.
CONCLUSION: It was found that the VNTR variant of the PER3 gene (rs57875989) may 
be associated with the SP and family history of BD as well as the BD itself. 
Further studies with the VNTR variant of the PER3 gene (rs57875989) in different 
ethnic populations are also required to determine these polymorphisms' exact 
role in BD."
1831,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the effects of Major Depressive 
Disorder (MDD) on monocyte counts, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and 
Monocyte to HDL ratios (MHR) among inflammatory markers.
METHOD: This is a retrospective case-control study. The case group of our study 
included 120 major depressive patients. The control group included 124 healthy 
individuals. The data were collected using a Personal Information Form, the 
Clinical Global Impression Scale, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The 
lipid profiles and complete blood count parameters of the case and control 
groups were tested and compared. The collected data were analyzed using the 
Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test and independent-samples t-test.
RESULTS: A significant increase in the monocyte and MHR values and a decrease in 
the HDL values of the case group were observed with older ages (p<0.01). In the 
case group, the MHR and monocyte count values were higher, and the HDL levels 
were lower in the MDD patients who had never received treatment in comparison to 
those who had received treatment. As the severity of depression increased, MHR 
levels also increased.
CONCLUSION: Our study is the first study to show that MHR is significantly 
higher in MDD patients than healthy controls. It was also shown that depression 
severity and MHR are positively correlated. Consequently, MHR might be a simple, 
practical, and low-cost parameter which shows inflammation in MDD patients."
1832,"The channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) farming industry is the largest and 
one of the oldest aquaculture industries in the United States. Despite being an 
established industry, production issues stemming from disease outbreaks remain 
problematic for producers. Supplementing fish diets with probiotics to enhance 
the immune system and growth potential is one approach to mitigating disease. 
Although considerable laboratory data demonstrate efficacy, these results do not 
always translate to natural modes of disease transmission. Hence, the present 
work was conducted in the laboratory but incorporated flow-through water from 
large catfish pond production systems, allowing for natural exposure to 
pathogens. Two feeding trials were conducted in an 18-tank aquaria system 
housing two different sizes, 34.8 ± 12.5 g and 0.36 ± 0.03 g, of channel 
catfish. Channel catfish in the first trial were fed three experimental diets 
over six weeks. Commercial diets were top-coated with two selected spore-forming 
Bacillus spp. probiotics, Bacillus velezensis AP193 (1 × 106 CFU g-1) and 
BiOWiSH (3.6 × 104 CFU g-1), or a basal diet that contained no dietary additive. 
In the second eight-week trial, diets were top-coated with BiOWiSH at three 
concentrations (1.8, 3.6, and 7.3 × 104 CFU g-1), along with one basal diet (no 
probiotic). At the completion of these studies, growth performance, survival, 
hematocrit, blood chemistry, and immune expression of interleukin 1β (il1β), 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-α), interleukin-8 (il8), transforming-growth 
factor β1 (tgf-β1), and toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) were evaluated using qPCR. 
Trial results revealed no differences (p &gt; 0.05) among treatments concerning 
growth, survival, or hematological parameters. For immune gene expression, 
interesting trends were discerned, with substantial downregulation observed in 
B. velezensis AP193-fed fish for il1β, tnf-α, and tlr9 expression within splenic 
tissue, compared to that of the basal and BiOWiSH diets (p &lt; 0.05). However, 
the results were not statistically significant for anterior kidney tissue in the 
first trial. In the second trial, varied levels of probiotic inclusion revealed 
no significant impact of BiOWiSH's products on the expression of il1β, tnf-α, 
il8, and tgf-β1 in both spleen and kidney tissue at any rate of probiotic 
inclusion (p &gt; 0.05). Based on these findings, more research on utilizing 
probiotics in flow-through systems with natural infection conditions is crucial 
to ensure consistency from a controlled laboratory scale to real-world 
practices."
1833,"The objectives of the present work were to evaluate the semen of dogs by means 
of proteomics methods and to compare with proteomics results of the blood of the 
animals, in order to increase available knowledge on the topic and present 
relevant reference values for semen samples. Semen samples were collected from 
five Beagle-breed dogs. Reproductive assessment of the animals by means of 
clinical, ultrasonographic and seminological examinations confirmed their 
reproductive health. The sperm-rich fraction and the prostatic fraction of semen 
were processed for proteomics evaluation. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by 
means of a LTQ Orbitrap Elite system. The technology combines high separation 
capacity and strong qualitative ability of proteins in biological samples that 
require deep proteome coverage. Protein classification was performed based on 
their functional annotations using Gene Ontology (GO). In blood plasma, semen 
sperm-rich fraction, and semen prostatic fraction, 59, 42 and 43 proteins, 
respectively, were detected. Two proteins were identified simultaneously in 
plasma and the semen sperm-rich fraction, 11 proteins in plasma and the semen 
prostatic fraction, and three proteins in the semen sperm-rich and prostatic 
fractions. In semen samples, most proteins were related to cell organization and 
biogenesis, metabolic processes or transport of ions and molecules. Most 
proteins were located in the cell membrane, the cytosol or the nucleus. Finally, 
most proteins performed functions related to binding or enzyme regulation. There 
were no differences between the semen sperm-rich fraction and prostatic 
fractions in terms of the clustering of proteins. In conclusion, a baseline 
reference for proteins in the semen of Beagle-breed dogs is provided. These 
proteins are involved mostly in supporting spermatozoan maturation, survival and 
motility, enhancing the reproductive performance of male animals. There appears 
potential for the proteomics examination of semen to become a tool in semen 
evaluation. This analysis may potentially identify biomarkers for reproductive 
disorders. This can be particularly useful in stud animals, also given its 
advantage as a non-invasive method."
1834,"The potential for sexually dimorphic innate immune responses to respiratory 
disease was evaluated, where eight steers and seven heifers (280 ± 4 kg) were 
subjected to a viral-bacterial respiratory disease challenge utilizing bovine 
herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1; intranasal; 1 × 108 PFU/nostril) and Mannheimia 
haemolytica (MH; intratracheal; 1.3 × 107 CFU/head) administered 72 h later. 
Body temperature was lesser in heifers than steers (p &lt; 0.01). There was a 
sex × time interaction (p = 0.05) for white blood cells where heifers had 
reduced concentrations compared with steers at -72 and 0 h but greater 
concentrations from 36 to 60 h post-MH. Concentrations of neutrophils were 
lesser in heifers compared to steers from 0 to 4 h, and from 8 to 12 h (p = 
0.03). Lymphocytes were greater in heifers compared to steers at 12 h and from 
36 to 60 h post-MH (p &lt; 0.01). The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was lesser in 
heifers compared to steers from 2 to 24 h and at 48 h post-MH (p &lt; 0.01). 
Monocytes were greater in heifers compared to steers from 24 to 60 h post-MH (p 
&lt; 0.01), while eosinophils were greater in heifers compared to steers at 48 
and 60 h (p &lt; 0.01). Serum IL-4 was lesser in heifers compared to steers at 0 
h and from 2 to 72 h post-MH challenge (p = 0.02). Non-esterified fatty acid 
concentrations were lesser (p &lt; 0.01) in heifers compared to steers from 2 to 
4 h post-MH challenge. Urea nitrogen concentrations were greater (p &lt; 0.01) 
in heifers than steers at 36 h post-MH challenge. Data from this study reveal 
distinct differences in the acute phase response following a respiratory disease 
challenge where steers produced an early response, while the response in heifers 
appeared to be delayed."
1835,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a potential treatment for many 
intestinal diseases. In dogs, FMT has been shown to have positive regulation 
effects in treating Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), canine parvovirus (CPV) enteritis, acute diarrhea (AD), and acute 
hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS). FMT involves transplanting the functional 
components of a donor's feces into the gastrointestinal tract of the recipient. 
The effective components of FMT not only include commensal bacteria, but also 
include viruses, fungi, bacterial metabolites, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) from 
the donor feces. By affecting microbiota and regulating host immunity, these 
components can help the recipient to restore their microbial community, improve 
their intestinal barrier, and induce anti-inflammation in their intestines, 
thereby affecting the development of diseases. In addition to the above 
components, mucin proteins and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) may be 
functional ingredients in FMT as well. In addition to the abovementioned 
indications, FMT is also thought to be useful in treating some other diseases in 
dogs. Consequently, when preparing FMT fecal material, it is important to 
preserve the functional components involved. Meanwhile, appropriate fecal 
material delivery methods should be chosen according to the mechanisms these 
components act by in FMT."
1836,"Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) is an approximately 2.8 kb circular 
single-stranded DNA virus known to cause infections in dogs. However, its 
incidence in Republic of Korea remains unknown. In this study, 135 dog fecal 
samples were collected to determine TTCaV infection status in Republic of Korea. 
Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, 13 of 135 (9.6%) dogs tested 
positive for TTCaV. Three full-length genome sequences (GenBank IDs: MZ503910, 
MZ503911, and MZ503912) were obtained from the positive specimens. Phylogenetic 
tree construction and sequence identity, similarity plot, and recombination 
analyses were performed using these three full-length genomic sequences. Among 
the three full-length genomes, MZ503912 was determined to be a recombinant virus 
based on analysis with the reference TTCaV strains. This novel virus strain 
might have been generated by recombination between TTCaV strain KX827768 
discovered in China and MZ503910 discovered in Republic of Korea. This is the 
first report to determine the incidence, genetic variation, and recombination of 
TTCaV in dogs in Republic of Korea. Further studies are needed to elucidate 
TTCaV pathogenesis in dogs."
1837,"Reproduction is believed to contribute to the frequently observed seasonal 
cycles in parasite loads in many organisms, as an investment in reproduction by 
the host could result in a higher susceptibility to parasites. In this study, we 
examined the impact of breeding season on haemosporidian infection in free-range 
chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). We sampled a total of 122 chickens (66 
chickens during the breeding season of April 2017 and 56 chickens during the 
non-breeding season of January 2017) to test for haemosporidian infections. The 
result showed that 56 out of 66 chickens examined during the breeding season 
tested positive for parasites (84.8% parasite prevalence), whereas 39 out of 56 
chickens tested positive for parasites during the non-breeding season (69.6% 
parasite prevalence). Moreover, among the 11 Leucocytozoon lineages and 2 
Plasmodium lineages identified, the parasite lineages that infected chickens 
during the breeding season were more diversified than those that affected 
chickens during the non-breeding season. This study indicated that chickens have 
a higher incidence of haemosporidian infection and a greater diversity of 
haemosporidian parasite lineages during the breeding season relative to the 
non-breeding season."
1838,"An 11-year-old castrated male Shih Tzu was referred for lethargy and melena. The 
hematocrit level was 18.8% (normal range: 36-56%), indicating severe anemia. 
Abdominal ultrasound revealed a round-to-oval-shaped mass in the stomach. 
Computed tomography (CT) revealed an intraluminal mass (17 × 12 × 15 mm) cranial 
to the pyloric antrum. After obtaining informed consent from the owner, 
exploratory laparotomy and subsequent gastrostomy were performed, showing an 
ulcerated mass potentially responsible for the severe anemia. A lump of hair was 
firmly attached to the ulcerated surface of the mass. After complete removal of 
the mass, the anemia resolved spontaneously. Histological examination revealed 
that the mass was a gastric hyperplastic polyp. At the 6-month follow-up, the 
dog was healthy with a normal hematocrit level. Gastric hyperplastic polyps are 
tumor-like lesions arising from the mucosal surface of the stomach, and 
projecting into the lumen. They can appear in any part of the stomach, and are 
usually found incidentally during gastric endoscopy or necropsy. The clinical 
signs include chronic occult blood loss, abdominal pain, and gastric tract 
obstruction. Gastric polyps causing acute blood loss anemia have rarely been 
reported in human medicine. To our knowledge, this is the first report 
describing a gastric hyperplastic polyp that caused severe anemia because of 
acute blood loss in a dog."
1839,"To determine the level of application and the effectiveness of the use of plant 
feed additives from sweet chestnut wood extract (Castanea Sativa Mill) in the 
diet of Cobb-500 cross broiler chickens, four groups were formed via the 
balanced groups method. The chickens in the experimental groups were 
supplemented with sweet chestnut wood extract in the main diet rather than a 
feed antibiotic at an amount of 500 g per ton of compound starter feed and 250 g 
per ton of grower and finisher in the second experimental group; 650 g per ton 
of compound starter feed and 325 g per ton of grower and finisher in the third 
experimental group; and 800 g per ton of compound starter feed and 400 g per ton 
of grower and finisher in the fourth experimental group. Supplementation with 
phytobiotics led to an increase in the digestibility of the dry matter in the 
second and third groups compared to the first experimental group. Furthermore, 
broiler chickens supplemented with a medium dose of phytobiotics revealed a 
significant difference in both crude protein and fiber when compared to the 
second experimental group (91.95% and 12.11% vs. 88.98% and 10.07%, 
respectively). The preslaughter weight of the birds in the phytobiotics 
supplemented groups was higher than in those fed with the lowest dosage of 
phytobiotic by 5.47%, and the difference was significant. There were no 
significant differences in terms of the blood biochemical parameters between the 
groups. In summary, the inclusion of plant feed additives from sweet chestnut 
wood extract as a substitute for an antibacterial drug in the diet of broiler 
chickens did not deteriorate the blood biochemical parameters and improved the 
intensity of the nutrient digestion process. As a result, it enhanced the 
quality indicators of the broiler carcass during the entire growth period."
1840,"A low reproductive rate coupled with human activities has endangered the giant 
panda, a species endemic to southwest China. Although giant pandas feed almost 
exclusively on bamboo, they retain carnivorous traits and suffer from 
carnivorous diseases. Additionally, their immune system is susceptible to aging, 
resulting in a reduced ability to respond to diseases. This study aimed to 
determine the genes and pathways expressed differentially with age in blood 
tissues. The differentially expressed genes in different age groups of giant 
pandas were identified by RNA-seq. The elderly giant pandas had many 
differentially expressed genes compared with the young group (3 years old), 
including 548 upregulated genes and 401 downregulated genes. Further, functional 
enrichment revealed that innate immune upregulation and adaptive immune 
downregulation were observed in the elderly giant pandas compared with the young 
giant pandas. Meanwhile, the immune genes in the elderly giant pandas changed 
considerably, including genes involved in innate immunity and adaptive immunity 
such as PLSCR1, CLEC7A, CCL5, CCR9, and EPAS1. Time series analysis found that 
giant pandas store glycogen by prioritizing fat metabolism at age 11, verifying 
changes in the immune system. The results reported in this study will provide a 
foundation for further research on disease prevention and the energy metabolism 
of giant pandas."
1841,"Avian Eimeria species vary in their replication location, fecundity, and 
pathogenicity. They are required to complete the development within the limited 
space of host intestines, and some synergistic or antagonistic effects occur 
among different Eimeria species. This study evaluated the impact of Eimeria 
mitis on the outcome of Eimeria necatrix or Eimeria tenella challenge infection. 
The severity of E. mitis/E. necatrix and E. mitis/E. tenella mixed infections 
were quantified by growth performance evaluation, survival rate analysis, lesion 
scoring, blood stool scoring, and oocyst output counting. The presence of E. 
mitis exacerbated the outcome of co-infection with E. tenella, causing high 
mortality, intestinal lesion score, and oocyst production. However, E. mitis/E. 
tenella co-infection had little impact on the body weight gain compared to 
individual E. tenella infection. In addition, the presence of E. mitis appeared 
not to enhance the pathogenicity of E. necatrix, although it tends to inhibit 
the growth of challenged birds and facilitate oocyst output and mortality in an 
E. mitis/E. necatrix co-infection model. Collectively, the results suggested a 
synergistic relationship between E. mitis and E. tenella/E. necatrix when 
sharing the same host. The presence of E. mitis contributed to disease pathology 
induced by E. tenella and might also advance the impact of E. necatrix in 
co-infections. These observations indicate the importance of accounting for 
differences in the relationships among different Eimeria species when using 
mixed infection models."
1842,"Several studies performed in humans have demonstrated that the onset of systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) represents a high risk condition to 
develop myocardial damage and arrhythmias. Therefore, we also hypothesized 
cardiac involment for dogs affected by SIRS. To assess this hypothesis, 24 dogs 
with a diagnosis of SIRS (13 entire males, 7 entire females, and 4 spayed 
females) with an age ranging from 4 to 11 years (mean 5.6 years) and an average 
weight of 24 kg (range from 5 to 47 kg) were enrolled. The dogs were divided 
into two groups according to their prognosis: Survivors (G1) and not survivors 
(G2), composed by 13 and 11 dogs, respectively. Moreover, healthy dogs were 
included as the control group (CTR). All the dogs with a history of cardiac or 
renal disease were excluded. At the inclusion, each patient underwent a physical 
examination and a complete cell count, and a biochemistry panel (including 
electrolyte profile) was performed; moreover, the blood cardiac Troponin I 
(cTnI) was measured. For each clinical variable indicative of SIRS, a score 
between 0 (absence) and 1 (presence) was applied. Furthermore, an 
electrocardiographic examination was recorded. Seventeen out of 24 (70.8%) dogs 
with SIRS showed arrhythmias, of which n. 6 belonged to the G1, while n. 11 
belonged to the G2. Most represented findings were sinus tachycardia (7/17; 
41.1%), followed by monomorphic premature ventricular beats (6/17; 35.3%), less 
common were first-degree atrioventricular block (2/17; 11.7%) and sinus 
bradycardia 1/17; 5.8%). Notably, in G1 dogs, only sinus tachycardia and 
premature ventricular beats were observed. G2 dogs presented a number of total 
and banded leukocytes significantly higher than those of G1 (p = 0.002 and 
0.049), in the same manner, the clinical score suggestive of SIRS (3 vs. 2.1) 
was significantly higher in G2 than in G1 dogs (p = 0.01). Moreover, a 
significantly higher value of cTnI was observed in the G2 group compared to the 
G1 group (p = 0.006). Data presented here suggested a cardiac involvement in 
dogs with SIRS, analogously to humans, that may significantly influence the 
patient's prognosis."
1843,"Aflatoxin can cross the blood-brain barrier, damage brain tissues, and have the 
potential to harm the development of the human brain. Although dietary aflatoxin 
exposure is common in children, there is a paucity of data on aflatoxin exposure 
and child developmental outcomes. The child's cognitive, motor, and language 
functions were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler 
Development-III or BSID-III at the same time points. Association between 
exposure to aflatoxin and subtests of BSID-III were examined using mixed-effect 
linear regression. Aflatoxin assays were performed on 194, 167, and 163 children 
at 15, 24, and 36 months of age, and chronic aflatoxin exposure was detected in 
20.6%, 16.8%, and 60.7% of children, respectively. Multi-variable analyses 
showed that aflatoxin exposure was independently related to the children's 
cognitive score (β: -0.69; 95% CI: -1.36, -0.02), receptive language score (β: 
-0.90; 95% CI: -1.62, -0.17), and expressive language score (β: -1.01; 95% CI: 
-1.96, -0.05). We did not observe any association between exposure to aflatoxin 
and the motor function of children. Chronic exposure to aflatoxin exposure was 
linked to reduced cognitive, expressive, and receptive language scores of the 
study children. Further research is needed in a different setting to confirm 
this novel finding."
1844,"The African viperid snake genera Atheris, Cerastes, and Proatheris are closely 
related, similar in size, but occupy extremely divergent ecological niches 
(arboreal in tropical rainforests, fossorial in deserts, and swamp-dwelling, 
respectively). Their venoms have not previously been subjected to comparative 
analyses for their action upon the coagulation of blood, most notably with 
significant data deficiencies from Atheris and Proatheris. In contrast, the 
closely related genus Echis is well-documented as capable of producing potent 
procoagulant effects. In light of this, we set out to compare the coagulotoxic 
actions of Atheris ceratophora, A. chlorechis, A. desaixi, A. nitschei, A. 
squamigera, C. cerastes, C. cerastes&amp;nbsp;gasperettii, C. vipera, and 
Proatheris superciliaris and explore potential pharmacological interventions to 
reestablish normal blood coagulation. All venoms displayed extremely potent 
procoagulant effects, over twice as fast as the most potent Echis reported to 
date. Although Cerastes is used in the immunising mixture of two different 
regionally available antivenoms (Inoserp-MENA with C. cerastes, C. 
cerastes&amp;nbsp;gasperettii, C. vipera and Saudi Arabian polyvalent with C. 
cerastes), none of the other species in this study are included in the 
immunising mixture of any antivenom. Notably, all the Cerastes species were only 
neutralised by the Inoserp-MENA antivenom. C. cerastes venom was not neutralised 
well by the Saudi Arabian antivenom, with the low levels of recognition for any 
of the Cerastes venoms suggesting a strong regional variation in the venom of 
this species, as the C. cerastes venom tested was of African (Tunisian) origin 
versus Saudi locality used in that antivenom's production. The other antivenoms 
(Micropharm EchiTAbG, ICP EchiTAb-Plus-ICP, Inosan Inoserp Pan-Africa, Premium 
Serums PANAF Sub-Sahara Africa, South African Vaccine Producers Echis, South 
African Vaccine Producers Polyvalent) all displayed trivial-to-no ability to 
neutralise the procoagulant toxicity of any of the Atheris, Cerastes, or 
Proatheris venoms. Comparative testing of the enzyme inhibitors DMPS, 
marimastat, and prinomastat, revealed a very potent neutralising capacity of 
marimastat, with prinomastat showing lower but still significant potency at the 
same molar concentration, while a 5× molar concentration of DMPS had no apparent 
effect on procoagulant venom effects normalized by the other inhibitors. These 
results and methods contribute to the body of knowledge of potential clinical 
effects and data necessary for evidence-based advancement of clinical management 
strategies."
1845,"Jellyfish stings can result in local tissue damage and systemic 
pathophysiological sequelae. Despite constant occurrences of jellyfish stings in 
oceans throughout the world, the toxinological assessment of these jellyfish 
envenomations has not been adequately reported in quantitative as well as in 
qualitative measurements. Herein, we have examined and compared the in vivo 
toxic effects and pathophysiologic alterations using experimental animal models 
for two representative stinging jellyfish classes, i.e., Cubozoa and Scyphozoa. 
For this study, mice were administered with venom extracts of either Carybdea 
brevipedalia (Cnidaria: Cubozoa) or Nemopilema nomurai (Cnidaria: Scyphozoa). 
From the intraperitoneal (IP) administration study, the median lethal doses 
leading to the deaths of mice 24 h post-treatment after (LD50) for C. 
brevipedalia venom (CbV) and N. nomurai venom (NnV) were 0.905 and 4.4697 mg/kg, 
respectively. The acute toxicity (i.e., lethality) of CbV was much higher with a 
significantly accelerated time to death value compared with those of NnV. The 
edematogenic activity induced by CbV was considerably (83.57/25 = 3.343-fold) 
greater than NnV. For the evaluation of their dermal toxicities, the epidermis, 
dermis, subcutaneous tissues, and skeletal muscles were evaluated 
toxinologically/histopathologically following the intradermal administration of 
the venoms. The minimal hemorrhagic doses (MHD) of the venoms were found to be 
55.6 and 83.4 μg/mouse for CbV and NnV, respectively. Furthermore, the CbV 
injection resulted in extensive alterations of mouse dermal tissues, including 
severe edema, and hemorrhagic/necrotic lesions, with the minimum necrotizing 
dose (MND) of 95.42 µg/kg body weight. The skin damaging effects of CbV appeared 
to be considerably greater, compared with those of NnV (MND = 177.99 µg/kg). The 
present results indicate that the toxicities and pathophysiologic effects of 
jellyfish venom extracts may vary from species to species. As predicted from the 
previous reports on these jellyfish envenomations, the crude venom extracts of 
C. brevipedalia exhibit much more potent toxicity than that of N. nomurai in the 
present study. These observations may contribute to our understanding of the 
toxicities of jellyfish venoms, as well as their mode of toxinological actions, 
which might be helpful for establishing the therapeutic strategies of jellyfish 
stings."
1846,"Ricin toxin is an agent of biodefense concern and we have been developing 
countermeasures for ricin threats. In doing so, we sought biomarkers of ricin 
toxicosis and found that in mice parenteral injection of ricin toxin causes 
profound hypoglycemia, in the absence of other clinical laboratory 
abnormalities. We now seek to identify the mechanisms underlying this 
hypoglycemia. Within the first hours following injection, while still 
normoglycemic, lymphopenia and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion were 
observed, particularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The cytokine response 
evolved over the next day into a complex storm of both pro- and 
anti-inflammatory cytokines. Evaluation of pancreatic function and histology 
demonstrated marked islet hypertrophy involving predominantly β-cells, but only 
mildly elevated levels of insulin secretion, and diminished hepatic insulin 
signaling. Drops in blood glucose were observed even after destruction of 
β-cells with streptozotocin. In the liver, we observed a rapid and persistent 
decrease in the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) RNA and protein 
levels, accompanied by a drop in glucose-6-phosphate and increase in glycogen. 
TNF-α has previously been reported to suppress G6Pase expression. In humans, a 
genetic deficiency of G6Pase results in glycogen storage disease, type-I 
(GSD-1), a hallmark of which is potentially fatal hypoglycemia."
1847,"India suffers the highest incidence of snakebite envenomation (SBE) in the 
world. Rural communities within India and other countries have long-held 
cultural beliefs surrounding snakes and SBE treatments, with snake statues 
present in numerous Hindu temples. While most cultural beliefs are well 
respected and do not affect anyone, some people worship live venomous snakes 
without any safety precautions. Moreover, they practice various inappropriate 
first aid and traditional treatments that exacerbate SBE-induced complications. 
We report an unusual case of SBE on the tongue of a patient who was bitten while 
worshipping Russell's viper following the advice of an astrologer based on the 
appearance of a snake in the patient's dream. Following the bite, the tongue was 
deeply incised by the priest as a first aid to mitigate SBE-induced 
complications. The patient suffered profuse bleeding and swelling of the tongue 
resulting in difficulties in intubating them. The patient regained consciousness 
after antivenom administration, intranasal ventilation, and blood removal from 
the mouth. The tongue underwent extensive surgery to restore movement and 
function. This report advises caution to those undertaking the extremely risky

and enforce policies to mitigate such actions and educate rural communities."
1848,"Hypoglycemia may be induced by a variety of physiologic and pathologic stimuli 
and can result in life-threatening consequences if untreated. However, 
hypoglycemia may also play a role in the purported health benefits of 
intermittent fasting and caloric restriction. Previously, we demonstrated that 
systemic administration of ricin toxin induced fatal hypoglycemia in mice. Here, 
we examine the metabolic landscape of the hypoglycemic state induced in the 
liver of mice by two different stimuli: systemic ricin administration and 
fasting. Each stimulus produced the same decrease in blood glucose and weight 
loss. The polar metabolome was studied using 1H NMR, quantifying 59 specific 
metabolites, and untargeted LC-MS on approximately 5000 features. Results were 
analyzed by multivariate analyses, using both principal component analysis (PCA) 
and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), to identify global 
metabolic patterns, and by univariate analyses (ANOVA) to assess individual 
metabolites. The results demonstrated that while there were some similarities in 
the responses to the two stimuli including decreased glucose, ADP, and 
glutathione, they elicited distinct metabolic states. The metabolite showing the 
greatest difference was O-phosphocholine, elevated in ricin-treated animals and 
known to be affected by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Another difference 
was the alternative fuel source utilized, with fasting-induced hypoglycemia 
primarily ketotic, while the response to ricin-induced hypoglycemia involves 
protein and amino acid catabolism."
1849,"The Usutu virus (USUV) has recently attracted the attention of scientists 
because of its rapid spread across Europe and its growth over the previous 
seasons in Italy. Here, we describe the first case of USUV infection in Asti, 
Piedmont region, Italy. The patient remained asymptomatic in the acute phase and 
during the early follow-up, despite a mild increase in liver enzymes. The prompt 
diagnosis in this patient was due to positive qualitative PCR for WNV 
blood-donor screening with negative RT-PCR of WNV and positive USUV-RNA 
following the confirmation test. Blood-donor screening and transmission risk 
monitoring are pivotal in following the spread of this Flavivirus in non-endemic 
countries, due to the high percentage of asymptomatic carriers."
1850,"The genus Borrelia encompasses spirochetal species that are part of three 
well-defined groups. Two of these groups contain pathogens that affect humans: 
the group causing Lyme disease (LDG) and the relapsing fever group (RFG). Lyme 
disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., which is distributed in the 
Northern Hemisphere, and relapsing fevers are caused by Borrelia spp., which are 
found in temperate and tropical countries and are an emerging but neglected 
pathogens. In some departments of Colombia, there are records of the presence of 
Borrelia sp. in humans and bats. However, little is known about the impact and 
circulation of Borrelia spp. in the country, especially in wildlife, which can 
act as a reservoir and/or amplifying host. In this context, the objective of our 
research was to detect and identify the Borrelia species present in wild mammals 
in the departments of Caldas and Risaralda in Colombia. For morphological 
detection, blood smears and organ imprints were performed, and molecular 
identification was carried out through a nested PCR directed on the flagellin B 
(flaB) gene. A total of 105 mammals belonging to three orders (Chiroptera, 
Didelphimorphia and Rodentia) were analyzed, of which 15.24% (n = 16) were 
positive for Borrelia. Molecularly, the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. in 
lung tissues of Thomasomys aureus and blood of Mus musculus (Rodentia) was 
detected, with 99.64 and 100% identity, respectively. Borrelia sp. genospecies 
from a clade branch of a bat-associated LDG sister group were identified in 
seven individuals of bat species, such as Artibeus lituratus, Carollia 
brevicauda, Sturnira erythromos, and Glossophaga soricina. Furthermore, two 
Borrelia genospecies from the RFG in seven individuals of bats (A. lituratus, 
Artibeus jamaicensis, Platyrrhinus helleri, Mesophylla macconnelli, 
Rhynchonycteris naso) and rodents (Coendou rufescens, Microryzomys altissimus) 
were documented. Additionally, the presence of a spirochete was detected by 
microscopy in the liver of a Sturnira erythromos bat specimen. These results 
contain the first molecular evidence of the presence of B. burgdorferi s.s. in 
South America, which merits the need for comprehensive studies involving 
arthropods and vertebrates (including humans) in other departments of Colombia, 
as well as neighboring countries, to understand the current status of the 
circulation of Borrelia spp. in South America."
1851,"The recombinant, modified leucine-rich repeat protein rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 has been 
suggested as a candidate for leptospiral vaccine development since it was 
predicted to be a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich repeat motifs 
and immunogenic epitopes. The immunogenic epitopes showed binding affinities 
with lower IC50 values than peptides of known antigenic proteins, e.g., LipL32. 
Moreover, this protein was immunoreactive with hyperimmune sera against several 
serovars. In this study, we aimed to develop a lateral flow strip test using the 
rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 protein for the detection of anti-leptospiral IgG in dogs. The 
lateral flow assay was performed with 184 dog plasma samples and evaluated with 
a culture method, 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rss) analysis real-time PCR, and 
LipL32 ELISA. The culture method failed to detect leptospires in the dog blood 
samples. Six of nine symptomatic dogs gave positive results with the real-time 
PCR assay. The lateral flow assay and LipL32 ELISA gave positive results with 59 
and 50 dogs, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 
rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 lateral flow strip test were 70.00, 82.09, and 78.80%, 
respectively, when compared with LipL32 ELISA. There was a significant 
association between the LipL32 ELISA and the rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 lateral flow 
assay. The rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 lateral flow strip test has therefore demonstrated 
a good potential to detect anti-leptospiral IgG in dogs."
1852,"Senegal is hyperendemic for dengue. Since 2017, outbreaks have been noticed 
annually in many regions around the country, marked by the co-circulation of 
DENV1-3. On 8 October 2021, a Dengue virus outbreak in the Rosso health post 
(sentinel site of the syndromic surveillance network) located in the north of 
the country was notified to the WHO Collaborating Center for arboviruses and 
hemorrhagic fever viruses at Institut Pasteur de Dakar. A multidisciplinary team 
was then sent for epidemiological and virologic investigations. This study 
describes the results from investigations during an outbreak in Senegal using a 
rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for the combined detection of dengue virus 
non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and IgM/IgG. For confirmation, samples were also 
tested by real-time RT-PCR and IgM ELISA at the reference lab in Dakar. qRT-PCR 
positive samples were subjected to whole genome sequencing using nanopore 
technology. Virologic analysis scored 102 positives cases (RT-PCR, NS1 antigen 
detection and/or IgM) out of 173 enrolled patients; interestingly, virus 
serotyping showed that the outbreak was caused by the DENV-1, a serotype 
different from DENV-2 involved during the outbreak in Rosso three years earlier, 
indicating a serotype replacement. Nearly all field-tested NS1 positives samples 
were confirmed by qRT-PCR with a concordance of 92.3%. Whole genome sequencing 
and phylogenetic analysis of strains suggested a re-introduction in Rosso of a 
DENV-1 strain different to the one responsible for the outbreak in the Louga 
area five years before. Findings call for improved dengue virus surveillance in 
Senegal, with a wide deployment of DENV antigenic tests, which allow easy 
on-site diagnosis of suspected cases and early detection of outbreaks. This work 
highlights the need for continuous monitoring of circulating serotypes which is 
crucial for a better understanding of viral epidemiology around the country."
1853,"Malaria is one of the deadliest tropical diseases, especially causing havoc in 
children under the age of five in Africa. Although the disease is treatable, the 
rapid development of drug resistant parasites against frontline drugs requires 
the search for novel antimalarials. In this study, we tested a series of 
organosulfur compounds from our internal library for their antiplasmodial effect 
against Plasmodium falciparum asexual and sexual blood stages. Some active 
compounds were also obtained in enantiomerically pure form and tested 
individually against asexual blood stages of the parasite to compare their 
activity. Out of the 23 tested compounds, 7 compounds (1, 2, 5, 9, 15, 16, and 
17) exhibited high antimalarial activity, with IC50 values in the range from 2.2 
± 0.64 to 5.2 ± 1.95 µM, while the other compounds showed moderate to very low 
activity. The most active compounds also exhibited high activity against the 
chloroquine-resistant strain, reduced gametocyte development and were not toxic 
to non-infected red blood cells and Hela cells, as well as the hematopoietic HEL 
cell line at concentrations below 50 µM. To determine if the enantiomers of the 
active compounds display different antimalarial activity, enantiomers of two of 
the active compounds were separated and their antimalarial activity compared. 
The results show a higher activity of the (-) enantiomers as compared to their 
(+) counterparts. Our combined data indicate that organosulfur compounds could 
be exploited as antimalarial drugs and enantiomers of the active compounds may 
represent a good starting point for the design of novel drugs to target malaria."
1854,"Methanol poisonings caused by drinking industrial alcohol remain a severe 
problem worldwide. Education on types of alcohol and their harmfulness and legal 
regulations limiting the industrial alcohol trade seem to be the keys to 
reducing the number of poisonings. Methanol distribution in different tissues 
after absorption is not well understood. This research aimed to quantify the 
methanol and formic acid distribution in body fluids and tissue material in 
post-mortem samples collected from 19 fatal victims of massive intoxication with 
industrial alcohol in the Silesia Region (Poland) who died between April and 
June 2022. The samples were analyzed using a gas chromatography-flame ionization 
detector (GC-FID), and correlation coefficients for methanol and formic acid 
were determined. The results show a wide distribution of methanol and formic 
acid in human post-mortem biological fluids (blood, urine, vitreous humor, bile, 
and cerebrospinal fluid) and tissues (muscle, kidney, liver, spleen, lung, and 
brain). The strongest correlation for methanol concentration in blood and body 
fluids/tissues was obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid (r = 0.997) and for 
formic acid in muscle tissue (r = 0.931). The obtained results may be a valuable 
tool in toxicological analysis and improve medical standards of early diagnosis 
and targeted treatment."
1855,"BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are human-made compounds 
with a widespread presence in human blood and other organs. PFAS have been 
associated with multiple health effects, including higher serum cholesterol and 
LDL cholesterol.
OBJECTIVE: Potential population differences in serum PFAS attributable to 
ezetimibe, a medication that inhibits cholesterol absorption, are of interest 
for several reasons. The ""C8"" Health Project survey data from six contaminated 
water districts in the mid-Ohio Valley of the United States provide a wide 
enough range of serum PFAS and a sufficient number of ezetimibe takers to 
explore this topic.
METHODS: A total of 44,126 adult participants of the C8 Health Survey were 
included in the community-based study. The status of taking (1075) or non-taking 
of ezetimibe, alone or in combination with another lipid-lowering agent, was 
acquired. The geometric mean serum concentrations of the four most commonly 
detected serum PFAS were compared based on the status of ezetimibe use.
RESULTS: There is no significant difference in serum concentrations of 
perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), 
perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) between 
ezetimibe users and non-users after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), cigarette smoking, education, and 
average household income.
CONCLUSION: The sterol absorption-inhibiting medication ezetimibe does not 
appear to affect serum PFAS concentrations. We sought but did not find direct 
evidence that ezetimibe could inhibit PFAS uptake nor inferential evidence that 
inter-individual differences in sterol absorption could provide a confounding 
factor explanation for the association of serum total- and LDL-cholesterol with 
serum PFAS."
1856,"Lead (Pb) is one of the toxins responsible for the deterioration of ecological 
health in aquatic environments. The present study investigated the effects of 
Pb(NO3)2 toxicity on growth, blood cell morphology, and the histopathology of 
gills, liver, and intestine of juvenile Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. A 
30-day long aquarium trial was conducted by assigning three treatment groups T1 
5.20 mg L-1, T2 10.40 mg L-1, and T3 20.80 mg L-1, and a control 0 mg L-1 
following the 96 h LC50 of 51.96 mg L-1 from acute toxicity test. Overall growth 
performance significantly declined in all the Pb(NO3)2 treated groups and the 
highest mortality was recorded in T3. Behavioural abnormalities were intense in 
all the treatment groups compared to the control. Hepatosomatic index (HSI) 
values were reported as higher in treatment groups. Reduced nucleus diameter and 
nuclei size in erythrocytes were reported for T2 and T3 groups. Dose-dependent 
histological alterations were visible in the gills, liver, and intestine of all 
the Pb(NO3)2 treated groups. The width of the intestinal villi was highly 
extended in T3 showing signs of severe histological alterations. In conclusion, 
Pb toxicity causes a negative effect on growth performance, erythrocyte 
morphology, and affected the vital organs histomorphology of juvenile O. 
niloticus."
1857,"The Mongolian economy is supported by rich deposits of natural resources, such 
as copper, coal, and gold. However, the risk of heavy metal pollution to 
livestock and human have been recently discussed. This research collected 
various samples from soil and animal (sheep, goat, horse, cow, and camel), blood 
and organs (kidney and liver) in the Mongolian countryside. These samples were 
processed, and the concentration of metals was quantified using inductively 
coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP/MS). As previously reported, arsenic was 
found at high levels of accumulation in soil. Selenium is another concern, as 
median concentration in one area exceeded the maximum allowable level. Cadmium 
and selenium were found to be highly accumulated in animal kidney. This research 
revealed the current pollution level in Mongolia based on evaluation of soil and 
animals. The concentration in animals could not indicate that animals had severe 
effects because of heavy metal exposure. However, kidney is eaten in Mongolia, 
and so there is a direct connection to human health, and this research suggested 
the possible risks posed by each edible animal. In particular, evaluation of 
metals in livestock is rare in Mongolia. This result can contribute to animal 
and human health in Mongolian communities."
1858,"Air pollution risk factor on human health was surpassed only by high blood 
pressure, tobacco use and poor diet. Total number of deaths due to air pollution 
worldwide was estimated to 6.67 million people in 2019. In the European Union, 
97% of the urban population is exposed to levels of fine particulate matter 
above the latest guideline levels set by the World Health Organization. Air 
pollution accounts for 20% of newborn deaths worldwide, most related to 
complications of low birth weight and preterm birth. Low birth weight and 
preterm birth are responsible for 1.8 million deaths worldwide. Bucharest is the 
capital city of Romania and one of the most polluted cities in Europe, ranking 
in the 9th position out of 96 of the top cities from Europe and in the 4th 
position out of 32 of the top cities in Eastern Europe, data from June 2022. The 
aim of this study was to measure the real time level of indoor particulate 
pollution levels in different indoor environments from Bucharest, during the 
pandemic period. The PM2.5/PM10 ratio and its rate of change were also 
determined for the measured data. The PM2.5/PM10 ratio and its rate of change 
were also calculated based on the measurement data. The PM2.5/PM10 ratio showed 
an upward trend on weekends compared to weekdays, suggesting a relationship with 
outdoor PM where leisure activities and traffic infiltrated the indoors. The 
fluctuation range of the PM2.5/PM10 ratio was 0.44~0.95, and low measured values 
were detected on weekdays. Of the seasons, the proportion of particulate in 
autumn and its rate of change tended to be higher than in summer. It was 
suggested that outdoor air may have permeated the room. In addition, the 
relationship was considered, such as it is a holiday period, there are few rainy 
days, the concentration of coarse particles is high, and the number of residents 
in the city decreases. When it comes to indoor air quality, the higher this 
ratio, the more serious the air pollution. PM10 concentrations decreased by 
29.1% in the absence of human activity and increased by 35.1% in the presence of 
humans. PM2.5 concentration decreased by 30.3% without human activity and 
increased by 3.1% with the presence of humans. Certain trends were suggested for 
the resumption of human activity and an increase in PM2.5 concentrations. The 
average relative difference between October 2021, a pandemic period, and October 
2022, a post pandemic period, was 64% for PM10 and 47% for PM2.5. The pandemic 
period brought a significantly better indoor air quality from the particulate 
pollution point of view."
1859,"Stimulants belonging to the amphetamine group nowadays pose an undeniable 
worldwide threat to the life and health of users. Intoxications of domestic 
animals also occur, which can either be accidental or related to intentional 
human action. This study presents the first ever reported case of a simultaneous 
amphetamine and methamphetamine intoxication of a cat, along with the results of 
toxicological studies. Blood, urine, vitreous humor and liver were collected 
during the cat's autopsy and analyzed by UHPLC─QqQ─MS/MS. The sample preparation 
technique was based on one-step precipitation of proteins with cold 
acetonitrile. The determined amphetamine concentrations in the collected 
biological materials were 93.4 ng/mL in blood, 496.6 ng/mL in urine, 589.2 ng/mL 
in the vitreous humor and 291.2 ng/g in liver, respectively. Methamphetamine 
concentrations were 45.5 ng/mL in blood, 263.1 ng/mL in urine, 351.2 ng/mL in 
vitreous humor, and 97.7 ng/g in liver. Other substances were also found in the 
biological material, i.e., diazepam, oxazepam and nordiazepam. Cases of 
intentional or accidental poisoning of pets with psychoactive substances are a 
serious problem, carrying the risk to the health and life of the animal. 
Therefore, it is important to increase awareness of the high risk of poisoning 
of domestic animals, as well as to learn about the incompletely understood 
mechanisms of pharmacokinetics of various drugs in animals, including cats."
1860,"As the single cell lining of the heart and all blood vessels, the vascular 
endothelium serves a critical role in maintaining homeostasis via control of 
vascular tone, immune cell recruitment, and macromolecular transit. For victims 
of acute high-dose radiation exposure, damage to the vascular endothelium may 
exacerbate the pathogenesis of acute and delayed multi-organ radiation 
toxicities. While commonalities exist between radiation-induced endothelial 
dysfunction in radiosensitive organs, the vascular endothelium is known to be 
highly heterogeneous as it is required to serve tissue and organ specific roles. 
In keeping with its organ and tissue specific functionality, the molecular and 
cellular response of the endothelium to radiation injury varies by organ. 
Therefore, in the development of medical countermeasures for multi-organ injury, 
it is necessary to consider organ and tissue-specific endothelial responses to 
both injury and candidate mitigators. The purpose of this review is to summarize 
the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction following total or near total body 
irradiation exposure at the level of individual radiosensitive organs."
1861,"This paper contributes to the ecotoxicological risk assessment of the Actellic 
50 EC insecticide (with 50% pirimiphos-methyl as the active substance) tested on 
non-target organisms. The insecticide concentrations tested were the same for 
all organisms (0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 mg L-1 of Actellic 50 EC), with an exposure 
of 3-5-21 days for plants and 4-5-14 days for animals. The non-target organisms 
tested were both plants (wheat and two ferns) and animals (the Prussian carp and 
marsh frog tadpoles). The tested insecticide significantly inhibited the growth 
of roots in wheat, a result that was also confirmed by a microbiotest 
application (62% root growth inhibition in sorghum and 100% germination 
inhibition in white mustard and garden cress). In ferns, even for the lowest 
concentration, the percentage of germinated spores was inhibited by 40% for 
Asplenium scolopendrium. The recorded toxicological effects of Actellic 50 EC 
upon the Prussian carp included a decrease in the respiratory rate and oxygen 
consumption, an increase in the number of erythrocytes and leukocytes, and an 
increase in blood glucose levels. The highest concentration (0.1 mg L-1 of 
Actellic 50 EC) caused a 50% decrease in the survival rate of marsh frog 
tadpoles after 5 days of exposure, negatively affecting body volume and length. 
Given the high degree of toxicity of the insecticide Actellic 50 EC, we 
recommend continuing investigations on non-target species, including both plants 
and animals, as the sub-chronic effects are quite little known in the scientific 
literature."
1862,"Cyfluthrin, a typical type II pyrethroid pesticide, is widely used in house 
hygiene and agricultural pest control. Several epidemiological investigations 
have found that maternal pyrethroid exposure is connected to adverse pregnancy 
outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Thus, we 
evaluated the effect of cyfluthrin exposure during pregnancy on placenta 
development in vivo. In the current study, Pregnant SD rats were randomly 
divided into four groups and administered 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg/kg body weight 
cyfluthrin or an equivalent volume of corn oil by gavage from GD0 to GD19. The 
results have shown that gestational exposure to cyfluthrin exerted no effect on 
the fetal birth defect, survival to PND4, or fetal resorption and death. 
However, live fetuses and implantation sites significantly decreased in the 
high-dose cyfluthrin-treated group. Moreover, a significant reduction in 
placenta weight and diameter was observed in rats. Correspondingly, the fetal 
weight and crown-rump length from dams exposed to cyfluthrin were reduced. 
Cyfluthrin-treat groups, the total area of the placenta, spongiotrophoblast 
area, and labyrinth area had abnormal changes. Meanwhile, the area of blood 
sinusoid and CD34-positive blood vessel numbers in the placenta were 
considerably reduced, as well as abnormal expression of placental pro-angiogenic 
and anti-angiogenic factors in dams exposed to cyfluthrin. Further observation 
by transmission electron microscopy revealed significant changes in the 
ultrastructure of the medium-dose and high-dose groups. Additional experiments 
showed gestational exposure to cyfluthrin inhibited proliferation and induced 
apoptosis of placentas, as decreased PCNA-positive cells and increased 
TUNEL-positive cells. Furthermore, western blot and qPCR analysis revealed that 
gestational exposure to medium-dose and high-dose cyfluthrin increased the 
expression of GRP78, and three downstream mRNA and proteins (p-eIF2α, ATF4, and 
CHOP) of the PERK signaling, indicating that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress-mediated PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway in rat placentas was 
activated. Our study demonstrated that gestational exposure to cyfluthrin leads 
to placental developmental disorder, which might be associated with ER 
stress-mediated PERK signaling pathway."
1863,"The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is one of the most commercially 
sought-after freshwater fish species and one of the most farmed in the world. On 
the other hand, aquaculture breeding frequently results in outbreaks of 
infectious diseases and pests, and compromises the production and welfare of 
fish. Arthrospira platensis (known as ""Spirulina"") has been used as a supplement 
in diets to enhance fish welfare in recent years because of its beneficial 
properties. This study aimed to assess the possible protective effects of 
Arthrospira platensis on rainbow trout specimens exposed to three different 
doses of the toxicant CdCl2. The experiment was carried out using five 
experimental treatments of 40 individuals each: control group; group II (0.2 mg 
CdCl2 per kg of commercial fish feed); group III (0.2 mg Kg-1 of CdCl2 plus 2.5 
g per kg of A. platensis); group IV (0.2 mg Kg-1 of CdCl2 plus 5 g per kg of A. 
platensis); group V (0.2 mg Kg-1 of CdCl2 plus 10 g per kg of A. platensis). 
During the experiment, dietary supplementation of A. platensis normalized all 
serum and blood parameters altered by the presence of CdCl2. A. platensis also 
had a protective effect on markers of oxidative stress."
1864,"The oral intake of alcohol has become a widespread concern due to its high risk 
to body health. Therefore, our purpose in this study was to reveal the 
antioxidant efficacies of natural Commiphora myrrha on hepatotoxicity and 
oxidative stress induced by ethanol in adult male rats, especially because these 
were not adequately revealed by previous studies. We examined the impacts of C. 
myrrha in male Sprague Dawley rats orally treated with C. myrrha (500 mg/kg) 
alone or in combination with 40% ethanol (3 g/kg), daily for 30 days. The 
results showed that treatment with C. myrrha after the oral consumption of 
ethanol caused a reduction in serum liver function parameters (alanine 
transferases, aspartate transaminase, and total bilirubin), hepatic tumor 
markers (α-L-flucosidase and arginase), and hepatic lipid peroxidation indicator 
(thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), as well as a slight restoration (not 
significant) in the levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced 
glutathione; and total antioxidant capacity. In addition, it alleviated 
histopathological changes in the liver, as revealed by decreased areas of 
inflammatory infiltrate, milder necrosis, and noticeably reduced periportal 
fibrosis and hemorrhage. The therapeutic efficiency of C. myrrha could be due to 
its rich sesquiterpenoids content which possesses anti-inflammatory properties 
and ROS-scavenging activities. Our findings provide evidence that the 
attenuation of oxidative stress by C. myrrha enables hepatic tissue to suppress 
inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms, resulting in enhanced liver structure and 
function. Therefore, C. myrrha extract shows promise as a protective and 
therapeutic supplement against toxic agents."
1865,"Tobacco/nicotine is one of the most toxic and addictive substances and continues 
to pose a significant threat to global public health. The harmful effects of 
smoking/nicotine affect every system in the human body. Nicotine has been 
associated with effects on endocrine homeostasis in humans such as the imbalance 
of gonadal steroid hormones, adrenal corticosteroid hormones, and thyroid 
hormones. The present study was conducted to characterize the structural binding 
interactions of nicotine and its three important metabolites, cotinine, 
trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, and 5'-hydroxycotinine, against circulatory hormone 
carrier proteins, i.e., sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), 
corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). 
Nicotine and its metabolites formed nonbonded contacts and/or hydrogen bonds 
with amino acid residues of the carrier proteins. For SHBG, Phe-67 and Met-139 
were the most important amino acid residues for nicotine ligand binding showing 
the maximum number of interactions and maximum loss in ASA. For CBG, Trp-371 and 
Asn-264 were the most important amino acid residues, and for TBG, Ser-23, 
Leu-269, Lys-270, Asn-273, and Arg-381 were the most important amino acid 
residues. Most of the amino acid residues of carrier proteins interacting with 
nicotine ligands showed a commonality with the interacting residues for the 
native ligands of the proteins. Taken together, the results suggested that 
nicotine and its three metabolites competed with native ligands for binding to 
their carrier proteins. Thus, nicotine and its three metabolites may potentially 
interfere with the binding of testosterone, estradiol, cortisol, progesterone, 
thyroxine, and triiodothyronine to their carrier proteins and result in the 
disbalance of their transport and homeostasis in the blood circulation."
1866,"The aim of this study was, first of all, to associate the mercury (Hg) 
concentrations and respiratory functions of the gold miners in the artisanal 
small-scale gold mining (ASGM) environment in San Martín de Loba, Colombia. We 
carried out a cross-sectional study using a survey whereby we collected basic 
demographic information, occupational medical history, and applied two validated 
questionnaires (Q16 and SF36). We measured Hg levels in all volunteers using 
direct thermal decomposition-atomic absorption spectrometry. Univariate and 
bivariate statistical analyses were carried out for all variables, performing 
logistic regression to assess the effect of ASGM on health outcomes. Volunteers 
enrolled (n = 124) were between the ages of 20 and 84 years (84% miners and 79% 
males). No changes were found in the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood 
pressure, and heart rate from the ASGM miners, in crude and adjusted statistical 
analyses. ASGM miners increased 8.91 (95% confidence interval, 1.55-95.70) times 
the risk of having these than of having neurotoxic effects. Concentrations of 
total whole blood mercury (T-Hg) in all participants ranged from 0.6 to 82.5 
with a median of 6.0 μg/L. Miners had higher T-Hg concentrations than non-miners 
(p-value = 0.011). Normal and abnormal respiratory spirometry patterns showed 
significant differences with the physical role and physical function of 
quality-of-life scales (the (p-value was 0.012 and 0.004, respectively). The 
spirometry test was carried out in 87 male miners, with 25% of these miners 
reporting abnormalities. Out of these, 73% presented a restrictive spirometry 
pattern, and 27%, an obstructive spirometry pattern. The ASGM population had 
higher Hg concentrations and worse neurotoxic symptomatology than non-miners of 
the same community."
1867,"To contribute new information to the pyrethroid pesticide α-cypermethrin 
toxicity profile, we evaluated its effects after oral administration to Wistar 
rats at daily doses of 2.186, 0.015, 0.157, and 0.786 mg/kg bw for 28 days. 
Evaluations were performed using markers of oxidative stress, cholinesterase 
(ChE) activities, and levels of primary DNA damage in plasma/whole blood and 
liver, kidney, and brain tissue. Consecutive exposure to α-cypermethrin affected 
the kidney, liver, and brain weight of rats. A significant increase in 
concentration of the thiobarbituric acid reactive species was observed in the 
brain, accompanied by a significant increase in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 
activity. An increase in GPx activity was also observed in the liver of all 
α-cypermethrin-treated groups, while GPx activity in the blood was significantly 
lower than in controls. A decrease in ChE activities was observed in the kidney 
and liver. Treatment with α-cypermethrin induced DNA damage in the studied cell 
types at almost all of the applied doses, indicating the highest susceptibility 
in the brain. The present study showed that, even at very low doses, exposure to 
α-cypermethrin exerts genotoxic effects and sets in motion the antioxidative 
mechanisms of cell defense, indicating the potential hazards posed by this 
insecticide."
1868,"RATIONALE: There are a lack of outcome measures with robust clinimetric 
properties in bronchiectasis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinimetric properties (reliability over one year 
during clinical stability and responsiveness over a course of antibiotics for 
pulmonary exacerbation) of objective and patient-reported outcome measures.
METHODS: This multi-centre cohort study included adults with bronchiectasis from 
seven UK hospitals. Participants attended four visits, four months apart over 
one year while clinically stable and at the beginning/end of exacerbation and 
completed lung function (spirometry and multiple breath washout), provided a 
blood sample for C-reactive protein measurement and completed health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires (Quality of Life-Bronchiectasis (QoL-B), 
St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and EuroQoL (EQ-5D-5L).
RESULTS: Participants (n=132) had a mean (SD) age of 66 (11) years, 64% were 
female. Lung function parameters (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), 
lung clearance index (LCI2.5)) were reliable over time (coefficient of variation 
(CV):<10%). With regards to responsiveness, FEV1 demonstrated better properties 
than LCI, therefore a clear justification for use of LCI in future trials is 
needed. CRP was less reliable (CV>20%) over time than FEV1 and LCI2.5 and whilst 
CRP had a large mean change between the start and end of an exacerbation, this 
may have been driven by a small number of patients having a large change in CRP. 
Reliability of HRQoL questionnaires/ questionnaire domains ranged from 
acceptable (CV:20-30%) to good (CV:10-20%) and HRQoL were responsive to 
treatment of exacerbations. Considering the specific questionnaire domain 
relevant to the intervention and its associated clinimetric properties is 
important. Additional statistics will support future power/sample-size analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This information on the clinimetric properties of lung function 
parameters, CRP and HRQoL parameters should be used to inform the choice of 
outcome measures used in future bronchiectasis trials."
1869,"The differentiation of splenic tissue from malignant lesions via imaging may be 
challenging, particularly considering aberrant or accessory lesions and diseases 
that are rarely encountered. Functioning splenic tissue can be identified using 
technetium-99m red blood cell (99mTc-RBC) scintigraphy, but its sensitivity is 
limited and may not be available. We present the case of a patient in whom 
disseminated abdomino-pelvic splenosis was diagnosed using PET/CT with 
gallium-68-oxine-labeled RBCs. The method represents a feasible and probably 
superior alternative to splenic scintigraphy."
1870,"Exposure to aristolochic acid (AA) is of increased concern due to carcinogenic 
and nephrotoxic effects, and incidence of aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) is 
increasing. This study characterizes renal alterations during the acute phase of 
AAN using parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An AAN and a control 
group of male Wistar rats received administration of aristolochic acid I (AAI) 
and polyethylene glycol (PEG), respectively, for six days. Both groups underwent 
MRI before and 2, 4 and 6 days after AAI or PEG administration. T2 relaxation 
times and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were determined for four renal 
layers. Serum creatinine levels (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were 
measured. Tubular injury scores (TIS) were evaluated based on histologic 
findings. Increased T2 values were detected since day 2 in the AAN group, but 
decreased ADCs and increased sCr levels and BUN were not detected until day 4. 
Significant linear correlations were observed between T2 of the cortex and the 
outer stripe of outer medulla and TIS. Our results demonstrate that parametric 
MRI facilitates early detection of renal injury induced by AAI in a rat model. 
T2 mapping may be a valuable tool for assessing kidney injury during the acute 
phase of AAN."
1871,"BACKGROUND: Noncontrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) features are promising 
markers for acute hematoma expansion (HE) in patients with intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH). It remains unclear whether accurate identification of these 
markers is also reliable in raters with different levels of experience.
METHODS: Patients with acute spontaneous ICH admitted at four tertiary centers 
in Germany and Italy were retrospectively included from January 2017 to June 
2020. In total, nine NCCT markers were rated by one radiology resident, one 
radiology fellow, and one neuroradiology fellow with different levels experience 
in ICH imaging. Interrater reliabilities of the resident and radiology fellow 
were evaluated by calculated Cohen's kappa (κ) statistics in reference to the 
neuroradiology fellow who was referred as the gold standard. Gold-standard 
ratings were evaluated by calculated interrater κ statistics. Global interrater 
reliabilities were evaluated by calculated Fleiss kappa statistics across all 
three readers. A comparison of receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) was 
used to evaluate differences in the diagnostic accuracy for predicting acute 
hematoma expansion (HE) among the raters.
RESULTS: Substantial-to-almost-perfect interrater concordance was found for the 
resident with interrater Cohen's kappa from 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.81) to 0.96 (95% 
CI 0.94-0.98). The interrater Cohen's kappa for the radiology fellow was 
moderate to almost perfect and ranged from 0.58 (95% CI 0.52-0.65) to 94 (95% CI 
92-0.97). The intrarater gold-standard Cohen's kappa was almost perfect and 
ranged from 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.90) to 0.98 (95% CI 0.78-0.90). The global 
interrater Fleiss kappa ranged from 0.62 (95%CI 0.57-0.66) to 0.93 (95%CI 
0.89-0.97). The diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of acute hematoma 
expansion (HE) was different for the island sign and fluid sign, with p-values 
&lt; 0.05.
CONCLUSION: The NCCT markers had a substantial-to-almost-perfect interrater 
agreement among raters with different levels of experience. Differences in the 
diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of acute HE were found in two out of nine 
NCCT markers. The study highlights the promising utility of NCCT markers for 
acute HE prediction."
1872,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer represents a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, with the 
highest frequency and mortality in both sexes combined. In a clinical scenario 
characterized by the widespread of multidetector-row spiral CT, core-needle 
biopsy under tomographic guidance is one of the main and safest methods to 
obtain tissue specimens, even though there are relatively high rates of 
pneumothorax (0-60% incidence) and pulmonary hemorrhage (4-27% occurrence 
rates). The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy 
of CT-guided core-needle biopsy in the diagnosis of primary lung malignancies 
and to compare our results with evidence from the literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our analysis included 350 thoracic biopsies, performed 
from 2017 to 2022 with a 64-row CT guidance and 16/18 G needles mounted on a 
biopsy gun. We included in the final cohort all samples with evidence of primary 
lung malignancies, precursor lesions, and atypia, as well as inconclusive and 
negative diagnoses.
RESULTS: There was sensitivity of 90.07% (95% CI 86.05-93.25%), accuracy of 
98.87% (95% CI 98.12-99.69%), positive predictive value of 100%, and negative 
value of 98.74% (95% CI 98.23-99.10%). Specificity settled at 100% (93.84-100%). 
The AUC was 0.952 (95% CI 0.924-0.972). Only three patients experienced major 
complications after the procedure. Among minor complications, longer distances 
from the pleura, the presence of emphysema, and the lower dimensions of the 
lesions were correlated with the development of pneumothorax after the 
procedure, while longer distances from the pleura and the lower dimensions of 
the lesions were correlated with intra-alveolar hemorrhage. Immunohistochemistry 
analysis was performed in 51% of true positive cases, showing TTF-1, CK7, and 
p40 expression, respectively, in 26%, 24%, and 10% of analyzed samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The CT-guided thoracic core-needle biopsy is an extremely accurate 
and safe diagnostic procedure for the histological diagnosis of lung cancer, a 
first-level interventional radiology exam for peripheral and subpleural lesions 
of the lung, which is also able to provide adequate samples for advanced 
pathologic assays (e.g., FISH, PCR) to assess molecular activity and genetic 
sequencing."
1873,"Pulsation of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) produces intercranial pressure (ICP) 
waves. The aim of this study is to determine if externally modifying ICP 
pulsatility alters parenchymal blood flow pulsatility. A cardiac-gated 
inflatable device was inserted in the lateral epidural space of 12 anaesthetized 
canines (canis familiaris) and used to cause reduction, inversion and 
augmentation of the ICP pulse. CBF in each hemisphere was measured using laser 
doppler velocimetry. A significant increase in both mean CBF and its amplitude 
was observed for reduction as well as inversion of the ICP pulse, with larger 
changes observed for the inversion protocol. Significant increases in the mean 
CBF were also observed ipsilaterally for the augmentation protocol, together 
with indications of reduction contralaterally. External alteration of the ICP 
pulse thus caused significant changes in parenchymal blood flow pulsatility. The 
inverse relationship between the ICP and CBF amplitude suggests the changes did 
not occur via modification of the intracranial Windkessel mechanism. Thus, the 
effects likely occurred in the low-pressure vessels, i.e., capillaries and/or 
venules, rather than the high pressure arteries. Future MRI studies are however 
required to map and quantify the effects on global cerebral blood flow."
1874,"PURPOSE: This study sought to determine if high sodium (HS) intake in salt 
resistant (SR) individuals attenuates upper limb arterial dilation in response 
to reactive (occlusion) and active (exercise) hyperemia, two stimuli with 
varying vasodilatory mechanisms, and the role of oxidative stress in this 
response.
METHODS: Ten young, SR participants (9 Males, 1 Female) consumed a 7-day HS 
(6,900 milligrams/day) and a 7-day recommended sodium intake (RI: 2,300 
milligrams/day) diet in a randomized order. On the last day of each diet, 
brachial artery (BA) function was evaluated via reactive (RH-FMD: 5 minutes of 
cuff occlusion) and active (handgrip (HG) exercise) hyperemia after consumption 
of both placebo (PL) and antioxidants (AO).
RESULTS: The HS diet significantly elevated sodium excretion (p < 0.05), but 
mean arterial blood pressure was unchanged. During the PL condition, the HS diet 
significantly reduced RH-FMD when compared to RI diet (p = 0.01), but this 
reduction was significantly restored (p = 0.01) when supplemented with AO 
(HS+PL: 5.9 ± 3.4; HS+AO: 8.2 ± 2.7; RI+PL: 8.9 ± 4.7; RI+AO: 7.0 ± 2.1 %). BA 
shear-to-dilation slopes, evaluated across all HG exercise workloads, were not 
significantly different across sodium intervention or AO supplementation.
CONCLUSION: In SR individuals, HS intake impaired BA function when assessed via 
RH-FMD, but was restored with acute AO consumption suggesting oxidative stress 
as a contributor to this dysfunction. However, exercise-induced BA dilation was 
unaltered, potentially implicating an inability of HS intake to influence the 
mechanisms responsible for effectively maintaining skeletal muscle perfusion 
during exercise."
1875,"PURPOSE: The rectus femoris has three myotendinous or myoaponeurosis junctions 
and causes three types of muscle strain anatomically. We aimed to investigate 
the anatomical injury site of the rectus femoris muscle strain in professional 
soccer players as well as the characteristic findings on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and to evaluate its relationship with the time taken to return to 
play at competition levels.
METHODS: Thirteen Japanese professional soccer players who sustained injuries to 
the rectus femoris were included in this study. The mechanism of injury, 
anatomical injury site, severity, absence of hematomas, and time taken to return 
to competition were evaluated.
RESULTS: Ten patients were injured while kicking and three while sprinting. The 
anatomical injury site was the origin aponeurosis in two cases, intramuscular 
tendon in eight cases, and distal aponeurosis in three cases. The severity was 
one-degree in three cases and two-degree in 10 cases. Hematomas were observed in 
five cases. Cases with injuries caused by sprinting, two-degree injuries, or 
clear hematomas were associated with significantly longer periods of return to 
play than the other cases. Additionally, patients with distal aponeurosis-type 
injuries tended to take a long time to return to the competition.
CONCLUSIONS: In rectus femoris muscle strain, it is important to evaluate the 
anatomical injury site, severity, and absence of hematomas on MRI. Not only the 
injury mechanism, a clear hematoma, and high severity but also distal 
aponeurosis injuries may be associated with long periods of return to play at 
competition levels."
1876,"Few studies in the literature have illustrated cold hypoalgesia induced by 
strength training. Objectives of this contribution were to compare the ratings 
of perceived pain in endurance running (n = 22) and powerlifting (n = 22) male 
athletes and controls (n = 22) at baseline and after two bouts of 40 min 
aerobic/strength training respectively, using the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) and 
simultaneously monitoring changes in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and 
body temperature. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to examine the 
effects of training sessions in endurance runners vs. powerlifting athletes vs. 
controls on the intensity of perceived pain at CPT. A statistically significant 
two-way interaction between the group and training resulted in p &lt; 0.001, ηp2 
= 0.513. A simple main effects analysis showed that as the participants went 
through the strength training session, pain perception at CPT was significantly 
lower in powerlifters compared to runners and controls. Considering the 
physiological parameters, powerlifters reported significantly higher values of 
BP and HR. This difference was present at baseline but after training as well, 
and before and after CPT, despite a slight hypotensive effect. The differences 
reported after CPT at baseline, but very significantly after the strength 
activation session in the powerlifters, provide interesting insights into the 
hypoalgesic effect of high-intensity strength training."
1877,"BACKGROUND: Modern pentathlon includes horse riding, fencing, swimming, shooting 
and cross-country running. Events can last many hours during which the athletes 
face almost maximal energy and physiological demands, and fatigue. Early 
recognition and prevention of injuries and overuse syndromes can be achieved by 
refining the individual training loads. The purpose of the study was to 
determine which parameter could be the most accurate predictor of swimming 
working capacity determinants in pentathletes.
METHODS: Fourteen male pentathletes performed a continuous maximal incremental 
test in the swimming flume ergometer to measure peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), 
and five swimming tests in a 50 m swimming pool to detect critical velocity 
(CV); velocity at 2 and 4 mM·L-1 of blood lactate (v2, v4) and energy cost (EC).
RESULTS: The 200 m swimming time was 2:18-2:32 m:s (340 FINA points). CV was 
1.21 ± 0.04 m·s-1, v2 was 1.14 ± 0.09 and v4 1.23 ± 0.08 m·s-1. VO2peak was 
3540.1 ± 306.2 mL·min-1 or 48.8 ± 4.6 mL·kg-1·min-1. EC at 1.24 m·s-1 was 45.7 ± 
2.4 mL·kg-1·min-1. Our main finding was the large correlation of CV with 200 m 
swimming performance; Conclusions: Among all the protocols analysed, CV is the 
most predictive and discriminative of individual swimming performance in this 
group of pentathletes. It appears as the most suitable test to constantly refine 
their swimming training loads for both performance enhancement and health 
promotion."
1878,"This study analyzed the acute effects of heavy strength training on mechanical, 
hemodynamic, metabolic, and psychophysiological responses in adult males. 
Thirteen recreational level males (23.3 ± 1.5 years) randomly performed two 
heavy strength training sessions (3 sets of 8 repetitions at 80% of one 
repetition maximum [1RM]) using the bench press (HST-BP) or full squat 
(HST-FS)). The repetition velocity was recorded in both sessions. Moreover, 
before and after the sessions, the velocity attained against the ~1.00 m·s-1 
load (V1Load) in the HST-BP, countermovement jump (CMJ) height in the HST-FS, 
blood pressure, heart rate, blood lactate, and psychophysiological responses 
(OMNI Perceived Exertion Scale for Resistance Exercise) were measured. There 
were differences between exercises in the number of repetitions performed in the 
first and third sets (both &lt;8 repetitions). The velocity loss was higher in 
the HST-BP than in the HST-FS (50.8 ± 10.0% vs. 30.7 ± 9.5%; p &lt; 0.001). 
However, the mechanical fatigue (V1Load vs. CMJ height) and the 
psychophysiological response did not differ between sessions (p &gt; 0.05). The 
HST-FS caused higher blood pressure and heart rate responses than the HST-BP (p 
&lt; 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively) and greater blood lactate changes from 
pre-training to post-set 1 (p &lt; 0.05). These results showed that the number 
of maximal repetitions performed in both sessions was lower than the target 
number and decreased across sets. Moreover, the HST-BP caused a higher velocity 
loss than the HST-FS. Finally, the HST-FS elicited higher hemodynamic and 
metabolic demand than the HST-BP."
1879,"Concussion diagnosis is difficult and may be improved with the addition of a 
blood-based biomarker that indicates concussion. The purpose of this research 
was to investigate the capability of serum amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), 
neurofilament light (NfL), and visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) to distinguish 
athletes who were diagnosed with a concussion pitch-side. An observational 
cross-sectional study design was used to replicate sideline concussion 
diagnosis. Subjects included mutually exclusive pre-match (n = 9), post-match (n 
= 15), and SRC (n = 7) groups. Six paired pre-and post-match subjects were 
analyzed for APP. APP increased significantly from pre-match (mean = 57.98 
pg·mL-1, SD = 63.21 pg·mL-1) to post-match (mean = 111.37 pg·mL-1, SD = 106.89 
pg·mL-1, p = 0.048) in the paired subjects. NfL was lower in the SRC group 
(median = 8.71 pg·mL-1, IQR = 6.09 pg·mL-1) compared to the post-match group 
(median = 29.60 pg·mL-1, IQR = 57.45 pg·mL-1, p &lt; 0.001). VILIP-1 was higher 
in the post-match group (median = 212.18 pg·mL-1, IQR = 345.00 pg·mL-1) compared 
to both the pre-match (median = 32.63 pg·mL-1, IQR = 52.24 pg·mL-1), p = 0.001) 
and SRC (median = 30.21 pg·mL-1, IQR = 47.20 pg·mL-1), p = 0.003) groups. APP, 
NfL, and VILIP-1 were all able to distinguish between pre-match and post-match 
groups (AUROC &gt; 0.700) but not from the SRC group (AUROC &lt; 0.660). Our 
results show that APP, NfL, and VILIP-1 were not helpful in differentiating 
concussed from non-concussed athletes pitch-side in this study."
1880,"The purpose of this investigation was to examine the interrelationship between 
time spent underwater (UW), movement frequency and accompanying blood acid base 
balance response. Elite artistic swimmers (n = 6) participated in the 
investigation and were all familiar with the testing procedures. All athletes 
completed the same choreographed artistic swimming routine. The routine was 
videoed and the number of movements during each 'lap' of the routine counted. 
Fingertip capillary blood samples were collected prior to the routine 60 sec 
post routine for pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), partial pressure 
of oxygen (pO2), bicarbonate (HCO3-) and potassium (K+). and lactate (La) 
concentration (mmol/L). On a separate day an incremental exercise test to 
exhaustion was performed on a cycle ergometer for determination of maximal 
oxygen uptake (VO2max). Over half the routine was performed underwater (56 ± 
4%). Aside from pCO2 (-1.07 ± 12.29%, p = 0.686), there were significant changes 
in all variables measured from the BG analysis. VO2peak was significantly 
correlated to total UW of the routine (r = -0.93; p = 0.007). as well as ∆PO2 r 
= 0.47 and ∆HCO3 r = 0.51. There was also a significant correlation between 
total UW and post routine pCO2 (r = 0.86; p = 0.030). There was also a 
significant correlation between total movements during the routine and post pO2 
(r = -0.83; p = 0.044). These data show UW in combination with movement rate 
during a AS routine imfluence the metabolic response to the exercise. In 
addition, VO2max represents an important performance variable influencing AS 
performance."
1881,"Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans infection is 
the most common cause of death in HIV/AIDS patients. Macrophages are pivotal for 
the regulation of immune responses to cryptococcal infection by either playing 
protective function or facilitating fungal dissemination. However, the 
mechanisms underlying macrophage responses to C. neoformans remain unclear. To 
analyze the transcriptomic changes and identify the pathogenic factors of 
macrophages, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of alveolar 
macrophage responses during C. neoformans infection. Alveolar macrophages 
isolated from C. neoformans-infected mice showed dynamic gene expression 
patterns, with expression change from a protective M1 (classically 
activated)-like to a pathogenic M2 (alternatively activated)-like phenotype. 
Arg1, the gene encoding the enzyme arginase 1, was found as the most upregulated 
gene in alveolar macrophages during the chronic infection phase. The in vitro 
inhibition of arginase activity resulted in a reduction of cryptococcal 
phagocytosis, intracellular growth, and proliferation, coupled with an altered 
macrophage response from pathogenic M2 to a protective M1 phenotype. In an 
in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier, macrophage-derived arginase was found 
to be required for C. neoformans invasion of brain microvascular endothelium. 
Further analysis of the degree of virulence indicated a positive correlation 
between arginase 1 expression in macrophages and cryptococcal brain 
dissemination in vivo. Thus, our data suggest that a dynamic macrophage 
activation that involves arginase expression may contribute to the cryptococcal 
disease by promoting cryptococcal growth, proliferation, and the invasion to the 
brain endothelium."
1882,"In this study, we investigated the effects of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
SND1-IT1 on human microglia (HMC3 cells) delivered by intracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH)-derived exosomes (ICH-exos) as well as a competitive endogenous RNA 
(ceRNA) network. Exosomes obtained from ICH plasma were characterized by 
nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 
and western blot. RNA sequencing was performed to study the lncRNA transcriptome 
from ICH-exos and the healthy control-derived exosomes (HC-exos) and 
differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) were identified. HMC3 cells were 
treated with ICH-exos or transfected with pcDNA3.1-SND1-IT1, and then cell 
viability and apoptosis were measured. The ceRNA network (lncRNA 
SND1-IT1/miR-124-3p/messenger RNA MTF1) was chosen for further investigation. 
NTA, TEM, and western blot showed that exosomes were successfully separated and 
could be absorbed by HMC3 cells. The expression of lncRNA SND1-IT1 in ICH-exos 
was significantly higher than that of HC-exos (p < 0.05). In addition, lncRNA 
SND1-IT1 overexpression and ICH-exos significantly inhibited cell viability and 
enhanced apoptosis. A total of 162 DE-lncRNAs were identified by sequencing, and 
a ceRNA network was constructed. The dual-luciferase reporter gene indicated 
that lncRNA SND1-IT1, miR-124-3p, and MTF1 interacted with each other. Cell 
experiments showed that lncRNA SND1-IT1 affected the growth of HMC3 cells 
through miR-124-3p/MTF1. In conclusion, ICH-exos delivered lncRNA SND1-IT1 to 
HMC3 cells, and exosomal lncRNA SND1-IT1 can regulate cell viability and 
apoptosis to influence HMC3 cell growth via the SND1-IT1/miR-124-3p/MTF1 axis."
1883,"Transparency in animals is a complex form of camouflage involving mechanisms 
that reduce light scattering and absorption throughout the organism. In 
vertebrates, attaining transparency is difficult because their circulatory 
system is full of red blood cells (RBCs) that strongly attenuate light. Here, we 
document how glassfrogs overcome this challenge by concealing these cells from 
view. Using photoacoustic imaging to track RBCs in vivo, we show that resting 
glassfrogs increase transparency two- to threefold by removing ~89% of their 
RBCs from circulation and packing them within their liver. Vertebrate 
transparency thus requires both see-through tissues and active mechanisms that 
""clear"" respiratory pigments from these tissues. Furthermore, glassfrogs' 
ability to regulate the location, density, and packing of RBCs without clotting 
offers insight in metabolic, hemodynamic, and blood-clot research."

1885,"Patient-centric sampling strategies, where the patient performs self-sampling 
and ships the sample to a centralized laboratory for readout, are on the verge 
of widespread adaptation. However, the key to a successful patient-centric 
workflow is user-friendliness, with few noncritical user interactions, and 
simple, ideally biohazard-free shipment. Here, we present a capillary-driven 
microfluidic device designed to perform the critical biomarker capturing step of 
a multiplexed immunoassay at the time of sample collection. On-chip sample 
drying enables biohazard-free shipment and allows us to make use of advanced 
analytics of specialized laboratories that offer the needed analytical 
sensitivity, reliability, and affordability. Using C-Reactive Protein, MCP1, 
S100B, IGFBP1, and IL6 as model blood biomarkers, we demonstrate the 
multiplexing capability and applicability of the device to a patient-centric 
workflow. The presented quantification of a biomarker panel opens up new 
possibilities for e-doctor and e-health applications."
1886,"OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) use by 
dermatologists previously trained on a novel handheld, chip-based ultrasound 
device (HHUD) to screen for early psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
METHODS: Twelve dermatologists were recruited to screen psoriasis patients for 
PsA using the novel HHUD in one major hospital in Bonn (Germany) and six private 
practices in surrounding regions. Patient screening was based on medical 
history, clinical examination, and the GEPARD questionnaire paired with an MSUS 
examination of up to three painful joints. All screened patients were then 
referred to rheumatologists, who determined the final diagnosis. The screening 
effect of MSUS was assessed according to its sensitivity and specificity before 
and after its application.
RESULTS: Between October 1 2020 and May 26 2021, a total of 140 psoriasis 
patients with arthralgia participated in this study. PsA was diagnosed in 19 
(13.6%) cases. Before applying MSUS, dermatologists' screening sensitivity and 
specificity were recorded as 88.2% and 54.4%, respectively, while after applying 
MSUS the sensitivity and specificity changed to 70.6% and 90.4%, respectively. 
MSUS led to a change of PsA suspicion in 46 cases, with PsA no longer being 
suspected in 45 of them.
CONCLUSION: This study was able to demonstrate that PsA screening using MSUS by 
previously trained dermatologists can lead to more precise PsA detection and 
potentially decreased rheumatologist referral rates."
1887,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the 
efficacy and safety of evening primrose (EP) for facilitation of parturition in 
peripartum persons.
METHODS: This search sought records related to the efficacy and safety of EP 
preparations to facilitate parturition. Eligibility criteria were primary 
literature with efficacy or safety outcomes reported; studied in peripartum 
persons; and available in English. Records were excluded if they were available 
as abstracts only. Data was synthesized by study characteristics, patient 
demographics, and outcomes. The RoB2 and ROBINS-I were used to assess risk of 
bias.
RESULTS: A total of 11 studies met inclusion criteria: seven randomized 
placebo-controlled trials, one randomized non placebo-controlled trial, one case 
study, one observational retrospective study, and one quasi-experimental 
cross-sectional study. Efficacy outcomes included Bishop scores and duration of 
labor during the different phases. Reported adverse events were generally mild 
and included increased blood pressure, decreased heart rate, pain, bleeding, 
nausea, and vomiting. Important risks of bias exist across the literature 
reviewed.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of EP for parturition in peripartum individuals is not 
recommended. Further research is warranted before use during parturition or the 
peripartum period. Other: The authors deny conflicts of interest. The study was 
neither registered nor funded."
1888,"PURPOSE: Previous studies suggest that the endothelial glycocalyx adds to 
vascular resistance, inhibits thrombosis, and is critical for regulating 
homogeneous blood flow and ensuring uniform red blood cell (RBC) distribution. 
However, these functions and consequences of the glycocalyx have not been 
examined in the retina. We hypothesize that the endothelial glycocalyx is a 
critical regulator of retinal hemodynamics and perfusion and decreases the 
propensity for retinal thrombus formation.
METHODS: Hyaluronidase and heparinase, which are endothelial 
glycocalyx-degrading enzymes, were infused into mice. Fluorescein 
isothiocyanate-dextran (2000 kDa) was injected to measure lumen diameter, while 
RBC velocity and distribution were measured using fluorescently labeled RBCs. 
The diameters and velocities were used to calculate retinal blood flow and shear 
rates. Mean circulation time was calculated by measuring the difference between 
arteriolar and venular mean transit times. Rose Bengal dye was infused, followed 
by illumination with a green light to induce thrombosis.
RESULTS: The acute infusion of hyaluronidase and heparinase led to significant 
increases in both arteriolar (7%) and venular (16%) diameters in the retina, 
with a tendency towards increased arteriolar velocity. In addition, the 
degradation caused a significant decrease in the venular shear rate (14%). The 
enzyme infusion resulted in substantial increases in total retinal blood flow 
(26%) and retinal microhematocrit but no changes in the mean circulation time 
through the retina. We also observed an enhanced propensity for retinal thrombus 
formation with the removal of the glycocalyx.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that acute degradation of the glycocalyx can cause 
significant changes in retinal hemodynamics, with increases in vessel diameter, 
blood flow, microhematocrit, pro-thrombotic conditions, and decreases in venular 
shear rate."
1889,"The regenerative repair of segmental bone defect (SBD) is an urgent problem in 
the field of orthopedics. Rapid induction of angiogenesis and osteoinductivity 
after implantation of scaffold is critical. In this study, a unique tissue 
engineering strategy with mixture of peripheral blood-derived mesenchymal stem 
cells (PBMSC) and endothelial progenitor cells (PBEPC) was applied in a 
3D-printed biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) scaffold with highly bioactive nano 
hydroxyapatite (nHA) coating (nHA/BCP) to construct a novel vascularized tissue 
engineered bone (VTEB) for rabbit femoral SBD repair. The 2D coculture of PBMSC 
and PBEPC showed that they could promote the osteogenic or angiogenic 
differentiation of the cells from each other, especially in the group of 
PBEPC/PBMSC = 75:25. Besides, the 3D coculture results exhibited that the nHA 
coating could further promote PBEPC/PBMSC adhesion, proliferation, and 
osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation on the BCP scaffold. In vivo 
experiments showed that among the four groups (BCP, BCP-PBEPC/PBMSC, nHA/BCP, 
and nHA/BCP-PBEPC/PBMSC), the nHA/BCP-PBEPC/PBMSC group induced the best 
formation of blood vessels and new bone and, thus, the good repair of SBD. It 
revealed the synergistic effect of nHA and PBEPC/PBMSC on the angiogenesis and 
osteogenesis of the BCP scaffold. Therefore, the construction of VTEB in this 
study could provide a possibility for the regenerative repair of SBD."
1890,"The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been extensively used to detect ischemia and 
the need for shunting during carotid endarterectomy. Limited literature exists 
using EEG data to detect ischemia in other surgeries. This case report depicts a 
65-year-old man, with extensive vascular history including complete left carotid 
occlusion and severe right carotid stenosis, who presented for left first rib 
resection and left subclavian vein balloon angioplasty. Following induction of 
general anesthesia, frontal EEG (SedLine; Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) 
demonstrated hemispheric asymmetry, which nearly resolved with vasoactive 
support. At three distinct periods, discordance reoccurred necessitating a 
higher mean arterial pressure threshold. This case demonstrates EEG patterns 
concerning for focal spectrographic ischemia and highlights the potential use of 
EEG signals to capture hypoperfusion and direct vasoactive therapy."
1891,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus 
responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although 
COVID-19 is a viral illness, many patients admitted to hospital are prescribed 
antibiotics, based on concerns that COVID-19 patients may experience secondary 
bacterial infections, and the assumption that they may respond well to 
antibiotic therapy. This has led to an increase in antibiotic use for some 
hospitalised patients at a time when accumulating antibiotic resistance is a 
major global threat to health. Procalcitonin (PCT) is an inflammatory marker 
measured in blood samples and widely recommended to help diagnose bacterial 
infections and guide antibiotic treatment. The PEACH study will compare patient 
outcomes from English and Welsh hospitals that used PCT testing during the first 
wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with those from hospitals not using PCT. It will 
help to determine whether, and how, PCT testing should be used in the NHS in 
future waves of COVID-19 to protect patients from antibiotic overuse. PEACH is a 
retrospective observational cohort study using patient-level clinical data from 
acute hospital Trusts and Health Boards in England and Wales. The primary 
objective is to measure the difference in antibiotic use between COVID-19 
patients who did or did not have PCT testing at the time of diagnosis. Secondary 
objectives include measuring differences in length of stay, mortality, intensive 
care unit admission, and resistant bacterial infections between these groups."
1892,"Intracellular delivery of freezing-tolerant trehalose is crucial for 
cryopreservation of red blood cells (RBCs) and previous strategies based on 
membrane-disruptive activity usually generate severe hemolysis. Herein, we 
develop a dynamic membrane-active glycopeptide grafting with 25% maltotriose and 
50% p-benzyl alcohol for the first time to effectively facilitate entry of 
membrane-impermeable trehalose in human RBCs with low hemolysis. Results of 
mechanism acting on cell membranes suggest that reversible adsorption of such 
benzyl alcohol-grafted glycopeptide on cell surfaces upon weak perturbation with 
phospholipids and dynamic transition towards membrane stabilization are 
essential for keeping cellular biofunctions. Furthermore, the functionalized 
glycopeptide is indicative of typical α-helical/β-sheet structure-driven 
regulations of ice crystals during freeze-thaw, thereby strongly promoting 
efficient cryopreservation. Such all-in-one glycopeptide enables achieving both 
high cell recovery post-thaw above 85% and exceptional cryosurvival over 95% in 
direct freezing protocols. The rationally designed benzyl alcohol-modified 
glycopeptide permits the development of a competent platform with high 
generality for protection of blood cells against freeze-stress. This article is

1893,"INTRODUCTION: Oncogene-addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
present a high incidence of CNS metastases either at diagnosis or during the 
course of the disease. In this case, patients present with worse prognosis and 
are often excluded from clinical trials unless brain metastases are pre-treated 
or clinically stable.
AREAS COVERED: As a result of the discovery of several oncogenic drivers in 
ALK/ROS1/NTRK-positive NSCLC, targeted agents have been tested in several 
trials. We evaluate and compare the intracranial efficacy of available targeted 
agents in ALK/ROS1/NTRK-positive NSCLC based on subgroup analysis from pivotal 
trials.
EXPERT OPINION: Last-generation ALK inhibitors have shown slightly superior 
intracranial activity but pivotal trials do not consider the same endpoints for 
intracranial efficacy, therefore data are not comparable. Local treatments for 
BM including surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and WBRT, 
should be integrated with systemic therapies basing on specific criteria like 
presence of oligoprogression or symptomatic progression."
1894,"BACKGROUND: eHealth tools such as patient portals and personal health records, 
also known as patient-centered digital health records, can engage and empower 
individuals with chronic health conditions. Patients who are highly engaged in 
their care have improved disease knowledge, self-management skills, and clinical 
outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically review the effects of patient-centered 
digital health records on clinical and patient-reported outcomes, health care 
utilization, and satisfaction among patients with chronic conditions and to 
assess the feasibility and acceptability of their use.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO databases 
between January 2000 and December 2021. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. Eligible studies 
were those evaluating digital health records intended for nonhospitalized adult 
or pediatric patients with a chronic condition. Patients with a high disease 
burden were a subgroup of interest. Primary outcomes included clinical and 
patient-reported health outcomes and health care utilization. Secondary outcomes 
included satisfaction, feasibility, and acceptability. Joanna Briggs Institute 
critical appraisal tools were used for quality assessment. Two reviewers 
screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. Associations between health record 
use and outcomes were categorized as beneficial, neutral or clinically 
nonrelevant, or undesired.
RESULTS: Of the 7716 unique publications examined, 81 (1%) met the eligibility 
criteria, with a total of 1,639,556 participants across all studies. The most 
commonly studied diseases included diabetes mellitus (37/81, 46%), 
cardiopulmonary conditions (21/81, 26%), and hematology-oncology conditions 
(14/81, 17%). One-third (24/81, 30%) of the studies were randomized controlled 
trials. Of the 81 studies that met the eligibility criteria, 16 (20%) were of 
high methodological quality. Reported outcomes varied across studies. The 
benefits of patient-centered digital health records were most frequently 
reported in the category health care utilization on the ""use of recommended care 
services"" (10/13, 77%), on the patient-reported outcomes ""disease knowledge"" 
(7/10, 70%), ""patient engagement"" (13/28, 56%), ""treatment adherence"" (10/18, 
56%), and ""self-management and self-efficacy"" (10/19, 53%), and on the clinical 
outcome ""laboratory parameters,"" including HbA1c and low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL; 16/33, 48%). Beneficial effects on ""health-related quality of life"" were 
seen in only 27% (4/15) of studies. Patient satisfaction (28/30, 93%), 
feasibility (15/19, 97%), and acceptability (23/26, 88%) were positively 
evaluated. More beneficial effects were reported for digital health records that 
predominantly focus on active features. Beneficial effects were less frequently 
observed among patients with a high disease burden and among high-quality 
studies. No unfavorable effects were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of patient-centered digital health records in 
nonhospitalized individuals with chronic health conditions is potentially 
associated with considerable beneficial effects on health care utilization, 
treatment adherence, and self-management or self-efficacy. However, for firm 
conclusions, more studies of high methodological quality are required.

1895,"The effect of group medical visits (GMV) compared to individual medical visits 
(IMV), on weight and blood pressure in a large primary care practice serving a 
predominantly underserved population, was assessed. The records of 304 patients 
attending a weight-loss program were analyzed using mixed-effects regression 
models. Patients in GMV lost an average of 11.63 lbs, whereas patients in IMV 
lost an average of 3.99 lbs (p &lt; 0.001). A total of 55% of patients lost ≥7% 
in GMV compared to 11% of patients in IMV (p ≤ 0.001). Individuals who lost 
&gt;5% of their baseline weight had a higher reduction in overall blood 
pressure. For systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the differences between 
baseline and three months for GMV and IMV were -7.4 vs. 4.1 mm of Hg (p = 0.002) 
and -4.6 vs. 4.2 mm of Hg (p = 0.003), respectively. Results from this study 
demonstrate that GMV may be a potentially useful modality for addressing weight 
and blood pressure in an underserved population."
1896,"Blood-based biomarkers have been considered as a promising method for the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The reliability and accuracy of plasma 
core AD biomarkers, including phosphorylated tau (P-tau181), total tau (T-tau), 
Aβ42, and Aβ40, have also been confirmed in diagnosing AD and predicting 
cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition in Western populations, while fewer research 
studies have ever been conducted in China's Han population. In this study, we 
investigated the capability of plasma core AD biomarkers in predicting cerebral 
Aβ deposition burden among the China Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorder 
Initiative (CANDI) cohort consisting of cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), AD dementia, and non-Alzheimer's dementia disease (Non-ADD). 
Body fluid (plasma and CSF) AD core biomarkers were measured via single-molecule 
array (Simoa) immunoassay. The global standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) was 
then calculated by 18F-florbetapir PET, which was divided into positive (+) and 
negative (-). The most significant correlation between plasma and CSF was plasma 
P-tau181 (r = 0.526, P < 0.0001). Plasma P-tau181 and P-tau181/T-tau ratio were 
positively correlated with global SUVR (r = 0.257, P < 0.0001; r = 0.263, P < 
0.0001, respectively), while Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio were negatively correlated 
with global SUVR (r = -0.346, P < 0.0001; r = -0.407, P < 0.0001, respectively). 
Interestingly, voxel-wise analysis showed that plasma P-tau181 and 
P-tau181/T-tau ratio were negatively related to 18F-florbetapir PET in the 
hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. The optimal predictive capability in 
distinguishing all Aβ+ participants from Aβ- participants and MCI+ from MCI- 
subgroups was the plasma P-tau181/T-tau ratio (AUC = 0.825 and 0.834, 
respectively). Our study suggested that plasma P-tau181 and P-tau181/T-tau ratio 
possessed better diagnostic and predictive values than plasma Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 
in this cohort, a finding that may be useful in clinical practices and trials in 
China."

1898,"With respect to the potential natural resources in the marine environment, 
marine macroalgae or seaweeds are recognized to have health impacts. Two marine 
algae that are found in the Red Sea, Codium tomentosum (Green algae) and 
Actinotrichia fragilis (Red algae), were collected. Antibacterial and 
antioxidant activities of aqueous extracts of these algae were evaluated in 
vitro. Polyphenols from the extracts were determined using HPLC. Fillet fish was 
fortified with these algal extracts in an attempt to improve its nutritional 
value, and sensory evaluation was performed. The antibacterial effect of C. 
tomentosum extract was found to be superior to that of A. fragilis extract. 
Total phenolic contents of C. tomentosum and A. fragilis aqueous extract were 
32.28 ± 1.63 mg/g and 19.96 ± 1.28 mg/g, respectively, while total flavonoid 
contents were 4.54 ± 1.48 mg/g and 3.86 ± 1.02 mg/g, respectively. Extract of C. 
tomentosum demonstrates the highest antioxidant activity, with an IC50 value of 
75.32 ± 0.07 μg/mL. The IC50 of L-ascorbic acid as a positive control was 22.71 
± 0.03 μg/mL. The IC50 values for inhibiting proliferation on normal PBMC cells 
were 33.7 ± 1.02 µg/mL and 51.0 ± 1.14 µg/mL for C. tomentosum and A. fragilis, 
respectively. The results indicated that both algal aqueous extracts were safe, 
with low toxicity to normal cells. Interestingly, fillet fish fortified with C. 
tomentosum extract demonstrated the greatest overall acceptance score. These 
findings highlight the potential of these seaweed species for cultivation as a 
sustainable and safe source of therapeutic compounds for treating human and fish 
diseases, as well as effective food supplements and preservatives instead of 
chemical ones after performing in vivo assays."
1899,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder. In addition to taking 
medication, adjusting the composition of the diet is also considered one of the 
effective methods to control the levels of blood glucose. Chitosan and its 
derivatives are natural and versatile biomaterials with health benefits. 
Chitosan has the potential to alleviate diabetic hyperglycemia by reducing 
hepatic gluconeogenesis and increasing skeletal muscle glucose uptake and 
utility. Scientists also focus on the glucose-lowering effect of chitosan 
oligosaccharide (COS). COS supplementation has the potential to alleviate 
abnormal glucose metabolism in diabetic rats by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and 
lipid peroxidation in the liver. Both high and low molecular weight chitosan 
feeding reduced insulin resistance by inhibiting lipid accumulation in the liver 
and adipose tissue and ameliorating chronic inflammation in diabetic rats. COS 
can reduce insulin resistance but has less ability to reduce hepatic lipids in 
diabetic rats. A clinical trial showed that a 3-month administration of chitosan 
increased insulin sensitivity and decreased body weight and triglycerides in 
obese patients. Chitosan and COS are considered Generally Recognized as Safe; 
however, they are still considered to be of safety concerns. This review 
highlights recent advances of chitosan and its derivatives in the 
glucose-lowering/antidiabetic effects and the safety."
1900,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by 
elevated levels of blood glucose due to insulin resistance or insulin-secretion 
defects. The development of diabetes is mainly attributed to the interaction of 
several complex pathogenic, genetic, environmental and metabolic processes. 
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a serine protease that cleaves X-proline 
dipeptides from the N-terminus of several polypeptides, including natural 
hypoglycemic incretin hormones. Inhibition of this enzyme restores and maintains 
glucose homeostasis, making it an attractive drug target for the management of 
T2DM. Natural products are important sources of bioactive agents for anti-T2DM 
drug discovery. Marine ecosystems are a rich source of bioactive products and 
have inspired the development of drugs for various human disorders, including 
diabetes. Here, structure-based virtual screening and molecular docking were 
performed to identify antidiabetic compounds from the Comprehensive Marine 
Natural Products Database (CMNPD). The binding characteristics of two 
shortlisted compounds, CMNPD13046 and CMNPD17868, were assessed using molecular 
dynamics simulations. Thus, this study provides insights into the potential 
antidiabetic activity and the underlying molecular mechanism of two compounds of 
marine origin. These compounds could be investigated further for the development 
of potent DPP-4 inhibitors."
1901,"Xestospongia muta is a marine sponge belonging to the family Petrosiidae. It is 
an important source of biologically active marine natural products, with 
different kinds of essential fatty acids. Scavenger receptor class B type I 
(SR-BI) is the main receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 
which plays a pivotal role in preventing atherosclerosis. It removes cholesterol 
from HDL cholesterol, returning lipid-poor lipoprotein into blood circulation. 
The present study investigated the effects of X. muta Fraction-7 and linoleic 
acid on SR-BI gene expression and HDL cholesterol uptake. In vitro studies of 
the activity of X. muta and linoleic acid against the therapeutic target for 
hypercholesterolemia were conducted using the HDL receptor SR-BI via luciferase 
assay and HepG2 cells. In the present study, Fraction-7 of X. muta showed the 
highest expression level of the SR-BI gene via luciferase assay. Profiling of 
Fraction-7 of X. muta by GC-MS revealed 58 compounds, comprising various fatty 
acids, particularly linoleic acid. The in vitro study in HepG2 cells showed that 
the Fraction-7 of X. muta and linoleic acid (an active compound in X. muta) 
increased SR-BI mRNA expression by 129% and 85%, respectively, compared to the 
negative control. Linoleic acid increased HDL uptake by 3.21-fold compared to 
the negative control. Thus, the Fraction-7 of X. muta and linoleic acid have the 
potential to be explored as adjuncts in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia to 
prevent or reduce the severity of atherosclerosis development."
1902,"Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread environmental toxicant that can cause severe 
hepatic injury. Oyster protein hydrolysates (OPs) have potential effects on 
preventing liver disease. In this study, thirty mice were randomly divided into 
five groups: the control, Cd, Cd + ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 100 
mg/kg), and low/high dose of OPs-treatment groups (100 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg). 
After continuous administration for 7 days, the ameliorative effect of OPs on 
Cd-induced acute hepatic injury in Cd-exposed mice was assessed. The results 
showed that OPs significantly improved the liver function profiles (serum ALT, 
AST, LDH, and ALP) in Cd-exposed mice. Histopathological analysis showed that 
OPs decreased apoptotic bodies, hemorrhage, lymphocyte accumulation, and 
inflammatory cell infiltration around central veins. OPs significantly retained 
the activities of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px, and decreased the elevated hepatic MDA 
content in Cd-exposed mice. In addition, OPs exhibited a reductive effect on the 
inflammatory responses (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and inhibitory effects on the 
expression of inflammation-related proteins (MIP-2 and COX-2) and the ERK/NF-κB 
signaling pathway. OPs suppressed the development of hepatocyte apoptosis (Bax, 
caspase-3, and Blc-2) and the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in 
Cd-exposed mice. In conclusion, OPs ameliorated the Cd-induced hepatic injury by 
inhibiting oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, as well as the 
development of hepatocyte apoptosis via regulating the ERK/NF-κB and 
PI3K/AKT-related signaling pathways."
1903,"Two new guanidine alkaloids, batzelladines O (1) and P (2), were isolated from 
the deep-water marine sponge Monanchora pulchra. The structures of these 
metabolites were determined by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and ECD. The 
isolated compounds exhibited cytotoxic activity in human prostate cancer cells 
PC3, PC3-DR, and 22Rv1 at low micromolar concentrations and inhibited colony 
formation and survival of the cancer cells. Batzelladines O (1) and P (2) 
induced apoptosis, which was detected by Western blotting as caspase-3 and PARP 
cleavage. Additionally, induction of pro-survival autophagy indicated as 
upregulation of LC3B-II and suppression of mTOR was observed in the treated 
cells. In line with this, the combination with autophagy inhibitor 
3-methyladenine synergistically increased the cytotoxic activity of 
batzelladines O (1) and P (2). Both compounds were equally active in 
docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells, despite 
exhibiting a slight p-glycoprotein substrate-like activity. In combination with 
docetaxel, an additive effect was observed. In conclusion, the isolated new 
guanidine alkaloids are promising drug candidates for the treatment of 
taxane-resistant prostate cancer."
1904,"Sea anemones are predatory marine invertebrates and have diverse venom arsenals. 
Venom is integral to their biology, and is used in competition, defense, and 
feeding. Three lineages of sea anemones are known to have independently evolved 
symbiotic relationships with clownfish, however the evolutionary impact of this 
relationship on the venom composition of the host is still unknown. Here, we 
investigate the potential of this symbiotic relationship to shape the venom 
profiles of the sea anemones that host clownfish. We use transcriptomic data to 
identify differences and similarities in venom profiles of six sea anemone 
species, representing the three known clades of clownfish-hosting sea anemones. 
We recovered 1121 transcripts matching verified toxins across all species, and 
show that hemolytic and hemorrhagic toxins are consistently the most dominant 
and diverse toxins across all species examined. These results are consistent 
with the known biology of sea anemones, provide foundational data on venom 
diversity of these species, and allow for a review of existing hierarchical 
structures in venomic studies."
1905,"BACKGROUND: In women with late preterm pre-eclampsia (i.e. at 34+0 to 36+6 
weeks' gestation), the optimal delivery time is unclear because limitation of 
maternal-fetal disease progression needs to be balanced against infant 
complications. The aim of this trial was to determine whether or not planned 
earlier initiation of delivery reduces maternal adverse outcomes without 
substantial worsening of perinatal or infant outcomes, compared with expectant 
management, in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia.
METHODS: We undertook an individually randomised, triple non-masked controlled 
trial in 46 maternity units across England and Wales, with an embedded health 
economic evaluation, comparing planned delivery and expectant management (usual 
care) in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia. The co-primary maternal outcome 
was a maternal morbidity composite or recorded systolic blood pressure of 
≥ 160 mmHg (superiority hypothesis). The co-primary short-term perinatal outcome 
was a composite of perinatal deaths or neonatal unit admission (non-inferiority 
hypothesis). Analyses were by intention to treat, with an additional 
per-protocol analysis for the perinatal outcome. The primary 2-year infant 
neurodevelopmental outcome was measured using the PARCA-R (Parent Report of 
Children's Abilities-Revised) composite score. The planned sample size of the 
trial was 900 women; the trial is now completed. We undertook two linked 
substudies.
RESULTS: Between 29 September 2014 and 10 December 2018, 901 women were 
recruited; 450 women [448 women (two withdrew consent) and 471 infants] were 
allocated to planned delivery and 451 women (451 women and 475 infants) were 
allocated to expectant management. The incidence of the co-primary maternal 
outcome was significantly lower in the planned delivery group [289 (65%) women] 
than in the expectant management group [338 (75%) women] (adjusted relative risk 
0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.94; p = 0.0005). The incidence of the 
co-primary perinatal outcome was significantly higher in the planned delivery 
group [196 (42%) infants] than in the expectant management group [159 (34%) 
infants] (adjusted relative risk 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.47; 
p = 0.0034), but indicators of neonatal morbidity were similar in both groups. 
At 2-year follow-up, the mean PARCA-R scores were 89.5 points (standard 
deviation 18.2 points) for the planned delivery group (290 infants) and 91.9 
points (standard deviation 18.4 points) for the expectant management group (256 
infants), both within the normal developmental range (adjusted mean difference 
-2.4 points, 95% confidence interval -5.4 to 0.5 points; non-inferiority 
p = 0.147). Planned delivery was significantly cost-saving (-£2711, 95% 
confidence interval -£4840 to -£637) compared with expectant management. There 
were nine serious adverse events in the planned delivery group and 12 in the 
expectant management group.
CONCLUSION: In women with late preterm pre-eclampsia, planned delivery reduces 
short-term maternal morbidity compared with expectant management, with more 
neonatal unit admissions related to prematurity but no indicators of greater 
short-term neonatal morbidity (such as need for respiratory support). At 2-year 
follow-up, around 60% of parents reported follow-up scores. Average infant 
development was within the normal range for both groups; the small between-group 
mean difference in PARCA-R scores is unlikely to be clinically important. 
Planned delivery was significantly cost-saving to the health service. These 
findings should be discussed with women with late preterm pre-eclampsia to allow 
shared decision-making on timing of delivery.
LIMITATIONS: Limitations of the trial include the challenges of finding a 
perinatal outcome that adequately represented the potential risks of both groups 
and a maternal outcome that reflects the multiorgan manifestations of 
pre-eclampsia. The incidences of maternal and perinatal primary outcomes were 
higher than anticipated on the basis of previous studies, but this did not limit 
interpretation of the analysis. The trial was limited by a higher loss to 
follow-up rate than expected, meaning that the extent and direction of bias in 
outcomes (between responders and non-responders) is uncertain. A longer 
follow-up period (e.g. up to 5 years) would have enabled us to provide further 
evidence on long-term infant outcomes, but this runs the risk of greater 
attrition and increased expense.
FUTURE WORK: We identified a number of further questions that could be 
prioritised through a formal scoping process, including uncertainties around 
disease-modifying interventions, prognostic factors, longer-term follow-up, the 
perspectives of women and their families, meta-analysis with other studies, 
effect of a similar intervention in other health-care settings, and clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of other related policies around neonatal 
unit admission in late preterm birth.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was prospectively registered as ISRCTN01879376.

Research ( NIHR ) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published

1906,"Aluminum, one of the most abundant metallic elements, is known to be toxic to 
multiple organs including the kidneys. This study aimed to investigate the 
pleiotropic nephroprotective effects of Hesperidin in aluminum chloride 
(ALCL3)-induced renal injury, highlighting the potential molecular mechanisms 
underlying. Twenty-four male albino rats were divided into four groups: control, 
Hesperidin (80 mg/kg BW, orally), ALCL3 (10 mg/kg BW, IP), and 
ALCL3 + Hesperidin groups. By the end of the study, blood samples were 
collected, and tissue samples were harvested at sacrifice. ALCL3 rats showed 
dramatically declined renal function, enhanced intrarenal oxidative stress, 
inflammation, apoptosis, and extravagant renal histopathological damage with 
interstitial fibrosis as shown by a higher Endothelial, Glomerular, Tubular, and 
Interstitial (EGTI) score. Hesperidin significantly reversed all the 
aforementioned detrimental effects in ALCL3-treated rats. The study verified the 
nephroprotective effects of Hesperidin on ALCL3-induced renal damage and 
confirmed the critical role of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and 
apoptosis inhibition."
1907,"The effects of interactions between the toxic and essential metal mixtures on 
cognitive function are poorly understood. This study aims to identify the joint 
association of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) with cognitive function 
in older adults and the moderating role of selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), and copper 
(Cu) in this association. This study included 1000 community-dwelling older 
adults. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE). Blood concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Se, Zn, and Cu were measured using 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Linear regression and Bayesian 
kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were applied to assess the individual 
and joint associations of As, Cd, and Pb with cognitive function and to examine 
whether Se, Zn, and Cu (individually and as a mixture) modified these 
associations. In the adjusted single-metal models, both Cd (β = - 0.37, 95% 
CI: - 0.73 to - 0.01) and Pb (β = - 0.44, 95% CI: - 0.86 to - 0.02) were 
associated with MMSE scores, while Se (β = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.13) exhibited 
a positive relationship with MMSE scores. Univariate exposure-response functions 
from BKMR models showed similar results. Moreover, the toxic metal mixture (As, 
Cd, and Pb) exhibited a significant negative association with MMSE scores in a 
dose-response pattern, with Pb being the greatest contributor within the 
mixture. The negative association of Pb alone or the toxic metal mixture with 
MMSE scores became weaker at higher concentrations of Se within its normal 
range, especially when Se levels were greater than the median (89.18 μg/L). Our 
findings support that Se can attenuate the negative associations of exposure to 
single Pb or the As, Cd, and Pb mixtures with cognitive function. Future 
prospective studies are needed to replicate our findings."
1908,"BACKGROUND: In transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA), 99mTc-pyrophosphate 
myocardial scintigraphy (99mTc-PYP) is a diagnostic tool that utilizes visual 
and quantitative evaluation. However, false positive cases can occur because of 
tracer accumulation in the blood. We investigated the effectiveness of the 
heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio of 99mTc-PYP in ATTR-CA diagnosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively included 164 patients who underwent 99mTc-PYP 
single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography between March 
2019 and January 2022. The diagnostic accuracy of ATTR-CA was examined by the 
heart-to-contralateral lung (H/CL) and H/M ratio calculated at 3 hours 
post-tracer administration.
RESULTS: After the exclusion of patients who did not undergo endomyocardial 
biopsy, 30 patients (15 each with ATTR-CA and without ATTR-CA) were included. 
The receiver operating characteristic curve used to distinguish ATTR-CA from 
non-ATTR-CA patients revealed an area under the curve of 0.986 and 0.943, 
respectively. A H/M ratio of > 1.41 identified ATTR-CA patients with a 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative 
predictive value (NPV) of 100, 93.3, 93.3, and 100%, respectively. Conversely, 
an H/CL ratio of > 1.3 identified ATTR-CA patients with 100% sensitivity, 40.0% 
specificity, 62.5% PPV, and 100% NPV.
CONCLUSION: The H/M ratio obtained at 3 hours post-injection has the potential 
to be a novel indicator for ATTR-CA."
1909,"Continuous factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) infusions are commonly used 
for patients with hemophilia A (HA) or B (HB) undergoing surgery to secure 
perioperative hemostasis. To describe differences between the initial recovery 
and subsequent FIX and FVIII levels, and describe clinical outcomes among HB and 
HA patients receiving perioperative continuous infusion (CI) of recombinant 
FVIII and FIX concentrates. Retrospective chart review was conducted on 8 
consecutive patients with HB and 7 consecutive patients with HA who underwent 
major surgery between 2014 and 2018 and received continuous infusions of 
standard half-life factor concentrate. Median initial bolus dose per kilogram 
was higher for HB compared to HA patients [90.8 (IQR 78.0-98.7) vs. 52.1 (IQR 
48.6-55.6) IU/kg], while initial CI dose-rates were similar [4.3 (IQR 3.8-4.6) 
vs. 4.2 (IQR 3.8-4.4) IU/kg/h]. Median post-bolus recovery was higher for FVIII 
compared to FIX [1.70 (IQR 1.23-1.75) vs. 0.88 (IQR 0.75-1.00) IU/mL]. Median 
factor levels also were higher for FVIII on post-operative days 1 to 3. HB 
patients had greater mean intraoperative estimated blood loss [285.7 (range 
0-1000) vs. 142.8 (range 0-400) mL] and longer median length of hospital stay [9 
(IQR 8-12) vs. 5 (IQR 4-6.5) days]. Our initial evidence suggests greater in 
vivo yield of rFVIII compared to rFIX in the perioperative setting. We 
identified poorer clinical outcomes in this small cohort of perioperative HB 
patients indicating that they may benefit from a higher CI rate for adequate 
surgical hemostatic coverage."
1910,"Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV 1) is a major bovine pathogen spreading 
worldwide and causing extensive damage to the livestock industry. BoHV causes 
respiratory, genital, and neurological disorders. A cross-sectional study was 
performed for the first time to estimate the seroreactivity to BoHV 1 and 
related risk factors among Iran's central desert dairy cattle. A total of 800 
blood samples was randomly collected from 76 unvaccinated herds. Samples were 
tested with an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) commercial kit 
to detect BoHV 1 antibodies. The logistic regression model was used to analyze 
the data. BoHV 1 seroreactivity at animal and herd levels was 50% and 65%, 
respectively. Herd size was recognized as a risk factor (OR = 2.65, 
CI = 1.61-4.37) for seroreactivity to BoHV using GLM (p < 0.05). The high 
prevalence of BoHV 1 antibodies in the study area indicates the need to 
implement educational programs on the importance of the disease and design 
methods to control and prevent virus distribution."
1911,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy 
(TA-TMA) is a fatal post-transplant complication. It has a high mortality rate 
and worse prognosis, but treatment strategies remain controversial. We screened 
6 out of 3453 studies on the treatment of TA-TMA. These investigations compared 
5 treatment strategies with a network meta-analysis approach. The final outcome 
was the proportion of patients who responded to these therapies. There were 
significant differences in response rates for each treatment. Achieving analysis 
through direct and indirect evidence in the rank probabilities shows that rTM 
(recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin) is most likely to be rank 1 (64.98%), 
Eculizumab intervention rank 2 (48.66%), ISM (immunosuppression manipulation) 
rank 3 (32.24%), TPE (therapeutic plasma exchange) intervention rank 4 (69.56%), 
and supportive care intervention rank 5 (70.20%). Eculizumab and ISM have 
significantly higher efficacy than supportive care (odds ratio (OR): 18.04, 
18.21 respectively); and TPE having lower efficacy than all other TA-TMA 
therapies exception to supportive care. In our study, rTM and Eculizumab may be 
the best choice when treating TA-TMA."
1912,"BACKGROUND: For ischemic stroke patients with concomitant unruptured aneurysm, 
intravenous thrombolysis therapy (IVT) remains a disputable decision. We hence 
performed a meta-analysis to identify the related brain hemorrhage rate of 
unruptured aneurysms and the risk ratio for their rupture comparing to stroke 
patients who do not have aneurysms.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify the studies from the 
online database from 2000 to September 1st, 2022. Cohort studies were included 
and assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for quality. The research 
procedures were subjected to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Fixed-effects model was used based on the 
heterogeneity tests.
RESULTS: In 10 eligible studies, 7238 ischemic stroke patients were screened, a 
total of 302 patients with 348 aneurysms were included. 10 studies were eligible 
for ICH rate analysis, 8 for SAH rate analysis and 7 for risk ratio of stroke 
patients with unruptured aneurysms. The pooled any ICH rate was 16% (95% CI 
11-21%), symptomatic ICH rate was 4% (95% CI 1-7%, I2 = 0.00%, p = 0.90), and 0% 
(95% CI 0-1%) for aneurysm-related ICH. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was as low as 2% 
(95% CI 0-5%), while 0% (95% CI 0-2%) directly related to the aneurysm rupture. 
The risk ratio of ICH in stroke patients with aneurysms was 1.18 (95% CI 
0.79-1.77). Additionally, the hemorrhage rate difference was not evident between 
saccular and fusiform aneurysms due to a lack of details.
CONCLUSIONS: IVT is unlikely to induce hemorrhage of pre-existing unruptured 
aneurysms in stroke patients. Further randomized control studies are warranted 
to validate these conclusions."
1913,"Consumption of game meat may exert additional lead exposure with potential 
health risks. The purpose of the present pilot study was to determine blood lead 
concentration in game meat and no game meat consumers in southern Germany. 
Concentration of lead in blood (µg·L- 1) was significantly higher in game meat 
consumers (n = 190; 21.3 [20.0; 29.7]) compared to study participants consuming 
no game meat (n = 74; 20.0 [20.0; 20.0], p < 0.0001). In study participants with 
no game meat consumption, blood lead concentration was significantly higher in 
those who perform active hunting (80.3 [50.5; 110.0]) as well as active shooting 
(80.3 [50.5; 110.0]) than in those with no hunting or shooting activities (20.0 
[20.0; 20.0], p < 0.01). In conclusion, game meat consumers as well as active 
hunters and shooters should take in to account their potential for an increased 
lead exposure and the corresponding health risks."
1914,"PURPOSE: We aimed to examine the relationships of disease activity and risk 
factors with serum levels of orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones in patients 
with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).
METHODS: Fasting blood samples were taken for hormonal analysis of all 
participants, abdominal/neck bioimpedance measurements were recorded, and 
polysomnography (PSG) analyses were performed. According to the apnea-hypopnea 
index (AHI), 34 patients with newly diagnosed OSAS and 34 participants without 
OSAS were compared.
RESULTS: The median body mass index (BMI) measured in the OSAS group was 
30.39 kg/m2 and AHI was 18.95 and these values were 25.40 kg/m2 and 1.55 in the 
control group. There was a higher level of visceral adiposity and neuropeptide Y 
(NPY) in the moderate-to-severe OSAS group compared to the mild OSAS and control 
groups, and in the mild OSAS group compared to the control group (p = 0.001, 
p < 0.001). A positive correlation between the level of NPY and AHI and BMI 
(p < 0.001, p = 0.011), and a negative correlation between NPY levels and oxygen 
saturation (p = 0.001) was found. Oxygen saturation and desaturation rates were 
correlated with body fat percentage, body fat mass, abdominal adiposity, 
visceral adiposity, resting metabolic rate, and NPY levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The visceral adiposity ratio and increase in NPY levels are 
important parameters that increase the severity of OSAS. Considering the 
negative effects of NPY on vascular endothelium, measurement of basal NPY level 
before PSG in patients with OSAS is considered a parameter related to disease 
severity."
1915,"BACKGROUND: Internal maxillary artery (IMA) bypass has become popularized due to 
its medium-to-high blood flow, short graft length, and well-matched arterial 
caliber between donor and recipient vessels.
METHOD: We described an open surgery of a NEW ""workhorse,"" the IMA bypass, to 
treat a giant, thrombosed cerebral aneurysm. The extracranial middle 
infratemporal fossa (EMITF) approach was used to unveil the pterygoid segment of 
the IMA for cerebral revascularization.
CONCLUSION: Although this technique is technically challenging, the variations 
in IMA can be effectively identified and sufficiently exposed in this technique 
to achieve favorable clinical outcomes with a high bypass patency rate."
1916,"PURPOSE: NKG2A, an inhibitory receptor expressed on NK cells and T cells, leads 
to immune evasion by binding to HLA-E expressed on cancer cells. Here, we 
investigated the relationship between HLA-E surface expression on head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines and the efficacy of monalizumab, an 
NKG2A inhibitor, in promoting NK cell activity.
METHODS: Six HNSCC cell lines were used as target cells. After exposure to IFN- 
γ, HLA-E surface expression on HNSCC cell lines was measured by flow cytometry. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and isolated NK 
cells were used as effector cells. NK cells were stimulated by treatment with 
IL-2 and IL-15 for 5 days, and NK cell-induced cytotoxicity was analyzed by 
CD107a degranulation and 51Cr release assays.
RESULTS: We confirmed that HLA-E expression was increased by IFN-γ secreted by 
NK cells and that HLA-E expression was different for each cell line upon 
exposure to IFN-γ. Cell lines with high HLA-E expression showed stronger 
inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity, and efficacy of monalizumab was high. 
Combination with cetuximab increased the efficacy of monalizumab. In addition, 
stimulation of isolated NK cells with IL-2 and IL-15 increased the efficacy of 
monalizumab, even in the HLA-E low groups.
CONCLUSION: Monalizumab efficacy was correlated with HLA-E surface expression 
and was enhanced when NK cell activity was increased by cetuximab or cytokines. 
These results suggest that monalizumab may be potent against HLA-E-positive 
tumors and that monalizumab efficacy could be improved by promoting NK cell 
activity."
1917,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-papillary prone PCNL 
for the treatment of patients with renal abnormalities.
METHODS: An observational retrospective cohort study including PCNL cases of 
patients with renal abnormalities was performed. The following inclusion 
criteria were applied: renal stones > 1.5 cm with maximal diameter, anatomical 
malformations of affected kidney (malrotated kidneys, horseshoe kidneys and 
kidneys with complete duplicated systems, medullary sponge kidney), patients 
treated with standard (30Fr) PCNL or mini-PCNL (22Fr). The lithotripsy was 
performed using the Lithoclast Master or the Lithoclast® Trilogy (EMS Medical, 
Nyon, Switzerland).
RESULTS: Overall, 57 patients, 35 males, and 22 females with any renal 
malformation underwent non-papillary prone PCNL. Our study included 25 patients 
with horseshoe kidneys, 21 with malrotated kidneys, 9 with kidneys with 
duplicated pelvicalyceal systems and 2 with medullary sponge kidneys. The mean 
cumulative stone size was 36 ± 1.4 mm and most of the stones were in the lower 
calyceal group (36.9%) and in the pelvis (27.2%). The stone-free rate (SFR) was 
84.2% and the mean hospitalization time was 2.7 ± 0.7 days. In total, 
postoperative complications were developed in six patients (10.5%), half of them 
presenting fever and the other half requiring blood transfusion (Grade II).
CONCLUSION: The PCNL is the method of choice for treating large stones in 
anomalous kidneys. The generally accepted panacea that only a papillary puncture 
is safe is questioned by our results. Based on our experience, a non-papillary 
puncture proved to be a safe and effective procedure."
1918,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, based on PET/CT radiomics features, we developed and 
validated a nomogram to predict progression-free survival (PFS) for cases with 
diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with immunochemotherapy.
METHODS: This study retrospectively recruited 129 cases with DLBCL. Among them, 
PET/CT scans were conducted and baseline images were collected for radiomics 
features along with their clinicopathological features. Radiomics features 
related to recurrence were screened for survival analysis using univariate Cox 
regression analysis with p < 0.05. Next, a weighted Radiomics-score (Rad-score) 
was generated and independent risk factors were obtained from univariate and 
multivariate Cox regressions to build the nomogram. Furthermore, the nomogram 
was tested for their ability to predict PFS using time-dependent receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve 
analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Blood platelet, Rad-score, and gender were included in the nomogram as 
independent DLBCL risk factors for PFS. We found that the training cohort areas 
under the curve (AUCs) were 0.79, 0.84, and 0.88, and validation cohort AUCs 
were 0.67, 0.83, and 0.72, respectively. Further, the DCA and calibration curves 
confirmed the predictive nomogram's clinical relevance.
CONCLUSION: Using Rad-score, blood platelet, and gender of the DLBCL patients, a 
PET/CT radiomics-based nomogram was developed to guide cases' recurrence risk 
assessment prior to treatment. The developed nomogram can help provide more 
appropriate treatment plans to the cases.
KEY POINTS: • DLBCL cases can be classified into low- and high-risk groups using 
PET/CT radiomics based Rad-score. • When combined with other clinical 
characteristics (gender and blood platelet count), Rad-score can be used to 
predict the outcome of the pretreatment of DLBCL cases with a certain degree of 
accuracy. • A prognostic nomogram was established in this study in order to aid 
in assessing prognostic risk and providing more accurate treatment plans for 
DLBCL cases."
1919,"Candida auris has emerged as a pan-resistant pathogenic yeast among 
immunocompromised patients worldwide. As this pathogen is involved in 
biofilm-associated infections with serious medical manifestations due to the 
collective expression of pathogenic attributes and factors associated with drug 
resistance, successful treatment becomes a major concern. In the present study, 
we investigated the candidicidal activity of a plant defensin peptide named 
defensin-like protein 1 (D-lp1) against twenty-five clinical strains of C. 
auris. Furthermore, following the standard protocols, the D-lp1 was analyzed for 
its anti-biofilm and anti-virulence properties. The impact of these peptides on 
membrane integrity was also evaluated. For cytotoxicity determination, a 
hemolytic assay was conducted using horse blood. The minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values ranged 
from 0.047-0.78 mg/mL and 0.095-1.56 mg/mL, respectively. D-lp1 at 
sub-inhibitory concentrations potentially abrogated both biofilm formation and 
24-h mature biofilms. Similarly, the peptide severely impacted virulence 
attributes in the clinical strain of C. auris. For the insight mechanism, D-lp1 
displayed a strong impact on the cell membrane integrity of the test pathogen. 
It is important to note that D-lp1 at sub-inhibitory concentrations displayed 
minimal hemolytic activity against horse blood cells. Therefore, it is highly 
useful to correlate the anti-Candida property of D-lp1 along with anti-biofilm 
and anti-virulent properties against C. auris, with the aim of discovering an 
alternative strategy for combating serious biofilm-associated infections caused 
by C. auris."
1920,"Invasive candidiasis (IC) contributes to the morbidity and mortality of 
hospitalized patients and represents a significant burden to the healthcare 
system. Previous Brazilian studies have reported the presence of endemic Candida 
parapsilosis sensu stricto genotypes causing candidemia and clonal transmission 
involving fluconazole-resistant isolates. We performed a 5-year retrospective 
analysis of IC cases in a Brazilian tertiary pediatric hospital and conducted a 
molecular investigation of C. parapsilosis sensu stricto. Non-duplicate C. 
parapsilosis sensu stricto genotyping was performed by microsatellite analysis. 
Antifungal susceptibility and biofilm formation were also evaluated. A total of 
123 IC episodes were identified, with an IC incidence of 1.24 cases per 1000 
hospital admissions and an overall mortality of 34%. The main species were the 
C. parapsilosis complex (35.8%), Candida albicans (29.2%), and Candida 
tropicalis (21.9%). All C. parapsilosis sensu stricto were recovered from blood 
cultures, and 97.5% were biofilm producers. Microsatellite typing identified 
high genotypic diversity among the isolates. We observed that all isolates were 
sensitive to amphotericin B, and although one isolate was non-sensitive to 
fluconazole, only a silent mutation on ERG11 gene was identified. No clear 
evidence of clonal outbreak or emergence of fluconazole-resistant isolates was 
found, suggesting that multiple sources may be involved in the epidemiology of 
IC in children."
1921,"β-D-glucan (BDG) is a cell wall component of many pathogenic fungi. The 
detection of BDG as an assay is clinically broadly used as a diagnostic tool. 
However, the current data on BDG in paediatrics are limited, prompting specific 
considerations about when BDG can be used in neonates and children. We aimed to 
analyse the available data for the use of serum BDG in neonates and 
immunocompromised children and adolescents; as well as to understand the extent 
and characteristics of the use of BDG in children in Europe."
1922,"BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (IFS) with orbital complications has 
remained a challenging disease over the past few decades. Only a few studies 
have been conducted to investigate the factors associated with orbital 
complications in fungal rhinosinusitis (FRS). We aimed to review the 
characteristics between IFS and non-invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (NIFS) and 
determine clinical factors associated with orbital complications and overall 
survival.
METHODS: A multi-institutional database review study was conducted using the 
Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) from January 2001 to January 2019. We 
identified FRS patients using International Classification of Diseases diagnosis 
codes and SNOMED CT. We categorized patients into IFS and NIFS groups and 
analyzed the demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical symptoms, 
laboratory data, image findings, fungal infection status, and survival outcomes.
RESULTS: We included 1624 patients in our study, with 59 IFS patients and 1565 
NIFS patients. The history of an organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation had 
a significant prognostic effect on the survival outcomes, with surgical 
intervention and high hemoglobin (Hb) and albumin levels recognized as positive 
predictors. Posterior ethmoid sinus involvement, sphenoid sinus involvement, 
facial pain, blurred vision, and periorbital swelling were risk factors of 
orbital complications.
CONCLUSIONS: In NIFS patients, orbital complications were found to be associated 
with old age, a high WBC count, high blood glucose, and a high CRP level. For 
the risk factors of orbital complications in IFS patients, posterior ethmoid 
sinus involvement, sphenoid sinus involvement, facial pain, blurred vision, and 
periorbital swelling were recognized as predictors. Among IFS patients, a 
history of organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation was a risk factor for 
poor survival, while, conversely, surgical intervention and high Hb and albumin 
levels were related to improved survival. As predictors of orbital complications 
in IFS patients, posterior ethmoid sinus involvement, sphenoid sinus 
involvement, facial pain, blurred vision, and periorbital swelling upon the 
first visit should raise attention, with close monitoring."
1923,"Endothelialization of artificial scaffolds is considered an effective strategy 
for increasing the efficiency of vascular transplantation. This study aimed to 
compare the biophysical/biocompatible properties of three different 
biodegradable fibrous scaffolds: Poly (ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) alone, Poly 
Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) alone (both processed using Spraybase® 
electrospinning machine), and Coaxial scaffold where the fiber core and sheath 
was made of PCL and PLGA, respectively. Scaffold structural morphology was 
assessed by scanning electron microscope and tensile testing was used to 
investigate the scaffold tension resistance over time. Biocompatibility studies 
were carried out with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human 
vascular fibroblasts (HVF) for which cell viability (and cell proliferation over 
a 4-day period) and cell adhesion to the scaffolds were assessed by cytotoxicity 
assays and confocal microscopy, respectively. Our results showed that all 
biodegradable polymeric scaffolds are a reliable host to adhere and promote 
proliferation in HUVEC and HVF cells. In particular, PLGA membranes performed 
much better adhesion and enhanced cell proliferation compared to control in the 
absence of polymers. In addition, we demonstrate here that these biodegradable 
membranes present improved mechanical properties to construct potential 
tissue-engineered vascular graft."
1924,"We report a closed bipolar electrode (CBE)-based sensing platform for the 
detection of diagnostic metabolites in undiluted whole human blood. The sensor 
is enabled by electrode chemistry based on: (1) a mixed layer of 
blood-compatible adsorption-resistant phosphorylcholine (PPC) and phenylbutyric 
acid (PBA), (2) ferrocene (Fc) redox mediators, and (3) immobilized redox-active 
enzymes. This scheme is designed to overcome nonspecific protein adsorption and 
amplify sensing currents in whole human fluids. The scheme also incorporates a 
diffusing mediator to increase electronic communication between the immobilized 
redox enzyme and the working electrode. The use of both bound and freely 
diffusing mediators is synergistic in producing the electrochemical response. 
The sensor is realized by linking the analyte cell, containing the specific 
electrode surface architecture, through a CBE to a reporter cell containing the 
electrochromic reporter, methyl viologen (MV). The colorless-to-purple color 
change accompanying the 1e- reduction of MV2+ is captured using a smartphone 
camera. Subsequent red-green-blue analysis is performed on the acquired images 
to determine cholesterol, glucose, and lactate concentrations in whole blood. 
The CBE blood metabolite sensor produces a linear color change at clinically 
relevant concentration ranges for all metabolites with good reproducibility (∼5% 
or better) and with limits of detection of 79 μM for cholesterol, 59 μM for 
glucose, and 86 μM for lactate. Finally, metabolite concentration measurements 
from the CBE blood metabolite sensor are compared with results from commercially 
available FDA-approved blood cholesterol, glucose, and lactate meters, with an 
average difference of ∼3.5% across all three metabolites in the ranges studied."
1925,"The location of the macular central is very important for the examination of 
macular edema when using an automated screening system. The erratic character of 
the macular light intensity and the absence of a clear border make this 
anatomical structure difficult to detect. This paper presents a new method for 
detecting the macular center based on its geometrical location in the temporal 
direction of the optic disc. Also, a new method of determining the temporal 
direction using the vascular features visible on the optic disc is proposed. 
After detecting the optic disc, the temporal direction is determined by 
considering blood vessel positions. The macular center is detected using 
thresholding and simple morphology operations with optimum macular region of 
interest (ROI) direction. The results show that the proposed method has a low 
computation time of 0.34 s/image with 100% accuracy for the DRIVE dataset, while 
that of DiaretDB1 was 0.57 s/image with 98.87% accuracy."
1926,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) often is challenging, and 
mortality is high in such patients. Our goal was to characterize common 
diagnostic tools to enable a rapid and accurate diagnosis and to correlate these 
tools with mortality outcomes.
METHODS: Because of the possibility of including perioperative diagnostics, only 
surgically treated patients with suspected left-sided IE were included in this 
retrospective, monocentric study. A clinical committee confirmed the diagnosis 
of IE.
RESULTS: 201 consecutive patients (age 64 ± 13 years, 74% male) were finally 
diagnosed with IE, and 14 patients turned out IE-negative. Preoperative tests 
with the highest sensitivity for IE were positive blood cultures (89.0%) and 
transesophageal echocardiography (87.5%). In receiver operating characteristics, 
vegetation size revealed high predictive power for IE (AUC 0.800, p &lt; 0.001) 
with an optimal cut-off value of 11.5 mm. Systemic embolism was associated with 
mortality, and N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) 
had predictive power for mortality.
CONCLUSION: If diagnostic standard tools remain inconclusive, we suggest 
employing novel cut-off values to increase diagnostic accuracy and accelerate 
diagnosis. Patients with embolism or elevated NT-proBNP deserve a closer 
follow-up."
1927,"Atherosclerosis of femoral arteries can cause the insufficient blood supply to 
the lower limbs and lead to gangrenous ulcers and other symptoms. 
Atherosclerosis and inflammatory factors are significantly different from other 
plaques. Therefore, it is crucial to observe the cellular composition of the 
femoral atherosclerotic plaque and identify plaque heterogeneity in other 
arteries. To this end, we performed single-cell sequencing of a human femoral 
artery plaque. We identified 14 cell types, including endothelial cells, smooth 
muscle cells, monocytes, three macrophages with four different subtypes of foam 
cells, three T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells. We then downloaded 
single-cell sequencing data of carotid atherosclerosis from GEO, which were 
compared with the one femoral sample. We identified similar cell types, but the 
femoral artery had significantly more nonspecific immune cells and fewer 
specific immune cells than the carotid artery. We further compared the 
differences in the proportion of inflammatory macrophages, and resident 
macrophages, and the proportion of inflammatory macrophages was greater within 
the carotid artery. Through comparing one femoral sequencing sample with carotid 
samples from public datasets, our study reveals the single-cell map of the 
femoral artery and the heterogeneity of carotid and femoral arteries at the 
cellular level, laying the foundation for mechanistic and pharmacological 
studies of the femoral artery."
1928,"(1) Background: Insulin resistance (IR) is a characteristic pathophysiologic 
feature in heart failure (HF). We tested the hypothesis that skeletal muscle 
metabolism is differently impaired in patients with reduced (HFrEF) vs. 
preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction. (2) Methods: carbohydrate and lipid 
metabolism was studied in situ by intramuscular microdialysis in patients with 
HFrEF (59 ± 14y, NYHA I-III) and HFpEF (65 ± 10y, NYHA I-II) vs. healthy 
subjects of similar age during the oral glucose load (oGL); (3) Results: There 
were no difference in fasting serum and interstitial parameters between the 
groups. Blood and dialysate glucose increased significantly in HFpEF vs. HFrEF 
and controls upon oGT (both p &lt; 0.0001), while insulin increased 
significantly in HFrEF vs. HFpEF and controls (p &lt; 0.0005). Muscle tissue 
perfusion tended to be lower in HFrEF vs. HFpEF and controls after the oGL (p = 
0.057). There were no differences in postprandial increases in dialysate lactate 
and pyruvate. Postprandial dialysate glycerol was higher in HFpEF vs. HFrEF and 
controls upon oGL (p = 0.0016); (4) Conclusion: A pattern of muscle glucose 
metabolism is distinctly different in patients with HFrEF vs. HFpEF. While 
postprandial IR was characterized by impaired tissue perfusion and higher 
compensatory insulin secretion in HFrEF, reduced muscle glucose uptake and a 
blunted antilipolytic effect of insulin were found in HFpEF."
1929,"Elevated homocysteine (Hcy) increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Our 
objective was to emphasize Hcy's contribution in hypertension and CVD management 
by determining H-type hypertension (hypertension with Hcy ≥ 10 µmol/L) and 
associations between Hcy, blood pressure (BP) and estimates of vascular function 
among Black South Africans. We included 1995 adults (63% female). Plasma Hcy and 
cardiovascular measures (systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP), pulse pressure, 
heart rate (HR), carotid-radialis pulse wave velocity (cr-PWV), intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) were 
quantified. Five Hcy-related polymorphisms (cystathionine β-synthase (CBS 
844ins68, T833C, G9276A); methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T) and 
methionine synthase (MTR A2756G)) were genotyped. Hcy was &gt;10 µmol/L in 41% 
(n = 762), and of the 47% (n = 951) hypertensives, 45% (n = 425) presented with 
H-type. Hcy was higher in hypertensives vs. normotensives (9.86 vs. 8.78 µmol/L, 
p &lt; 0.0001, effect size 0.56) and correlated positively with SBP, DBP, cr-PWV 
and ICAM-1 (r &gt; 0.19, p &lt; 0.0001). Over Hcy quartiles, SBP, DBP, HR, 
cr-PWV and ICAM-1 increased progressively (all p-trends ≤ 0.001). In multiple 
regression models, Hcy contributed to the variance of SBP, DBP, HR, cr-PWV and 
ICAM-1. H-type hypertensives also had the lowest MTHFR 677 CC frequency (p = 
0.03). Hcy is positively and independently associated with markers of vascular 
function and raised BP."
1930,"OBJECTIVES: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a significant and devastating 
complication in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD/HD). 
Since one-third of AIS in ESRD/HD patients occurs during or soon after dialysis, 
patients are more likely to present within the time window when intravenous 
thrombolysis (IVT) can be performed. IVT may improve prognosis in ESRD/HD 
patients with AIS. However, ESRD/HD patients have been excluded from large 
trials and may have been withheld from IVT due to concerns about bleeding 
complications. To date, there is no clear evidence and firm guidance on the 
safety and efficacy of IVT in ESRD/HD patients with AIS. This narrative review 
aimed to evaluate critical scientific data on the benefits and risks of IVT use 
in patients with ESRD/HD and AIS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the electronic database of PubMed for studies 
evaluating the relationship between AIS, ESRD/HD, and IVT. Reference sections 
and additional publications were also searched manually. Studies on AIS in 
patients with ESRD/HD requiring maintenance dialysis that referred to IVT were 
included.
RESULTS: In total, 560 studies were found in the PubMed electronic database 
during the period covered, of which 10 met the selection criteria. IVT for AIS 
in ESRD/HD patients could improve neurological outcomes and be safely performed 
even with the possibility of hemorrhagic complications associated with 
hypertension. Despite the high complication and mortality rates in ESRD/HD 
patients with AIS after IVT, the association with IVT was unclear.
CONCLUSIONS: IVT for AIS in ESRD/HD patients may improve outcomes and should not 
be withheld based solely on ESRD/HD status."
1931,"The term chronic coronary syndromes encompasses a variety of clinical 
presentations of coronary artery disease (CAD), ranging from stable angina due 
to epicardial coronary artery disease to microvascular coronary dysfunction. 
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has an established role in the 
diagnosis, prognostication and treatment planning of patients with CAD. Recent 
advances in parametric mapping CMR techniques have added value in the assessment 
of patients with chronic coronary syndromes, even without the need for 
gadolinium contrast administration. Furthermore, quantitative perfusion CMR 
techniques have enabled the non-invasive assessment of myocardial blood flow and 
myocardial perfusion reserve and can reliably identify multivessel coronary 
artery disease and microvascular dysfunction. This review summarizes the 
clinical applications and the prognostic value of the novel CMR parametric 
mapping techniques in the setting of chronic coronary syndromes and discusses 
their strengths, pitfalls and future directions."
1932,"BACKGROUND: Predicting beat-to-beat blood pressure has several clinical 
applications. While most machine learning models focus on accuracy, it is 
necessary to build models that explain the relationships of hemodynamical 
parameters with blood pressure without sacrificing accuracy, especially during 
exercise.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use the RuleFit model to measure the 
importance, interactions, and relationships among several parameters extracted 
from photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals during a 
dynamic weight-bearing test (WBT) and to assess the accuracy and 
interpretability of the model results.
METHODS: RuleFit was applied to hemodynamical ECG and PPG parameters during rest 
and WBT in six healthy young subjects. The WBT involves holding a 500 g weight 
in the left hand for 2 min. Blood pressure is taken in the opposite arm before 
and during exercise thereof.
RESULTS: The root mean square error of the model residuals was 4.72 and 2.68 
mmHg for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, 
during rest and 4.59 and 4.01 mmHg, respectively, during the WBT. Furthermore, 
the blood pressure measurements appeared to be nonlinear, and interaction 
effects were observed. Moreover, blood pressure predictions based on PPG 
parameters showed a strong correlation with individual characteristics and 
responses to exercise.
CONCLUSION: The RuleFit model is an excellent tool to study interactions among 
variables for predicting blood pressure. Compared to other models, the RuleFit 
model showed superior performance. RuleFit can be used for predicting and 
interpreting relationships among predictors extracted from PPG and ECG signals."
1933,"BACKGROUND: Lower body perfusion (LBP) may be a strategy for maintaining organ 
perfusion during congenital heart disease surgery. It is hypothesized that renal 
and lower limb oxygen supply during LBP is superior to off-pump surgery and 
comparable to that of a standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
METHODS: in this prospective single-center study, patients aged &lt;1 year were 
recruited if they were scheduled for a correction of aortic arch anomalies using 
antegrade cerebral perfusion and LBP (group 1), a repair of coarctation during 
aortic cross-clamping (group 2), or surgery under whole-body CPB (group 3). 
Renal (prefix ""r"") and peripheral (prefix ""p"") oxygen saturation (SO2), 
hemoglobin amount (Hb), blood velocity (Velo), and blood flow (Flow) were 
measured noninvasively.
RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were included (group 1, n = 9; group 2, n = 5; 
group 3, n = 9). Compared to the baseline values, rSO2 and pSO2 decreased 
significantly in group 2 compared to groups 1 and 3. Conversely, rHB 
significantly increased in group 2 compared to groups 1 and 3, reflecting 
abdominal venous stasis. Compared to group 3, group 1 showed a significantly 
lower pFlow during CPB; however, rFlow, pFlow, and pVelo did not differ.
CONCLUSION: according to these observations, LBP results in an improved renal 
oxygen supply compared to off-pump surgery and may prove to be a promising 
alternative to conventional CPB."
1934,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary safety and 
effect of a pulsed electric field (PEF) ablation system.
METHODS: The pulmonary veins (PVs) and superior vena cava (SVC) were isolated 
with the pulsed field ablation (PFA) system, which included a PEF generator and 
an electrode. The effects of PFA were investigated in six porcines using a novel 
circular catheter with combined functions (mapping/ablation) designed to work 
with a cardiac mapping system. The PEF generator delivered a train of biphasic 
pulsed electric pulses with a high amplitude (800-2000 V) and short pulse 
duration. The voltage mapping, PVs and SVC potentials, ostial diameters, and 
phrenic nerve and esophagus viability data were collected 4 weeks later, after 
which the animals were subsequently euthanized for gross histopathology 
analysis.
RESULTS: PFA 100% isolated the PVs and SVC with four applications with a mean 
pulse number of 100-150 pulses, causing no muscle convulsion. PFA does not cause 
PV stenosis or phrenic nerve dysfunction. Histological analysis confirmed 100% 
transmurally without any venous stenoses or phrenic injuries. Pathology 
follow-up showed that PFA had selectively ablated cardiomyocytes but spared 
blood vessels, the esophagus, and phrenic nerves; after ablation, the myocardial 
tissue showed homogeneous fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: The PFA system is safe and feasible in the preliminary porcine 
model, which can effectively isolate PVs and SVCs. Transmural tissue damage can 
be achieved without phrenic palsy or stenosis."
1935,"A 35-year-old female presented to our emergency department with clinical signs 
of acute heart failure. Clinical workup identified severe right heart (RH) 
dilation and dysfunction with a crossing membrane structure in the right atrium. 
Right heart catheterization confirmed high output heart failure (HOHF), 
pulmonary hypertension (PH), and left-to-right blood shunting followed by the 
documentation of multiple liver and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations 
(AVMs). Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) diagnosis was made according 
to clinical criteria and was established as the cause of HOHF because of chronic 
volume overload from systemic to pulmonary shunts. With this illustrative case, 
we aim to discuss the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of HHT and the 
unusual phenotype of HOHF secondary to HHT. This case also highlights the broad 
diagnosis of atrial echocardiographic abnormalities and cardiac structural 
distortion secondary to high output that can be misleading at imaging 
evaluation."
1936,"To investigate the relationship of preoperative high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin T (hs-cTnT) with early postoperative hypoxemia (EPH) following off-pump 
coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). Records of patients undergoing OPCAB 
between 2018 and 2022 were reviewed. Baseline characteristics and postoperative 
arterial blood gas analysis were derived from the cardiovascular surgery 
electronic medical records. Preoperative hs-cTnT levels were measured routinely 
in all patients. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test the 
association of preoperative hs-cTnT with EPH. A total of 318 OPCAB patients were 
included, who had a preoperative hs-cTnT test available for review. Before 
surgery, 198 patients (62%) had a rise in hs-cTnT level (≥14 ng/L) and 127 
patients (40%) had a more severe hs-cTnT level (≥25 ng/L). The preoperative 
hs-cTnT level was associated with EPH (odds ratio per ng/L, 1.86; 95% confidence 
interval 1.30-2.68; p &lt; 0.001), prolonged intensive care unit stay (odds 
ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.32; p = 0.019), and delayed 
extubating time (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval 1.15-2.34; p = 
0.007). On multivariable analysis, adjusted for BMI, hypertension, smoking 
status, serum creatinine, and cardiac function, preoperative hs-cTnT remained an 
independent factor associated with EPH. Elevation of hs-cTnT concentrations are 
significantly associated with EPH after OPCAB. Review of presurgical hs-cTnT 
concentration may help identify patients who would benefit from OPCAB to improve 
surgical risk assessment."
1937,"BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness, measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV), is a 
purported mechanism linking sedentary behavior to cardiovascular disease. This 
secondary analysis compared associations between measured carotid-femoral PWV 
(cfPWV) and carotid-radial (crPWV) responses to an acute bout of prolonged 
sitting with mathematically estimated cfPWV (ePWV).
METHODS: Overweight/obese adults with elevated blood pressure were enrolled (n = 
25; 42 ± 12 yrs; 64% males). Participants performed an 8 h simulated workday of 
mostly sitting. cfPWV and crPWV were measured while supine in the morning, 
midday, and afternoon. ePWV was calculated at the same timepoints using age and 
seated mean arterial pressure (MAP). Pearson correlation coefficients associated 
ePWV with cfPWV and crPWV. Generalized linear models separately examined the 
effects of time on cfPWV, crPWV, and ePWV.
RESULTS: ePWV significantly associated with cfPWV and crPWV (r = 0.69 and 0.55, 
respectively; p &lt; 0.05) in the morning (baseline). cfPWV significantly 
increased over time (β = 0.52 ± 0.20 and 0.48 ± 0.21 with and without MAP 
adjustment, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, ePWV and crPWV did not 
significantly increase overtime (β = 0.14 ± 0.09 and 0.25 ± 0.23, respectively; 
p &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, although ePWV is associated with cfPWV 
and crPWV at a fixed timepoint, ePWV responds differently to prolonged sitting 
and likely does not capture the same acute vascular responses."
1938,"CD8 cytotoxic T cells are a potent line of defense against invading pathogens. 
To aid in curtailing aberrant immune responses, the activation status of CD8 T 
cells is highly regulated. One mechanism in which CD8 T cell responses are 
dampened is via signaling through the immune-inhibitory receptor Programmed Cell 
Death Protein-1, encoded by Pdcd1. Pdcd1 expression is regulated through 
engagement of the TCR, as well as by signaling from extracellular cytokines. 
Understanding such pathways has influenced the development of numerous clinical 
treatments. In this study, we showed that signals from the cytokine IL-6 
enhanced Pdcd1 expression when paired with TCR stimulation in murine CD8 T 
cells. Mechanistically, signals from IL-6 were propagated through activation of 
the transcription factor STAT3, resulting in IL-6-dependent binding of STAT3 to 
Pdcd1 cis-regulatory elements. Intriguingly, IL-6 stimulation overcame B 
Lymphocyte Maturation Protein 1-mediated epigenetic repression of Pdcd1, which 
resulted in a transcriptionally permissive landscape marked by heightened 
histone acetylation. Furthermore, in vivo-activated CD8 T cells derived from 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection required STAT3 for optimal 
Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 surface expression. Importantly, STAT3 was the 
only member of the STAT family present at Pdcd1 regulatory elements in 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Ag-specific CD8 T cells. Collectively, these 
data define mechanisms by which the IL-6/STAT3 signaling axis can enhance and 
prolong Pdcd1 expression in murine CD8 T cells."
1939,"Hematopoiesis integrates cytokine signaling, metabolism, and epigenetic 
modifications to regulate blood cell generation. These processes are linked, as 
metabolites provide essential substrates for epigenetic marks. In this study, we 
demonstrate that ATP citrate lyase (Acly), which metabolizes citrate to generate 
cytosolic acetyl-CoA and is of clinical interest, can regulate chromatin 
accessibility to limit myeloid differentiation. Acly was tested for a role in 
murine hematopoiesis by small-molecule inhibition or genetic deletion in 
lineage-depleted, c-Kit-enriched hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from 
Mus musculus. Treatments increased the abundance of cell populations that 
expressed the myeloid integrin CD11b and other markers of myeloid 
differentiation. When single-cell RNA sequencing was performed, we found that 
Acly inhibitor-treated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells exhibited greater 
gene expression signatures for macrophages and enrichment of these populations. 
Similarly, the single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing 
showed increased chromatin accessibility at genes associated with myeloid 
differentiation, including CD11b, CD11c, and IRF8. Mechanistically, Acly 
deficiency altered chromatin accessibility and expression of multiple C/EBP 
family transcription factors known to regulate myeloid differentiation and cell 
metabolism, with increased Cebpe and decreased Cebpa and Cebpb. This effect of 
Acly deficiency was accompanied by altered mitochondrial metabolism with 
decreased mitochondrial polarization but increased mitochondrial content and 
production of reactive oxygen species. The bias to myeloid differentiation 
appeared due to insufficient generation of acetyl-CoA, as exogenous acetate to 
support alternate compensatory pathways to produce acetyl-CoA reversed this 
phenotype. Acly inhibition thus can promote myelopoiesis through deprivation of 
acetyl-CoA and altered histone acetylome to regulate C/EBP transcription factor 
family activity for myeloid differentiation."
1940,"BACKGROUND: The sensitivity of newborn screening (NBS) in detecting infants that 
later develop symptomatic vitamin B12 deficiency is unknown. We evaluated the 
predictive value using NBS algorithms in detecting infants that later were 
clinically diagnosed with symptomatic B12 deficiency. Furthermore, we 
investigated whether being born in a hospital using nitrous oxide (N2O) as pain 
relief in labor may have had an impact on total homocysteine at NBS.
METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved NBS data and analyzed total homocysteine, 
methylmalonic acid and methyl citrate on stored NBS dried blood spots (DBS) of 
70 infants diagnosed with symptomatic B12 deficiency and compared them to 646 
matched and 434 unmatched DBS controls to evaluate the Austrian and Heidelberg 
B12 NBS algorithms.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of NBS in detecting infants later diagnosed with 
symptomatic B12 deficiency at median age 10.9 weeks was ≤10%. Total homocysteine 
was higher in DBS for the unmatched controls who were born in hospitals 
providing N2O compared to in hospitals not providing N2O, with median total 
homocysteine 4.0 µmol/L compared to 3.5 µmol/L (n = 434, 95% CI 0.04-0.87, p = 
0.03).
CONCLUSION: NBS algorithms were unable to identify most infants diagnosed with 
symptomatic B12 deficiency after the neonatal period. Being born in hospitals 
providing N2O may impact total homocysteine at NBS."
1941,"In this study, we modified a fully automatic immunoassay on ceruloplasmin 
concentration on dried blood spots (DBS) to increase its analytical sensitivity 
in order to accurately differentiate newborns from true Wilson disease (WD) 
patients. Modifications to the assay parameters of the Roche/Hitachi Cobas c 
systems immunoturbidimetric assay are adjusted to lower the limit of 
quantitation to 0.60 mg/L from 30 mg/L. This enables sensitive measurement of 
ceruloplasmin in eluent after DBS extraction. In addition, reference intervals 
and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for diagnostic cut-off were 
established using DBS of neonates and WD adult patients. After DBS whole blood 
calibration, the 95th percentile of the reference interval for newborns was 
86-229 mg/L. The cut-off value of 54 mg/L was found to be the most optimal point 
for differentiating true adult WD from newborn controls. This test shows a high 
area under curve of 1.000 with 100% sensitivity and specificity in 
differentiating normal newborns from WD adult samples. However, the results 
should be further validated with true newborn WD patient samples together with 
the consideration of other factors that can also lead to low ceruloplasmin 
levels. This test shows application potential in newborn screening for WD, which 
can save lives through early identification and timely treatment."
1942,"Parents increasingly utilise the internet to obtain information on health 
practices, but the quality of online information about screening for inherited 
metabolic diseases (IMD) needs to be improved. A content analysis examined how 
IMD blood and urine tests were described online in local healthcare sectors 
between May and June 2021. Among the nine resources, four were blood test 
providers and five were urine test providers. All mentioned the test benefits 
and procedures. Other information, such as false-positive/negative or risk of 
pain, was infrequently mentioned. The descriptions of urine tests are advertised 
as outperforming blood tests and can be purchased from commercial laboratory 
sites without medical guidance. Two urine test providers claimed no false 
results were reported. A few commercial advertisements highlighted the 
simplicity of the urine test and potentially overstated the invasiveness of the 
blood test. We found that some advertisements described IMD as ""silent killers"" 
and emphasised the advantage of getting ""reassurance"" in controlling the child's 
developmental health and well-being. To better protect the parents, or broadly, 
the public interest, regulatory and oversight measures on the urine tests should 
be implemented to promote the proper use of genetic tests. Without timely 
regulation and oversight, the incorrect descriptions might create a public 
misconception about utilising these commercial laboratory tests to inform health 
decisions."
1943,"Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the most universal platform currently 
available for the analysis of enzymatic activities and biomarkers in dried blood 
spots (DBS) for applications in newborn screening (NBS). Among the MS/MS 
applications in NBS, the most common is flow-injection analysis (FIA-) MS/MS, 
where the sample is introduced as a bolus injection into the mass spectrometer 
without the prior fractionation of analytes. Liquid chromatography combined with 
MS/MS (LC-MS/MS) has been employed for second-tier tests to reduce the 
false-positive rate associated with several nonspecific screening markers, 
beginning two decades ago. More recently, LC-MS/MS has been applied to primary 
screening for new conditions for which FIA-MS/MS or other methods, including 
genomic screening, are not yet adequate. In addition to providing a list of the 
currently used LC-MS/MS-based assays for NBS, the authors share their experience 
regarding the maintenance requirements of LC-MS/MS vs. FIA-MS/MS systems. The 
consensus is that the maintenance of LC-MS/MS and FIA-MS/MS instrumentation is 
similar, and LC-MS/MS has the advantage of allowing for a larger number of 
diseases to be screened for in a multiplex, cost-effective fashion with a high 
throughput and an adequate turnaround time."
1944,"IntroductionThe Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) is a seven-item questionnaire 
assessing symptoms that asthma clinicians consider to be most important for 
evaluating the adequacy of asthma control. An online version of the ACQ may be 
able to indicate whether a visit to the physician is warranted to modify therapy 
to achieve better control of their asthma, ultimately reducing the number of 
unnecessary visits, particularly during the pandemic. The aim of our study is to 
compare the paper and online ACQ to validate the online version for use in 
real-life settings.MethodsOur study included 28 patients who completed both 
paper and the online ACQ on the same day when they came home. The online version 
of the questionnaire was prepared to look similar to the paper form, with the 
same sentences and answers.ResultsThe correlation between paper and online ACQ 
questionnaires was very high (r = 0.935; p < 0.001). When comparing each 
individual item, correlation coefficients ranged from 0.672 to 0.935. The lowest 
correlation is obtained in activity limitations, while the next one is 0.767, 
others higher than 0.8. The online form gave small and insignificantly higher 
scores compared to paper form with mean difference between -0.07 and 0.21. Mean 
difference of 0.01 (p = 0.986) between paper ACQ and online ACQ is 
obtained.ConclusionThe online version of the ACQ can be used for asthma control 
monitoring in pediatric patients in order to minimize unnecessary social 
contacts as well as hospital patient load, but retain adequate surveillance of 
disease symptoms by their physician."
1945,"The traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture methods have a long history of 
mimicking in vivo cell growth. However, these methods cannot fully represent 
physiological conditions, which lack two major indexes of the in vivo 
environment; one is a three-dimensional 3D cell environment, and the other is 
mechanical stimulation; therefore, they are incapable of replicating the 
essential cellular communications between cell to cell, cell to the 
extracellular matrix, and cellular responses to dynamic mechanical stimulation 
in a physiological condition of body movement and blood flow. To solve these 
problems and challenges, 3D cell carriers have been gradually developed to 
provide a 3D matrix-like structure for cell attachment, proliferation, 
differentiation, and communication in static and dynamic culture conditions. 3D 
cell carriers in dynamic culture systems could primarily provide different 
mechanical stimulations which further mimic the real in vivo microenvironment. 
In this review, the current advances in 3D dynamic cell culture approaches have 
been introduced, with their advantages and disadvantages being discussed in 
comparison to traditional 2D cell culture in static conditions."
1946,"In the field of tissue engineering, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) 
effectively regenerates damaged tissue and restores its biological function. 
However, FGF-2 readily diffuses and degrades under physiological conditions. 
Therefore, methods for the sustained and localized delivery of FGF-2 are needed. 
Drug delivery systems using hydrogels as carriers have attracted significant 
interest. Injectable hydrogels with an affinity for FGF-2 are candidates for 
FGF-2 delivery systems. In this study, we fabricated a hydrogel from 
phenol-grafted alginate sulfate (AlgS-Ph) and investigated its application to 
the delivery of FGF-2. The hydrogel was prepared under mild conditions via 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mediated cross-linking. Surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR) measurements show that the AlgS-Ph hydrogel has an affinity for FGF-2 in 
accordance with its degree of sulfation. Conditions for the preparation of the 
AlgS-Ph hydrogel, including HRP and H2O2 concentrations, are optimized so that 
the hydrogel can be used as an injectable drug carrier. The hydrogel shows no 
cytotoxicity when using 10T1/2 cells as a model cell line. The angiogenesis 
assay shows that FGF-2 released from the AlgS-Ph hydrogel promotes the formation 
of blood vessels. These results indicate that the AlgS-Ph hydrogel is a suitable 
candidate for the FGF-2 carrier."
1947,"Background: The endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms has become 
widespread but may still be limited by recurrence rates or complications. The 
discovery of novel embolic strategies may help mitigate these concerns. Methods: 
We formulated a Photosensitive Hydrogel Polymer (PHP) embolic agent which is 
low-viscosity, shear-thinning, and radio-opaque. After the filling of an 
aneurysm with PHP with balloon assistance, we utilized photopolymerization to 
induce solidification. Different methods of light delivery for 
photopolymerization were assessed in silicone models of aneurysms and in four 
acute animal trials with venous anastomosis aneurysms in pigs. Then, 
balloon-assisted embolization with PHP and photopolymerization was performed in 
three aneurysms in pigs with a one-month follow-up. Filling volume, recurrence 
rates, and complications were recorded. Results: The PHP was found to be 
suitable for the intravascular delivery and treatment of cerebral aneurysms. It 
was found that light delivery through the balloon catheter, as opposed to light 
delivery through the injection microcatheter, led to higher rates of filling in 
the 3D model and acute animal model for cerebral aneurysms. Using the 
balloon-assisted embolization and light delivery strategy, three wide-necked 
aneurysms were treated without complication. One-month follow-up showed no 
recurrence or neck remnants. Conclusions: We demonstrated a novel method of 
balloon-assisted photosensitive hydrogel polymer embolization and 
photopolymerization, leading to complete aneurysm filling with no recurrence at 
1 month in three wide-necked aneurysms in pigs. This promising methodology will 
be investigated further with longer-term comparative animal trials."
1948,"The research was oriented towards the preparation of aerogel particles based on 
egg white and whey protein isolate using various dispersion methods: dripping, 
spraying, and homogenization. Based on the results of analytical studies, the 
most appropriate samples were selected to obtain aerogels loaded with the drug. 
The results of the experimental research were used to study methods for 
obtaining nasal drug delivery systems based on aerogels. Protein aerogels were 
obtained by thermal gelation followed by supercritical drying. The obtained 
particles of protein aerogels have a specific surface area of up to 350 m2/g 
with a pore volume of up to 2.9 cm3/g, as well as a porosity of up to 95%. The 
results of experimental studies have shown that changing the dispersion method 
makes it possible to control the structural characteristics of protein aerogel 
particles. The results of the studies were applied to obtain innovative nasal 
drug delivery systems for the treatment of socially significant diseases. 
Analytical studies were conducted to determine the amount and state of adsorbed 
drugs in protein aerogel particles, as well as in vivo experiments on the 
distribution of clomipramine in blood plasma and brain tissue of rats to study 
the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the resulting drug-loaded protein 
aerogel."
1949,"Understanding socioeconomic inequalities in non-communicable disease prevalence 
and preventive care usage can help design effective action plans for health 
equality programs among India's aging population. Hypertension (HTN) and 
diabetes mellitus (DM) are frequently used as model non-communicable diseases 
for research and policy purposes as these two are the most prevalent NCDs in 
India and are the leading causes of mortality. For this investigation, data on 
31,464 older persons (aged 60 years and above) who took part in the Longitudinal 
Ageing Survey of India (LASI: 2017-2018) were analyzed. The concentration index 
was used to assess socioeconomic inequality whereas relative inequalities 
indices were used to compare HTN, DM, and preventive care usage between the 
different groups of individuals based on socioeconomic status. The study reveals 
that wealthy older adults in India had a higher frequency of HTN and DM than the 
poor elderly. Significant differences in the usage of preventive care, such as 
blood pressure/blood glucose monitoring, were found among people with HTN or DM. 
Furthermore, economic position, education, type of work, and residential status 
were identified as important factors for monitoring inequalities in access to 
preventive care for HTN and DM. Disparities in non-communicable diseases can be 
both a cause and an effect of inequality across social strata in India."
1950,"We assessed the association between polypharmacy and cardiovascular autonomic 
function among community-dwelling elderly patients having chronic diseases. 
Three hundred and twenty-one patients from an urban municipality area of 
Kolkata, India were studied in August 2022. The anticholinergic burden and 
cardiac autonomic function (Valsalva ratio, orthostatic hypotension, change in 
diastolic blood pressure after an isometric exercise, and heart rate variability 
during expiration and inspiration) were evaluated. Binary logistic regression 
analysis was performed to find out the association of polypharmacy and total 
anticholinergic burden with cardiac autonomic neuropathy. A total of 305 
patients (age, 68.9 ± 3.4; 65.9% male) were included. Of these patients, 81 
(26.6%) were on polypharmacy. Out of these 81 patients, 42 patients were on 
ninety-eight potential inappropriate medications. The anticholinergic burden and 
the proportion of patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy were significantly 
higher among patients who were on polypharmacy than those who were not (8.1 ± 
2.3 vs. 2.3 ± 0.9; p = 0.03 and 56.8% vs. 44.6%; p = 0.01). The presence of 
polypharmacy and a total anticholinergic burden of &gt; 3 was significantly 
associated with cardiac autonomic neuropathy (aOR, 2.66; 95% CI, 0.91-3.98 and 
aOR, 2.51; 95% CI, 0.99-3.52, respectively). Thus, polypharmacy was 
significantly associated with cardiac autonomic neuropathy among 
community-dwelling elderly patients."
1951,"Astrocytes and brain endothelial cells are components of the neurovascular unit 
that comprises the blood brain barrier (BBB) and their dysfunction contributes 
to pathogenesis in Huntington's disease (HD). Defining the contribution of these 
cells to disease can inform cell-type specific effects and uncover new 
disease-modifying therapeutic targets. These cells express integrin (ITG) 
adhesion receptors that anchor the cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) to 
maintain the integrity of the BBB. We used HD patient-derived induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) modeling to study the ECM-ITG interface in 
astrocytes and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and found ECM-ITG 
dysregulation in human iPSC-derived cells that may contribute to dysfunction of 
the BBB in HD. This disruption has functional consequences since reducing ITG 
expression in glia in an HD Drosophila model suppressed disease-associated CNS 
dysfunction. Since ITGs can be targeted therapeutically and manipulating ITG 
signaling prevents neurodegeneration in other diseases, defining the role of 
ITGs in HD may provide a novel strategy of intervention to slow CNS 
pathophysiology to treat HD."
1952,"Qualitative platelet disorders remain rare and varied. We describe here 2 
additional patients with giant platelets, thrombocytopenia, deficiency in alpha 
granules and the presence of membranous inclusions within the cytoplasm. 
Collectively known as Medich syndrome, we further elucidated structural and 
clinical features of this rare syndrome. Platelets obtained from 2 patients with 
macro-thrombocytopenia were evaluated by electron microscopy. Structural 
findings were correlated with clinical characteristics. The defining morphologic 
feature found in the platelets of these patients is the presence of long, 
tubular inclusions consisting of several layers of membrane wrapped around a 
core of cytoplasm. These inclusions may deform the discoid shape of the 
platelet. In addition, abnormal giant alpha granules are present. Clinically all 
patients in the current report and review of the literature had mucosal bleeding 
and were often misdiagnosed as having immune related thrombocytopenia. To date 
five cases of Medich giant platelet syndrome have been reported. The cases are 
unified by the ultrastructural findings of abnormal alpha granules and unusual 
cytoplasmic scrolls. All patients experienced mucosal bleeding, however many 
clinical, biologic and genetic characteristics of this rare disorder remain to 
be determined."
1953,"The reservoir for zoonotic o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) has remained unknown since 
this virus was first recognized in Uganda in 1959. Building on existing evidence 
for mosquito blood-feeding on various frugivorous bat species in Uganda, and 
seroprevalence for arboviruses among bats in Uganda, we sought to assess if 
serum samples collected from bats in Uganda demonstrated evidence of exposure to 
ONNV or the closely related zoonotic chikungunya virus (CHIKV). In total, 652 
serum samples collected from six bat species were tested by plaque reduction 
neutralization test (PRNT) for neutralizing antibodies against ONNV and CHIKV. 
Forty out of 303 (13.2%) Egyptian rousettes from Maramagambo Forest and 1/13 
(8%) little free-tailed bats from Banga Nakiwogo, Entebbe contained neutralizing 
antibodies against ONNV. In addition, 2/303 (0.7%) of these Egyptian rousettes 
contained neutralizing antibodies to CHIKV, and 8/303 (2.6%) contained 
neutralizing antibodies that were nonspecifically reactive to alphaviruses. 
These data support the interepidemic circulation of ONNV and CHIKV in Uganda, 
although Egyptian rousette bats are unlikely to serve as reservoirs for these 
viruses given the inconsistent occurrence of antibody-positive bats."
1954,"This study investigated whether Greek Orthodox Christian fasting during Holy 
Week can change body composition and cardiometabolic parameters in overweight 
individuals, and whether these changes are maintained one week after fasting 
cessation (FC). Body composition and physiological and biochemical parameters 
were measured before, immediately after (n = 23) and one week after FC (subgroup 
of n = 10). Fasting resulted in decreased body weight, waist circumference, 
waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index and total body fat, as well as blood 
glucose, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. 
Nutrition analysis showed a decreased protein and saturated fat intake during 
fasting. FC (n = 10) resulted in a decreased carbohydrate intake and increased 
protein and cholesterol intake compared to fasting. Fasting resulted in 
decreased blood glucose, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels but 
returned to pre-fasting levels after FC. Greek Orthodox Christian fasting during 
Holy Week is beneficial for body composition and some aspects of cardiometabolic 
health. However, these favourable changes are not maintained one week following 
fasting."
1955,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is defined as the obstruction of the pulmonary artery or 
one of its branches by a blood clot, tumor, air, or fat emboli originating 
elsewhere in the body. A saddle PE occurs when the obstruction affects the 
bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery trunk. We present a case of a 
46-year-old man who presented to our hospital due to an episode of syncope. 
Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest showed extensive PE and 
abdominal CT scan showed a large 8 cm left renal mass with inferior vena cava 
(IVC) thrombus. Emergent embolectomy, left total nephrectomy, and IVC tumor 
removal were performed yielding the diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC). Interestingly, our patient did not experience any symptoms related to his 
RCC until the diagnosis of PE due to syncope, and the asymptomatic tumor was 
found out to be the possible cause of this PE due to the presence of tumor cells 
constituting the tumor embolus. It is thus recommended to improve the early 
screening process for RCC. Besides, clinicians should pay attention to patients 
presenting with uncharacteristic symptoms of RCC who might present with symptoms 
of saddle PE."
1956,"BACKGROUND: Tixagevimab/cilgavimab (TGM/CGM) are neutralizing monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) directed against different epitopes of the receptor-binding 
domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that have been considered as pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP).
OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to assess the efficacy and safety of TGM/CGM to 
prevent COVID-19 in patients at high risk for breakthrough and severe SARS-CoV-2 
infection who never benefited maximally from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and for 
those who have a contraindication to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
DESIGN: This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. The Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was 
followed.
METHODS: Electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, medRxiv, ProQuest, Wiley 
online library, Medline, and Nature) were searched from 1 December 2021 to 30 
November 2022 in the English language using the following keywords alone or in 
combination: 2019-nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 
2019, SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, tixagevimab, 
cilgavimab, combination, monoclonal, passive, immunization, antibody, efficacy, 
clinical trial, cohort, pre-exposure, prophylaxis, and prevention. We included 
studies in moderate to severe immunocompromised adults (aged ≥18 years) and 
children (aged ≥12 years) who cannot be vaccinated against COVID-19 or may have 
an inadequate response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The effect sizes of the 
outcome of measures were pooled with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and risk 
ratios (RRs).
RESULTS: Of the 76 papers that were identified, 30 articles were included in the 
qualitative analysis and 13 articles were included in the quantitative analysis 
(23 cohorts, 5 case series, 1 care report, and 1 randomized clinical trial). 
Studies involving 27,932 patients with high risk for breakthrough and severe 
COVID-19 that reported use of TGM/CGM combination were analyzed (all were adults 
(100%), 62.8% were men, and patients were mainly immunocompromised (66.6%)). The 
patients' ages ranged from 19.7 years to 79.8 years across studies. TGM/CGM use 
was associated with lower COVID-19-related hospitalization rate (0.54% vs. 1.2%, 
p = 0.27), lower ICU admission rate (0.6% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.68), lower mortality 
rate (0.2% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.67), higher neutralization of COVID-19 Omicron 
variant rate (12.9% vs. 6%, p = 0.60), lower proportion of patients who needed 
oxygen therapy (8% vs. 41.2%, p = 0.27), lower RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate 
(2.1% vs. 5.8%, p &lt; 0.01), lower proportion of patients who had severe 
COVID-19 (0% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.79), lower proportion of patients who had 
symptomatic COVID-19 (1.8% vs. 6%, p = 0.22), and higher adverse effects rate 
(11.1% vs. 10.7%, p = 0.0066) than no treatment or other alternative treatment 
in the prevention of COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: For PrEP, TGM/CGM-based treatment can be associated with a better 
clinical outcome than no treatment or other alternative treatment. However, more 
randomized control trials are warranted to confirm our findings and investigate 
the efficacy and safety of TGM/CGM to prevent COVID-19 in patients at risk for 
breakthrough or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection."
1957,"Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder that usually manifests 
in childhood due to mutations in the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene. 
It is believed that there is an association between this gene 
mutation/polymorphism and cancer risk, including breast, lung, and pancreatic 
cancers. We report a rare case of a 69-year-old woman who developed three 
different primary cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in both 
lungs and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and was later found to have a rarely 
reported variant mutation in the ATM gene, namely Exon 39, c.5644 C &gt; T. We 
hypothesize that the ATM gene, c.5644 C &gt; T mutation could be a plausible 
contributor in the pathogenesis of these three cancers. This hypothesis has yet 
to be validated by larger studies that focus on a mechanistic approach involving 
DNA repair genes such as the ATM. More importantly, this paves the way to 
developing new patient-specific targeted therapies and inaugurating precision 
medicine as a cornerstone in cancer therapeutics."
1958,"The aim of this project was to determine research priorities, barriers, and 
enablers for adult primary brain tumour research in Australia and New Zealand. 
Consumers, health professionals, and researchers were invited to participate in 
a two-phase modified Delphi study. Phase 1 comprised an initial online survey (n 
= 91) and then focus groups (n = 29) which identified 60 key research topics, 26 
barriers, and 32 enablers. Phase 2 comprised two online surveys to (1) reduce 
the list to 37 research priorities which achieved consensus (&gt;75% 2-point 
agreement) and had high mean importance ratings (n = 116 participants) and (2) 
determine the most important priorities, barriers, and enablers (n = 90 
participants). The top ten ranked research priorities for the overall sample and 
sub-groups (consumers, health professionals, and researchers) were identified. 
Priorities focused on: tumour biology, pre-clinical research, clinical and 
translational research, and supportive care. Variations were seen between 
sub-groups. The top ten barriers to conducting brain tumour research related to 
funding and resources, accessibility and awareness of research, collaboration, 
and process. The top ten research enablers were funding and resources, 
collaboration, and workforce. The broad list of research priorities identified 
by this Delphi study, together with how consumers, health professionals, and 
researchers prioritised items differently, and provides an evidence-based 
research agenda for brain tumour research that is needed across a wide range of 
areas."
1959,"The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy for women 
with early-stage, high-risk, HER2+ breast cancer has been observed to lead to 
higher pathologic complete response rates (pCR), and improved event-free 
survival compared to trastuzumab and chemotherapy alone. Based on available 
data, neoadjuvant pertuzumab is recommended by ESMO, ASCO, and NICE as well as 
by a Canadian Consensus Guideline Group. We discuss the implications for 
Canadian patients with HER2+ early breast cancer due to a second and final 
negative funding decision by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in 
Health (CADTH) related to neoadjuvant pertuzumab. This decision will have 
adverse impacts for up to 1 in 6 women receiving neoadjuvant therapy for 
high-risk HER2+ breast cancer, due to suboptimal pCR rates and higher risks of 
invasive breast cancer recurrent events, resulting in the need for more toxic 
adjuvant therapy."
1960,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality worldwide, and its incidence has increased rapidly in the United 
States over the past two decades. Liver transplant is considered curative, but 
is not always possible, and pre-transplant immunotherapy is of great interest as 
a modality for downstaging the tumor burden. We present a review of the 
literature on pre-liver transplant immunotherapy use in patients with HCC. Our 
literature search queried publications in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Web of 
Science, and ultimately identified 24 original research publications to be 
included for analysis. We found that the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 in risk 
stratification for rejection is of special interest to researchers, and ongoing 
randomized clinical trials PLENTY and Dulect 2020-1 will provide insight into 
the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 in liver transplant management in the future. This 
literature search and the resulting review represents the most thorough 
collection, analysis, and presentation of the literature on the subject to date."
1961,"OBJECTIVES: Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) exposes the kidney to 
ischemia-reperfusion injury. Blood loss and hypotension are also associated with 
kidney injury. We aimed to test the hypothesis that, during NSS, both ischemia 
duration and blood loss significantly affect postoperative renal function and 
that their effects interact.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing NSS were enrolled. The primary endpoint 
was renal function expressed as the absolute delta between preoperative and 
postoperative peak creatinine. We developed a generalized linear model with the 
ischemia duration and absolute hemoglobin difference as independent variables, 
their interaction term, and the RENAL score. The model was than expanded to 
include a history of hypertension (as a proxy for hypotension susceptibility) 
and related interaction terms. Further, we described the perioperative and 
mid-term oncological outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 478 patients underwent NSS, and 209 (43.7%) required 
ischemia for a mean of 10.9 min (SD 8). Both the ischemia duration (partial eta 
0.842, p = 0.006) and hemoglobin difference (partial eta 0.933, p = 0.029) 
significantly affected postoperative renal function, albeit without evidence of 
a significant interaction (p = 0.525). The RENAL score also significantly 
influenced postoperative renal function (p = 0.023). After the addition of a 
previous history of hypertension, the effects persisted, with a significant 
interaction between blood loss and a history of hypertension (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Ischemia duration and blood loss had a similar impact on 
postoperative renal function, albeit without potentiating each other. While the 
surgical technique and ischemia minimization remain crucial to postoperative 
kidney function, increased awareness of conscious hemodynamic management appears 
warranted."
1962,"BACKGROUND: In the ATLANTIS study, second-line lurbinectedin/doxorubicin did not 
improve overall survival (OS), however patients with a chemotherapy-free 
interval (CTFI) of ≥180 days had an improved progression free survival (PFS). 
The objective of this retrospective study was to identify the proportion of 
real-world small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients who are suitable for 
lurbinectedin-based therapy based on these criteria.
METHODS: A retrospective study of all SCLC referred to BC Cancer between 2012 
and 2017 was conducted. Patient demographics, staging, treatment, and survival 
data were collected retrospectively. Baseline characteristics were compared 
using descriptive statistics. OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Statistically significant p-value was &lt;0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 1048 patients were identified. Baseline characteristics: 
median age 68 years, 47% male, 61% current smoking status, 68% extensive 
disease. Best supportive care was received by 22%. First-line systemic therapy 
was platinum doublet for 71% of the population. Second-line systemic therapy was 
delivered to 22%. Of the 219 patients who received second-line systemic therapy 
after platinum doublet, 183 patients had a CTFI of ≥90 days and 107 patients had 
a CTFI of ≥180 days. Patients originally treated as limited stage disease, 
received platinum doublet as second line, received thoracic radiation (RT) or 
prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) were more likely to have a CTFI of ≥90 
and ≥180 days.
CONCLUSION: In our real-world SCLC population, only 21% of the SCLC population 
received second-line therapy after platinum doublet with 17% achieving CTFI of 
≥90 days and 10% CTFI of ≥180 days. Based on this retrospective review, only a 
small fraction of platinum-treated patients would be preferentially offered 
lurbinectedin in the second-line setting."
1963,"In recent years, a dynamic development of oncology has been observed, resulting 
from the increasingly frequent occurrence of neoplasms and therefore, increasing 
population of patients. The most effective form of therapy for cancer patients 
is complex multidisciplinary specialized disease management, including 
nephro-oncology care. Different forms of renal function impairment are 
frequently diagnosed in cancer patients. They are caused by different 
co-morbidities existing before starting the oncologic treatment as well as the 
direct undesirable effects of this therapy which may cause temporary or 
irreversible damage of the urinary system-especially kidneys. According to 
different therapeutic programs, in such cases the degree of renal damage is 
often crucial for the possibility of further anti-cancer treatment. Medical 
personnel responsible for delivering care to oncology patients should be 
properly educated on current methods of prevention and treatment of renal 
complications resulting from anti-cancer therapy. The development of oncologic 
medicines design, including especially immuno-oncological agents, obliges us to 
learn new patomechanisms determining potential adverse effects, including renal 
complications. This publication is focused on the most important undesirable 
nephrotoxic effects of the frequently used anti-cancer drugs."
1964,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes (DM2) and the consecutively daily use of 
antidiabetic medication are characterized by a frequent prevalence worldwide and 
were shown to impact the initiation and progression of malignant diseases. While 
these effects were observed in a variety of malignancies, comprehensive data 
about the role of DM2 and antidiabetic drugs in the outcome of head and neck 
melanoma (HNM) patients are missing.
METHODS: This retrospective population-based cohort study included 382 HNM 
patients from Eastern Bavaria having received tumor resection to negative 
margins between 2010 and 2017. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was evaluated with 
regard to DM2 and routine metformin intake. Statistical analysis was performed 
by uni- and multivariate analyses. The median follow-up time was 5.6 years.
RESULTS: DM2 was diagnosed in 68 patients (17.8%), routine metformin intake was 
found in 39 cases (10.2%). The univariate survival analysis revealed impaired 
5-year RFS in HNM patients with DM2 compared to non-diabetic controls (p = 
0.016; 64.0% and 74.5%, respectively). The multivariate Cox regression 
substantiated this effect (HR = 1.980, 95% CI = 1.108-3.538, p = 0.021). In 
detail, the cumulative locoregional recurrence rate displayed the most 
far-reaching negative effect on the RFS of diabetic HNM patients (HR = 4.173, 
95% CI = 1.628-10.697, p = 0.003). For metformin intake, a profound positive 
effect on the RFS in multivariate statistics was observed, both in the complete 
cohort (HR = 0.396, 95% CI = 0.177-0.884, p = 0.024) as well as in the cohort of 
diabetic HNM patients (HR = 0.352, 95% CI = 0.135-0.913, p = 0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes that DM2 is a relevant comorbid condition in 
HNM patients, impairing patient survival. Metformin intake was associated with a 
favorable outcome in HNM patients, providing possible therapeutic implications 
for future adjuvant treatment regimes."
1965,"Pretherapeutic serological parameters play a predictive role in pathologic risk 
factors (PRF), which correlate with treatment and prognosis in cervical cancer 
(CC). However, the method of pre-operative prediction to PRF is limited and the 
clinical availability of machine learning methods remains unknown in CC. 
Overall, 1260 early-stage CC patients treated with radical hysterectomy (RH) 
were randomly split into training and test cohorts. Six machine learning 
classifiers, including Gradient Boosting Machine, Support Vector Machine with 
Gaussian kernel, Random Forest, Conditional Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and 
Elastic Net, were used to derive diagnostic information from nine clinical 
factors and 75 parameters readily available from pretreatment peripheral blood 
tests. The best results were obtained by RF in deep stromal infiltration 
prediction with an accuracy of 70.8% and AUC of 0.767. The highest accuracy and 
AUC for predicting lymphatic metastasis with Cforest were 64.3% and 0.620, 
respectively. The highest accuracy of prediction for lymphavascular space 
invasion with EN was 59.7% and the AUC was 0.628. Blood markers, including 
D-dimer and uric acid, were associated with PRF. Machine learning methods can 
provide critical diagnostic prediction on PRF in CC before surgical 
intervention. The use of predictive algorithms may facilitate individualized 
treatment options through diagnostic stratification."
1966,"PURPOSE: This paper aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the temporary 
redirection of blood flow of hepatoenteric collaterals using a balloon catheter 
in the common hepatic artery (CHA) to prevent the nontarget deposition of 90Y 
microspheres.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study of patients who 
received 90Y radioembolization (RE) from September 2010 to September 2015, 
diagnostic (67 patients) or treatment (72 patients) angiograms with the 
attempted use of a balloon catheter in the CHA to temporarily direct blood flow 
away from the hepatoenteric arteries were analyzed. SPECT/CT nuclear 
scintigraphy was performed after both diagnosis and treatment.
RESULTS: Overall, only 12 hepatoenteric arteries in 11 patients required 
embolization due to persistent hepatoenteric flow despite the use of the balloon 
occlusion technique in a total of 86 patients. Physicians performed the 90Y RE 
using balloon occlusion with glass (n = 22) or resin (n = 50) microspheres. Over 
80% administration of the prescribed 90Y dose was accomplished in 34 (67%) resin 
and 20 (95%) glass microsphere patients. Post-treatment 90Y RE scintigraphy 
confirmed the absence of extrahepatic activity in all patients. One grade 2 
gastrointestinal ulcer was present after 90 days of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Temporary CHA occlusion with a balloon catheter is a reliable and 
reproducible alternative to the conventional coil embolization of hepatoenteric 
arteries during diagnostic Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin and therapeutic 90Y RE 
delivery."
1967,"BACKGROUND: The Canadian Blood Services Cord Blood Bank (CBS CBB) was created to 
improve access to stem cell products for transplantation for patients across 
ethnic groups. An analysis of distributed units is needed to assess the 
effectiveness of the bank to meet the needs of patients from different ethnic 
groups.
METHODS: A descriptive analysis was performed on all cord blood units 
distributed from the CBS' CBB as of 30 June 2022.
RESULTS: Distribution of the first 60 units based on CBS' CBB inventory has been 
linear over time. A similar proportion of cord blood unit (CBU) recipients were 
pediatric or adult. More than half of the cord blood units (56.7%) were 
distributed to recipients outside of Canada, and CBUs were used to treat a broad 
range of hematologic and immune disorders. 43.3% of distributed CBUs were of 
non-Caucasian ethnicity and 18% were from donors self-reporting as multi-ethnic. 
The mean total nucleated cell counts and total CD34+ cell counts were 1.9 ± 0.1 
× 109 cells and 5.3 ± 0.5 × 106 CD34+ cells, respectively. CD34+ cells per kg 
(recipient weight) varied significantly between pediatric (age 0-4), adolescent 
(age 5-17) and adult recipients (age 18 and older) (3.1 ± 0.5, 1.4 ± 0.5 and 0.9 
± 0.07 × 105 CD34+ cells/kg, respectively). HLA matching was 6/6 (15%), 5/6 
(47%) or 4/6 (38%).
CONCLUSIONS: The CBS' CBB has facilitated the utilization of banked units for 
patients across a broad range of ages, geographic distribution, ethnicity, and 
diseases. Distributed units were well matched for HLA alleles and contained 
robust cell counts, reflecting a high-quality inventory with significant 
utility."
1968,"PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the albumin/globulin ratio (AGR), 
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) 
diagnostic and prognostic predictive value in a stratified population of 
prostate cancer (PC) cases.
METHODS: Population was divided based on the clinical and histologic diagnosis 
in: Group A: benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cases (494 cases); Group B: all 
PC cases (525 cases); Group B1: clinically significant PC (426 cases); Group B2: 
non-metastatic PC (416 cases); Group B3: metastatic PC (109 cases). NLR, PLR, 
and AGR were obtained at the time of the diagnosis, and only in cases with PC 
considered for radical prostatectomy, determinations were also repeated 90 days 
after surgery. For each ratio, cut-off values were determined by receiver 
operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis and fixed at 2.5, 120.0, and 1.4, 
respectively, for NLR, PLR, and AGR.
RESULTS: Accuracy in predictive value for an initial diagnosis of clinically 
significant PC (csPC) was higher using PLR (0.718) when compared to NLR (0.220) 
and AGR (0.247), but, despite high sensitivity (0.849), very low specificity 
(0.256) was present. The risk of csPC significantly increased only according to 
PLR with an OR = 1.646. The percentage of cases with metastatic PC significantly 
increased according to high NLR and high PLR. Accuracy was 0.916 and 0.813, 
respectively, for NLR and PLR cut-off, with higher specificity than sensitivity. 
The risk of a metastatic disease increased 3.2 times for an NLR &gt; 2.5 and 5.2 
times for a PLR &gt; 120 and at the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: PLR and NLR have a significant predictive value towards the 
development of metastatic disease but not in relation to variations in 
aggressiveness or T staging inside the non-metastatic PC. Our results suggest an 
unlikely introduction of these analyses into clinical practice in support of 
validated PC risk predictors."
1969,"Src is overexpressed in various cancers, including 27% of non-small cell lung 
cancer NSCLC, and is correlated with poor clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that 
Src kinase inhibitors, including Bosutinib, may exhibit clinical synergy in 
combination with the antifolate drug pemetrexed. In this Phase I, 
dose-escalation, safety, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)-determining study, 14 
patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors that had progressed on ""standard 
of care"" chemotherapy were enrolled in a 3 + 3 dose escalation study. Oral 
Bosutinib was administered once daily beginning on day 1, where the first cohort 
started at an oral dose of 200 mg daily with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV on a 
three-week schedule. The study's primary objective was to determine the 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the MTD of Bosutinib in combination with 
pemetrexed, and the type and frequency of adverse events associated with this 
treatment. Twelve patients were evaluable for response, including ten patients 
with adenocarcinoma of the lung, one patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma of 
the appendix, and one patient with urothelial carcinoma. The median number of 
Bosutinib and pemetrexed cycles received was 4 (range, 1-4). The MTD of oral 
Bosutinib in this combination was 300 mg daily. Two patients (17%) had a partial 
response (PR), and seven patients (58%) showed stable disease (SD) as the best 
response after the fourth cycle (end of treatment). One patient had disease 
progression after the second cycle, while three patients had disease progression 
after the fourth cycle. The two responders and the two patients with the longest 
stable disease duration or stabilization of disease following progression on 
multiple systemic therapies demonstrated Src overexpression on 
immunohistochemical staining of their tumor. The median progression-free 
survival (PFS) was 6.89 months (95% CI (3.48, 30.85)), and the median overall 
survival (OS) was 11.7 months (95% CI (3.87, 30.85)). Despite the limitations of 
this Phase I study, there appears to be potential efficacy of this combination 
in previously treated patients."
1970,"Our study aimed to evaluate the baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and 
systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) in relation to invasion, metastasis, 
and resectability for patients with gastric cancer, respectively, as predictors 
of death during hospitalization or surgical complications. A retrospective 
cohort study was conducted on 657 gastric cancer subjects. Inflammatory 
biomarkers were computed. The associations with tumor stage, metastasis, optimal 
procedure, in-hospital mortality, and surgical complications were evaluated. 
Subjects who underwent curative-intent surgery presented lower median NLRs (2.9 
vs. 3.79), PLRs (166.15 vs. 196.76), and SIIs (783.61 vs. 1122.25), and higher 
LMRs (3.34 vs. 2.9) than those who underwent palliative surgery. Significantly 
higher NLRs (3.3 vs. 2.64), PLRs (179.68 vs. 141.83), and SIIs (920.01 vs. 
612.93) were observed for those with T3- and T4-stage cancer, in comparison with 
those with T1- and T2-stage cancer. Values were significantly higher in the case 
of metastasis for the NLR (3.96 vs. 2.93), PLR (205.22 vs. 167.17), and SII 
(1179 vs. 788.37) and significantly lower for the LMR (2.74 vs. 3.35). After the 
intervention, the NLR, PLR, and SII values were higher (p &lt; 0.01) for 
patients with surgical complications, and the NLR and SII values were higher for 
those who died during hospitalization. Higher NLRs, PLRs, SIIs, and lower LMRs 
were associated with a more aggressive tumor; during early follow-up, these were 
related to post-operative complications and death during hospitalization."
1971,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for more than 90% of all renal 
cancers. The five-year survival rate of early-stage (TNM 1) ccRCC reaches 96%, 
while the advanced-stage (TNM 4) is only 23%. Therefore, early screening of 
patients with renal cancer is essential for the treatment of renal cancer and 
the long-term survival of patients. In this study, blood samples of patients 
were collected and a pre-defined set of blood indicators were measured. A random 
forest (RF) model was established to predict based on each indicator in the 
blood, and was trained with all relevant indicators for comprehensive 
predictions. In our study, we found that there was a high statistical 
significance (p &lt; 0.001) for all indicators of healthy individuals and early 
cancer patients, except for uric acid (UA). At the same time, ccRCC also 
presented great differences in most blood indicators between males and females. 
In addition, patients with ccRCC had a higher probability of developing a low 
ratio of albumin (ALB) to globulin (GLB) (AGR &lt; 1.2). Eight key indicators 
were used to classify and predict renal cell carcinoma. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of the eight-indicator model 
was as high as 0.932, the sensitivity was 88.2%, and the specificity was 86.3%, 
which are acceptable in many applications, thus realising early screening for 
renal cancer by blood indicators in a simple blood-draw physical examination. 
Furthermore, the composite indicator prediction method described in our study 
can be applied to other clinical conditions or diseases, where multiple blood 
indicators may be key to enhancing the diagnostic potential of screening 
strategies."
1972,"(1) Background: Length of stay (LOS) has been suggested as a marker of the 
effectiveness of short-term care. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies 
could help monitor hospital stays. We developed an AI-based novel predictive LOS 
score for advanced-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients 
following cytoreductive surgery and refined factors significantly affecting LOS. 
(2) Methods: Machine learning and deep learning methods using artificial neural 
networks (ANN) were used together with conventional logistic regression to 
predict continuous and binary LOS outcomes for HGSOC patients. The models were 
evaluated in a post-hoc internal validation set and a Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) was developed to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of sophisticated LOS 
predictions. (3) Results: For binary LOS predictions at differential time 
points, the accuracy ranged between 70-98%. Feature selection identified 
surgical complexity, pre-surgery albumin, blood loss, operative time, bowel 
resection with stoma formation, and severe postoperative complications (CD3-5) 
as independent LOS predictors. For the GUI numerical LOS score, the ANN model 
was a good estimator for the standard deviation of the LOS distribution by ± two 
days. (4) Conclusions: We demonstrated the development and application of both 
quantitative and qualitative AI models to predict LOS in advanced-stage EOC 
patients following their cytoreduction. Accurate identification of potentially 
modifiable factors delaying hospital discharge can further inform services 
performing root cause analysis of LOS."
1973,"Polycythemia vera (PV) is one of the three main classic disorders of 
Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), with the other two 
being essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). PV may 
develop (15%) in women of childbearing age (15-45 years), with an anticipated 
rate of roughly 0.3 per 100,000 people, although maintaining a male to female 
ratio predominance of about 2:1 and a peak prevalence in the sixth and seventh 
decades of life. Without always being presented with its actual clinical 
manifestations due to pregnancy itself, and most commonly due to iron 
deficiency, PV can be frequently missed and therefore belatedly diagnosed. We 
describe the case of a primipara woman in her 40s, without risk factors for 
thrombosis, who developed a portal vein occlusion 1.5 month postpartum after 
C-section and who had a delayed diagnosis of PV."
1974,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (COV) are a large family of viruses that cause 
infections ranging from the common cold to more serious diseases. Mild to severe 
respiratory illnesses have been linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
which has been classified as a pandemic disease by the World Health 
Organization. It has been demonstrated that the severity of COVID-19 is highly 
positively linked with hypocalcemia. Furthermore, calcium imbalances among other 
electrolytes are linked to the prognosis of COVID-19.
OBJECTIVES: This study demonstrates a connection between serum calcium levels 
and COVID-19 as biomedical indicators of COVID-19 infections in Sulaymaniyah 
city, Iraq.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Baxshin Hospital for about two 
months from February 2022 to April 2022. The work was conducted with a total of 
40 patients including 22 males and 18 females. The patients' ages ranged from 22 
to 80 years old. By analyzing a sample from a nasopharyngeal swab and performing 
real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), all of the 
patients tested positive as having COVID-19 infection. Serum calcium was 
determined from the blood samples of the patients in order to evaluate their 
serum calcium levels. The statistical package for social science (SPSS) was 
utilized to examine the obtained data.
RESULTS: The study revealed a level of calcium between 6.10 and 9.86 mg/dL in 
male and female patients. The majority of the female patients (61%) displayed 
low levels of serum calcium, and 33% of the males had a low level of calcium. It 
can be seen that the highest rate of male patients (66.6%) exhibited a normal 
level of serum calcium, while 33.3% showed decreased serum calcium. Based on 
gender and age groups, a statistically significant difference in calcium levels 
was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study discovered that infection with COVID-19 has some 
significant laboratory abnormalities, including hypocalcemia, showing that serum 
calcium might be employed as a prognostic marker in the clinic."
1975,"Cancer is the third-leading cause of death in the United Arab Emirates (UAE); 
cancer care in the UAE has evolved dramatically over the last 40 years, from a 
single center in Al Ain in 1981 to more than 30 cancer centers and clinics 
across the UAE, with at least four comprehensive cancer centers in the UAE 
nowadays. Despite the significant progress in medical care, cancer quality 
control across the UAE is still lacking, with significant variations in cancer 
care across the cancer centers. Access to clinical trials is still hampered by a 
lack of expertise and research infrastructure and a small population, which 
renders patient accrual for trials a major challenge. Education and training are 
other areas for improvement that require immediate attention, and, in this 
review, we try to address these critical aspects for stakeholders to consider 
better cancer care in the UAE. Early cancer detection and screening are still 
evolving in the UAE, and a national screening program is lacking. There is also 
a need to address barriers to screening and to consider less invasive screening 
methods such as approved blood-based screening, which is likely to be more 
acceptable to the UAE population. In this review, we also address new topics 
that have not been addressed previously, including oncology medical tourism, 
psycho-oncology, onco-fertility, precision oncology, survivorship, oncology 
nursing, cancer support programs, and the oncology sector's response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, all in the context of the UAE cancer landscape. Finally, we 
provide recommendations for policymakers, regulators, payers, patient advocacy 
groups, and the UAE oncology community regarding the delivery and future 
planning of high-quality cancer care. These recommendations are aligned with the 
UAE government's vision to reduce cancer mortality and provide high-quality 
healthcare for its citizens and residents."
1976,"Variability in the timing of daily sleep is increasingly recognized as an 
important factor in sleep and general physical health. One potential driver of 
such daily variations in sleep timing is different work and social obligations 
during the ""working week"" and weekends. To investigate the nature of 
weekday/weekend differences in the timing of sleep offset, we examined 
actigraphy records of 79,161 adult participants in the UK Biobank who wore an 
actiwatch for 1 week. The time of sleep offset was found to be on average 36 min 
later on weekends than on weekdays, and when this difference was expressed as an 
absolute value (i.e., irrespective of sleep offset being either later or earlier 
on weekends), it was 63 min. Younger age, more socioeconomic disadvantage, 
currently being in employment, being a smoker, being male, being of non-white 
ethnicity and later chronotype were associated with greater differences in sleep 
offset between weekdays and weekend days. Greater differences in sleep offset 
timing were associated with age-independent small differences in cardiometabolic 
health indicators of BMI and diastolic blood pressure, but not HbA1c or systolic 
blood pressure. In a subset of participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, 
weekday/weekend sleep offset differences were associated weakly with BMI, 
systolic blood pressure and physical activity. Overall, this study demonstrates 
potentially substantive differences in sleep offset timings between weekdays and 
weekends in a large sample of UK adults, and that such differences may have 
public health implications."
1977,"Anesthesia with propofol is frequently associated with hypotension. The TRPA1 
gene contributes to the vasodilator effect of propofol. Hypotension is crucial 
for anesthesiologists because it is deleterious in the perioperative period. We 
tested whether the TRPA1 gene polymorphisms or haplotypes interfere with the 
hypotensive responses to propofol. PCR-determined genotypes and haplotype 
frequencies were estimated. Nitrite, nitrates, and NOx levels were measured. 
Propofol induced a more expressive lowering of the blood pressure (BP) without 
changing nitrite or nitrate levels in patients carrying CG+GG genotypes for the 
rs16937976 TRPA1 polymorphism and AG+AA genotypes for the rs13218757 TRPA1 
polymorphism. The CGA haplotype presented the most remarkable drop in BP. Heart 
rate values were not impacted. The present exploratory analysis suggests that 
TRPA1 genotypes and haplotypes influence the hypotensive responses to propofol. 
The mechanisms involved are probably other than those related to NO 
bioavailability. With better genetic knowledge, planning anesthesia with fewer 
side effects may be possible."
1978,"Neuropsychiatric complications, in particular cognitive and depressive 
disorders, are common consequences of ischemic stroke (IS) and complicate the 
rehabilitation, quality of life, and social adaptation of patients. The 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, sympathoadrenal medullary system 
(SAMS), and inflammatory processes are believed to be involved in the 
pathogenesis of these disorders. This study aimed to explore these systems in IS 
patients, including those with post-stroke cognitive and depressive disorders, 
within a year after IS. Indices of the HPA axis, inflammatory system, and SAMS 
were measured in blood serum (cortisol, interleukin-6 (IL-6)), plasma 
(adrenocorticotropic hormone), and saliva (cortisol, α-amylase). During one year 
after mild/moderate IS (NIHSS score 5.9 ± 4.3), serum cortisol and salivary 
α-amylase levels remained elevated in the total cohort. In the group with 
further cognitive decline, serum and salivary cortisol levels were elevated 
during the acute period of IS. In the group with poststroke depressive disorder, 
salivary α-amylase was constantly elevated, while serum IL-6 was minimal during 
the acute period. The results suggest prolonged hyperactivation of the HPA axis 
and SAMS after IS. Specifically, post-stroke cognitive impairment was associated 
with hyperactivation of the HPA axis during the acute IS period, while 
post-stroke depressive disorder was associated with the chronic inflammatory 
process and hyperactivation of SAMS during the follow-up period."
1979,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by various cell types are heterogeneous in 
size and composition. Changes in the RNA sets of EVs in biological fluids are 
considered the basis for the development of new approaches to minimally invasive 
diagnostics and the therapy of human diseases. In this study, EVs were obtained 
from the blood of healthy donors by centrifugation, followed by 
ultracentrifugation. It was shown that EVs consist of several populations 
including small exosome-like vesicles and larger microvesicle-like particles. 
The composition of EVs' RNAs was determined. A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were 
incubated with EV and the NGS analysis of differentially expressed genes was 
performed. During the incubation of A549 cells with EVs, the levels of mRNA 
encoding components for the NF-kB signaling pathway increased, as well as the 
expression of genes controlled by the NF-kB transcription factor. Overall, our 
results suggest that components of EVs trigger the NF-kB signaling cascade in 
A549 cells, leading to the transcription of genes including cytokines, adhesion 
molecules, cell cycle regulators, and cell survival factors. Our data provide 
insight into the interaction between blood EVs and human cells and can be used 
for designing new tools for the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases."
1980,"Currently 30-day mortality is commonly used as a quality indicator for cardiac 
surgery; however, prediction models have not included the role of 
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We hypothesized that reproducing currently 
utilised prediction model methods of 30-day mortality using the Australian and 
New Zealand Collaborative Perfusion Registry (ANZCPR) would identify relevant 
CPB predictors. Nine centers in Australia and New Zealand collected data using 
the ANZCPR between 2011-2020. CPB parameter selection was determined by 
evaluating association with 30-day mortality. Data were divided into model 
creation (n = 15,073) and validation sets (n = 15,072). Bootstrap sampling and 
automated variable selection methods were used to develop candidate models. The 
final model was selected using prediction mean square error and Bayesian 
Information Criteria. The average receiver operating characteristic (ROC), 
p-value for Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-squared test and MSE were obtained from 
multifold validation. In total, 30,145 patients were included, of which 735 
(2.4%) died within 30 day of surgery. The area under the ROC curve for the model 
including CPB parameters was significantly greater than preoperative risk 
factors only (0.829 vs 0.783, p < 0.001). CPB parameters included in the 
predictive model were CPB time, red blood cell transfusion, mean arterial 
pressure <50 mmHg, minimum oxygen delivery, cardiac index <1.6 L/min/m2. CPB 
parameters improve the prediction of 30-day mortality. Randomised trials 
designed to evaluate modifiable CPB parameters will determine their impact on 
mortality."
1981,"A case-control study including 446 workers reporting headaches (cases; 136 males 
and 310 females, mean age 46.71 ± 10.84 years) and 446 age- and sex-matched 
colleagues without headaches (controls; mean age 45.44 ± 10.13) was conducted in 
the second half of 2020 in a sample drawn from socio health and commercial 
services companies to investigate the association of headache with lifestyle, 
metabolic, and work-related factors. Workers suffering from headache reported 
higher body weight (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.46-2.53, p &lt; 0.001), higher blood 
cholesterol (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.46-2.77, p &lt; 0.001), triglyceride (OR: 2.01, 
95% CI: 1.20-3.35, p &lt; 0.01), blood glucose (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.16-3.24, p 
&lt; 0.01), and blood pressure levels (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.23-2.52, p &lt; 
0.01). In the year preceding the survey, cases had experienced a higher 
frequency of workplace violence (OR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.25-4.20, p &lt; 0.01 for 
physical aggression, OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.45-3.41, p &lt; 0.001 for threat, OR: 
2.74, 95% CI: 1.72-4.38, p &lt; 0.001 for harassment) and were more frequently 
distressed (effort/reward ratio &gt; 1) (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.39-2.40, p &lt; 
0.001) than the controls. Compared to the controls, cases also had higher scores 
on anxiety and depression scales, lower scores on happiness, and lower levels of 
sleep quality (p &lt; 0.001). The association of headaches with metabolic and 
mental health problems suggests that monitoring headaches in the workplace could 
help to identify workers at risk of impairment."
1982,"Patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) without other options for 
adequate arterial revascularization could undergo deep (or distal) venous 
arterialization for limb salvage. Additionally, patients with extensive foot 
wound with CLTI sometimes require free flap transfer for limb salvage. We herein 
report a case of successful reconstructive limb-salvage surgery for an 
extensively necrotic foot with CLTI, using a two-stage operation involving 
venous arterialization using foot-perforating veins and subsequent free flap 
transfer (with preservation of the arterialized vein). The patient was a 
59-year-old man with CLTI. The patient's right foot had dry necrotic tissue 
after Lisfranc joint amputation. Only one straight-line to the posterior tibial 
artery was achieved after endovascular therapies (four times). At the first 
stage of surgery, an arterial-venous shunt bypass from the superficial femoral 
artery to the distal great saphenous vein (GSV) (near the foot-perforating vein) 
was created. Arterial blood supply reached the necrotic area via the foot venous 
circulation system. At the second stage of surgery, free latissimus dorsi 
musculocutaneous flap (8 × 27 cm) transfer with preservation of the arterialized 
vein was performed. The pedicle artery was anastomosed to the bypass graft 
(end-to-side). The pedicle vein was anastomosed to the proximal stump of the GSV 
(end-to-end). The flap and residual foot survived completely, at a one-year 
follow-up postoperatively. An indocyanine green bypass-through angiography 
revealed the angiosome through the venous arterialization bypass graft, which 
included the flap; entire forefoot; and partial regions of the midfoot and heel. 
This two-stage operation might be considered a useful option for limb-salvage 
and complete wound-healing in patients with severe non-healing wound with CLTI. 
The two methods could compensate and overcome the problems of either method: 
incomplete wound-healing after venous arterialization, and the absence of a 
recipient artery for free flap transfer."
1983,"We reported the case of a 33-year-old male who presented a dengue infection 
complicated by spontaneous coronary artery intramural hematoma associated with 
acute myocarditis. The initial presentation was a typical acute coronary 
syndrome with ST-segment elevation. Coronary angiography and endocoronary 
optical coherence tomography confirmed the diagnosis of left anterior descending 
artery intramural hematoma. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed not only 
typical ischaemic injury but also lesions of acute myocarditis confirmed by 
native T1- and T2-mapping, sub-epicardial late gadolinium enhancement and 
pericardial effusion. This case highlights the multiple cardiac damages caused 
by dengue virus, their possible association (coincidental or linked?), and the 
impact of multimodal imaging on diagnosis and management."
1984,"A variety of surgical techniques exist for deep burn wounds in the shin at low 
temperature reconstruction after appropriate debridement, but limited 
high-quality data exist to inform treatment strategies. Using 
multi-institutional data, the authors evaluated the length of healing time, 
cost, and outcomes of three common surgical reconstructive modalities. All 
subjects with deep burn wounds in the shin caused by low temperature who 
received direct suture repair, skin grafting, or local flap reconstruction were 
retrospectively reviewed (from 2015.01 to 2021.03). Mean operation time, mean 
blood loss in operation, postoperative healing time, whether there is scar 
depression after operation were the primary outcomes; patient satisfaction 
score, Vancouver scar scale (VSS) score and average costs were secondary 
outcomes. Two hundred subjects (68 suture, 87 skin-grafting, and 45 local flap 
coverage patients) were evaluated. Matched patients (n = 200; 3/groups) were 
analysed. The average operation time, average operation blood loss, and 
postoperative healing time were statistically significant differences 
(P < 0.05). Readmissions and reoperations were greater for direct suture and 
local flaps, if achievable, direct suture provided success at low cost. Skin 
grafting was effective with large burn wounds but at higher costs and longer 
length of stay. Local flaps successfully treated smaller burn wounds unable to 
suture directly, with less pigmentation and scars, even suitable for older 
patients. Deep low heat burn wounds in the shin healing can be performed 
effectively using multiple modalities with varying degrees of success and costs. 
Direct suture or local skin flap reconstruction, if achievable, provides 
successful coverage at minimal costs, no skin contractures, and reducing length 
of hospital stay."
1985,"The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with severe aortic 
stenosis (AS) is 30-68%. Nevertheless, there is still not enough evidence to use 
invasive assessment of lesion severity, because the hemodynamic milieu of AS may 
impact the fractional flow reserve (FFR) and non-hyperemic indices. Therefore, 
the aim of the study is two-fold. First, to measure acute and long-term changes 
of FFR, index of microvascular resistance (IMR), and coronary flow reserve (CFR) 
in patients undergoing TAVI procedure. Second, to compare the diagnostic 
accuracy of intracoronary indices with myocardial perfusion measured by 
cadmium-zinc-telluride single-photon emission tomography (CZT-SPECT) and find 
cut-off values defining significant stenosis. We plan to enroll 40 patients 
eligible for TAVI with intermediate stenosis (30-70%) in the left anterior 
descending (LAD) coronary artery. In each patient FFR, CFR, and IMR will be 
measured in addition to myocardial blood flow calculated by CZT-SPECT before and 
either immediately after TAVI (acute cohort) or in 6 months (late cohort) after 
the procedure. FFR, CFR, and IMR will be matched with the results of myocardial 
perfusion measured by CZT-SPECT in the area of LAD. As a result, cut-off values 
of FFR, CFR, and IMR defining the decreased blood flow will be found."
1986,"Chemical warfare agents (CWAs) are among the most prominent threats to the human 
population, our peace, and social stability. Therefore, their detection and 
quantification are of utmost importance to ensure the security and protection of 
mankind. In recent years, significant developments have been made in 
supramolecular chemistry, analytical chemistry, and molecular sensors, which 
have improved our capability to detect CWAs. Fluorescent and colorimetric 
chemosensors are attractive tools that allow the selective, sensitive, cheap, 
portable, and real-time analysis of the potential presence of CWAs, where 
suitable combinations of selective recognition and transduction can be 
integrated. In this review, we provide a detailed discussion on recently 
reported molecular sensors with a specific focus on the sensing of each class of 
CWAs such as nerve agents, blister agents, blood agents, and other toxicants. We 
will also discuss the current technology used by military forces, and these 
discussions will include the type of instrumentation and established protocols. 
Finally, we will conclude this review with our outlook on the limitations and 
challenges in the area and summarize the potential of promising avenues for this 
field."
1987,"The aim of this study was to provide information about immunity against COVID-19 
along with risk factors and behavior among employees in day care facilities and 
preschools (DCS) in Denmark. In collaboration with the Danish Union of 
Pedagogues, during February and March 2021, 47,810 members were offered a 
point-of-care rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody test (POCT) at work and were invited to 
fill in an electronic questionnaire covering COVID-19 exposure. Seroprevalence 
data from Danish blood donors (total Ig enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
[ELISA]) were used as a proxy for the Danish population. A total of 21,018 (45%) 
DCS employees completed the questionnaire and reported their POCT result {median 
age, 44.3 years (interquartile range [IQR], [32.7 to 53.6]); females, 84.1%}, of 
which 20,267 (96.4%) were unvaccinated and included in analysis. A total of 
1,857 (9.2%) participants tested seropositive, significantly higher than a 
seroprevalence at 7.6% (risk ratio [RR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 
to 1.27) among 40,541 healthy blood donors (median age, 42 years [IQR, 28 to 
53]; males, 51.3%). Exposure at work (RR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.3 to 3.6) was less of a 
risk factor than exposure within the household (RR, 12.7; 95% CI, 10.2 to 15.8). 
Less than 25% of participants reported wearing face protection at work. Most of 
the participants expressed some degree of fear of contracting COVID-19 both at 
work and outside work. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was slightly higher in DCS 
staff than in blood donors, but possible exposure at home was associated with a 
higher risk than at work. DCS staff expressed fear of contracting COVID-19, 
though there was limited use of face protection at work. IMPORTANCE Identifying 
at-risk groups and evaluating preventive interventions in at-risk groups is 
imperative for the ongoing pandemic as well as for the control of future 
epidemics. Although DCS staff have a much higher risk of being infected within 
their own household than at their workplace, most are fearful of being infected 
with COVID-19 or bringing COVID-19 to work. This represents an interesting 
dilemma and an important issue which should be addressed by public health 
authorities for risk communication and pandemic planning. This study design can 
be used in a strategy for ongoing surveillance of COVID-19 immunity or other 
infections in the population. The findings of this study can be used to assess 
the need for future preventive interventions in DCS, such as the use of personal 
protective equipment."
1988,"Methanol poisoning is caused by the toxicity of formate, a by-product of 
methanol metabolism. Measurement of blood formate concentrations is required for 
emergency treatment and investigation of the cause of death. In this study, we 
measured concentrations of formate in the plasma of a patient with methanol 
poisoning using headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) and a 
formate assay kit. Results showed a discrepancy as the quantitative values of 
the kit were higher than those of HS-GC/MS. Metabolic profiling of 
low-molecular-weight organic compounds in patient plasma samples showed that the 
concentrations of lactate were correlated to the values obtained using the kit. 
We observed a progression when lactate and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were 
added to the kit reaction simultaneously, even in the absence of formate. 
Moreover, disulfiram, an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, suppressed the values 
of patient plasma samples in the formate assay kit, implying that formate 
production from remaining methanol in patient plasma samples via formaldehyde 
occurred during the kit reaction. The reactions of the kit with lactate and 
methanol were undesirable for accurate measurement of formate concentration in 
the sample. However, considering that elevated concentrations of lactate and 
remaining methanol both cause acidosis and are dangerous to the body, 
cross-reactions with lactate and methanol in formate assay kit may be acceptable 
for rapid diagnosis in facilities where HS-GC/MS and other physical and chemical 
equipment are unavailable."
1989,"Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is an autosomal dominant, inherited disorder 
caused by pathogenic germline variants of mainly SMAD4 or BMPR1A genes. Some 
patients with JPS, especially with SMAD4 variants, also develop hereditary, 
hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is also an autosomal dominant inherited 
disorder. Herein, we identified a novel germline pathogenic variant of the SMAD4 
in a Japanese family with JPS and HHT. A six-base pair deletion in the SMAD4 
gene (NM_005359.6:c.1495_1500delTGCATA) was identified in the patients. Two 
amino acids are deleted from SMAD4 protein (p.Cys499_Ile500del), which are 
located in MSH2 domain essential for the binding with SMAD3. This is a novel 
variant that has not been registered in any database surveyed. Amino acid 
structural analysis predicted significant changes in the secondary and 
three-dimensional structures in the vicinity of the two amino acids' deletion. 
The variant is classified as 'Likely Pathogenic' according to the American 
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines."
1990,"A study targeting the etiology of severe anaemia that sporadically occurred in 
laboratory-bred cyprinid hybrids resulted in a diagnosis of a Mycoplasma-like 
organism selectively invading the cytoplasm of erythrocytes. Despite the fact 
that there was a concurrent yeast infection in moribund anaemic hybrids, the 
primary role in the development of anaemia was assigned to the Mycoplasma-like 
organism due to its regular occurrence in erythrocytes of both the moribund 
hybrids and hybrids that were free of yeast infection yet showed early to 
advanced symptoms of the disease. Novel data on the Mycoplasma-like organism's 
cytoskeleton were obtained from ultrathin sections of affected erythrocytes. An 
ultrastructural study of the concurrent yeast infection in moribund hybrids 
manifesting the most advanced anaemia revealed the presence of Titan cells in 
ascitic fluid. The original findings presented in this study underline the 
diagnostic relevance of transmission electron microscopy in the research of 
similar infections."
1991,"BACKGROUND: Adagrasib, an oral small-molecule inhibitor of mutant KRAS G12C 
protein, has shown clinical activity in pretreated patients with several tumor 
types, including colorectal cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that combining a 
KRAS G12C inhibitor with an epidermal growth factor receptor antibody could be 
an effective clinical strategy.
METHODS: In this phase 1-2, open-label, nonrandomized clinical trial, we 
assigned heavily pretreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with 
mutant KRAS G12C to receive adagrasib monotherapy (600 mg orally twice daily) or 
adagrasib (at the same dose) in combination with intravenous cetuximab once a 
week (with an initial loading dose of 400 mg per square meter of body-surface 
area, followed by a dose of 250 mg per square meter) or every 2 weeks (with a 
dose of 500 mg per square meter). The primary end points were objective response 
(complete or partial response) and safety.
RESULTS: As of June 16, 2022, a total of 44 patients had received adagrasib, and 
32 had received combination therapy with adagrasib and cetuximab, with a median 
follow-up of 20.1 months and 17.5 months, respectively. In the monotherapy group 
(43 evaluable patients), a response was reported in 19% of the patients (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 8 to 33). The median response duration was 4.3 months 
(95% CI, 2.3 to 8.3), and the median progression-free survival was 5.6 months 
(95% CI, 4.1 to 8.3). In the combination-therapy group (28 evaluable patients), 
the response was 46% (95% CI, 28 to 66). The median response duration was 7.6 
months (95% CI, 5.7 to not estimable), and the median progression-free survival 
was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 8.1). The percentage of grade 3 or 4 
treatment-related adverse events was 34% in the monotherapy group and 16% in the 
combination-therapy group. No grade 5 adverse events were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Adagrasib had antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients 
with metastatic colorectal cancer with mutant KRAS G12C, both as oral 
monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab. The median response duration was 
more than 6 months in the combination-therapy group. Reversible adverse events 
were common in the two groups. (Funded by Mirati Therapeutics; KRYSTAL-1

1992,"Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia due to defective 
insulin secretion or its biological dysfunction. However, frequent subcutaneous 
injection of insulin often results in discomfort and local tissue infection. 
Herein, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of a mini-tablet system based 
on self-propelled micromotors with biocompatibility and biodegradability for 
oral colon administration of insulin. The insulin layer is first constructed 
onto the surface of a magnesium based micromotor via electrostatic interactions, 
followed by a tableting process. The resulting mini-tablets are then coated with 
esterified starch with colonic degradation capability, thus achieving controlled 
release of the embedded micromotors in the colon region. In the meantime, 
autonomous movement of the released micromotors with a speed up to 76.22 μm·s-1 
further results in enhanced colonic uptake and absorption of insulin, realizing 
long-term control of blood glucose for more than 5 h. Our micromotor based 
mini-tablet system can not only broaden the biomedical applications of emerging 
self-propelled micromotors but also offer an appealing strategy for oral 
administration of biomacromolecular drugs represented by insulin."
1993,"A 27-year-old patient with a history of severe obstetrical complications and

the acute episode of hereditary TTP became plasma-refractory and fetal death was 
imminent, weekly injections of recombinant ADAMTS13 at a dose of 40 U per 
kilogram of body weight were initiated. The patient's platelet count normalized, 
and the growth of the fetus stabilized. At 37 weeks 1 day of gestation, a

1994,"AIMS: Visceral adiposity index (VAI) was a reliable marker for visceral 
adiposity accumulation and dysfunction. The associations between VAI and 
nephropathy outcomes remains uncertain in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. We 
aimed to evaluate the longitudinal relationships between VAI and incident 
nephropathy outcomes in T2DM patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 10,132 participants with T2DM from the ACCORD trial were 
included in the present study. Cumulative average VAI based on VAI measurements 
at baseline and follow-up was used to represent long-term VAI status. The 
primary outcome was incident composite nephropathy outcome, defined as: (1) 
serum creatinine doubling or >20 mL/min decrease in eGFR; or (2) development of 
macro-albuminuria; or (3) renal failure or end stage kidney disease (dialysis) 
or serum creatinine >3.3 mg/dL.
RESULTS: During 26,168 person-years follow-up duration, 6094 (60.1%) 
participants developed incident composite nephropathy outcome. When assessing 
cumulative average VAI as quartiles, compared with those in the 1-2 quartiles 
(<2.6), a significantly higher risk of incident composite nephropathy outcome 
was observed among participants in the 3-4 quartiles (≥2.6, adjusted HR: 1.09, 
95%CI: 1.01, 1.18). Moreover, the positive association was consistent in 
participants with or without single abnormal VAI components, including general 
obesity, abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides and low high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol; or with different numbers of abnormal VAI components. 
Additionally, the positive association was stronger in participants with 
cumulative average systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg (versus ≥130 mmHg; 
P-interaction< 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In T2DM patients, higher cumulative average VAI was associated with 
higher risk of incident composite nephropathy outcomes. This article is

1995,"Urinary tract infections caused by urinary catheter implantation are becoming 
more serious. Therefore, the construction of a responsive antibacterial 
biomaterial that can not only provide biocompatible conditions, but also 
effectively prevent the growth and metabolism of bacteria, is urgently needed. 
In this work, we designed and synthesized a benzophenone-derived phosphatase 
light-triggered antibacterial agent, which was tethered to the biological 
materials using a one-step method for in vivo antibacterial therapy. This 
surface could kill gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) and 
gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli). More importantly, because this 
material exhibited a zwitterion structure, it did not damage blood cells and 
tissue cells. When the bacteria interacted with this surface, the initial 
fouling of the bacteria was reduced by zwitterion hydration. When the bacteria 
actively accumulated and metabolized to produce a certain amount of alkaline 
phosphatase, the surface immediately started the sterilization performance, and 
the bactericidal effect was achieved by destroying the bacterial cell membrane. 
In summary, we successfully constructed an antibacterial biomaterial that showed 
biocompatibility with mammalian cells, providing new ideas for the development 
of intelligent urinary catheters. This article is protected by copyright. All

1996,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound vector flow imaging (VFI) shows potential as an emerging 
non-invasive modality for time-resolved flow mapping. However, its efficacy in 
tracking multidirectional pulsatile flow with temporal resolvability has not yet 
been systematically evaluated because of the lack of an appropriate test 
protocol.
PURPOSE: We present the first systematic performance investigation of VFI in 
tracking pulsatile flow in a meticulously designed scenario with time-varying, 
omnidirectional flow fields (with flow angles from 0° to 360°).
METHODS: Ultrasound VFI was performed on a three-loop spiral flow phantom (4 mm 
diameter; 5 mm pitch) that was configured to operate under pulsatile flow 
conditions (10 mL/s peak flow rate; 1 Hz pulse rate; carotid pulse shape). The 
spiral lumen geometry was designed to simulate recirculatory flow dynamics 
observed in the heart and in curvy blood vessel segments such as the carotid 
bulb. The imaging sequence was based on steered plane wave pulsing (-10°, 0°, 
+10° steering angles; 5 MHz imaging frequency; 3.3 kHz interleaved pulse 
repetition frequency). VFI's pulsatile flow estimation performance and its 
ability to detect secondary flow were comparatively assessed against flow fields 
derived from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that included 
consideration of fluid-structure interactions (FSI). The mean percentage error 
(MPE) and the coefficient of determination (R2 ) were computed to assess the 
correspondence of the velocity estimates derived from VFI and CFD-FSI 
simulations. In addition, VFI's efficacy in tracking pulse waves was analyzed 
with respect to pressure transducer measurements made at the phantom's inlet and 
outlet.
RESULTS: Pulsatile flow patterns rendered by VFI agreed with the flow profiles 
computed from CFD-FSI simulations (average MPE: -5.3%). The shape of the 
VFI-measured velocity magnitude profile generally matched the inlet flow 
profile. High correlation exists between VFI measurements and simulated flow 
vectors (lateral velocity: R2 = 0.8; axial velocity R2 = 0.89; beam-flow angle: 
R2 = 0.98; p < 0.0001 for all three quantities). VFI was found to be capable of 
consistently tracking secondary flow. It also yielded pulse wave velocity (PWV) 
estimates (5.72 ± 1.02 m/s) that, on average, are within 6.4% of those obtained 
from pressure transducer measurements (6.11 ± 1.15 m/s).
CONCLUSION: VFI can consistently track omnidirectional pulsatile flow on a 
time-resolved basis. This systematic investigation serves well as a quality 
assurance test of VFI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1997,"OBJECTIVES: The modified National Institutes of Health (NIH) risk criteria for 
gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) have some limitations and need to be 
improved.
METHODS: Patients who underwent radical resection of primary GIST were 
retrospectively reviewed. Peripheral blood indices including the 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were 
analysed. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was calculated and compared. 
Multivariate analysis was conducted. Area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 492 patients were enrolled. Tumour size, mitotic index (MI), 
tumour location and PNI were independent prognostic factors. The modified NIH 
criteria could not distinguish among very low-, low- and intermediate-risk 
patients, and PNI was the only independent prognostic factors for them. The 
five-year RFS rate in the high risk (HR) group was significantly lower. A 
further modification to the NIH risk criteria was proposed (the 'NIH-PNI 
stratification'). Non-high risk (NHR) patients were divided into the NHR-PNI-H 
group (PNI > 48.05) and the NHR-PNI-L group (PNI ≤ 48.05), respectively. HR 
patients were divided according to tumour size and MI: the HR1, HR2 and HR3 
groups. The five-year RFS rates of the NHR-PNI-H, NHR-PNI-L, HR1, HR2 and HR3 
groups were 97.3%, 93.5%, 74.1%, 61.7% and 24.4%, respectively (p < .001). The 
area under the curve (AUC) for the NIH-PNI stratification, modified NIH 
criteria, NIH criteria (2002), AFIP criteria and nomogram were 0.857, 0.807, 
0.817, 0.843 and 0.831, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The proposed NIH-PNI stratification was able to distinguish among 
five groups in terms of risk of recurrence."
1998,"In Drosophila larvae, the direction of blood flow within the heart tube, as well 
as the diastolic filling of the posterior heart chamber, is regulated by a 
single cardiac valve. This valve is sufficient to close the heart tube at the 
junction of the ventricle and the aorta and is formed by only two cells; both 
are integral parts of the heart tube. The valve cells regulate hemolymph flow by 
oscillating between a spherical and a flattened cell shape during heartbeats. At 
the spherical stage, the opposing valve cells close the heart lumen. The dynamic 
cell shape changes of valve cells are supported by a dense, criss-cross 
orientation of myofibrils and the presence of the valvosomal compartment, a 
large intracellular cavity. Both structures are essential for the valve cells' 
function. In a screen for factors specifically expressed in cardiac valve cells, 
we identified the transcription factor Tailup. Knockdown of tailup causes 
abnormal orientation and differentiation of cardiac muscle fibers in the larval 
aorta and inhibits the formation of the ventral longitudinal muscle layer 
located underneath the heart tube in the adult fly and affects myofibrillar 
orientation of valve cells. Furthermore, we have identified regulatory sequences 
of tup that control the expression of tailup in the larval and adult valve 
cells."
1999,"The abnormal immunomodulatory functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have 
been implicated in the development of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Recent 
studies have suggested important effects of complement on immune cell function. 
However, whether complement modulates bone marrow MSCs function in ITP is poorly 
defined. Tacrolimus has recently been applied to the treatment of autoimmune 
diseases. Here, we explored whether impaired ITP-MSCs could be targeted by 
tacrolimus. Our results showed that the Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain 
containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was activated in ITP MSCs with complement 
deposition (MSCs-C+ ) and initiated caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis. 
Transcriptome sequencing results showed abnormal fatty acid metabolism in 
MSCs-C+ . Enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation and reactive oxygen species production 
activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. Adipocytes derived from MSCs-C+ secreted less 
adiponectin. Adiponectin promoted the differentiation of megakaryocytes and 
inhibited the destruction of platelets. Tacrolimus inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation and MSCs-C+ pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Tacrolimus plus danazol 
elicited a higher sustained response than danazol monotherapy in 
corticosteroid-resistant patients with ITP. Our findings demonstrate that the 
activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in ITP MSCs mediated by complement could be 
inhibited by tacrolimus, which might be a potential new therapy for ITP."
2000,"Imaging in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients is not targeted at 
evaluating the transplant per se. Rather, imaging is largely confined to 
evaluating peri-procedural and post-procedural complications. Alternatively, 
imaging may be performed to establish a baseline study for comparison should the 
patient develop certain post-procedural complications. This article looks to 
describe the various imaging modalities available with recommendations for which 
imaging study should be performed in specific complications. We also provide 
select imaging protocols for different indications and modalities for the 
purpose of establishing a set minimal standard for imaging in these complex 
patients."
2001,"Primary atopic disorders are a group of inborn errors of immunity that skew the 
immune system toward severe allergic disease. Defining the biology underlying 
these extreme monogenic phenotypes reveals shared mechanisms underlying common 
polygenic allergic disease and identifies potential drug targets. Germline 
gain-of-function (GOF) variants in JAK1 are a cause of severe atopy and 
eosinophilia. Modeling the JAK1GOF (p.A634D) variant in both zebrafish and human 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) revealed enhanced myelopoiesis. RNA-Seq 
of JAK1GOF human whole blood, iPSCs, and transgenic zebrafish revealed a shared 
core set of dysregulated genes involved in IL-4, IL-13, and IFN signaling. 
Immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analysis of patients carrying a JAK1GOF 
variant revealed marked Th cell skewing. Moreover, long-term ruxolitinib 
treatment of 2 children carrying the JAK1GOF (p.A634D) variant remarkably 
improved their growth, eosinophilia, and clinical features of allergic 
inflammation. This work highlights the role of JAK1 signaling in atopic immune 
dysregulation and the clinical impact of JAK1/2 inhibition in treating 
eosinophilic and allergic disease."
2002,"BACKGROUND: MRI often requires sedation or anaesthesia to ensure good image 
quality in paediatric patients. Access to paediatric anaesthesia services is, 
however, a limiting factor for effective paediatric MRI service, and alternative 
sedation methods are, therefore, warranted.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of an intranasal 
dexmedetomidine sedation program for paediatric MRI, without immediate presence 
of anaesthesia personnel.
DESIGN: Single institution retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Tertiary care paediatric hospital.
PATIENTS: Children 0 to 12 years, ASA risk class 1 or 2 with heart rate within 
age-appropriate limit.
INTERVENTION: Radiology personnel administered an initial dose of intranasal 
dexmedetomidine of 4 μg kg-1 followed by a second dose of 2 μg kg-1 to the 
patients if needed. Recordings of image quality, critical events, heart rate, 
pulse oximetry saturation and noninvasive blood pressure before and after 
dexmedetomidine administration were made.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in haemodynamic and respiratory data before vs. 
after intranasal dexmedetomidine were analysed for changes, and the incidence of 
critical events was evaluated as well as rate of successful MRI scans.
RESULTS: One thousand and ninety-one MRIs under intranasal dexmedetomidine 
sedation were included (mean age 34 months, 95% confidence interval (CI), 33 to 
36, 599 male individuals). A success rate of 93% (95% CI, 91 to 94%) was found. 
No major critical events were recorded, total incidence of minor issues was 0.2% 
(95% CI, 0 to 0.7%). Five children had a heart rate under a preset minimal limit 
after dexmedetomidine (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.9%). Significant decreases in 
heart rate and mean arterial pressure, within acceptable limits not requiring 
intervention, was seen after dexmedetomidine administration.
CONCLUSION: Intranasal dexmedetomidine sedation without immediate presence of 
anaesthesia personnel appears to be well tolerated and associated with minimal 
interference on MRI image quality.

2004,"Cardiovascular prevention with low-dose aspirin can be less effective in 
patients with a faster recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 activity 
during the 24 hours dosing interval. We previously showed that incomplete 
suppression of TXA2 over 24 hours can be rescued by a twice daily aspirin 
regimen. Here we show that reduced platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ibα shedding 
characterizes patients with accelerated COX-1 recovery and may contribute to 
higher thrombopoietin production and higher rates of newly-formed platelets, 
escaping aspirin inhibition over 24 hours. Two-hundred aspirin-treated patients 
with high cardiovascular risk (100 with type 2 diabetes mellitus) were 
stratified according to the kinetics of platelet COX-1 activity recovery during 
the 10-24h dosing interval. Whole proteome analysis showed that platelets from 
patients with accelerated COX-1 recovery were enriched in proteins involved in 
cell survival, inhibition of apoptosis and cellular protrusion formation. In 
agreement, we documented increased plasma thrombopoietin, megakaryocyte 
maturation and proplatelet formation, and conversely increased platelet 
galactose and reduced caspase 3, phosphatidylserine exposure and ADAM17 
activation, translating into diminished GPIbα cleavage and glycocalicin release. 
Treatment of HepG2 cells with recombinant glycocalicin led to a dose-dependent 
reduction in liver thrombopoietin mRNA, suggesting that reduced GPIbα ectodomain 
shedding may unleash thrombopoiesis. A cluster of clinical markers, including 
younger age, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, visceral obesity and higher 
thrombopoietin/glycocalicin ratio, predicted with significant accuracy the 
likelihood of faster COX-1 recovery and suboptimal aspirin response. Circulating 
thrombopoietin/glycocalicin ratio, reflecting a dysregulation of platelet 
lifespan and production, may provide a simple tool to identify patients amenable 
to more frequent aspirin daily dosing."
2005,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to analyze the features of conventional 
ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in hepatic epithelioid 
hemangioendothelioma (HEHE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the US images (grayscale, 
color Doppler and CEUS) of the patients with histopathologically confirmed HEHE 
in our hospital from March 2015 to August 2021 who had underwent a US 
investigation.
RESULTS: A total of 13 patients were reported during the study period (seven 
men, aged from 23 to 62 years, with an average age of 40 years). The unifocal, 
multifocal, and diffuse lesions were 2, 9, and 2, respectively. Five patients 
(5/13) had liver involvement of both lobes, and eight (8/13) patients had only 
right lobe involvement. The maximum diameter of the lesions ranged from 1.9 to 
7.0 cm. The grayscale US of HEHE mainly showed multiple hypoechoic lesions (n=9) 
near the capsule of the right lobe of the liver, with well-defined margins 
(n=7), accompanied by a hypoechoic halo (n=3) or capsule retraction (n=4) and 
calcification (n=8). Color Doppler US can detect blood flow in the lesion (n=8). 
CEUS was performed in five patients (5/13). The enhancement pattern of CEUS 
varied in the arterial phase, mainly including rim-like hyper-enhancement (n=2) 
and inhomogeneous hypo-enhancement (n=2), but was approximately the same in the 
portal venous phase and the late venous phase, both showing varying degrees of 
regression.
CONCLUSIONS: The grayscale US and CEUS seem to provide some reference value for 
diagnosing HEHE."

2007,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of time-restricted eating (TRE) 
on integrated skeletal muscle myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) rates in 
males with overweight/obesity.
METHODS: A total of 18 healthy males (age 46 ±  5 years; BMI: 30 ± 2 kg/m2 ) 
completed this exploratory, parallel, randomized dietary intervention after a 
3-day lead-in diet. Participants then consumed an isoenergetic diet (protein: 
~1.0 g/kg body mass per day) following either TRE (10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) or 
an extended eating control (CON; 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.) protocol for 10 days. 
Integrated MyoPS rates were measured using deuterated water administration with 
repeated saliva, blood, and muscle sampling. Secondary measures included 
continuous glucose monitoring and body composition (dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry).
RESULTS: There were no differences in daily integrated MyoPS rates (TRE: 
1.28% ± 0.18% per day, CON: 1.26% ± 0.22% per day; p = 0.82) between groups. 
From continuous glucose monitoring, 24-hour total area under the curve was 
reduced following TRE (-578 ± 271 vs. CON: 12 ± 272 mmol/L × 24 hours; 
p = 0.001). Total body mass declined (TRE: -1.6 ± 0.9 and CON: -1.1 ± 0.7 kg; 
p < 0.001) with no differences between groups (p = 0.22). Lean mass loss was 
greater following TRE compared with CON (-1.0 ± 0.7 vs. -0.2 ± 0.5 kg, 
respectively; p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Consuming food within an 8-hour time-restricted period does not 
lower daily MyoPS rates when compared with an isoenergetic diet consumed over 
12 hours. Future research should investigate whether these results translate to 
free-living TRE."
2008,"In current clinical practice, when a fall occurs in a long-term care facility, 
it is often treated as an accident. Falls are classified as one of the most 
commonly prevalent geriatric syndromes. As their causes are extremely diverse 
and complex, their occurrence rate depends on individual susceptibility, even if 
appropriate fall prevention measures are taken. Falls are common among older 
adults, and fractures and intracranial hemorrhage resulting from falls can lead 
to the deterioration of activities of daily living and death. For this reason, 
it is recommended that the risk of falls is assessed in the general population 
of older adults, and that appropriate interventions are carried out for those at 
high risk. In response to this situation, the Japan Geriatrics Society and the

2009,"Ultra rapid lispro (URLi) is a novel formulation of insulin lispro designed to 
more closely match the physiological insulin response to a meal, with the aim of 
improving postprandial glucose (PPG) control. We conducted a multinational, 
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, treat-to-target, 26-week, phase 3 trial 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of URLi in adults with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D). After an 8-week lead-in period during which basal insulin glargine or 
degludec was optimized, adults with T2D were randomized (2:1) to prandial URLi 
(n = 395) or lispro (n = 200). The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of URLi 
versus lispro in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change from baseline to week 
26. Multiplicity-adjusted analyses were performed to assess the superiority of 
URLi in 1- and 2-h PPG excursions during a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) and 
HbA1c change at week 26. URLi showed non-inferiority for HbA1c change at week 26 
versus lispro (least-squares mean [LSM] difference, 0.07%; 95% confidence 
interval: -0.07, 0.21). HbA1c was reduced by 0.56% and 0.63% with URLi and 
lispro, respectively, with no significant treatment difference (P = 0.321). URLi 
provided superior PPG excursion control versus lispro at 1 h (LSM difference: 
-14.6 mg/dL, P < 0.001) and 2 h (LSM difference: -21.8 mg/dL, P < 0.001) as well 
as other time points (30-240 min) during the MMTT. Incremental area under the 
glucose curve during the MMTT was also significantly lower with URLi versus 
lispro. The safety profiles were generally similar between treatment groups. In 
conclusion, URLi was superior to lispro for PPG control, with non-inferiority in 
HbA1c improvement, in adults with T2D."
2010,"In recent decades, haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) to treat 
severe aplastic anemia (SAA) has achieved remarkable progress. However, 
long-term results are still lacking. We conducted a multicenter prospective 
study involving SAA patients who underwent haplo-SCT as salvage therapy. 
Long-term outcomes were assessed, mainly focusing on survival and quality of 
life (QoL). Longitudinal QoL was prospectively evaluated during 
pretransplantation and at 3 and 5 years posttransplantation using the SF-36 
scale in adults and the PedsQL 4.0 scale in children. A total of 287 SAA 
patients were enrolled, and the median follow-up was 4.56 years (range, 
3.01-9.05 years) among surviving patients. During the long-term follow-up, 268 
of 275 evaluable patients (97.5%) obtained sustained full donor chimerism, and 
93.4% had complete hematopoietic recovery. The estimated overall survival and 
failure-free survival for the whole cohort at 9 years were 85.4% ± 2.1% and 
84.0% ± 2.2%, respectively. Age (≥18 years) and a poorer performance status 
(ECOG >1) were identified as risk factors for survival outcomes. For QoL 
recovery after haplo-SCT, we found that QoL progressively improved from 
pretransplantation to the 3-year and 5-year time points with statistical 
significance. The occurrence of chronic graft versus host disease was a risk 
factor predicting poorer QoL scores in both the child and adult cohorts. At the 
last follow-up, 74.0% of children and 72.9% of adults returned to normal school 
or work. These inspiring long-term outcomes suggest that salvage transplantation 
with haploidentical donors can be routine practice for SAA patients without 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors."
2011,"The diagnosis of multiple or diffuse renal lesions in a child is challenging by 
imaging and/or pathology. Optimal management requires distinguishing benign 
lesions such as nephrogenic rests from cancerous lesions such as Wilms tumor, 
but this is often difficult or impossible. This difficulty is compounded by the 
overlapping nature of our current radiologic and pathologic definitions of 
lesions along the spectrum of nephrogenic rests/nephroblastomatosis. We provide 
a review of these issues, as a collaborative effort between the Children's 
Oncology Group Renal Tumor Committee and International Society of Pediatric 
Oncology Renal Tumor Study Group. Our aim is to discuss current challenges in 
diagnosis and management of these renal lesions, encouraging future work toward 
consensus definitions for research and patient care."
2012,"While immunotherapy has become standard-of-care for cutaneous melanoma patients, 
primary and acquired resistance prevent long-term benefits for about half of the 
late-stage patients. Pre-clinical models are essential to increase our 
understanding of the resistance mechanisms of melanomas, aiming to improve the 
efficacy of immunotherapy. Here, we present two novel syngeneic transplantable 
murine melanoma cell lines derived from the same primary tumor induced on 
BrafV600E Pten-/- mice: MeVa2.1 and MeVa2.2. Derivatives of these cell lines 
expressing the foreign antigen ovalbumin (dOVA) showed contrasting 
immune-mediated tumor control. MeVa2.2.dOVA melanomas were initially controlled 
in immune-competent hosts until variants grew out that had lost their antigens. 
By contrast, MeVa2.1.dOVA tumors were not controlled despite presenting the 
strong OVA antigen, as well as infiltration of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells. 
MeVa2.1.dOVA displayed reduced sensitivity to T cell-mediated killing and growth 
inhibition in vitro by both IFN-γ and TNF-α. MeVa2.1.dOVA tumors were 
transiently controlled in vivo by either targeted therapy, adoptive T cell 
transfer, regulatory T cell depletion, or immune checkpoint blockade. 
MeVa2.1.dOVA could thus become a valuable melanoma model to evaluate novel 
immunotherapy combinations aiming to overcome immune resistance mechanisms."
2013,"OBJECTIVE: This study explored the lived experience of parents of children with 
retinoblastoma.
DESIGN AND METHOD: A phenomenological qualitative study design was used, and a 
purposive sampling technique to recruit parents of children with retinoblastoma. 
Semi-structured interviews were conducted to document the lived experience of 
participants, who were asked to narrate their experiences caring for a child 
with retinoblastoma, thinking back to the day they learned about their child's 
condition, as well as their thoughts about the future. The interviews were 
conducted in Amharic and Oromo language, and audio recordings were transcribed 
and translated to English. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Thirteen parents (seven mothers, six fathers) participated in the 
study. Collectively, the children of the participants represented all the stages 
of the retinoblastoma journey (i.e., diagnosis, treatment, remission, and 
recurrence). Five major themes emerged from the thematic data analysis: (a) 
reactions when learning the child's condition; (b) receiving health care; (c) 
costs of caregiving; (d) support; and (e) uncertainties.
CONCLUSION: The lived experiences of parents of children with retinoblastoma 
revealed a significant mental health and psychosocial burden. The sources of 
mental distress were found to be complex and varied. Holistic care for 
retinoblastoma should include programs that address the biopsychosocial needs of 
caregivers."
2014,"BACKGROUND: Vascular malformations (VMs) are rare disorders that can cause pain, 
coagulopathy, disfigurement, asymmetric growth, and disability. Families 
affected by complex VMs experience misdiagnosis, limited trustworthy 
information, delayed or inappropriate treatments, and persistent uncertainty. 
However, more research is needed to understand the communication experiences of 
these families during clinical encounters.
PROCEDURE: We performed semi-structured interviews with 34 parents of children 
with VMs (18% men; 82% women; mean age = 41 years) and 25 young adults with VMs 
(8% men; 88% women; 4% nonbinary; mean age = 29) living in the United States, 
recruited through four patient advocacy groups. We performed thematic analysis 
to assess communication experiences, using a previously developed functional 
model of communication in pediatric oncology as an a priori framework.
RESULTS: We identified evidence of eight communication functions previously 
identified in pediatric oncology: building relationships, exchanging 
information, enabling self-management, managing uncertainty, responding to 
emotions, making decisions, providing validation, and supporting hope. 
Uncertainty was pervasive through participants' experiences and seemed to 
influence the fulfillment of communication functions. Fewer participants seemed 
to highlight the role of clinicians in responding to emotions or supporting 
hope, compared to other communication functions.
CONCLUSION: Interviews with parents and young adult patients with VMs provided 
evidence for eight functions of communication. While exchanging information and 
building relationships were described by nearly every respondent, supporting 
hope and responding to emotions were mentioned less frequently. Future studies 
should develop patient-reported communication measures to quantify the 
fulfillment of these functions and to identify areas of communication in need of 
intervention."
2015,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate loss of protective anti-hepatitis B 
(HBs) titers and seroconversion to hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) during chemotherapy 
in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS: Anti-HBs titers were done at diagnosis. Patients were divided into two 
groups. Group I (protective titers >10 mIU/ml) received single double dose of 
HBV as booster. Titers were repeated at three time points: end of phase 1b, 
beginning of re-induction, and start of maintenance chemotherapy. Group II 
(nonprotective titers <10 mIU/L) received hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), 
prior to start of chemotherapy, followed by three double doses of HBV as 
booster. Titers were repeated at two time points: prior to first dose, and 
4 weeks after third dose of vaccine.
RESULTS: Total 125 patients were included: 88 in group I; 37 in group II. Among 
group I patients, 98.7%, 90%, and 84% retained protective titers at the three 
points, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that those with initial titers 
greater than 100 mIU/L retained protective titers better than those with titers 
between 11 and 100 mIU/L (p = .0001). Among group II patients, 62% and 64% 
attained protective titers at the two points, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: HBV boosters helped maintain protective titers during intensive ALL 
chemotherapy in immunized children having titers more than 10 mIU/L, and more so 
if titer was more than 100 mIU/L. Therefore, we propose that cut off for 
protective anti-HBs titers be changed to greater than or equal to 100 mIU/L. 
Titers between 11 and 100 mIU/L may require combined active and passive 
immunization. Around one-third of group II patients who fail to attain 
protective titers may need frequent doses of HBIG."
2016,"BACKGROUND: Infection is a significant risk factor that impacts for 
perioperative morbidity and mortality in liver transplantation (LTx) patients 
and is difficult to evaluate quantitatively in the early posttransplantation 
period. Thus, a biomarker to assess the risk of infection and the prognosis of 
the recipient is highly desirable.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight consecutive patients with end-stage liver 
diseases undergoing LTx between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, at the 
First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were 
screened retrospectively. Graft preservation fluid and blood samples were 
collected for culture, and other perioperative laboratory examination results 
were recorded, for assessment of infection status.
RESULTS: After a follow-up period of 30 days, the survival rate among the 128 
LTx recipients was 94.5%. Multivariable regression analysis showed that the 
logarithmically transformed neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (HR = 3.548, 
95% CI: ; p = 0.041) on post-LTx day 1 and graft preservation fluid culture 
positivity (HR = 12.032, 95% CI: ; p = 0.006) were independent predictive 
factors for early prognosis after LTx.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive graft preservation fluid culture and the logarithmically 
transformed NLR on post-LTx day 1 were independent predictive factors for early 
prognosis after LTx. The logarithmically transformed NLR could provide an 
earlier indication than culture results in clinical practice. This article is

2017,"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is suggested to result from a 
dysregulated immune response to infections in children with a preleukaemic 
state. Childcare in early life supposedly may protect against childhood ALL by 
facilitating sufficient exposure to infections to stimulate and ensure normal 
maturation of the immune system. We assessed the association between childcare 
attendance before age two years and risk of childhood ALL in a register-based 
cohort study, including all children aged 2-14 years born in Denmark during 
1991-2014 with available childcare information recorded in the Danish Childcare 
Database (n=1,116,185). Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) 
comparing children enrolled in childcare and children not enrolled before age 
two years. Further, we assessed the association according to age at enrolment, 
type of childcare facility and specific ALL subtypes. During 10,460,811 
person-years of follow-up, 460 children developed ALL at ages 2-14 years. Of 
these, 57 (12.4%) never attended childcare before age two years compared with 
10.6% in the total cohort. Compared with homecare, childcare attendance before 
age two years was associated with a statistically non-significantly, marginally 
decreased risk of childhood ALL with adjusted HR = 0.87 (95% confidence interval 
(CI): 0.65-1.16). Risk estimates did neither vary statistically significantly by 
age at enrolment nor by type of childcare facility and also not between 
childhood ALL subtypes, including frequently prenatally initiated ALL subtypes. 
Results from this large, nationwide register-based study provided no evidence 
that childcare attendance in the first years of life protects against childhood 
ALL."
2018,"Bendamustine and rituximab (BR) is a preferred first-line therapy for indolent 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL); however, few 
reports on BR performance in elderly patients are available to date. We compared 
safety and efficacy of BR in patients ≥70 years (elderly) vs <70 years (younger) 
treated at our institution. Among 201 patients, 113 were elderly (median age: 
77 years), including 38 patients ≥80 years, and 88 were younger (median age: 
62 years). Elderly patients had more bone marrow involvement by lymphoma, 
anemia, ECOG status 3, and high-risk disease follicular lymphoma (p<0.05 for 
all). Fifty-four percent of elderly received full dose of bendamustine vs 79.5% 
of younger patients. More elderly patients (54%) vs younger (43.2%) experienced 
treatment delay. Less elderly proceeded to rituximab maintenance. Overall, the 
number of adverse events per patient and transformed B-Cell lymphoma/secondary 
malignancies were similar between groups. Elderly patients had less febrile 
neutropenia, rituximab-associated infusion reactions, but more herpes zoster 
reactivation. There were more deaths in the elderly (37.2%) vs younger (10.2%) 
groups (p<0.001), mainly due to non-lymphoma-related causes. With median 
follow-up of 42 months [4.0-97.0] disease-free survival for the elderly was 
similar to younger patients. There was no difference between patients <80 and 
≥80 years (p=0.274). In conclusion, the real-world elderly patients have more 
advanced disease and higher ECOG status. BR is well-tolerated; elderly patients 
had lower incidence of febrile neutropenia. Dose reduction and treatment delays 
are common, but BR efficacy was not affected even in very old patients 
(≥80 years)."
2019,"Inducible NO synthase (NOS II) was proposed to play an important role in salt 
resistance of Dahl salt-resistant (SR/Jr) rats. Its chronic inhibition by 
specific inhibitors was accompanied by blood pressure (BP) elevation in animals 
subjected to high salt intake. The aim of our study was to evaluate 1) whether 
such inhibitors affect BP and/or its particular components (sympathetic tone and 
NO-dependent vasodilation) only under the conditions of high salt intake, and 2) 
whether similar BP effects are elicited after systemic or 
intracerebroventricular (icv) application of these inhibitors. Wistar rats fed 
Altromin diet (0.45% NaCl) and SR/Jr rats fed either a low-salt (LS, 0.3% NaCl) 
or a high-salt (HS, 4% NaCl) diet were studied. Aminoguanidine (AMG) and 
2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine (AMT) were used as NOS II 
inhibitors. BP and its responses to acute blockade of renin-angiotensin system 
(captopril), sympathetic nervous system (pentolinium) and NO synthase (L-NAME) 
were measured in conscious cannulated rats. There were no significant changes of 
BP or its components in either Wistar rats or SR/Jr rats subjected to chronic 
inhibition of NOS II by peroral aminoguanidine administration (50 mg/kg/day for 
4 weeks). This was true for both SR/Jr rats fed LS or HS diets. Furthermore, we 
have studied BP effects of chronic icv administration of both NOS II inhibitors 
in SR/Jr rats fed HS diet, but we failed to find any BP changes elicited by such 
treatment. In conclusion, inducible NO synthase does not participate in the 
resistance of SR/Jr rats to hypertensive effects of excess salt intake."
2020,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and affects 
millions of people worldwide. Developing an effective CHB therapy requires using 
in vivo screening methods, such as mouse models reflecting CHB based on 
hydrodynamic delivery of plasmid vectors containing a replication-competent HBV 
genome. However, long-term expression of HBV proteins is accompanied by 
production of progeny virions, thereby requiring a Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 
animal facility. In the present study, we introduced a point mutation in the 
START codon of the HBV polymerase to develop a mouse model reflecting chronic 
hepatitis B infection without formation of viral progeny. We induced the mouse 
model by hydrodynamic injection of adeno-associated virus plasmid vector (pAAV) 
and minicircle plasmid (pMC) constructs into C57Bl/6 and C3H/HeN mouse strains, 
monitoring HBV antigens and antibodies in blood by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay and analysing liver expression of HBV core antigen by immunohistology. 
Persisting expression of viral antigens over 140 days (study endpoint) was 
observed only in the C3H/HeN mouse strain when using pAAV/1.2HBV-A and 
pMC/1.0HBV-D with pre-C and pre-S recombination sites. In addition, 
pAAV/1.2HBV-A in C3H/HeN sustained HBV core antigen positivity up to the study 
endpoint in C3H/HeN mice. Moreover, introducing the point mutation in the START 
codon of polymerase effectively prevented the formation of viral progeny. Our 
study establishes an accessible and affordable experimental paradigm for 
developing a robust mouse model reflecting CHB suitable for preclinical testing 
of anti-HBV therapeutics in a BSL2 animal facility."
2021,"BACKGROUND: The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not appear to be increased for 
psoriasis patients using biologics compared to those on other treatments, but 
evidence is still limited.
OBJECTIVES: (1) to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients 
with psoriasis, (2) to compare SARS-CoV-2 infection rates for different 
psoriasis treatments groups (biologic vs. systemic conventional vs. topical 
therapy) corrected for confounders and (3) to describe patients with severe 
COVID-19 for all treatment groups.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional cohort study all patients received a 
questionnaire to gather data on psoriasis treatment, SARS-CoV-2 infections and 
related risk factors. Simultaneously, they underwent a blood test to screen for 
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 
calculated and logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards models were 
performed to determine the association between treatment group and SARS-CoV-2 
infection risk, corrected for confounders. Patients with severe COVID-19 disease 
were described and the mortality rate per treatment group was calculated for the 
target population.
RESULTS: Patients were included between April 12, 2021 and October 31, 2021. Of 
551 patients, 59 (10.7% (CI95% 8.3-13.6)) had experienced a SARS-CoV-2 
infection, based on questionnaire data combined with serological data. In our 
study cohort, corrected for confounders, biologic or non-biologic systemic 
therapy users did not appear to have increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk 
compared to patients using other treatment. Only 4 hospitalizations (0.7% (CI95% 
0.2-1.0) were reported in our study population and no ICU admissions were 
reported. The rough mortality rate in the target cohort was 0.32% (CI95% 
0.13-0.66) in all treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Corrected for risk-mitigating behaviour and vaccination status, a 
higher SARS-CoV-2 incidence for biologics or non-biologics systemics compared to 
other treatments could not be proven. Severe cases were infrequent in all 
treatment groups. This finding further strengthens treatment recommendations 
that systemic therapies for patients with psoriasis do not require preventive 
cessation for reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk."
2022,"Incidence of Malignant Melanoma has become the 5th in the UK. To date, the major 
anticancer therapeutics include cell therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy and 
nanotechnology-based strategies. Recently, extracellular vesicles, especially 
exosomes, have been highlighted for their therapeutic benefits in numerous 
chronic diseases. Exosomes display multifunctional properties, including 
inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and initiation of apoptosis. In the 
present in vitro study, the antitumour effect of cord blood stem cell 
(CBSC)-derived exosomes was confirmed by the CCK-8 assay (p < 0.05) on CHL-1 
melanoma cells and improve the repair mechanism on lymphocytes from melanoma 
patients. Importantly, no significant effect was observed in healthy lymphocytes 
when treated with the exosome concentrations at 24, 48 and 72 h. Comet assay 
results (OTM and %Tail DNA) demonstrated that the optimal exosome concentration 
showed a significant impact (p < 0.05) in lymphocytes from melanoma patients 
whilst causing no significant DNA damage in lymphocytes of healthy volunteers 
was 300 μg/ml. Similarly, the Comet assay results depicted significant DNA 
damage in a melanoma cell line (CHL-1 cells) treated with CBSC-derived exosomes, 
both the cytotoxicity of CHL-1 cells treated with CBSC-derived exosomes 
exhibited a significant time-dependent decrease in cell survival. Sequencing 
analysis of CBSC exosomes showed the presence of the let-7 family of miRNAs, 
including let-7a-5p, let-7b-5p, let-7c-5p, let-7d-3p, let-7d-5p and two novel 
miRNAs. The potency of CBSC exosomes in inhibiting cancer progression in 
lymphocytes from melanoma patients and CHL-1 cells whilst causing no harm to the 
healthy lymphocytes makes it a potential candidate as an anticancer therapy."
2023,"We present a case of a dural tear associated with nerve root herniation 
following unilateral biportal endoscopic decompression (UBED) that was 
successfully treated using a computed tomography-guided epidural blood patch. A 
60-year-old man underwent UBED for radicular pain because of spinal stenosis at 
L4-5. A left partial hemilaminectomy and flavectomy were performed; however, the 
left dorsolateral side dura mater was torn during the procedure. TachoComb® was 
applied at the dural tear site, and the pain was relieved following UBED. 
However, 3 weeks post-UBED, the patient reported severe pain with an electric 
shock-like sensation in the left buttock and posterior thigh region with no 
other neurologic symptoms. The pain was aggravated by standing and spinal 
motion. Follow-up lumbar spinal magnetic resonance imaging was performed. Axial 
images indicated protrusion of the left S2 nerve root through the left 
dorsolateral side of the dura mater. The patient was further diagnosed with 
nerve root herniation following a dura mater tear. A computed tomography-guided 
epidural blood patch was performed, with successful therapeutic results. The 
outcome of this study indicates that a small dural tear that occurs during 
minimally invasive spinal surgery can be efficiently treated using an epidural 
blood patch prior to open surgery."
2024,"We explored the association between the serum level of cystatin C (CysC) at 
admission and short-term functional outcome in patients with hypertensive 
intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) without chronic kidney disease (CKD). A total of 
555 patients with HICH were consecutively recruited after admission and were 
followed-up for 3 months after admission. The primary outcome was poor 
functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≥ 3). The median serum 
CysC level in our cohort was 1.03 mg/L (interquartile range, .89-1.20). Patients 
were categorized into four groups according to the serum CysC quartiles. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a negative association 
between serum CysC and poor functional outcome at 3-month follow-up (quartile 
[Q]1 vs. Q4: adjusted odds ratio [OR] = .260, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
.098, .691, p < .001). The negative association between serum CysC and poor 
functional outcome at 3 months was more pronounced in subgroups with smaller 
hematoma volume (≤ 30 mL), and absence of secondary intraventricular hemorrhage 
(IVH). Addition of serum CysC to a model containing conventional risk factors 
improved the model performance with net reclassification index (NRI) of .426% (p 
< .001) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) of .043% (p < .001) for 
poor functional outcome. Serum CysC was found to be a negative predictor of poor 
short-term functional outcome in HICH patients independent of renal function."
2025,"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery reduces surgical trauma with 
better preservation of abdominal wall integrity, but the extraction site is 
still at risk of incisional hernia. This study aimed to determine pooled 
incidence of incisional hernia for each type of extraction site, and to compare 
incisional hernia rates after midline, non-midline and Pfannenstiel extraction.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using the PRISMA 
guidelines. Single-armed and multiple-armed cohort studies and randomized 
controlled trials regarding minimally invasive colorectal surgery were searched 
from five databases. Outcomes were pooled and compared with random-effects, 
inverse-variance models. Risk of bias within the studies was assessed using the 
Cochrane ROBINS-I and Rob 2 tool.
RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were included, totalling 11.788 patients. Pooled 
extraction site incisional hernia rate was 16.0% for midline (n = 4081), 9.3% 
for umbilical (n = 2425), 5.2% for transverse (n = 3213), 9.4% for paramedian 
(n = 134) and 2.1% for Pfannenstiel (n = 1449). Non-midline extraction 
(transverse and paramedian) showed significantly lower odds ratios (OR) for 
incisional hernia when compared to midline extraction (including umbilical). 
Pfannenstiel extraction resulted in significantly lower OR for incisional hernia 
compared to midline (OR 0.12 (0.50-0.30)), transverse (OR 0.25 (0.13-0.50)) and 
umbilical (OR 0.072 (0.033-0.16)) extraction sites. The risks of surgical site 
infection, seroma/hematoma or wound dehiscence were not significantly different 
in any of the analyses.
CONCLUSION: Pfannenstiel extraction is the preferred method in minimally 
invasive colorectal surgery. In cases where Pfannenstiel extraction is not 
possible, surgeons should avoid specimen extraction in the midline."
2026,"OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to compare the performance of rotational 
versus standard insertion of the i-gel® (Intersurgical, Wokingham, Berkshire, 
England) in patients of advanced age.
METHODS: This single-center, randomized, double-blind trial involved 140 
patients of advanced age undergoing general anesthesia. The patients were 
randomized into the standard group and rotational group. The primary objective 
of this study was to compare the success rate of the first attempt. The 
secondary outcome indicators were the insertion time and postoperative 
complications.
RESULTS: The placement success rate on the first attempt was significantly 
higher in the rotational group than in the standard group (92% vs. 73%, 
respectively). The overall success rate was 100% for the rotational method and 
95% for the standard method. The mean ± standard deviation insertion times were 
similar (15 ± 7.34 vs. 14 ± 7.26 s, respectively). The incidence rates of blood 
staining of the i-gel®, hoarseness, and sore throat did not increase with the 
rotational technique and were not significantly different from those of the 
standard method.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the standard method, the rotational method of i-gel® 
insertion had a higher success rate and did not increase the insertion time and 
complications in patients of advanced age.Trial registration: This trial was 
registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000038763, Date of 
registration: 30/09/2020)."
2027,"Hemodialysis patients exhibit anemia-related cerebral hyperperfusion and iron 
deposition (ID). However, the mechanisms underlying the pathology of cerebral ID 
are not clear. We investigated the role of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the 
pathophysiology of cerebral ID in hemodialysis patients with anemia. This study 
recruited 33 hemodialysis patients with anemia and thirty-three healthy controls 
(HCs). All the subjects underwent quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and 
arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure ID and CBF in the cerebral nuclei. 
Furthermore, we evaluated lacunar infarction (LI), cerebral microbleeds, and 
total white matter hyperintensity volume (TWMHV). Hemodialysis patients with 
anemia showed significantly higher ID and CBF in some nuclei compared to the HCs 
after adjusting for age, sex, and total intracranial volume (TIV) [P < 0.05, 
false discovery rate (FDR) corrected]. CBF showed a positive correlation with ID 
in both patients and HCs after adjustments for age, gender, and TIV (P < 0.05, 
FDR corrected). Serum phosphorus, calcium, TWMHV, hypertension, and dialysis 
duration were independently associated with ID (P < 0.05). Hemoglobin, serum 
phosphorus, and LI were independently associated with CBF (P < 0.05). Mediation 
analysis demonstrated that CBF mediated the effects between hemoglobin and ID. 
Our study demonstrated that CBF mediated aberrant cerebral ID in hemodialysis 
patients with anemia."
2028,"Cerebral ischemia triggers inflammatory changes, and early complications and 
unfavorable outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy for brain occlusion promote 
the recruitment of various cell types to the ischemic area. Although 
anti-inflammatory M2-type macrophages are thought to exert protective effects 
against cerebral ischemia, little has been clarified regarding the significance 
of post-ischemic phase-dependent modulation of M2-type macrophages. To test our 
hypothesis that post-ischemic phase-dependent modulation of macrophages 
represents a potential therapy against ischemic brain damage, the effects on 
rats of an M2-type macrophage-specific activator, Gc-protein 
macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF), were compared with vehicle-treated control 
rats in the acute (day 0-6) or subacute (day 7-13) phase after ischemia 
induction. Acute-phase GcMAF treatment augmented both anti-inflammatory CD163+ 
M2-type- and pro-inflammatory CD16+ M1-type macrophages, resulting in no 
beneficial effects. Conversely, subacute-phase GcMAF injection increased only 
CD163+ M2-type macrophages accompanied by elevated mRNA levels of arginase-1 and 
interleukin-4. M2-type macrophages co-localized with CD36+ phagocytic cells led 
to clearance of the infarct area, which were abrogated by clodronate-liposomes. 
Expression of survival-related molecules on day 28 at the infarct border was 
augmented by GcMAF. These data provide new and important insights into the 
significance of M2-type macrophage-specific activation as post-ischemic 
phase-dependent therapy."
2029,"Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is a major complication of prematurity that 
causes secondary brain injury and is associated with long-term neurological 
disabilities. This study used a postnatal day 5 rat model of GMH to explore 
immune response, brain injury, and neurobehavioral changes after hemorrhagic 
injury. The results showed that CD45high/CD11b+ immune cells increased in the 
brain after GMH and were accompanied by increased macrophage-related 
chemokine/cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Hematoma formed as early as 2 h 
after injection of collagenase VII and white matter injury appeared not only in 
the external capsule and hippocampus, but also in the thalamus. In addition, GMH 
caused abnormal motor function as revealed by gait analysis, and locomotor 
hyperactivity in the elevated plus maze, though no other obvious anxiety or 
recognition/memory function changes were noted when examined by the open field 
test and novel object recognition test. The animal model used here partially 
reproduces the GMH-induced brain injury and motor dysfunction seen in human 
neonates and therefore can be used as a valid tool in experimental studies for 
the development of effective therapeutic strategies for GMH-induced brain 
injury."
2030,"Pericytes are the mural cells of the microvascular network that are in close 
contact with underlying endothelial cells. Endothelial-secreted PDGFB leads to 
recruitment of pericytes to the vessel wall, but this is disrupted in 
Pdgfbret/ret mice when the PDGFB retention motif is deleted. This results in 
severely reduced pericyte coverage on blood vessels. In this study, we 
investigated vascular abnormalities and hemodynamics in Pdgfbret/ret mice 
throughout the cerebrovascular network and in different cortical layers by in 
vivo two-photon microscopy. We confirmed that Pdgfbret/ret mice are severely 
deficient in pericytes throughout the vascular network, with enlarged brain 
blood vessels and a reduced number of vessel branches. Red blood cell velocity, 
linear density, and tube hematocrit were reduced in Pdgfbret/ret mice, which may 
impair oxygen delivery to the tissue. We also measured intravascular PO2 and 
found that concentrations were higher in cortical Layer 2/3 in Pdgfbret/ret 
mice, indicative of reduced blood oxygen extraction. Finally, we found that 
Pdgfbret/ret mice had a reduced capacity for vasodilation in response to an 
acetazolamide challenge during functional MRI imaging. Taken together, these 
results suggest that severe pericyte deficiency can lead to vascular 
abnormalities and altered cerebral blood flow, reminiscent of pathologies such 
as arteriovenous malformations."
2031,"Cerebral ischemic stroke remains one of the most serious neurological disorders 
that pose threats to human health, causing a large amount of long-term 
disability or even death throughout the world. Based on its physiologic and 
pathological features, there are limited available therapeutic options for 
effective ischemic stroke management. Encouragingly, a rapid advancement of 
nanobiotechnology is bringing new insights into exploring more alternative 
strategies against cerebral ischemic stroke, which can cleverly overcome the 
limitations related to conventional treatment methods. Therefore, this review 
focuses on the recent achievements of nanobiotechnology for ischemic stroke 
management, which emphasizes diverse targeted delivery strategies using various 
nanoplatforms including liposomes, micelles, polymeric nanoparticles, nanogels, 
inorganic nanomaterials, and cell-derived nano-vectors based on the 
pathophysiological features of ischemic stroke. Moreover, different therapeutic 
approaches against ischemic stroke such as neuroprotection, anti-inflammation, 
thrombolysis, increased blood-brain barrier penetration and reactive oxygen 
species scavenging are highlighted. Meanwhile, this review discusses how these 
versatile nanoplatforms were designed to assist in the treatment of ischemic 
stroke. Based on this, challenges, opportunities, and future perspectives using 
nanobiotechnology through rational design for effective ischemic stroke 
management are revealed."
2032,"A relevant number of patients with resistant hypertension do not achieve blood 
pressure (BP) dipping during nighttime. This inadequate nocturnal BP reduction 
is associated with elevated cardiovascular risks. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate whether a nighttime intensification of BAT might improve nocturnal BP 
dipping. In this prospective observational study, non-dippers treated with BAT 
for at least 6 months were included. BAT programming was modified in a two-step 
intensification of nighttime stimulation at baseline and week 6. Twenty-four 
hours ambulatory BP (ABP) was measured at inclusion and after 3 months. A number 
of 24 patients with non- or inverted dipping pattern, treated with BAT for a 
median of 44 months (IQR 25-52) were included. At baseline of the study, 
patients were 66 ± 9 years old, had a BMI of 33 ± 6 kg/m2 , showed an office BP 
of 135 ± 22/72 ± 10 mmHg, and took a median number of antihypertensives of 6 
(IQR 4-9). Nighttime stimulation of BAT was adapted by an intensification of 
pulse width from 237 ± 161 to 267 ± 170 μs (p = .003) while frequency (p = .10) 
and amplitude (p = .95) remained unchanged. Uptitration of BAT programming 
resulted in an increase of systolic dipping from 2 ± 6 to 6 ± 8% (p = .03) 
accompanied with a significant improvement of dipping pattern (p = .02). Twenty 
four hours ABP, day- and nighttime ABP remained unchanged. Programming of an 
intensified nighttime BAT interval improved dipping profile in patients treated 
with BAT, while the overall 24 h ABP did not change. Whether the improved 
dipping response contributes to a reduction of cardiovascular risk beyond the 
BP-lowering effects of BAT, however, remains to be shown."
2033,"BACKGROUND: Studies have indicated that Ban-Xia Xie-Xin Decoction (BXXXD) has 
therapeutic effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, due to the 
complexity of components and diversity of targets, the mechanisms are still not 
fully elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: In this research, we systematically analysed the targets of BXXXD 
through the method of network pharmacology and further validated them through 
experiments.
METHODS: The active components and therapeutic targets were identified, and 
these targets were analysed by the methods of gene ontology (GO), Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
analysis. Then, based on these network pharmacology analyses, we validated the 
main targets through animal experiments.
RESULTS: A total of 169 active components and 159 targets were identified. KEGG 
analysis showed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling 
pathway, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling pathway, the 
phosphatidylinositol 3' -kinase (PI3K), Akt signalling pathway, and other 
pathways were related to the treatment of T2DM by BXXXD. PPI network analysis 
showed that the key genes included signal transducers and activators of 
transcription 3 (STAT3), JUN, TNF, Recombinant V-Rel Reticuloendotheliosis Viral 
Oncogene Homolog A (RELA), Akt/PKB-1 (Protein kinase B), TP53, mitogen-activated 
protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1), mitogen-activated protein kinase-3 (MAPK-3), 
interleukin- 6 (IL6), and mitogen-activated protein kinase-14 (MAPK-14), 
respectively. Animal experiments showed that BXXXD could reduce blood glucose 
and improve insulin resistance, which may be related to the mechanisms of 
inhibiting TNF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) and 
promoting Akt phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: Our research revealed the mechanisms of BXXXD in the treatment of 
diabetes, which laid a solid foundation for further studies on the molecular 
mechanisms of BXXXD in the treatment of T2DM."
2034,"Neonatal anaemia is a very frequent clinical condition that may be due to 
apparent or not evident blood loss, decreased red blood cells (RBCs) production, 
or increased destruction of RBCs. RBCs transfusion criteria are clearly defined 
by several national and locally agreed guidelines. However, it is not possible 
to define a unique cut-off to guide clinicians' transfusion practice, which 
needs a multiparametric analysis of demographic variables (gestational age, 
postnatal age, birth weight), clinical evaluation, conventional and new 
generation monitoring (such as echocardiography and near-infrared spectroscopy). 
Unfortunately, few tools are available in the delivery room to help 
neonatologists in the management of newborn with acute anaemia. Early volume 
replacement with cristalloids and RBCs transfusion could be life-saving in the 
delivery room when a hypovolaemic shock is suspected, but the use of 
un-crossmatched whole is not risk-free nor easily available in clinical 
practice. Placental transfusion could be an extremely effective and inexpensive 
method to increase haemoglobin (Hb), to improve oxygen delivery, and to increase 
cardiac output with a reduced need for RBCs transfusions, a reduced risk of 
intraventricular haemorrhages, and an improved survival of the newborn."
2035,"BACKGROUND: The lack of a substantial breakthrough in the treatment of diabetes, 
a global issue, has led to an ongoing quest for herbs that contain bioactive 
elements with hypoglycemic properties.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential protective effect of Nigella sativa 
seeds ethanol extract and its active ingredient, thymoquinone, on 
streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
METHODS: To induce diabetes, the male Wistar rats were administered an 
intraperitoneal injection of STZ at a dosage of 90mg/kg body weight in 0.9 
percent normal saline after being fasted for 16 hours and made diabetic Group 1; 
7 rats non-diabetic control (saline-treated), Group 2; 7 untreated diabetic 
rats, Group 3; 7 diabetic rats treated orally with N. sativa extract at a dose 
of 100mg/kg body weight, Group 4; 7 diabetic rats treated orally with 
thymoquinone at a dose of 10mg/kg body weight and Group 5; 7 diabetic rats 
treated orally with Metformin at a dose of 5mg/kg body weight. After the 
treatment of 28 days, all groups were examined for body weight and biochemical 
alterations.
RESULTS: The results showed a significant decrease in blood glucose, urea, 
creatinine, uric acid, total protein, total cholesterol, low-density 
lipoprotein, and very low-density lipoprotein, while high-density lipoprotein 
was increased. Hepatic enzymes, alanine transaminase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphate were also normalized and significantly 
increased body weight.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings demonstrate that the ethanol extract of 
N. sativa seeds and its active ingredient, thymoquinone have a protective effect 
against streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The present study opens new vistas 
for the use of N. sativa and its bioactive compound, thymoquinone, regarding its 
clinical application as a new nontoxic antidiabetic agent for managing diabetes 
mellitus."
2036,"AIMS: The present work aimed to assess the antihypertensive activity of Salvia 
aucheri.
BACKGROUND: Salvia aucheri (S. aucheri) is an aromatic and medicinal herb 
belonging to the Lamiaceae family. In Morocco, this plant is locally used for 
used to treat stomach, digestive disorders, rheumatism, and hypertension. 
Nevertheless, the effect of Salvia aucheri on hypertension has not yet been 
studied.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the beneficial 
effect of the aqueous extract of S. aucheri leaves on arterial blood pressure, 
systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) in normotensive and hypertensive rats. In 
addition, the effect of the aqueous extract of S. aucheri leaves on 
vasodilatation was assessed in isolated rat aortic rings with functional 
endothelium precontracted with epinephrine EP or KCl.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The aqueous extract of the aerial parts of S. aucheri 
(AESA) was obtained, and its antihypertensive ability was pharmacologically 
investigated in L-NAME hypertensive and normotensive rats. The rats received 
AESA orally at two selected doses of 100 and 140 mg/kg for six hours (acute 
experiment) and seven days (sub-chronic). Thereafter, systolic, diastolic, mean 
arterial blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated. Moreover, the 
vasorelaxant activity of AESA was performed in thoracic aortic ring rats. In 
addition, the mechanisms of action involved in the vasorelaxant effect were 
studied.
RESULTS: The results indicated that AESA significantly reduced the systolic, 
diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure in hypertensive rats over both 
single and repeated oral administration. However, AESA did not change the blood 
pressure parameters in normotensive rats. Concerning the results of vasorelaxant 
activity, the results showed that AESA was able to provoke potent vasorelaxant 
ability, which seems to be mediated through direct nitric oxide (NO) and 
NO-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathways.
CONCLUSION: The study elucidates the beneficial action of AESA as an 
antihypertensive and vasorelaxant agent."
2037,"BACKGROUND: Annona muricata L. (Annonaceae) (AM) 's remarkable anti-inflammatory 
and anti-cancer activities make it a targeted plant to be explored for its 
immunomodulatory properties. Traditional practitioners have employed various 
components of AM to cure a variety of ailments, including cancer, diabetes, and 
inflammation.
OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the immunosuppressive effects of 80% 
ethanol extract of of AM leaves in male Wistar rats on different parameters of 
humoral and cellular immune responses.
METHODS: AM leaf extract (AMLE) was analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS to profile its 
secondary metabolites. AMLE was rich in polyphenols which include 
(epi)catechin-(epi)catechin-(epi)catechin, caffeic acid, coumaroylquinic acid, 
hyperin, kaempferol, quinic acid and rutin. The rats were administered 100, 200 
and 400 mg/kg bw of the extract daily for 14 days. The effects of AMLE on innate 
immune responses were determined by evaluating phagocytosis, neutrophils 
migration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, CD11b/CD18 integrin 
expression, and ceruloplasmin, lysozyme and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. The 
adaptive immune parameters were evaluated by immunizing the rats with sheep red 
blood cells (sRBC) on day 0 and administered orally with AMLE for 14 days.
RESULTS: AMLE established significant immunosuppressive effects on the innate 
immune parameters by inhibiting the neutrophil migration, ROS production, 
phagocytic activity and expression of CD11b/CD18 integrin in a dose-dependent 
pattern. AMLE also suppressed ceruloplasmin, MPO and lysozyme expressions in the 
rat plasma dose-dependently. AMLE dose-dependently inhibited T and B lymphocytes 
proliferation, Th1 and Th2 cytokine production, CD4+ and CD8+ co-expression in 
splenocytes, immunoglobulins (IgM and IgG) expression and the sRBC-induced 
swelling rate of rat paw in delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH).
CONCLUSION: The strong inhibitory effects on the different parameters of humoral 
and cellular responses indicate that AMLE has potential to be an important 
source of effective immunosuppressive agents."
2038,"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of HSV resistant strains, new antiviral agents 
have emerged and still are urgently needed, especially those with alternative 
targets.
OBJECTIVE: In this work, we evaluated new quinolone derivatives as anti-HSV.
METHODS: For this study, cells were infected and treated with different 
components to evaluate the profile of HSV replication in vitro. In addition, 
studies were performed to determine the pharmacokinetic toxicity and profile of 
the compound.
RESULTS: Indeed the EC50 values of these promising molecules ranged between 8 µM 
and 32 µM. We have also showed that all compounds inhibited the expression of 
ICP27 viral proteins, which gives new insights in the search for new target for 
antiherpetic therapy. Chlorine in positions C6 and phosphonate in position C1 
have shown to be important for viral inhibition. The chloroquinolone carboxamide 
derivatives fulfilled ""Lipinsky Rule of Five"" for good oral bioavailability and 
showed higher intestinal absorption and blood brain barrier penetration, as well 
as lower toxicity profile.
CONCLUSION: Although the inhibition activities of chloroquinolone carboxamide 
derivatives were lower than acyclovir, they showed different modes of action in 
comparison to the drugs currently available. These findings encourage us to 
continue pre-clinical studies for the development of new anti-HSV-1 agents."
2039,"BACKGROUND: Although the clinical outcomes of patients with TP53-mutated acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) are dismal, subsets of patients eligible for 
curative-intent therapies may fare better. Because racial disparities are known 
to affect outcome in hematologic malignancies, the authors sought to explore 
disparities among patients with TP53-mutated AML.
METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective study was conducted in a cohort of 340 
patients who had TP53-mutated AML (275 non-Hispanic White [NHW] and 65 
non-Hispanic Black [NHB]) to analyze differences in treatment and outcome among 
NHW and NHB patients.
RESULTS: The median patient age was comparable between NHW and NHB patients 
(p = .76). A higher proportion of NHB patients had therapy-related AML (31% vs. 
20%; p = .08) and had co-mutations (74% vs. 61%; p = .06). A higher proportion 
of NHW patients received intensive chemotherapy compared with NHB patients (47% 
vs. 31%; p = .02). Conversely, a higher proportion of NHB patients received 
low-intensity chemotherapy (9% vs. 5.5%; p = .02) or best supportive care (22% 
vs. 7%; p < .001). The complete response rate (including complete responses with 
or without complete count recovery) was 31% versus 24.5% (p = .39) in NHW and 
NHB patients, respectively. Only 5% of NHB patients received allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation compared with 15.5% of NHW patients (p = .02). The 
proportion of patients who were event-free (18.5% vs. 8.5%; p = .49) or who 
remained alive (24.9% vs. 8.3%; p = .13) at 18 months was numerically higher in 
NHW versus NHB patients, respectively, but was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study highlights disparities between NHW and NHB 
patients with TP53-mutated AML. Efforts are warranted to eliminate treatment 
disparities in minority populations."
2040,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy 
originated from leukemia stem cells (LSC). Emerging evidence suggests T-cell 
immunoglobulin mucin-3(Tim3) as surface marker for LSC. However, the clinical 
significance and biology of Tim-3 in AML remain to be determined, especially 
those LSCs. In public AML databases as well as our data, we separated AML 
patients into Tim-3high and Tim-3low subsets using the X-tile software and 
evaluated the associations between Tim-3 and overall survival (OS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort revealed that 
high Tim-3 expression in leukemic cells was linked with poor prognosis (DFS: 
p = 0.018; OS: p = 0.041). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis shows that 
Tim-3 was an independent factor for the prognosis (HR = 2.26, 95% 
CI = 1.15-4.44, p = 0.017). Validation cohort of public gene expression omnibus 
(GEO) confirmed that Tim-3 was a prognostic candidate in AML. Besides, in our 
internal cohort, we also confirmed that over expression of Tim-3 protein in 
LSC/LPC made poor prognosis in AML. Additionally, we revealed that the LSC 
markers AKR1C3, CD34, and MMRN1 were upregulated in the Tim-3high group of TCGA. 
We found that the upregulated genes in the Tim-3high group were mainly enriched 
in immune response, cytokine binding and cell adhesion molecules, and JAK-STAT 
signaling pathway, by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Collectively, we revealed 
that, for the first time, upregulation of Tim-3 in LSCs at the level of gene and 
protein expression is associated with poor prognosis and the important 
biological feature of Tim-3 of LSC in AML."
2041,"INTRODUCTION: In patients with NSCLC harboring oncogenic ALK or ROS1 
rearrangements, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have yielded high response rates and 
improvements in progression-free survival compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy; 
however, acquired resistance eventually develops. In preclinical models, ALK and 
MEK coinhibition was able to overcome ALK inhibitor resistance.
METHODS: A phase 1 study of the ALK/ROS1 inhibitor ceritinib and the MEK 
inhibitor trametinib in patients with refractory NSCLC harboring ALK or ROS1 
fusions was initiated. A three plus three dose-escalation scheme was used. Two 
dose levels were investigated. The primary end point was to determine the safety 
and tolerability of the combination.
RESULTS: Nine patients (n = 8 ALK+, n = 1 ROS1+) were enrolled in the study and 
completed at least one cycle of therapy. The most common adverse events (all 
grades) were diarrhea (n = 9; 100%), rash (n = 8; 89%), abdominal pain (n = 5; 
56%), and elevated aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase level (n = 4; 
44%). The overall response rate was 22%, whereas disease control rate was 56%. 
Median duration of response was 7.85 months. The median progression-free 
survival was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval: 1.5-7.0 mo). The median 
overall survival was 8.9 months (95% confidence interval: 2.0-not reached).
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this trial indicate that the combination of ceritinib and 
trametinib had no unexpected toxicities and that a tolerable dose could be 
identified. A subset of patients seemed to obtain clinical benefit from this 
treatment after progression on prior ALK/ROS1 inhibitor 
treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03087448."
2042,"Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have illness uncertainty. 
The purpose of this longitudinal study was to investigate the effect of the 
degree of illness uncertainty in patients with NAFLD on liver function values. 
We conducted a questionnaire survey and collected blood samples from outpatients 
with NAFLD. The items in the questionnaire were measured for illness uncertainty 
using the Japanese version of the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale-Community 
(MUIS-C). Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 1 year. We divided 
the patients into two groups: one with high illness uncertainty and the other 
with low illness uncertainty. We then compared changes in alanine transaminase 
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels over time from baseline using 
multiple regression analysis. This study analyzed 148 patients with NAFLD; 75 
were male and 73 were female, with a mean age of 58.4 ± 12.3 years. The group 
with higher illness uncertainty had significantly higher ALT and AST levels at 1 
year (β = .185 and .183, respectively) than the group with lower illness 
uncertainty. High illness uncertainty in patients with NAFLD can lead to higher 
ALT and AST levels. Healthcare providers must focus on reducing illness 
uncertainty in patients with NAFLD."
2043,"This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of circumumbilical 
incision (CUI) for neonates requiring intestinal anastomosis. Seventy neonates 
requiring intestinal anastomosis at our institution between 2003 and 2020 were 
included in this retrospective case-control study. Patients were classified into 
the CUI (25 patients: 36%) and transverse incision (TI) groups (45 patients: 
64%). Postoperative complications and surgical outcomes were compared between 
the two groups. Intestinal perforation at the non-anastomotic site occurred 
significantly more often in the CUI group than in the TI group (3 patients: 12%, 
and 0 patients: 0%, respectively (p = 0.042)). There were no between-group 
differences regarding anastomotic leakages, anastomotic strictures, time to 
enteral feeding, operative time, and blood loss. Neonatal intestinal surgery 
employing CUI might be associated with increased intestinal perforation at the 
non-anastomotic site. Hesitating to enlarge the skin incision to maintain 
favorable cosmetic outcomes might cause severe injury to the delicate neonatal 
intestine during the surgical procedure owing to the restricted surgical field. 
When performing CUI, we suggest that the skin incision should be extended 
without hesitation whenever there is difficulty in manipulating the intestine."
2044,"Perioperative blindness, especially posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION), 
is an uncommon but potentially devastating complication. We report a case of a 
65-year-old male patient who underwent laryngopharyngectomy, bilateral neck 
dissection, and free jejunum flap reconstruction, but then experienced PION in 
his right eye following postoperative bleeding and bilateral internal jugular 
veins (IJVs) compression. Despite systemic corticosteroid therapy, his visual 
recovery prognosis was poor. The specific mechanism responsible for PION remains 
unclear, and no therapy has been shown to improve this condition. As such, 
prevention of perioperative PION remains the only available strategy. Surgeons 
should be aware of this rare potential complication and its risk factors and 
strive to avoid it. As postoperative bleeding and IJV compression are one of 
important risk factors for PION, avoiding these are critical."
2045,"Thromboembolic complications are a concern in the treatment of cerebral 
aneurysms using a flow diverter. In this study, we report a case of abnormal 
foreshortening of a Flow Re-Direction Endoluminal Device (FRED) caused by 
in-stent thrombosis immediately after its deployment. A 72-year-old woman had a 
large cavernous carotid aneurysm, which caused ptosis and diplopia. FRED 
deployment was planned, and dual antiplatelet therapy was initiated 2 weeks 
before the procedure. Under systemic heparinization, FRED was deployed with 
local compaction over the aneurysm orifice. Cone-beam computed tomography 
subsequently revealed slightly poor wall apposition at the proximal side. While 
the balloon catheter was prepared for angioplasty, the stent became abnormally 
foreshortened, the proximal side slipped into the aneurysm, and the internal 
carotid artery became occluded. FRED was removed using a snare wire, and 
recanalization was obtained. The lumen of the removed FRED was filled with 
thrombus. The antiplatelet therapy was changed to triple regimen, and a Pipeline 
Flex embolization device was placed 1 month later. At that time, no 
thromboembolic complications were noted. It was considered that thrombotic 
occlusion was followed by foreshortening of FRED on the distal side because of 
antegrade blood flow. Multiple factors, such as increased mesh density by 
locally compacted stent deployment, slightly poor wall apposition, clopidogrel 
resistance, and the dual-layer structure of FRED, may have been involved in 
thrombus formation."
2046,"This study sought to establish an experimental aneurysm model of visualizing 
coil insertion using radiolucent nylon coils. Moreover, this study aimed to 
clarify the characteristics and differences of each coil and use them clinically 
as indices of coil selection. The coil insertion test was performed on the 10 mm 
spherical silicone aneurysm model filled to a nylon coil volume embolization 
ratio of 11.8%. Five types of coil were randomly tested six times, and the 
distribution of the coils was analyzed by fluoroscopy imaging. Indices of ""Area 
(mm2),"" ""Feret's diameter (mm),"" and ""Circularity"" were calculated from the 
fluoroscopic images. Among the indices, only ""Area"" showed a significant 
difference between coils (p = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, ""Area"" of the ED 
Infini was larger than those of Target XL soft and Galaxy G3 (p = 0.018 and 
0.026, respectively). Furthermore, the area of the 360 soft was larger than that 
of G3 (p = 0.049). Analysis of the correlation between these values and the coil 
configuration showed that ""Area"" was negatively correlated with the stock-wire 
diameter (r = -0.50; p = 0.004) and primary coil configuration (r = -0.65; p < 
0.001). When inserting the coils in the early stage, although the difference 
between each coil is relatively difficult to obtain, knowledge on the proper use 
of the coils with differences in characteristics can help in selecting the coil 
most appropriate for the conditions."
2047,"We hypothesized that, compared with young males, young females have a smaller 
decrease in blood flow to the inactive limb, accompanied by a smaller increase 
in arterial blood pressure, during dynamic exercise with increased inspiratory 
muscle work. Young males and females performed dynamic knee-extension and 
-flexion exercises for 10 min (spontaneous breathing for 5 min and voluntary 
hyperpnoea with or without inspiratory resistance for 5 min). Mean arterial 
blood pressure (MAP) and mean blood flow (MBF) in the brachial artery were 
continuously measured by means of finger photoplethysmography and Doppler 
ultrasound, respectively. No sex differences were found in the ΔMAP and ΔMBF (Δ: 
from baseline) during exercise without inspiratory resistance. In contrast, the 
ΔMAP during exercise with inspiratory resistive breathing was greater (P < 0.05) 
in males (+31.3 ± 2.1 mmHg, mean ± SE) than females (+18.9 ± 3.2 mmHg). The MBF 
during exercise with inspiratory resistance did not change in males (-4.4 ± 10.6 
mL/min), whereas it significantly increased in females (+25.2 ± 15.4 mL/min). 
These results suggest that an attenuated inspiratory muscle-induced metaboreflex

exercise."
2048,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, to find scientific evidence for the traditional use 
of Pergularia tomentosa as an anti-diabetic remedy, the effects of its aqueous 
extract on streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in rats were evaluated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were fasted overnight and diabetes mellitus 
was induced using streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body weight). The rats were randomly 
and equally divided into four groups (n=5): group I (normoglycaemic control), 
group II (diabetic rats), group III (diabetic rats treated with 200 mg/kg BW of 
an aqueous extract of P. tomentosa), group IV (normoglycemic rats treated with 
200 mg/kg BW of an aqueous extract of P. tomentosa). Chemical profiling of the 
aqueous extract was carried out using liquid chromatography coupled with 
electrospray ionization and multiple-stage linear ion-trap and orbitrap 
high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/LTQOrbitrap/MS/MS). In addition, the 
quantitative determination of the main cardenolides in the extract was carried 
out by an analytical approach based on LC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
with ESI source and hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass analyzer 
(LC-ESI/QTrap/MS/MS).
RESULTS: Aqueous extract of P. tomentosa showed a reasonable reduction in blood 
glucose level. Probably, the P. tomentosa effect on hyperglycemic and 
hyperlipidemic diabetic animals was associated with antioxidant properties, 
triglyceride levels, as well as liver enzymes. Meanwhile, 
LC-ESI/LTQOrbitrap/MS/MS analysis led to identification of double-linked 
cardenolides along with cardenolides and flavone glycosides as the main 
bioactive compounds.
CONCLUSION: The extract decreased the glucose level and induced a beneficial 
effect on the lipid profile, probably due to the presence of cardenolide 
glycosides."
2049,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the in vivo anticancer activity of 
arginine-reduced graphene (Gr-Arg) and ginsenoside Rh2-containing 
arginine-reduced graphene (Gr-Arg-Rh2).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two mice with breast cancer were divided into four 
groups and treated every three days for 32 days: Group 1, PBS, Group 2, Rh2, 
Group 3, Gr-Arg, and Group 4, Gr-Arg-Rh2. The tumor size and weight, gene 
expression (IL10, INF-γ, TGFβ, and FOXP3), and pathological properties of the 
tumor and normal tissues were assessed.
RESULTS: Results showed a significant decrease in TGFβ expression for all drug 
treatment groups compared with the controls (P=0.04). There was no significant 
difference among the groups regarding IL10 and FOXP3 gene expression profiles 
(P>0.05). Gr-Arg-Rh2 significantly inhibited tumor growth (size and weight) 
compared with Rh2 and control groups. The highest survival rate and the highest 
percentage of tumor necrosis (87.5%) belonged to the Gr-Arg-Rh2 group. Lungs 
showed metastasis in the control group. No metastasis was observed in the 
Gr-Arg-Rh2 group. Gr-Arg-Rh2 showed partial degeneration of hepatocytes and 
acute cell infiltration in the portal spaces and around the central vein. The 
Gr-Arg group experienced a moderate infiltration of acute cells into the port 
spaces and around the central vein. The Rh2 group also showed a mild 
infiltration of acute and chronic cells in portal spaces.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results, Gr-Arg-Rh2 can reduce tumor size, weight, and 
growth, TGF-β gene expression, and increase tumor necrosis and survival time in 
mice with cancer."
2050,"OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease in diabetics is 
progressively increasing with an increased risk of fatal complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty male albino rats were used in the study, and type 2 
diabetes mellitus were induced. Diabetic rats were divided randomly into 5 
groups, the control diabetic group and 4 treated groups were treated with 
metformin (group3), dulaglutide (group 4), metformin & cilostazol (group 5), and 
the last group was treated with dulaglutide & cilostazol (group 6). At the end 
of the experiment, the weight of rats and systolic blood pressure were 
estimated. After overnight fasting, the serum levels of blood glucose, lipid 
profile, and kidney function were measured. After scarification, gene expression 
of eNOS and NFKB in kidney tissue were estimated and kidney tissues were 
examined for histopathology.
RESULTS: Diabetic rats showed a significant increase in body weight, blood 
pressure, serum blood glucose, lipid profile, and impaired kidney function. 
Metformin and dulaglutide are associated with a significant decrease in blood 
pressure, blood glucose level, serum lipid profile, and improved kidney 
function. These changes are associated with a significant increase in 
anti-oxidative markers, and decreased inflammatory and fibrotic markers, 
especially with the addition of cilostazol.
CONCLUSION: Metformin and dulaglutide have been shown to ameliorate kidney 
damage in diabetics by stimulating the anti-oxidant defense system, normalizing 
kidney functional parameters, and improving histopathological changes. The 
addition of cilostazol to metformin or dulaglutide increased some of their 
anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory properties."
2051,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, Boltorn® H40-PEG-MTX-anti-VEGFR2 nanobody was 
fabricated in which nanobody was selected for blocking the receptor, H40 as a 
nanocarrier for delivery of methotrexate (MTX) to the tumor cells, and 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties for improving the blood circulation time and 
safety.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The synthesis process of the nanosystem has been 
characterized by different analytical methods.
RESULTS: The prepared nanoplatform exhibited high drug loading capacity, 
excellent colloidal stability, and an average particle size of around 105 nm. 
MTX was successfully conjugated through ester bonds and its release profile 
clearly showed that the ester bond is in favor of releasing the drug in acidic 
pH (5.5). The cytotoxicity of the developed nanoplatform exhibited great 
anti-cancer activity against MCF7 and KDR293 (cells with overexpressed 
anti-VEGFR2 NB receptors) cell lines while no deleterious toxicity was observed 
for nanocarrier against HEK293 normal cells. Furthermore, both hemolysis and 
LD50 assay results confirmed the hemocompatibility and biocompatibility of the 
developed nanoplatform.
CONCLUSION: The most striking result to derive from the data is that the 
designed nanoplatform could potentially inhibit cell migration and invasion and 
the anti-angiogenesis properties of the developed nanoplatform may serve as a 
promising nanosystem to suppress the formation of blood vessels around tumor 
cells and consequently inhibit tumor progression."
2052,"AIMS: Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a major cause of drug-resistant 
paediatric epilepsy and is amenable to successful neurosurgical resection. FCD 
ILAE Type IIb is the most common FCD subtype, and brain somatic mutations 
affecting the mTOR pathway play a major pathogenic role. The aim of this study 
was to comprehensively describe the genotype-phenotype association of twenty 
patients with histopathologically confirmed FCDIIb using Next Generation 
Sequencing (NGS) of paired blood-brain samples METHODS: Clinical and 
neuropathological data were retrospectively reviewed from the hospital archive. 
The NGS panel included 11 mTOR-pathway-related genes with maximum coverage of 
2000x. The detected variants were validated by digital droplet PCR.
RESULTS: Pathogenic MTOR variants were identified in 10 patients (50%). Further 
comparison with MTOR-wildtype FCDIIb suggested a profound genotype-phenotype 
association characterized by (1) a non-temporal lobe lesion on MRI, (2) a larger 
lesion volume occupying grey and white matter (3.032±1.859cm3 vs. 1.110±0.856cm3 
, p=0.014), (3) more balloon cells (50.20±14.40BC/mm2 vs. 31.64±30.56BC/mm2 , 
p=0.099) and dysmorphic neurons (48.72±19.47DN/mm2 vs. 15.28±13.95DN/mm2 , 
p=0.000), as well as (4) a positive correlation between VAF and the lesion 
volume (r=0.802, p=0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified frequent MTOR mutations in the cell-rich 
FCDIIb phenotype, clinically characterized by a non-temporal location and large 
lesion volume. Comprehensive genotype-phenotype associations will help us 
further explore and define the broad spectrum of FCD lesions to make more 
targeted therapies available in the realm of epileptology."
2053,"To analyze the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of TLDH with 
Autologous Bone-Fusion for T10-L1 TLDH or Cage-Fusion for T12-L3 TLDH. This is a 
retrospective multi-center clinical study, involving a total of 43 patients with 
TLDH who underwent surgery in our institutions from December 2013 to January 
2021. In all, 15 of 43 patients (34.9%) with T10-11(2)/T11-12(5)/T12-L1 (8) TLDH 
underwent Autologous Bone-Fusion surgery and 28 of 43 patients (65.1%) with 
T12-L1(3)/L1-L2(12)/L2-L3(13) TLDH underwent Cage-Fusion surgery. Demographic 
data, clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. During 
the follow-up, pre- to post-operative ODI, VAS back and leg pain scores 
significantly decreased (P1.2 = 0.001) and the score changes had no significant 
difference between two groups (P3 = 0.81, 0.59, 0.68). The intraoperative blood 
loss and operation time showed no significant difference between two groups 
(P = 0.056, 0.072). The patients showed prominent improvement of hypokinesia and 
satisfactory rate in two groups (5/7, 71.4% VS 9/12, 75.0%, P = 0.633; 11, 73.3% 
VS 25, 89.3%, P = 0.281). Notably, no recurrence and severe complications were 
reported. The choice of surgery approach should be individualized by clinical 
characteristics and radiology. Selectively Autologous Bone-Fusion for T10-L1 
TLDH or Cage-Fusion for T12-L3 TLDH provided adequate nerve decompression and 
immediate stability. The overall fusion surgical outcomes were satisfactory 
without major complications during follow-up."
2054,"BACKGROUND Kidney failure is a public health problem that may require 
transplantation for patient survival and for those at risk of developing 
infectious diseases such as COVID-19 due to severe immunosuppression. We report 
the case of 2 kidney transplant patients who contracted COVID-19. CASE REPORT 
Patient 1: A 60-year-old Gabonese man presented with 8 days of wet cough, fever, 
and myalgias associated secondarily with dyspnea, without anosmia or ageusia. 
His medical history included renal transplant for malignant 
nephro-angiosclerosis and high blood pressure. The oxygen saturation level 
subsequently fell to 89-90%. The diagnosis of acute hypoxic respiratory failure 
secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia with heart and acute renal failure on renal 
transplant was made based on clinical symptoms, lung imaging results, and a 
positive SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab PCR test. Patient 2: A 79-year-old Gabonese man 
presented with 10 days of dry cough associated with intermittent fevers not 
quantified, anorexia, and fatigue. The patient's medical history was high blood 
pressure, diabetes mellitus, and renal transplantation. Oxygen saturation level 
decreased to 85-89% in ambient air. Clinical signs and chest CT scan showed 70% 
lung lesions with large areas of ground-glass opacity with essentially 
peripheral distribution of both lungs associated with crazy paving, 
condensation, bronchiectasis, and arterial dilatation, suggesting severe 
COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Those 2 presentations highlight the fact that a severe 
clinical form of COVID-19 associated with acute renal failure and kidney 
transplant can be fatal. Kidney transplantation is a risk factor for poor 
prognosis in patients with severe COVID-19 and greatly worsens the mortality 
rate of immunocompromised patients."
2055,"VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is a 
newly defined disorder in which treatment is still unclear. Herein, a patient 
with VEXAS syndrome who had atypical findings and an interesting treatment 
course is presented as a case report. He had fatigue, recurrent fever, pulmonary 
infiltrates, proteinuria, anemia, leucopenia, transient skin rush and increased 
acute phase reactants. The patient, who could not tolerate corticosteroid 
tapering, recovered rapidly after diagnostic splenectomy and the pathological 
examination of the spleen revealed significant findings."
2056,"BACKGROUND: New genome sequencing technologies with enhanced diagnostic 
efficiency have emerged. Rapid and timely diagnosis of treatable rare genetic 
diseases can alter their medical management and clinical course. However, 
multiple factors, including ethical issues, must be considered. We designed a 
targeted sequencing platform to avoid ethical issues and reduce the turnaround 
time.
METHODS: We designed an automated sequencing platform using dried blood spot 
samples and a NEOseq_ACTION panel comprising 254 genes associated with Mendelian 
diseases having curable or manageable treatment options. Retrospective 
validation was performed using data from 24 genetically and biochemically 
confirmed patients. Prospective validation was performed using data from 111 
patients with suspected actionable genetic diseases.
RESULTS: In prospective clinical validation, 13.5% patients presented with 
medically actionable diseases, including short- or medium-chain acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase deficiencies (N=6), hyperphenylalaninemia (N=2), 
mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (N=1), alpha thalassemia (N=1), 
3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2 deficiency (N=1), propionic acidemia (N=1), 
glycogen storage disease, type IX(a) (N=1), congenital myasthenic syndrome 
(N=1), and citrullinemia, type II (N=1). Using the automated analytic pipeline, 
the turnaround time from blood collection to result reporting was <4 days.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study evaluated the possibility of rapid and timely 
diagnosis of treatable rare genetic diseases using a panel designed by a 
multidisciplinary team. The automated analytic pipeline maximized the clinical 
utility of rapid targeted sequencing for medically actionable genes, providing a 
strategy for appropriate and timely treatment of rare genetic diseases."
2057,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) refers to a blood clot that starts in a vein. The 
risk of developing VTE is highest after major surgery or a major injury, or when 
someone has heart failure, cancer, or infectious disease (e.g., COVID-19). 
Without prompt treatment to break up clots and prevent more from forming, VTE 
can restrict or block blood flow and oxygen, which can damage the body tissue or 
organs. VTE can occur without any obvious signs, and imaging technologies are 
used. Alternatively rapid measurement of thrombin generation (TG) and D-dimer 
could be used to make a fast, portable, and easy-to-use diagnostic platform for 
VTE. Here, we have demonstrated a diagnostic sensing platform with the ability 
of simultaneous detection of TG and D-dimer in human plasma. Modifications were 
made to both the assay protocols to eliminate the need for sample dilution and 
incubation steps. Using a substantially reduced sample volume, the measurement 
results show comparable performance to the gold standard method. Our platform is 
able to deliver accurate and cost-effective results for both TG and D-dimer 
assays when using undiluted plasma in under 15 min. The assays presented are 
therefore a good candidate technology for use in a point-of-care platform to 
diagnose VTE."
2058,"BACKGROUND: Lower-than-normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 
associated with the risk for all-cause mortality and adverse cardiovascular 
events. In this regard, the role of higher-than-normal eGFR is still 
controversial.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate long-term clinical consequences across the levels of eGFR 
calculated by the creatinine-based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology 
Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation among apparently healthy cardiovascular risk 
subjects.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n=1747) of a population-based screening and 
intervention program for cardiovascular risk factors in Finland during the years 
2005-2007.
MAIN MEASURES: Cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality.
KEY RESULTS: Over the 14-year follow-up, subjects with eGFR ≥105 ml/min/1.73 m2 
(n=97) had an increased risk for all-cause mortality [HR 2.15 (95% CI: 
1.24-3.73)], incident peripheral artery disease [HR 2.62 (95% CI: 1.00-6.94)], 
and atrial fibrillation/flutter [HR 2.10 (95% CI: 1.21-3.65)] when compared to 
eGFR category 90-104 ml/min after adjustment for cardiovascular and 
lifestyle-related risk factors. The eGFR category ≥105 ml/min was also 
associated with a two-fold increased mortality rate compared to the Finnish 
general population.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal hyperfiltration defined as eGFR ≥105 ml/min/1.73 m2 is a 
frequent and important finding in patients commonly treated in primary care. 
These patients should be followed closely for timely interventions, such as 
strict BP and blood glucose regulation."
2059,"The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of dopamine 
(DA) versus norepinephrine (NE) as first-line therapy for sepsis-related 
hypotension in preterm infants. This is a retrospective cohort study over 
10 years at two tertiary neonatal units. Preterm infants born < 35 weeks 
post-menstrual age (PMA), who received DA or NE as primary therapy for 
hypotension during sepsis, defined as culture-positive or culture-negative 
infections or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), were included. Episode-related 
mortality (< 7 days from treatment), pre-discharge mortality, and major 
morbidities among survivors were compared between two groups. Analyses were 
adjusted using the inverse probability of treatment weighting estimated by 
propensity score (PS). A total of 156 infants were included, 113 received DA and 
43 NE. The mean ± SD PMA at birth and at treatment for the DA and NE groups were 
25.8 ± 2.3 vs. 25.2 ± 2.0 weeks and 27.7 ± 3.0 vs. 27.1 ± 2.6 weeks, 
respectively (p > 0.05). Pre-treatment, the NE group had higher mean airway 
pressure (14 ± 4 vs. 12 ± 4 cmH2O), heart rate (185 ± 17 vs. 175 ± 17 beats per 
minute), and median (IQR) fraction of inspired oxygen [0.67 (0.42, 1.0) vs. 0.52 
(0.32, 0.82)] (p < 0.05 for all). After PS adjustment, NE was associated with 
lower episode-related mortality [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) 0.55 (0.33, 
0.92)], pre-discharge mortality [0.60 (0.37, 0.97)], post-illness new diagnosis 
of significant neurologic injury [0.32 (0.13, 0.82)], and subsequent occurrence 
of NEC/sepsis among the survivors [0.34, (0.18, 0.65)].
CONCLUSION: NE may be more effective than DA for management of sepsis-related 
hypotension among preterm infants. These data provide a rationale for 
prospective evaluation of these commonly used agents.
WHAT IS KNOWN: •Dopamine is the commonest vasoactive agent used to support blood 
pressure among preterm infants. •For adult patients, norepinephrine is 
recommended as the preferred therapy over dopamine for septic shock.
WHAT IS NEW: •This is the first study examining the relative clinical 
effectiveness of dopamine and norepinephrine as first-line pharmacotherapy for 
sepsis-related hypotension among preterm infants. •Norepinephrine use may be 
associated with lower mortality and morbidity than dopamine in preterm infants 
with sepsis."
2060,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is common after allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). The determination of incidence, 
risk factors, and impact of CDI on alloHCT outcomes is an unmet need. The study 
examines all patients aged 2 years and older who received first alloHCT for 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) between 2013 and 2018 at US centers and reported 
to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 
data registry. In total, 826 patients with CDI and 6723 controls from 127 
centers were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of CDI by day 100 was 18.7% (99% 
CI: 15-22.7%) and 10.2% (99% CI: 9.2-11.1%) in pediatric and adult patients, 
respectively, with a median time to diagnosis at day +13. CDI was associated 
with inferior overall survival (OS) (p = 0.0018) and a 2.58-fold [99% CI: 
1.43-4.66; p < 0.001] increase in infection-related mortality (IRM). There was a 
significant overlap in the onset of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) and 
CDI. IRM increased to >4 fold when CDI + aGVHD was considered. Despite advances 
in the management of CDI, increased IRM and decreased OS still results from CDI."
2061,"One factor that shapes the establishment of early neonatal intestinal microbiota 
is environmental microbial exposure, and probiotic application has been shown to 
promote health and growth of piglets. Thus, this study hypothesized that 
environmental probiotic application in early days of life would be beneficial to 
newborn piglets. This study aimed to investigate the effect of spraying a 
compound probiotic fermented liquid (CPFL) into the living environment of 
piglets on their early growth performance and immunity. This work included 68 
piglets, which were randomized into probiotic and control groups. Blood and 
fecal samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days of age. Spraying CPFL 
significantly reshaped the microbiota composition of the delivery room 
environment, increased piglets' daily weight gain and weaning weight (P<0.001), 
and modulated piglets' serum cytokine levels (increases in IgA, IgG, and IL-10; 
decrease in IFN-γ; P<0.05 in each case) in piglets. Additionally, spraying CPFL 
during early days of life modified piglets' gut microbiota structure and 
diversity, increased the abundance of some potentially beneficial bacteria (such 
as Bacteroides uniformis, Butyricimonas virosa, Parabacteroides distasonis, and 
Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens) and decreased the abundance of Escherichia 
coli (P<0.05). Interestingly, CPFL application also significantly enhanced the 
gut microbial bioactive potential and levels of several serum metabolites 
involved in the metabolism of vitamins (B2, B3, B6, and E), medium/long-chain 
fatty acids (caproic, tetradecanoic, and peptadecanoic acids), and dicarboxylic 
acids (azelaic and sebacic acids). Our study demonstrated that spraying CPFL 
significantly could improve piglets' growth performance and immunity, and the 
beneficial effects are associated with changes in the gut microbiota and host 
metabolism. Our study has provided novel data for future development of 
probiotic-based health-promoting strategies and expanded our knowledge of 
probiotic application in animal husbandry."
2062,"CD8+ T cells are critical for elimination of cancer cells. Factors within the 
tumor microenvironment (TME) can drive these cells to a hypofunctional state 
known as exhaustion. The most terminally exhausted T (tTex) cells are resistant 
to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and might instead limit immunotherapeutic 
efficacy. Here we show that intratumoral CD8+ tTex cells possess transcriptional 
features of CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and are similarly capable of directly 
suppressing T cell proliferation ex vivo. tTex cell suppression requires CD39, 
which generates immunosuppressive adenosine. Restricted deletion of CD39 in 
endogenous CD8+ T cells resulted in slowed tumor progression, improved 
immunotherapy responsiveness and enhanced infiltration of transferred 
tumor-specific T cells. CD39 is induced on tTex cells by tumor hypoxia, thus 
mitigation of hypoxia limits tTex suppression. Together, these data suggest tTex 
cells are an important regulatory population in cancer and strategies to limit 
their generation, reprogram their immunosuppressive state or remove them from 
the TME might potentiate immunotherapy."
2063,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between retinal haemorrhages detected on 
Ultra-widefield (UWF) red channel images and perfusion status in eyes with acute 
central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).
METHODS: UWF fundus images were split into green and red channels using ImageJ 
software. The retinal haemorrhages were calculated quantitatively with both the 
green and red channel images, resulting in green channel haemorrhages (GCH) and 
red channel haemorrhages (RCH). The nonperfusion area (NPA) was also calculated 
from fluorescein angiography in each eye. The relationships between both the GCH 
and RCH with the NPA were investigated.
RESULTS: Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients with acute CRVO (18 men, 14 women) were 
included. The mean GCH and RCH values were 10.4% ± 8.2% and 1.7% ± 1.7%, 
respectively. The mean NPA was 39.2% ± 28.8%. Significant correlations were seen 
between the GCH and NPA (r = 0.38; P = 0.022) and RCH and NPA (r = 0.44; 
P = 0.010, linear regression analysis). Multivariate analysis suggested that 
only the RCHs were correlated significantly with the NPA.
CONCLUSIONS: Retinal haemorrhages detected by UWF red channel imaging were less 
compared to green channel imaging and associated closely with retinal NPAs in 
eyes with acute CRVO. UWF red channel imaging allowed us to identify 
ischaemia-related haemorrhage."
2064,"PURPOSE: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is routinely used to monitor 
cardiac function in cancer patients. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) detects 
subclinical myocardial dysfunction. There is no consensus on what constitutes a 
significant change in GLS in pediatric cancer patients. We aim to determine the 
change in GLS associated with a simultaneous decline in LVEF in pediatric cancer 
patients.
METHODS: This is a retrospective longitudinal study of pediatric cancer patients 
treated with anthracyclines between October 2017 and November 2019. GLS was 
measured by 2-dimensional speckle tracking. The study outcome was a decline in 
LVEF, defined as a decrease in LVEF of ≥ 10% points from baseline or LVEF < 55%. 
We evaluated two echocardiograms per patient, one baseline, and one follow-up. 
The follow-up echocardiogram was either (1) the first study that met the outcome 
or (2) the last echocardiogram available in patients without the outcome. 
Statistical analyses included receiver operator characteristic curves and 
univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: Out of 161 patients, 33 (20.5%) had a decline in LVEF within one year 
of follow-up. GLS reduction by ≥ 15% from baseline and follow-up GLS >-18% had 
sensitivities of 85% and 78%, respectively, and specificities of 86% and 83%, 
respectively, to detect LVEF decline. GLS reduction by ≥ 15% from baseline and 
follow-up GLS >-18% were independently associated with simultaneous LVEF decline 
[hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals): 16.71 (5.47-51.06), and 12.83 
(4.62-35.63), respectively].
CONCLUSION: Monitoring GLS validates the decline in LVEF in pediatric cancer 
patients."
2065,"Coronary flow capacity (CFC) categorizes severity of left ventricular (LV) 
ischemia by PET myocardial blood flow (MBF). Our objective was to correlate 
abnormal CFC with other indicators of regional ischemia. Data were examined 
retrospectively for 231 patients evaluated for known/suspected CAD who underwent 
rest and regadenoson-stress 82Rb PET/CT. MBF and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) 
were quantified, from which CFC was categorized as Normal CFC (1), Minimally 
reduced (2), Mildly reduced (3), Moderately reduced (4), and Severely reduced 
(5) for the three main arterial territories as well as globally. Relative 
perfusion summed stress score (SSS) and systolic phase contraction bandwidth 
(BW) were assessed. Accuracy to detect arteries with CFC ≥ 4 was highest for a 
Regional Index combining SSS and BW (88 ± 3%). A Global Index formed from stress 
ejection fraction, SSS and BW was the most accurate means of identifying 
patients with global CFC ≥ 4 (84 ± 3%). Arteries with abnormal CFC derived from 
absolute myocardial blood flow measurements are accurately identified by 
composite parameters combining regionally aberrant relative perfusion patterns 
and asynchrony."
2066,"CircRNAs have been shown to be involved in the development of certain diseases, 
but their application in prehypertension and hypertension remains unclear. We 
aimed to explore the potential role of circ_0000284 in revealing the molecular 
regulatory mechanisms of prehypertension and hypertension. We enrolled a total 
of 100 patients with normal blood pressure, 100 patients with prehypertension 
and 100 patients with hypertension. The expression of circ_0000284 among the 
groups was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT‒PCR). Multivariate logistic models were constructed combining 
conventional risk factors with circ_0000284. A receiver operating characteristic 
curve (ROC) was used to analyze the diagnostic value of circRNAs in the clinical 
model. Spearman correlation was used to analyze the correlation of circ_0000284 
and the biochemical characteristics of all subjects. The results showed that 
circ_0000284 was differentially expressed among the normal blood pressure group, 
prehypertensive group and hypertensive group and showed a significantly 
upregulated trend in the progression to hypertension (P < 0.05). The ROC curve 
revealed a high diagnostic ability of circ_0000284 in hypertension in the 
clinical model (AUC = 0.812). Circ_0000284 also presented a certain ability for 
early diagnosis of prehypertension (AUC = 0.628). Spearman correlation showed 
that circ_0000284 was positively correlated with Na and CKMB. Our study 
suggested that upregulated expression of circ_0000284 was an independent risk 
factor for prehypertension and hypertension. Circ_0000284 was a potential 
fingerprint for the early diagnosis of hypertension and distinguished the 
intermediate stage of hypertension development. Moreover, our study provided new 
insight into the correlation between circ_0000284 and cardiac injury in the 
progression to hypertension."
2067,"Chemoresistance and relapse are the leading cause of AML-related deaths. 
Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we dissected the cellular 
states of bone marrow samples from primary refractory or short-term relapsed AML 
patients and defined the transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity. We found 
that compared to proliferating stem/progenitor-like cells (PSPs), a 
subpopulation of quiescent stem-like cells (QSCs) were involved in the 
chemoresistance and poor outcomes of AML. By performing longitudinal scRNA-seq 
analyses, we demonstrated that PSPs were reprogrammed to obtain a QSC-like 
expression pattern during chemotherapy in refractory AML patients, characterized 
by the upregulation of CD52 and LGALS1 expression. Flow cytometric analysis 
further confirmed that the preexisting CD99+CD49d+CD52+Galectin-1+ (QSCs) cells 
at diagnosis were associated with chemoresistance, and these cells were further 
enriched in the residual AML cells of refractory patients. Interaction of 
CD52-SIGLEC10 between QSCs and monocytes may contribute to immune evading and 
poor outcomes. Furthermore, we identified that LGALS1 was a promising target for 
chemoresistant AML, and LGALS1 inhibitor could help eliminate QSCs and enhance 
the chemotherapy in patient-derived primary AML cells, cell lines, and AML 
xenograft models. Our results will facilitate a better understanding of the AML 
chemoresistance mechanism and the development of novel therapeutic strategies 
for relapsed/refractory AML patients."
2068,"Genetic predisposition (familial risk) in the myeloproliferative neoplasms 
(MPNs) is more common than the risk observed in most other cancers, including 
breast, prostate, and colon. Up to 10% of MPNs are considered to be familial. 
Recent genome-wide association studies have identified genomic loci associated 
with an MPN diagnosis. However, the identification of variants with functional 
contributions to the development of MPN remains limited. In this study, we have 
included 630 MPN patients and whole genome sequencing was performed in 64 
individuals with familial MPN to uncover recurrent germline predisposition 
variants. Both targeted and unbiased filtering of single nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) was performed, with a comparison to 218 individuals with MPN unselected 
for familial status. This approach identified an ATM L2307F SNV occurring in 
nearly 8% of individuals with familial MPN. Structural protein modeling of this 
variant suggested stabilization of inactive ATM dimer, and alteration of the 
endogenous ATM locus in a human myeloid cell line resulted in decreased 
phosphorylation of the downstream tumor suppressor CHEK2. These results 
implicate ATM, and the DNA-damage response pathway, in predisposition to MPN."
2069,"Microfibers, a type of long, thin, and flexible material, can be assembled into 
functional three-dimensional (3D) structures by folding, binding and weaving. As 
a novel spinning method, combining microfluidic technology and wet spinning, 
microfluidic spinning technology can precisely control the size, morphology, 
structure, and composition of the microfibers. Particularly, the process is mild 
and rapid, which is suitable for preparing microfibers using biocompatible 
materials and, without affecting the viability of cells encapsulated. 
Furthermore, owing to the controllability of microfluidic spinning, microfibers 
with well-defined structures (such as hollow structures) will contribute to the 
exchange of nutrients or guide cell orientation. Thus, this method is often used 
to fabricate microfibers as cell scaffolds for cell encapsulation or adhesion, 
and can be further applied to biomimetic fibrous tissues. In this review, we 
focus on different fiber structures prepared by microfluidic spinning 
technology, including solid, hollow, and heterogeneous structures, generated 
from three essential elements: spinning platform, fiber composition, and 
solidification methods. Furthermore, we describe the application of microfibers 
with different structures in tissue engineering, such as blood vessels, skeletal 
muscle, bone, nerves, and lung bronchi. Finally, the challenges and future 
development prospects of microfluidic spinning technology in tissue engineering 
applications are discussed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

2070,"Thioacetamide (TAA) exposure and hepatitis C virus infection are usually 
associated with renal dysfunction. Sofosbuvir (SFV) and daclatasvir (DAC) drugs 
combination has great value in the treatment of hepatitis C. The study aimed to 
identify the nephrotoxic effects of TAA and to evaluate the ameliorative role of 
SFV and DAC in this condition. Forty-eight adult male albino rats were divided 
into eight groups and received saline (control), SFV, DAC, SFV+DAC, TAA, 
TAA+SFV, TAA+DAC and TAA+SFV+DAC for eight weeks. Kidney and blood samples were 
retrieved and processed for histological (Hematoxylin and Eosin and Masson's 
trichrome), immunohistochemical (α-smooth muscle actin), and biochemical 
analysis (urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, malondialdehyde, reduced 
glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and tumor necrosis factor-α). Examination 
revealed marked destruction of renal tubules on exposure to TAA with either 
hypertrophy or atrophy of glomeruli, increase in collagen deposition, and wide 
expression of α-smooth muscle actin. Also, significant disturbance in kidney 
functions, oxidative stress markers, and tumor necrosis factor-α. 
Supplementation with either SFV or DAC produced mild improvement in the tissue 
and laboratory markers. Moreover, the combination of both drugs greatly refined 
the pathology induced by TAA at the cellular and laboratory levels. However, 
there are still significant differences when compared to the control. In 
conclusion, SFV and DAC combination partially but greatly ameliorated the renal 
damage induced by TAA which might be enhanced with further supplementations to 
give new hope for those with nephropathy associated with hepatitis."
2071,"Gut bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have important 
effects on immune cells and the gut. SCFAs derive from the fermentation of 
dietary fiber by gut commensal bacteria. Insufficient fiber intake thus 
compromises SCFA production and, as a consequence, the host's physiology 
(particularly immune functions). We propose that many Western diseases, 
including those associated with impaired mucosal responses such as food allergy 
and asthma, may be affected by insufficient fiber intake and reduced SCFA levels 
in the gut and blood. Insufficient fiber intake is 1 alternative, or 
contributor, on top of the ""hygiene hypothesis"" to the rise of Western lifestyle 
diseases, and the 2 ideas need to be reconciled. The mechanisms by which SCFAs 
influence immunity and gut homeostasis are varied; they include stimulation of G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as GPR43 or GPR41; inhibition of histone 
deacetylases (and hence, gene transcription changes); and induction of 
intracellular metabolic changes. SCFAs modulate at many different levels to 
alter mucosal homeostasis, including changes to gut epithelial integrity, 
increases in regulatory T-cell numbers and function, and decreased expression of 
numerous inflammatory cytokines. There is scope for preventing and/or treating 
diseases by using diets that alter SCFA levels."
2072,"Biologics have been a key component of severe asthma treatment, and there are 
currently biologics available that target IgE, IL-5, IL-4/IL-13, and TSLP. 
Randomized controlled trials have established clinical evidence, but a 
significant portion of patients with severe asthma in real-life settings would 
have been excluded from those trials. Therefore, real-world research is 
necessary, and there is a growing body of information about the long-term 
efficacy and safety of biologics. Multiple clinical phenotypes of severe asthma 
exist, and it is crucial to choose patients based on their phenotypes. Blood 
eosinophil count is an important biomarker for anti-IL-5 therapies, and FeNO and 
eosinophil counts serve as prediction markers for dupilumab. Reliable markers 
for predicting response, however, have not yet been fully established for 
omalizumab. Identification of clinical or biological prediction factors is 
crucial for the path toward clinical remission because the current treatment 
goal includes clinical remission, which is defined as a realistic goal for 
remission off treatment. Additionally, since there are now multiple biologic 
options and overlaps in eligibility for biologics in clinical practice, the 
evidence regarding the effectiveness of switching the biologics is crucial. 
Investigations into the clinical trajectory following the cessation of biologics 
are another important issue. Recent research on omalizumab, mepolizumab, 
benralizumab and dupilumab's real-world effectiveness, the prediction factor for 
the efficacy, and the impact of switching or discontinuation will be reviewed 
and discussed in this review."
2073,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the change of cortical venous flow in 
acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO-AIS) and its 
clinical value.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline whole-brain 4D-CTA/CTP and clinical data of 
LVO-AIS and a control group were collected from June 2020 to October 2021. 
Venous inflow time (VIT), venous peak time (VPT), and venous outflow time (VOT) 
were analyzed on both sides of patients and normal controls. The VIT/VPT/VOT 
were statistically described and compared between the patient group and normal 
controls, then, in patients with different collateral circulation and prognoses. 
Next, the correlation between cortical venous drainage time and collateral 
circulation grading was analyzed. Finally, logistic regression analysis was used 
to explore the relationship between the three venous times and prognosis, and 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the value 
of delayed cortical venous imaging in predicting prognosis.
RESULTS: 149 LVO-AIS and 73 normal controls were collected. VIT, VPT, and VOT 
were significantly delayed on the affected side in the patient group compared 
with the healthy side (p<0.05) and the controls (p<0.05); VIT and VPT were also 
significantly delayed on the healthy side of patients compared with the controls 
(p<0.05). Delayed VIT and VPT on the affected side in the patient group were 
more significant in patients with poor collateral circulation (p<0.05), and VIT 
and VPT on the affected side in the patient group were negatively correlated 
with arterial collateral scores. VIT and VPT were significantly delayed in both 
sides of patients in the poor prognosis group compared with the good prognosis 
group (p<0.05). logistic regression showed that patients' affected VPT, arterial 
collateral scores, and NIHSS were independent predictors of poor prognosis, with 
an accuracy of 79.6% in predicting poor prognosis. The affected VPT and NIHSS 
were independent predictors of poor prognosis for patients presenting within 24 
hours, with an accuracy of 79.6% in predicting poor prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Cortical venous flow was significantly slowed in both sides of 
LVO-AIS patients. delayed ipsilateral VPT in LVO-AIS patients can be used as an 
imaging indicator to determine poor collateral circulation and predict poor 
prognosis."
2074,"Heat-stress-induced inflammation may be ameliorated by antioxidant 
supplementation due to the purported effects of increased production of reactive 
oxygen species or oxidative stress on the gastrointestinal tract barrier. Thus, 
study objectives were to evaluate whether antioxidant supplementation [AGRADO 
Plus 2.0 (AP); EW Nutrition] affects metabolism and inflammatory biomarkers in 
heat-stressed lactating dairy cows. Thirty-two mid-lactation multiparous 
Holstein cows were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary-environmental treatments: (1) 
thermoneutral (TN) conditions and fed a control diet (TN-CON; n = 8), (2) TN and 
fed a diet with AP (10 g antioxidant; n = 8), (3) heat stress (HS) and fed a 
control diet (HS-CON; n = 8), or (4) HS and fed a diet with AP (HS-AP; n = 8). 
The trial consisted of a 23-d prefeeding phase and 2 experimental periods (P). 
Respective dietary treatments were top-dressed starting on d 1 of the prefeeding 
period and continued daily throughout the duration of the experiment. During P1 
(4 d), baseline data were collected. During P2 (7 d), HS was artificially 
induced using an electric heat blanket (Thermotex Therapy Systems Ltd.). During 
P2, the effects of treatment, day, and treatment-by-day interaction were 
assessed using PROC MIXED of SAS (SAS Institute Inc.). Heat stress (treatments 3 
and 4) increased rectal, vaginal, and skin temperatures (1.2°C, 1.1°C, and 
2.0°C, respectively) and respiration rate (33 breaths per minute) relative to TN 
cows. As expected, HS decreased dry matter intake, milk yield, and 
energy-corrected milk yield (32%, 28%, and 28% from d 4 to 7, respectively) 
relative to TN. There were no effects of AP on body temperature indices or 
production. Milk fat, protein, and lactose concentrations remained unaltered by 
HS or AP; however, milk urea nitrogen was increased during HS regardless of AP 
supplementation (26% relative to TN). Circulating glucose remained unchanged by 
HS, AP, or time. Additionally, HS decreased circulating glucagon (29% from d 3 
to 7 relative to TN), but there was no additional effect of AP. There was a 
tendency for nonesterified fatty acid concentrations to be increased in HS-AP 
cows throughout P2 (60% relative to TN-CON), whereas it remained similar in all 
other treatments. Blood urea nitrogen increased for both HS treatments from d 1 
to 3 before steadily decreasing from d 5 to 7, with the overall increase being 
most pronounced in HS-CON cows (27% relative to TN-CON). Further, supplementing 
AP decreased blood urea nitrogen in HS-AP on d 3 relative to HS-CON (15%). 
Circulating serum amyloid A tended to be and lipopolysaccharide binding protein 
was increased by HS, but neither acute-phase protein was affected by AP. 
Overall, AP supplementation appeared to marginally alter metabolism but did not 
meaningfully alter inflammation during HS."
2075,"The objective was to evaluate relationships between putative periparturient 
management and dietary factors at the pen and herd levels with metabolic- and 
inflammation-related analytes, health disorders, milk yield, and reproductive 
performance. Multiparous and primiparous cows from 72 farms in the northeastern 
United States were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Farms were visited 3 
times during the prepartum and postpartum periods: during the far-off dry, 
close-up dry, and fresh periods. Pen measurements were taken at each visit for 
the pens where cows sampled were housed, and particle size was determined for 
the total mixed ration for the pen. A survey was used to acquire data on 
herd-level management variables. Blood samples were collected from the same 11 
to 24 cows per farm during the close-up and fresh period visits. Whole blood was 
analyzed for postpartum β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations, and plasma was 
analyzed for prepartum and postpartum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and 
postpartum haptoglobin (Hp) concentrations. Health event, milk yield, and 
reproductive records were acquired through the records management software 
program used on the farm. For the pen-level analysis, primiparous and 
multiparous cows were analyzed separately. For the pen- and herd-level analysis, 
a simple linear regression was conducted on all possible explanatory variables. 
Variables were included in the full multivariable general linear model if P < 
0.20, and a manual backward stepwise elimination process ensued until all 
variables had P < 0.10. Our results indicate that pen- and herd-level management 
factors are associated with blood biomarkers, health, milk yield, and 
reproductive performance. For the prepartum period, our results support 
increasing the proportion of particles on the 19-mm sieve of the Penn State 
Particle Separator, optimizing bunk space, and not overfeeding metabolizable 
energy (ME), to decrease the prevalence of elevated postpartum NEFA, BHB, and Hp 
concentrations, decrease disorder incidence, maximize milk yield, and improve 
pregnancy risk to first service. For the fresh period, our results generally 
support optimizing bunk space, avoiding commingling, increasing feeding 
frequency, avoiding high physically effective undigested neutral detergent fiber 
(NDF) after 240 h of in vitro fermentation and high total fermentable 
carbohydrate diets while optimizing the inclusion of forage NDF, and ensuring 
adequate diet ME and metabolizable protein to reduce the prevalence of elevated 
postpartum NEFA, BHB, and Hp concentrations, minimize disorder incidence, 
maximize milk yield, and improve pregnancy risk to first service. At the herd 
level, our results generally support not vaccinating in the calving pen, 
minimizing the number of prepartum and postpartum pen moves, and avoiding long 
stays in the calving pen after parturition to reduce the prevalence of elevated 
biomarker concentrations, decrease disorder incidence, increase milk yield, and 
improve reproductive performance."
2076,"The objectives were to test the effects of dietary vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol 
(CHOL)] compared with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [calcidiol (CAL)] on vitamin D status 
and response to an endotoxin challenge. Forty-five Holstein bull calves (5 ± 2 d 
of age) were blocked into weekly cohorts, fed a basal diet that provided 0.25 
µg/kg body weight (BW) CHOL, and assigned randomly to 1 of 5 treatments: control 
[(CON) no additional vitamin D], 1.5 µg/kg BW CHOL (CHOL1.5), 3 µg/kg BW CHOL 
(CHOL3), 1.5 µg/kg BW CAL (CAL1.5), or 3 µg/kg BW CAL (CAL3). Calves were fed 
milk replacer until weaning at 56 d of age and had ad libitum access to water 
and starter grain throughout the experiment. Treatments were added daily to the 
diet of milk replacer until weaning and starter grain after weaning. Measures of 
growth, dry matter intake, and serum concentrations of vitamin D, Ca, Mg, and P 
were collected from 0 to 91 d of the experiment. At 91 d of the experiment, 
calves received an intravenous injection of 0.1 µg/kg BW lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS). Clinical and physiological responses were measured from 0 to 72 h 
relative to LPS injection. Data were analyzed with mixed models that included 
fixed effects of treatment and time, and random effect of block. Orthogonal 
contrasts evaluated the effects of (1) source (CAL vs. CHOL), (2) dose (1.5 vs. 
3.0 µg/kg BW), (3) interaction between source and dose, and (4) supplementation 
(CON vs. all other treatments) of vitamin D. From 21 to 91 d of the experiment, 
mean BW of supplemented calves was less compared with CON calves, but the effect 
was predominantly a result of the CHOL calves, which tended to weigh less than 
the CAL calves. Supplementing vitamin D increased concentrations of 
25-hydroxyvitamin D in serum compared with CON, but the increment from 
increasing the dose from 1.5 to 3.0 µg/kg BW was greater for CAL compared with 
CHOL (CON = 18.9, CHOL = 24.7 and 29.6, CAL = 35.6 and 65.7 ± 3.2 ng/mL, 
respectively). Feeding CAL also increased serum Ca and P compared with CHOL. An 
interaction between source and dose of treatment was observed for rectal 
temperature and derivatives of reactive metabolites after LPS challenge because 
calves receiving CHOL3 and CAL1.5 had lower rectal temperatures and plasma 
derivatives of reactive metabolites compared with calves receiving CHOL1.5 and 
CAL3. Supplementing vitamin D increased plasma P concentrations post-LPS 
challenge compared with CON, but plasma concentrations of Ca, Mg, fatty acids, 
glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, haptoglobin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and 
antioxidant potential did not differ among treatments post-LPS challenge. Last, 
supplementing vitamin D increased granulocytes as a percentage of blood 
leukocytes post-LPS challenge compared with CON. Supplementing CAL as a source 
of vitamin D to dairy calves was more effective at increasing serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D, Ca, and P concentrations compared with feeding CHOL. 
Supplemental source and dose of vitamin D also influenced responses to the LPS 
challenge."
2077,"Delayed umbilical cord clamping is a standard procedure for active management of 
the 3rd stage of labour. There are benefits associated with more than a 30 
second delay, but 1 minute is usually recommended. For newborns, increased iron 
reserves are important having a positive impact on further development. A 
reduction in the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular

clamping, no increased maternal blood loss was recorded, even in multiple 
pregnancies and caesarean sections."
2078,"INTRODUCTION: Pelvic packing (PP) as a simple method of ”damage control surgery” 
in severe abdominopelvic hemorrhage in gynecological and obstetric surgery after 
emergency obstetrics or gynecological hysterectomy.
OBJECTIVE: To present the case of successful PP as a simple and effective method 
in refractory pelvic bleeding after emergent peripartum hysterectomy and severe 
obstetric shock with consumptive coagulopathy.
CASE REPORT: Acording to laboratory findings and clinical condition in a 
30-year-old (G2 P2) parturient, it was most likely an obstetric embolism with 
uterine rupture as the cause of severe postparum hemorrhage with disseminated 
intravascular coagulopathy and obstetrics hemorrhagic shock development in the 
described case. Pelvic packing after postpartum hysterectomy was the definitive 
minimally invasive and simple hemostatic procedure.
CONCLUSION: The use of pelvic packing and obstetrics skills should be included 
in the protocol as a necessary, life-saving, and uncomplicated vital indication 
procedure."
2079,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The specificity of novel blood biomarkers for 
multiple sclerosis (MS)-related neurodegeneration is unclear because 
neurodegeneration also occurs during normal aging. To understand which aspects 
of neurodegeneration the serum biomarkers neurofilament light (sNfL), serum 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP), and serum contactin-1 (sCNTN1) reflect, 
we here explore their cross-sectional association with disability outcome 
measures and MRI volumes in a unique cohort of people with MS (PwMS) of the same 
age.
METHODS: sNfL, sGFAP (both singe-molecule array technology) and sCNTN1 (Luminex) 
were measured in serum samples of 288 PwMS and 125 healthy controls (HCs) of the 
Project Y cohort, a population-based cross-sectional study of PwMS born in the 
Netherlands in 1966 and age-matched HC.
RESULTS: sNfL (9.83 pg/mL [interquartile range {IQR}: 7.8-12.0]) and sGFAP (63.7 
pg/mL [IQR: 48.5-84.5]) were higher in PwMS compared with HC (sNfL: 8.8 pg/mL 
[IQR: 7.0-10.5]; sGFAP: 51.7 pg/mL [IQR: 40.1-68.3]) (p < 0.001), whereas 
contactin-1 (7,461.3 pg/mL [IQR: 5,951.8-9,488.6]) did not significantly differ 
between PwMS compared with HC (7,891.2 pg/mL [IQR: 6,120.0-10,265.8]) (p = 
0.068). sNfL and sGFAP levels were 1.2-fold higher in secondary progressive 
patients (SPMS) compared with relapsing remitting patients (p = 0.009 and p = 
0.043). Stratified by MS subtype, no relations were seen for CNTN1, whereas sNfL 
and sGFAP correlated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (ρ = 0.43 and ρ = 
0.39), Nine-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, and Symbol Digit Modalities 
Test (average ρ = 0.38) only in patients with SPMS. Parallel to these clinical 
findings, correlations were only found for sNfL and sGFAP with MRI volumes. The 
strongest correlations were observed between sNfL and thalamic volume (ρ = 
-0.52) and between sGFAP with deep gray matter volume (ρ = - 0.56) in primary 
progressive patients.
DISCUSSION: In our cohort of patients of the same age, we report consistent 
correlations of sNfL and sGFAP with a range of metrics, especially in 
progressive MS, whereas contactin-1 was not related to clinical or MRI measures. 
This demonstrates the potential of sNfL and sGFAP as complementary biomarkers of 
neurodegeneration, reflected by disability, in progressive MS."
2080,"BACKGROUND: Noninvasive respiratory support is increasingly used to support 
patients with acute respiratory failure. However, noninvasive support failure 
may worsen outcomes compared to primary support with invasive mechanical 
ventilation. Therefore, there is a need to identify patients where noninvasive 
respiratory support is failing so that treatment can be reassessed and adjusted. 
The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate three recurrent neural 
network models to predict noninvasive respiratory support failure.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study to evaluate the ability 
of deep recurrent neural network models (long short-term memory, gated recurrent 
unit, and gated recurrent unit with trainable decay) to predict failure of 
noninvasive respiratory support. Data were extracted from electronic health 
records from all adult (≥ 18 years) patient records requiring any type of oxygen 
therapy or mechanical ventilation between November 1, 2013, and September 30, 
2020 across 46 ICUs in the Southwest United States in a single healthcare 
network. Input variables for each model included serum chloride, creatinine, 
albumin, respiratory rate, heart rate, pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2), 
fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), oxygen saturation (SaO2), and two 
measurements each (point-of-care and laboratory measurement) of partial pressure 
of carbon dioxide and partial pressure of arterial oxygen from an arterial blood 
gas.
RESULTS: Time series data from electronic health records were available for 
22,075 patients. The highest accuracy and area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve were for the long short-term memory model (94.04% and 
0.9636, respectively). Accurate predictions were made 12 hours after ICU 
admission and performance remained high well in advance of noninvasive 
respiratory support failure.
CONCLUSION: Recurrent neural network models using routinely collected 
time-series data can accurately predict noninvasive respiratory support failure 
well before intubation. This lead time may provide an opportunity to intervene 
to optimize patient outcomes."
2081,"PURPOSE: To increase the number of images that can be acquired in MR 
examinations using quantitative parameters, we developed a method for obtaining 
arterial and venous images with mapping of proton density (PD), RF inhomogeneity 
(B1), longitudinal relaxation time (T1), apparent transverse relaxation time 
(T2*), and magnetic susceptibility through calculation, all with the same 
spatial resolution.
METHODS: The proposed method uses partially RF-spoiled gradient echo sequences 
to obtain 3D images of a subject with multiple scan parameters. The PD, B1, T1, 
T2*, and magnetic susceptibility maps are estimated using the quantification 
method we previously developed. Arterial images are obtained by adding images 
using optimized weights to emphasize the arteries. A morphology filter is used 
to obtain venous images from the magnetic susceptibility maps. For evaluation, 
images obtained from four out of five healthy volunteers were used to optimize 
the weights used in the arterial-image calculation, and the optimized weights 
were applied to the images from the fifth volunteer to obtain an arterial image. 
Arterial images of the five volunteers were calculated using the leave-one-out 
method, and the contrast between the arterial and background regions defined 
using the reference time-of-flight (TOF) method was evaluated using the area 
under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUC). The contrast between 
venous and background regions defined by a reference quantitative susceptibility 
mapping (QSM) method was also evaluated for the venous image.
RESULTS: The AUC to discriminate blood vessels and background using the proposed 
method was 0.905 for the arterial image and 0.920 for the venous image.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the arterial images and venous images have 
high signal intensity at the same region as determined from the reference TOF 
and QSM methods, demonstrating the possibility of acquiring vasculature images 
with quantitative parameter mapping through calculation in an integrated manner."
2082,"We herein report a rare case of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer (AHRU) 
complicated by cytomegalovirus enteritis following steroid pulse therapy for 
interstitial pneumonia. An 86-year-old woman underwent steroid pulse therapy for 
interstitial pneumonia. She was bedridden with dyspnea and suddenly developed 
melena. Colonoscopy revealed AHRU, which did not improve with conservative 
treatment, but did improve with ganciclovir administration for cytomegalovirus

2083,"Nonhuman primates are used extensively in a variety of non-clinical safety 
evaluation studies of new drugs. In those studies, intravenous infusion is a 
common treatment method, non-invasive telemetry system is usually used for 
cardiovascular safety and pharmacology evaluation, and blood samples are 
repeated collected for various analysis. Intravenous infusion, vest wearing and 
repeated bleeding can caused the stress response in cynomolgus monkeys, which 
may lead to changes on clinical pathology parameters in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Here, we aimed to test the effectiveness of the above operations on clinical 
pathology parameters in cynomolgus monkeys. 0.9% sodium chloride injection was 
administrated to 20 monkeys (10 animals/sex) via intravenous infusion on Day 1 
and Day 10. Each animal wore the vest before each dosing, the vest was removed 
at 24 hr after each dosing. Blood samples were collected pre-dosing, at 2 min, 
24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr, and 168 hr after each dosing. As compared to the pre-dosing 
(D -1) values, increased reticulocytes (RET% and RET#) and decreased 
erythrocytes (RBC, HGB, and HCT) were noted after dosing. The loss of 
erythrocytes and increases of reticulocytes were considered to the related to 
the repeated bleeding. Increased leukocytes (WBC, NEUT#, and NEUT%) and 
platelets (MPV and PDW) were noted at 2 min or 24 hr post dose. Increased AST, 
DBIL, CK, CRP, and hsTnI and decreased P were noted at 2 min to 72 hr post dose."
2084,"PURPOSE: We examined blood and protein dynamics potentially influenced by 
implant threads and hydrophilic/hydrophobic states of implant surfaces.
METHODS: A computational fluid dynamics model was created for a screw-shaped 
implant with a water contact angle of 70° (hydrophobic surface) and 0° 
(superhydrophilic surface). Movements and density of blood and fibrinogen as a 
representative wound healing protein were visualized and quantified during 
constant blood inflow.
RESULTS: Blood plasma did not occupy 40-50% of the implant interface or the 
inside of threads around hydrophobic implants, whereas such blood voids were 
nearly completely eliminated around superhydrophilic implants. Whole blood field 
vectors were disorganized and random within hydrophobic threads but formed 
vortex nodes surrounded by stable blood streams along the superhydrophilic 
implant surface. The averaged vector within threads was away from the implant 
surface for the hydrophobic implant and towards the implant surface for the 
superhydrophilic implant. Rapid and massive whole blood influx into the thread 
zone was only seen for the superhydrophilic implant, whereas a line of 
conflicting vectors formed at the entrance of the thread area of the hydrophobic 
implant to prevent blood influx. The fibrinogen density was up to 20-times 
greater at the superhydrophilic implant interface than the hydrophobic one. 
Fibrinogen density was higher at the interface than outside the threads only for 
the superhydrophilic implant.
CONCLUSIONS: Implant threads and surface hydrophilicity have profound effects on 
vector and distribution of blood and proteins. Critically, implant threads 
formed significant biological voids at the interface that were negated by 
superhydrophilicity-induced contact hemodynamics."

chemotherapy using S-1. However, second-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine and 
cis-diamminedichloroplatinum was required for the treatment of hepatic 
metastasis of the DCC 3 months following the surgery. Nine months after the 
surgery, the serum calcium and parathyroid hormone-related peptide 
concentrations were high, at 16.5 mg/dL and 28.7 pmol/L, respectively, which 
suggested the presence of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) secondary to 
the DCC. Moreover, marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 
40,400/μL, was also present. The patient died 11 months after the diagnosis of 
DCC. Because hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with a poor prognosis, 
and HHM and leukocytosis caused by DCC are very rare, we have presented the 
present case in detail and provide a review of the existing literature."
2086,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) is a 
well-recognized surgical procedure for gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor 
(GIST). In this report, we describe the clinical outcomes of LECS procedures for 
gastric GIST in our institution.
METHODS: We performed LECS procedures, including classical LECS, inverted LECS, 
closed LECS, and combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to 
neoplasia with non-exposure technique (CLEAN-NET), in 40 gastric intraluminal 
and intramural type GIST patients, whose tumors were ≤ 50 mm in diameter, 
between September 2012 and December 2020. The patient background, surgical 
outcomes, postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as the tumors' 
clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Pathological findings showed that most patients had a low or very low 
risk of tumor recurrence, while one patient had a high risk according to the 
modified-Fletcher's classification. The median length of postoperative hospital 
stay was 7 days. Only one patient had severe postoperative grade III 
complications according to the Clavien-Dindo (C-D) classification, after closed 
LECS, but was treated successfully with endoscopic hemostasis for postoperative 
hemorrhage. The remaining patients treated with LECS did not have severe 
complications. During the follow-up period (median, 31 months), all patients 
were disease-free, with no tumor recurrence or metastases.
CONCLUSION: LECS is a safe surgical procedure for gastric intraluminal and 
intramural type GIST ≤ 50 mm in diameter, with good clinical outcomes."
2087,"PURPOSE: To compare the myocardial protective efficacy of del Nido cardioplegia 
(DNC) with St. Thomas blood cardioplegia (SBC) in adult cardiac surgery.
METHODS: From January to December 2021, all the patients who underwent elective 
cardiac operation were randomly divided into two cohorts based on the type of 
cardioplegia: DNC group and SBC group. Three categories of variables were 
compared: patient demographics, clinical variables, and laboratory variables.
RESULTS: A total of 133 patients were enrolled in this study: DNC group, n = 65; 
and SBC group, n = 68. Except that the volume of cardioplegia administration 
were obvious less in the DNC group (P <0.01), no significant difference was 
found in the other postoperative clinical variables (P >0.05). No statistical 
significance was proved (P >0.05) in postoperative troponin I, creatine kinase, 
and B-type natriuretic peptide. The malondialdehyde concentration was higher in 
the SBC group, whether it is at 4 hours (P <0.05) or 24 hours (P >0.05) after 
operation. At the same two points in time, the change in superoxide dismutase 
activity was more significant in the SBC group (P <0.05).
CONCLUSION: The DNC cardioplegia was safe and effective on adult myocardium 
protection. The potential antioxidant stress effect in DNC may provide a 
direction for further improvement on the formula of cardioplegic solution."
2088,"INTRODUCTION: While reliable, quantitative in vitro testing for sensitivity to 
aeroallergens has been available for decades, such information has largely been 
ignored in clustering analyses of asthma. Our aim is to explore allergic 
polysensitization as a possible marker of asthma severity and, as such, to be 
considered as an integral marker in future asthma clustering analyses.
METHODS: We constructed a database of sensitizations to the 25 aeroallergens in 
our geographic area (zone 1, Northeastern US) using the ImmunoCAP® in vitro 
assay. We used the Scikit-Learn® machine learning library for model-based 
clustering to identify allergic polysensitization clusters. Clusters were 
compared for differences in common office-based clinical markers of asthma.
RESULTS: The database consisted of 509 patients. Unbiased machine learning 
identified ten clusters of increasing allergic polysensitization of varying 
sizes (n = 1-339) characterized by significant increases in mean serum 
immunoglobulin E (p < 0.001), peripheral blood eosinophil count (p < 0.001), and 
DLCO (p = 0.02). There was a significant decline in mean age at presentation (p 
< 0.001), FEV1/FVC (p = 0.01), and FEF25-75 (p = 0.002) with increasing allergic 
polysensitization. Finally, we identified two divergent paths for the 
poly-atopic march, one driven by perennial and the other by seasonal allergens.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study showed that allergic polysensitization, using 
readily available qualitative and quantitative in vitro sensitization data, 
largely ignored in cluster analyses to date, may add further clinical precision 
in cluster analyses of asthma. We suggest the methods used here can be applied 
and tested using larger databases and aeroallergens present in diverse 
geographic regions."
2089,"The first study aimed to evaluate the effect of drinking water disinfection 
(chlorination: NaClO 15%) and conditioning (acidification: H3PO4 diluted 1:5 in 
water) on water quality, water and feed consumption, apparent total tract 
digestibility, and its potential hazardous effects on Holstein bulls fed 
high-concentrate diets. Twenty-four animals (221 ± 20.9 kg of BW, and 
184 ± 9.9 days of age) were individually assigned to one of four treatments 
according to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement: conditioning (with or without 
acidification) and disinfection (with or without chlorination). The entire study 
lasted 210 days. Physicochemical and microbiological water quality, water and 
feed consumption, haematological and biochemical blood parameters, and apparent 
total tract digestibility were measured; data were analysed via a mixed-effects 
model. Chlorination and acidification increased (P = 0.02) free residual 
chlorine in water, and chlorination reduced (P = 0.01) total coliform and 
Clostridium perfringens counts in water. Treatment did not affect water 
consumption, total DM intake, or blood parameters. At the beginning of the 
study, NDF digestibility decreased (P = 0.04) with acidification, however, this 
was restored at the end of the study. The second study evaluated the potential 
benefit of drinking water chlorination and acidification on the performance of 
crossbred Holstein bulls fed high-concentrate diets under commercial conditions. 
Ninety-six animals (322 ± 35.0 kg of BW, and 220 ± 14.2 days of age) were 
allocated into six pens assigned to one of the two treatments: untreated 
drinking water or drinking water treated with chlorination and acidification for 
a total of 112 days. Physicochemical and microbiological water quality, water 
and concentrate consumption, eating behaviour, growth performance, and carcass 
quality were analysed via a mixed-effects model. Water conditioning and 
disinfection increased (P = 0.01) free residual chlorine concentration and 
reduced (P = 0.04) total coliform count in water. Although water consumption and 
eating behaviour were similar between treatments, water conditioning and 
disinfection increased average daily weight gain (P = 0.03), BW before slaughter 
(P = 0.01), and hot carcass weight (P = 0.01). In conclusion, drinking water 
chlorination and acidification in fattening dairy beef bulls is recommended as 
it improves growth performance without any detrimental side effects on health or 
nutrient digestibility."
2090,"Dietary proteins need to be digested first while free amino acids (AAs) and 
small peptides are readily available for absorption and rapidly appear in the 
blood. The rapid postprandial appearance of dietary AA in the systemic 
circulation may result in inefficient AA utilisation for protein synthesis of 
peripheral tissues if other nutrients implicated in AA and protein metabolism 
are not available at the same time. The objective of this experiment was to 
compare the postprandial concentrations of plasma AA and other metabolites after 
the ingestion of a diet that provided AA either as proteins or as free AA and 
small peptides. Twenty-four male growing pigs (38.8 ± 2.67 kg) fitted with a 
jugular catheter were assigned to one of three diets that provided AA either in 
protein form (INT), free AA and small peptides (HYD), or as free AA (FAA). After 
an overnight fast and initial blood sampling, a small meal was given to each pig 
followed by serial blood collection for 360 min. Postprandial concentrations of 
plasma AA, glucose, insulin, and urea were then measured from the collected 
blood. Non-linear regression was used to summarise the postprandial plasma AA 
kinetics. Fasting concentrations of urea and some AA were higher (P < 0.05) 
while postprandial plasma insulin and glucose were lower (P < 0.01) for INT than 
for HYD and FAA. The area under the curve of plasma concentration after meal 
distribution was lower for INT for most AAs (P < 0.05), resulting in a flatter 
curve compared to HYD and FAA. This was the result of the slower appearance of 
dietary AA in the plasma when proteins are fed instead of free AA and small 
peptides. The flatter curve may also result from more AAs being metabolised by 
the intestine and liver when INT was fed. The metabolism of AA of the intestine 
and liver was higher for HYD than FAA. Providing AA as proteins or as free AA 
and small peptides affected the postprandial plasma kinetics of AA, urea, 
insulin, and glucose. Whether the flat kinetics when feeding proteins has a 
positive or negative effect on AA metabolism still needs to be explored."
2091,"Immediate assessment of surgical incisions is an important component of wound 
management, and the development of relevant technologies has the potential to 
address these challenges. Smartphone-based handheld thermal imagers can collect 
infrared radiation from the skin to monitor local blood perfusion and metabolic 
levels in incisions. Here, we used this imaging technology for early assessment 
of healing progress and potential for predicting the healing status of thoracic 
surgical incisions. Thermal image acquisition and temperature extraction were 
performed on 40 patients for 7 consecutive days postoperatively, and visualised 
early warning information was observed, with temperature and temperature 
readings showing non-linear trajectory changes during the measurement period, 
and temperature readings on day 4 achieving high prediction of healing status at 
1-2 months capability with sensitivities and specificities of 91.67% and 85.71%, 
respectively, suggesting a promising clinical application of portable 
thermography for assessing incision healing dynamics and providing a scientific 
basis for later artificial intelligence-driven decision algorithms."
2092,"Clinical management of cyclophosphamide (CYP) results in numerous side effects 
including hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), which is characterized by inflammation and 
oxidative stress damage. Intravesical hyaluronic acid (HA) supplementation, a 
therapeutic method to restore barrier function of bladder, avoid the stimulation 
of metabolic toxicants on bladder and reduce inflammatory response, has shown 
good results in acute or chronic bladder diseases. However, there are unmet 
medical needs for the treatment of HC to temporarily restore bladder barrier and 
reduce inflammation. Herein, sulfhydryl functionalized HA (HA-SH) and dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) were used to prepared a hydrogel system for optimizing the 
treatment of HC. We systematically evaluated the physicochemical of hydrogels 
and their roles in a rat model of CYP-induced HC. The prepared hydrogels 
exhibited outstanding gel forming properties, injectability, and biosafety. 
Swelling and retention studies showed that hydrogels were stable and could 
prolong the residence time of HA in the bladder. Histopathology and vascular 
permeability studies indicated that the hydrogels significantly attenuated 
bladder injury caused by CYP administration. Moreover, the hydrogels also showed 
excellent anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation properties. In conclusion, these 
data suggest that intravesical instillation of HA-SH/DMSO hydrogels reduces 
CYP-induced bladder toxicity and this work provides a new strategy for the 
prevention and early treatment of HC."
2093,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a cluster of diseases that include diabetes 
and insulin resistance. A combination of these metabolic disorders damages liver 
function. We hypothesized here that HDAC1 inhibits FGF21 expression through 
histone deacetylation, thereby accentuating liver injury in rats with MetS. MetS 
rats induced by a high-fat diet were monitored weekly for blood pressure and 
body weight. The changes of hepatic injury parameters were also measured. The 
pathological changes in the liver were observed by HE staining and oil red O 
staining. We found that HDAC1 was increased in the liver of rats with MetS, 
while sh-HDAC1 reduced blood pressure, body weight and hepatic injury 
parameters. Improvement of structural pathological alterations and reduction of 
lipid deposition were observed after HDAC1 inhibition. Notably, HDAC1 inhibited 
FGF21 expression through histone deacetylation. The hepatoprotective effects of 
sh-HDAC1 on rats were reversed by adenovirus-mediated knockdown of FGF21. 
Moreover, METTL3 mediated the m6A modification of HDAC1 mRNA and increased its 
binding to IGF2BP2. Consistently, sh-METTL3 inhibited HDAC1 and increased FGF21 
expression, thereby ameliorating liver injury in MetS rats. This study 
discovered that HDAC1 is capable of managing liver injury in MetS. Targeting 
HDAC1 may be an optimal treatment for MetS-related liver injury."
2094,"Antisense DNA oligonucleotide (AS) technology is a promising approach to 
regulate gene expression and cellular processes. For example, ASs can be used to 
capture the overexpressed, oncogenic miRNAs in tumors to suppress tumor growth. 
Among many challenges faced by AS approach is the degradation of ASs by 
nucleases under physiological conditions. Elongating the AS lifespan could 
substantially enhance the functions of AS. The paper reports a simple strategy 
to increase the stability of ASs. We discover that the ASs degrade quickly if 
their ends are in unpaired, single-stranded form, but much slower if their ends 
are in paired duplex form. It is conceivable to integrate this strategy with 
other strategies (such as chemical modification of ASs backbones) to maximally 
increase the ASs stabilities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

2095,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) cycle in response to inflammatory and other 
proliferative stressors; however, they must quickly return to quiescence to 
avoid exhaustion and maintain their functional integrity. The mechanisms that 
regulate this return to quiescence are not well understood. Here we show that 
the tetraspanin CD53 is markedly upregulated in HSCs in response to a variety of 
inflammatory and proliferative stimuli, and loss of CD53 is associated with 
prolonged cycling and reduced HSC function in the context of inflammatory 
stress. Mechanistically, CD53 promotes the activity of the DREAM transcriptional 
repressor complex, which downregulates genes associated with cycling and 
division. Proximity labeling and confocal fluorescent microscopy studies show 
that CD53 interacts with DREAM-associated proteins, specifically promoting the 
interaction between Rbl2/p130 and its phosphatase, PP2A, effectively stabilizing 
p130 protein availability for DREAM binding. Together, these data identify a 
novel mechanism by which stressed HSCs resist continued cycling."
2096,"The choice to postpone treatment while awaiting genetic testing can result in 
significant delay in definitive therapies in severely pancytopenic patients. 
Conversely, inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) misdiagnosis can expose patients 
to ineffectual and expensive therapies, toxic transplant conditioning regimens, 
and inappropriate use of an affected family member as a stem cell donor. To 
predict the likelihood of patients having acquired or inherited BMF, we 
developed a two-step data-driven machine-learning model using 25 clinical and 
laboratory variables typically recorded at the initial clinical encounter. For 
model's development, patients were labeled as having acquired or inherited BMF 
depending on their genomic data. Datasets were unbiasedly clustered and an 
ensemble model was trained with cases from the largest cluster of the training 
cohort (n=359) and validated with an independent cohort (n=127). Cluster A, the 
largest group, was mostly immune or inherited aplastic anemia, whereas Cluster B 
was composed of underrepresented BMF phenotypes, and not included in the next 
step of data modeling due to small sample size. The ensemble model Cluster 
A-specific was accurate (89%) to predict BMF etiology, correctly predicting 
inherited and likely immune BMF in 79% and 92% of cases, respectively. Our model 
represents a practical guide for BMF diagnosis and highlights the importance of 
clinical and laboratory variables in the initial evaluation, particularly 
telomere length. Our tool can be potentially used by general hematologists and 
health care providers not specialized in BMF, and in under-resourced centers, to 
prioritize patients for genetic testing or for expeditious treatment."
2097,"Most aspects of physiology, including immunity, present 24-h variations called 
circadian rhythms. In this review, we examine the literature on the circadian 
regulation of CD8+ T cells, which are important to fight intracellular 
infections and tumors. CD8+ T cells express circadian clock genes, and ∼6% of 
their transcriptome presents circadian oscillations. CD8+ T cell counts present 
24-h rhythms in the blood and in secondary lymphoid organs, which depend on the 
clock in these cells as well as on hormonal rhythms. Moreover, the strength of 
the response of these cells to Ag presentation varies according to time of day, 
a rhythm dependent on the CD8+ T cell clock. The relevance of CD8+ T cell 
circadian rhythms is shown by the daily variations in the fight of intracellular 
infections. Such a circadian regulation also has implications for cancer, as 
well as the optimization of vaccination and immunotherapy."
2098,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an inherited multisystem ribosomopathy 
characterized by exocrine pancreatic deficiency, bone marrow failure, and 
predisposition to myeloid malignancies. The pathobiology of SDS results from 
impaired ribosome maturation due to deficiency of SBDS and inability to evict 
the anti-association factor eIF6 from the 60S ribosomal subunit. Clinical 
outcomes for SDS patients who develop myeloid malignancies are extremely poor 
due to high treatment-related toxicities and a high rate of refractory 
disease/relapse even after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 
Registry data indicate that outcomes are improved for SDS patients who undergo 
routine bone marrow surveillance and receive a HSCT prior to developing overt 
malignancy. However, the optimal approach to hematologic surveillance and timing 
of HSCT for SDS patients is not clearly established. Recent studies have 
elucidated distinct patterns of somatic blood mutations in SDS patients that 
either alleviate the ribosome defect by somatic rescue (heterozygous EIF6 
inactivation) or disrupt cellular checkpoints resulting in increased 
leukemogenic potential (heterozygous TP53 inactivation). Genomic analysis 
revealed that most myeloid malignancies in SDS patients have biallelic 
loss-of-function TP53 mutations. Single cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) of SDS 
bone marrow samples can detect pre-malignant biallelic TP53-mutated clones prior 
to clinical diagnosis, suggesting molecular surveillance may enhance detection 
of incipient myeloid malignancies when HSCT may be most effective. Here we 
review the clinical, genetic, and biologic features of SDS. Additionally, we 
present evidence supporting hematologic surveillance for SDS patients that 
incorporates clinical, pathologic, and molecular data to risk-stratify patients 
and prioritize transplant evaluation for SDS patients with high-risk features."
2099,"This global, phase 3 study compared lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) with 
standard of care (SOC) as second-line therapy for primary refractory or early 
relapsed (≤12 months) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Adults eligible for 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) were randomized 1:1 to liso-cel 
(100×106 CAR+ T cells) or SOC (3 cycles of platinum-based immunochemotherapy 
followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT in responders). The primary end 
point was event-free survival (EFS) by independent review. A total of 184 
patients were randomized. In this primary analysis with a median follow-up of 
17.5 months, median EFS was not reached (NR) for liso-cel versus 2.4 months for 
SOC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.356; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.243‒0.522). 
Complete response (CR) rate was 74% for liso-cel versus 43% for SOC (P < .0001) 
and median progression-free survival (PFS) was NR for liso-cel versus 6.2 months 
for SOC (HR = 0.400; 95% CI: 0.261‒0.615; P < .0001). Median overall survival 
was NR for liso-cel versus 29.9 months for SOC (HR = 0.724; 95% CI: 0.443‒1.183; 
P = .0987). When adjusted for crossover from SOC to liso-cel, median overall 
survival was NR for liso-cel and SOC (HR = 0.415; 95% CI: 0.251‒0.686). Grade 3 
cytokine release syndrome and neurological events occurred in 1% and 4% of 
patients in the liso-cel arm, respectively (no grade 4/5 events). These data 
show significant improvements in EFS, CR rate, and PFS for liso-cel over SOC and 
support liso-cel as a preferred second-line treatment compared with SOC in 
patients with primary refractory or early relapsed LBCL. (ClinicalTrials.gov; 
NCT03575351.)."
2100,"PURPOSE: Challenges to breast cancer control in low-and middle-income countries 
exist because of constrained access to care, including pathology services. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based estrogen receptor (ER) analysis is 
limited-nonexistent because of few and inadequately staffed and equipped 
pathology laboratories. We have identified Nw-hydroxy-L-Arginine (NOHA) as a 
blood-based biomarker to distinguish ER status in US patients with breast 
cancer. Here, we examine NOHA's clinical utility as an ER IHC alternative in 
Tanzanian patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following informed consent, 70 newly diagnosed, known or 
suspected patients with breast cancer were enrolled at Kilimanjaro Christian 
Medical Center; basic, deidentified clinical and sociodemographic data were 
collected. For each, a needle prick amount of blood was collected on a Noviplex 
plasma card and stored at -80°C. Plasma cards and unstained tumor pathology 
slides were shipped regularly to US laboratories for NOHA, histologic and IHC 
analysis. NOHA and IHC assay operators were blinded to each other's result and 
patient clinical status. Paired NOHA and IHC results were compared.
RESULTS: Slides from 43 participants were available for pathological analysis in 
the United States. Of those with confirmed malignancy (n = 39), 44%, 51%, 5% 
were ER-positive, ER-negative, and ER inconclusive, respectively. NOHA levels 
were available among 33 of 43 of those with pathological data and showed 
distinct threshold levels correlating 100% to tumor ER IHC and disease 
categorization where a level below 4 nM, from 4 to 8 nM, and above 8 nM 
signified ER-negative, ER-positive, and no cancer, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with findings from US patients and 
suggest NOHA's clinical utility as an accessible IHC replacement in determining 
ER status among low-and middle-income country patients with breast cancer, 
promising to extend access to cost-efficient, available hormonal agents and 
improve outcomes."
2101,"PURPOSE: Despite careful patient selection, induction chemotherapy for acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with a considerable risk for 
treatment-related mortality (5%-20%). We evaluated machine learning (ML) 
algorithms trained using factors available at the time of admission for AML 
therapy to predict death during the hospitalization.
METHODS: We included AML discharges with age > 17 years who received inpatient 
chemotherapy from State Inpatient Database from Arizona, Florida, New York, 
Maryland, Washington, and New Jersey for years 2008-2014. The primary objective 
was to predict inpatient mortality in patients undergoing chemotherapy using 
covariates present before initiation of chemotherapy. ML algorithms logistic 
regression (LR), decision tree, and random forest were compared.
RESULTS: 29,613 hospitalizations for patients with AML were included in the 
analysis each with 4,177 features. The median age was 58.9 (18-101) years, 
13,689 (53.7%) were male, and 20,203 (69%) were White. The mean time from 
admission to chemotherapy was 3 days (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.1), and 2,682 (9.1%) died 
during the hospitalization. Both LR and random forest models achieved an area 
under the curve (AUC) score of 0.78, whereas decision tree achieved an AUC of 
0.70. The baseline LR model with age yielded an AUC of 0.62. To clinically 
balance and minimize false positives, we selected a decision threshold of 0.7 
and at this threshold, 51 of our test set of 5,923 could have potentially 
averted treatment-related mortality.
CONCLUSION: Using readily accessible variables, inpatient mortality of patients 
on track for chemotherapy to treat AML can be predicted through ML algorithms. 
The model also predicted inpatient mortality when tested on different data 
representations and paves the way for future research."
2102,"Benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics are detected in the majority of fatal overdose 
cases in Norway, often in combination with other drugs of abuse, and their 
concentrations in peripheral blood might be important to elucidate the cause of 
death. In some forensic autopsies, peripheral blood is however not available. 
The aim of the present study was to compare concentrations of benzodiazepines 
and z-hypnotics in five alternative matrices to assess whether these 
concentrations are comparable to concentrations in peripheral blood. A total of 
109 forensic autopsy cases were included. Peripheral blood, cardiac blood, 
pericardial fluid, psoas muscle, lateral vastus muscle and vitreous humour from 
each case were analysed using UHPLC-MS/MS. We were able to detect clonazepam, 
7-aminoclonazepam, flunitrazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, nitrazepam, 
7-aminonitrazepam, diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, alprazolam, midazolam, 
zopiclone and zolpidem in all the analysed matrices. Concentrations measured in 
vitreous humour were generally much lower than those of peripheral blood for all 
compounds except zopiclone. 7-amino metabolite concentrations were high compared 
to the parent compounds, although less so for the muscle samples. In muscles, 
concentrations of the parent nitrobenzodiazepines were higher than in peripheral 
blood, but for the other compounds, concentrations in muscle showed good 
correspondence with peripheral blood. Both cardiac blood and pericardial fluid 
were viable alternative matrices for peripheral blood, although a larger 
variation and a tendency for higher concentrations in pericardial fluid was 
observed. This study shows that cardiac blood, psoas and lateral vastus muscle 
samples and pericardial fluid can give comparable concentrations to peripheral 
blood for benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics, while vitreous humour was less 
suitable. The concentrations in alternative matrices must, however, be 
interpreted carefully."
2103,"PURPOSE: Clinical outcomes of patients with CNS lymphomas (CNSLs) are remarkably 
heterogeneous, yet identification of patients at high risk for treatment failure 
is challenging. Furthermore, CNSL diagnosis often remains unconfirmed because of 
contraindications for invasive stereotactic biopsies. Therefore, improved 
biomarkers are needed to better stratify patients into risk groups, predict 
treatment response, and noninvasively identify CNSL.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We explored the value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for 
early outcome prediction, measurable residual disease monitoring, and 
surgery-free CNSL identification by applying ultrasensitive targeted 
next-generation sequencing to a total of 306 tumor, plasma, and CSF specimens 
from 136 patients with brain cancers, including 92 patients with CNSL.
RESULTS: Before therapy, ctDNA was detectable in 78% of plasma and 100% of CSF 
samples. Patients with positive ctDNA in pretreatment plasma had significantly 
shorter progression-free survival (PFS, P < .0001, log-rank test) and overall 
survival (OS, P = .0001, log-rank test). In multivariate analyses including 
established clinical and radiographic risk factors, pretreatment plasma ctDNA 
concentrations were independently prognostic of clinical outcomes (PFS HR, 1.4; 
95% CI, 1.0 to 1.9; P = .03; OS HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.2; P = .006). 
Moreover, measurable residual disease detection by plasma ctDNA monitoring 
during treatment identified patients with particularly poor prognosis following 
curative-intent immunochemotherapy (PFS, P = .0002; OS, P = .004, log-rank 
test). Finally, we developed a proof-of-principle machine learning approach for 
biopsy-free CNSL identification from ctDNA, showing sensitivities of 59% (CSF) 
and 25% (plasma) with high positive predictive value.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate robust and ultrasensitive detection of ctDNA at 
various disease milestones in CNSL. Our findings highlight the role of ctDNA as 
a noninvasive biomarker and its potential value for personalized risk 
stratification and treatment guidance in patients with CNSL."

2105,"Background This study was conducted to examine the impacts of coffee and green 
tea consumption on cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among people with 
severe hypertension. Methods and Results In the JACC (Japan Collaborative Cohort 
Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk), 18 609 participants (6574 men and 12 035 
women) aged 40 to 79 years at baseline who completed a lifestyle, diet, and 
medical history questionnaire, and health examinations, were followed up until 
2009. We classified the participants into four blood pressure (BP) categories: 
optimal and normal BP, high-normal BP, grade 1 hypertension, and grade 2-3 
hypertension. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the 
multivariable hazard ratios with 95% CIs of CVD mortality. During the 18.9 years 
of median follow-up, a total of 842 CVD deaths were documented. Coffee 
consumption was associated with an increased risk of CVD mortality among people 
with grade 2-3 hypertension; the multivariable hazard ratios (95% CI) of CVD 
mortality were 0.98 (0.67-1.43) for <1 cup/day, 0.74 (0.37-1.46) for 1 cup/day, 
and 2.05 (1.17-3.59) for ≥2 cups/day, compared with non-coffee drinkers. Such 
associations were not found among people with optimal and normal, high-normal 
BP, and grade 1 hypertension. Green tea consumption was not associated with an 
increased risk of CVD across any BP categories. Conclusions Heavy coffee 
consumption was associated with an increased risk of CVD mortality among people 
with severe hypertension, but not people without hypertension and with grade 1 
hypertension. In contrast, green tea consumption was not associated with an 
increased risk of CVD mortality across all categories of BP."
2106,"Patients with single large-scale mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion syndromes 
(SLSMDs) usually present with multisystemic disease, either as Pearson syndrome 
in early childhood or as Kearns-Sayre syndrome later in life. No 
disease-modifying therapies exist for SLSMDs. We have developed a method to 
enrich hematopoietic cells with exogenous mitochondria, and we treated six 
patients with SLSMDs through a compassionate use program. Autologous CD34+ 
hematopoietic cells were augmented with maternally derived healthy mitochondria, 
a technology termed mitochondrial augmentation therapy (MAT). All patients had 
substantial multisystemic disease involvement at baseline, including neurologic, 
endocrine, or renal impairment. We first assessed safety, finding that the 
procedure was well tolerated and that all study-related severe adverse events 
were either leukapheresis-related or related to the baseline disorder. After 
MAT, heteroplasmy decreased in the peripheral blood in four of the six patients. 
An increase in mtDNA content of peripheral blood cells was measured in all six 
patients 6 to 12 months after MAT as compared baseline. We noted some clinical 
improvement in aerobic function, measured in patients 2 and 3 by sit-to-stand or 
6-min walk testing, and an increase in the body weight of five of the six 
patients suffering from very low body weight before treatment. Quality-of-life 
measurements as per caregiver assessment and physical examination showed 
improvement in some parameters. Together, this work lays the ground for clinical 
trials of MAT for the treatment of patients with mtDNA disorders."
2107,"Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), which is driven by allogeneic T cells, 
has a high mortality rate and limited treatment options. Human β-defensin 2 
(hBD-2) is an endogenous epithelial cell-derived host-defense peptide. In 
addition to its antimicrobial effects, hBD-2 has immunomodulatory functions 
thought to be mediated by CCR2 and CCR6 in myeloid cells. In this study, we 
analyzed the effect of recombinant hBD-2 on aGVHD development. We found that 
intestinal β-defensin expression was inadequately induced in response to 
inflammation in two independent cohorts of patients with aGVHD and in a murine 
aGVHD model. Treatment of mice with hBD-2 reduced GVHD severity and mortality 
and modulated the intestinal microbiota composition, resulting in reduced 
neutrophil infiltration in the ileum. Furthermore, hBD-2 treatment decreased 
proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production by allogeneic T cells in 
vivo while preserving the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect. Using 
transcriptome and kinome profiling, we found that hBD-2 directly dampened 
primary murine and human allogeneic T cell proliferation, activation, and 
metabolism in a CCR2- and CCR6-independent manner by reducing proximal T cell 
receptor signaling. Furthermore, hBD-2 treatment diminished alloreactive T cell 
infiltration and the expression of genes involved in T cell receptor signaling 
in the ilea of mice with aGVHD. Together, we found that both human and murine 
aGVHD were characterized by a lack of intestinal β-defensin induction and that 
recombinant hBD-2 represents a potential therapeutic strategy to counterbalance 
endogenous hBD-2 deficiency."
2108,"BACKGROUND: Assessing the naturalistic puff topography and associated nicotine 
consumption during e-cigarette use is important as such information will not 
only unveil how these products are being consumed in real-world conditions, but 
also enable investigators and regulation bodies to conduct quantitative, 
accurate and realistic harmful exposure and nicotine abuse liability risk 
assessments based on actual e-cigarette use. Typically, the e-cigarette puff 
topography is assessed by (1) self-reporting survey, (2) frame-by-frame video 
recording, or (3) added puff recording sensors. However, none of these methods 
can accurately, conveniently, and noninvasively determine e-cigarette puff 
topography in a natural use environment. Novel technology-enabled systems that 
do not primarily rely on self-report mechanism or intrusive measurements to 
monitor e-cigarette product use behaviors are highly desired.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we aimed to explore and demonstrate the feasibility of a novel 
puff recording electronic nicotine delivery system (PR-ENDS) device in measuring 
naturalistic puff topography and estimating nicotine consumption during the ad 
libitum use of products among smokers and vapers.
METHODS: An ancillary data analysis based on a completed parent study was 
conducted. The parent study was a one-way randomized controlled, open-label puff 
topography and nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment carried out in 24 
healthy adults (12 smokers and 12 vapers). Participants were assigned with a 
randomized product use sequence of PR-ENDS within five site visits for both 
controlled and ad libitum product use sessions. Blood samples were obtained for 
plasma nicotine analysis and questionnaires were administered at various time 
points. During the ad libitum use session, puff topography was measured by CReSS 
as a benchmark (attached to PR-ENDS), as well as by PR-ENDS with the built-in 
puff recording feature.
RESULTS: No significant differences of representative puff topography parameters 
(number of puffs, total puff duration, average puff duration) between PR-ENDS 
and CReSS were observed at the populational level across different device 
powers, e-liquid nicotine strengths, and flavors. The evaluation of nicotine 
consumption estimated by PR-ENDS suggested that this device can be employed as a 
convenient monitoring tool for estimating nicotine use without measuring 
e-liquid weight loss between puffs. The linear relationship between PR-ENDS 
derived nicotine consumption and PK parameter AUCad lib substantiated the 
potential of using PR-ENDS as a pragmatic, non-invasive, and convenient means 
for estimating nicotine intake in the human body without blood collections.
CONCLUSIONS: As a proof-of-concept, it was demonstrated viable to use the novel 
PR-ENDS device in assessing naturalistic puff topography and estimating nicotine 
consumption and intake in the human body during ad libitum use. We identified 
several key factors that can influence users' puff topography, including device 
power levels, e-liquid nicotine strengths, and flavors. Together, the results 
presented in this study pave the way for further research in real-time 
measurement of naturalistic puff topography and puffing behavior in real world."
2109,"BACKGROUND Mutations in the FLT3 gene are associated with acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML). FLT3 mutations have been identified in approximately 30% of de novo AML 
patients, particularly those with typical karyotype and inferior prognosis. 
Therefore, we examined the frequencies of an internal tandem duplication (ITD) 
and missense mutations of the FLT3 gene and their associated clinical 
characteristics in patients with AML in northeast Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
The leftover bone marrow and/or peripheral blood specimens of 65 newly diagnosed 
AML patients recruited from Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, 
northeast Thailand, between January 2020 and May 2021 were included in this 
study. FLT3-ITD and FLT3- tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) were amplified using 
PCR-related techniques. RESULTS The frequencies of FLT3-ITD and TKD were found 
to be 16.9% (11/65) and 10.8% (7/65), respectively. One patient had ITD and TKD 
mutations. The white blood cell count and peripheral blast percentage of 
FLT3-ITD-positive patients were statistically significantly higher than those of 
the FLT3-wild type patients, while the peripheral blast percentage of 
FLT3-TKD-positive patients was significantly lower. No other clinical 
characteristics among FLT3-positive and FLT3-wild-type patients were observed. 
DNA sequencing identified 4 FLT3-TKD mutations. The c.2504A>T; Asp835Val and 
c.2503G>C; Asp835His mutations were predicted as pathogenic mutations while the 
2 novel mutations, c.2508C>A; Ile836= and c.2508C>G; Ile836Met were predicted as 
neutral mutations. CONCLUSIONS This study showed for the first time that 
FLT3-TKD mutation is common among northeast Thai AML patients. The data should 
prove useful for selecting efficacious targeted treatment plans for the 
patients."
2110,"BACKGROUND: Inhaled irritant air pollutants may trigger stress-related metabolic 
dysfunction associated with altered circulating adrenal-derived hormones.
OBJECTIVES: We used implantable telemetry in rats to assess real-time changes in 
circulating glucose during and after exposure to ozone and mechanistically 
linked responses to neuroendocrine stress hormones.
METHODS: First, using a cross-over design, we monitored glucose during ozone 
exposures (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 ppm) and nonexposure periods in male Wistar 
Kyoto rats implanted with glucose telemeters. A second cohort of unimplanted 
rats was exposed to ozone (0.0, 0.4 or 0.8 ppm) for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, or 4 h 
with hormones measured immediately post exposure. We assessed glucose metabolism 
in sham and adrenalectomized rats, with or without supplementation of 
adrenergic/glucocorticoid receptor agonists, and in a separate cohort, 
antagonists.
RESULTS: Ozone (0.8 ppm) was associated with significantly higher blood glucose 
and lower core body temperature beginning 90 min into exposure, with reversal of 
effects 4-6 h post exposure. Glucose monitoring during four daily 4-h ozone 
exposures revealed duration of glucose increases, adaptation, and diurnal 
variations. Ozone-induced glucose changes were preceded by higher levels of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone, and epinephrine but lower levels of 
thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormones. Higher glucose 
and glucose intolerance were inhibited in rats that were adrenalectomized or 
treated with adrenergic plus glucocorticoid receptor antagonists but exacerbated 
by agonists.
DISCUSSION: We demonstrated the temporality of neuroendocrine-stress-mediated 
biological sequalae responsible for ozone-induced glucose metabolic dysfunction 
and mechanism in a rodent model. Stress hormones assessment with real-time 
glucose monitoring may be useful in identifying interactions among irritant 
pollutants and stress-related illnesses. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11088."
2111,"Heterogeneity in progression to Alzheimer Disease poses challenges for both 
clinical prognosis and clinical trial implementation. Multiple AD-related 
subtypes have previously been identified, suggesting differences in receptivity 
to drug interventions. We identified early differences in preclinical Alzheimer 
Disease biomarkers, assessed patterns for developing preclinical Alzheimer 
Disease across the Amyloid-Tau-(Neurodegeneration) framework, and considered 
potential sources of difference by analyzing the cerebrospinal fluid proteome. 
108 participants enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer 
Disease Research Center completed four or more lumbar punctures. These 
individuals were cognitively normal at baseline. Cerebrospinal fluid measures of 
Aβ42, pTau181, and Neurofilament Light chain as well as proteomics values were 
evaluated. Imaging biomarkers, including positron emission tomography amyloid 
and tau and structural magnetic resonance imaging were repeatedly obtained when 
available. Individuals were staged according to the 
Amyloid-Tau-(Neurodegeneration) framework. Growth mixture modeling, an 
unsupervised clustering technique, identified three patterns of biomarker 
progression as measured by cerebrospinal fluid pTau181 and Aβ42. Two groups 
(Alzheimer Disease Biomarker Positive and Intermediate Alzheimer Disease 
Biomarker) had distinct progression from normal biomarker status to having 
biomarkers consistent with preclinical Alzheimer Disease. A third group 
(Alzheimer Disease Biomarker Negative) did not develop abnormal Alzheimer 
Disease biomarkers over time. Participants grouped by CSF trajectories were 
re-classified using only proteomic profiles (AUCAD Biomarker Positive vs AD 
Biomarker Negatives = 0.857, AUCAD Biomarker Positive vs. Intermediate AD 
Biomarkers = 0.525, AUCIntermediate AD Biomarkers vs. AD Biomarker 
Negative = 0.952). We highlight heterogeneity in the development of AD 
biomarkers in cognitively normal individuals. We identified some individuals who 
became amyloid positive before age 50. A second group, Intermediate AD 
Biomarkers, developed elevated CSF ptau181 significantly before becoming amyloid 
positive. A third group were AD Biomarker Negative over repeated testing. Our 
results could influence the selection of participants for specific treatments 
(e.g. amyloid-reducing vs. other agents) in clinical trials. CSF proteome 
analysis highlighted additional non-AT(N) biomarkers for potential therapies, 
including blood brain barrier-, vascular-, immune-, and 
neuroinflammatory-related targets."
2112,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD), a type of circulatory system disease related to 
the lesions of the cardiovascular system, has become one of the main diseases 
that endanger human health. Currently, the clinical diagnosis of most CVDs 
relies on a combination of imaging technology and blood biochemical test. 
However, the existing technologies for diagnosis of CVDs still have limitations 
in terms of specificity, detection range, and cost. In order to break through 
the current bottleneck, microfluidic with the advantages of low cost, simple 
instruments and easy integration, has been developed to play an important role 
in the early prevention, diagnosis and treatment of CVDs. Here, we have reviewed 
the recent various applications of microfluidic in the clinical diagnosis and 
treatment of CVDs, including microfluidic devices for detecting CVD markers, the 
cardiovascular models based on microfluidic, and the microfluidic used for CVDs 
drug screening and delivery. In addition, we have briefly looked forward to the 
prospects and challenges of microfluidics in diagnosis and treatment of CVDs."
2113,"KEY POINTS: Acute isocapnic hypoxia elicits lasting sympathoexcitation that does 
not correspond to parallel changes in vascular tone, suggesting blunted 
sympathetic transduction. Signal-averaging techniques track the magnitude and 
temporal cardiovascular responses following integrated muscle sympathetic nerve 
activity (MSNA) burst and nonburst cardiac cycles; however, this does not fully 
characterize the effects of sympathetic action potential (AP) activity on blood 
pressure control. We show that hypoxia blunts the sympathetic transduction of 
mean arterial pressure (MAP) following synchronous APs that form integrated MSNA 
bursts and that sympathetic transduction of MAP remains attenuated into early 
recovery. At rest, asynchronous APs attenuate the reduction in MAP compared to 
cardiac cycles following no AP activity, thus asynchronous sympathetic APs 
appear to contribute to the neural regulation of blood pressure. The results 
advance our understanding of sympathetic transduction of arterial pressure 
during and following exposure to acute isocapnic hypoxia in humans.
ABSTRACT: Post-hypoxia sympathoexcitation does not elicit corresponding changes 
in vascular tone, suggesting diminished sympathetic signalling. Blunted 
sympathetic transduction following acute hypoxia, however, has not been 
confirmed and the effects of hypoxia on the sympathetic transduction of mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) as a function of action potential (AP) activity is 
unknown. We hypothesized that MAP changes would be blunted during acute hypoxia 
but restored in recovery and asynchronous APs would elicit smaller MAP changes 
compared to synchronous APs. Seven healthy males (age: 24 (3) yrs; BMI: 25 (3) 
kg/m2 ) underwent 20-min isocapnic hypoxia (PET O2 : 47 (2) mmHg) and 30-min 
recovery. Multi-unit microneurography (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA) 
and continuous wavelet transform with matched mother wavelet was used to detect 
sympathetic APs during baseline, hypoxia, early (first 7-min), and late recovery 
(last 7-min). AP groups were classified as synchronous APs, asynchronous APs 
(occurring outside a MSNA burst), and no AP activity. Sympathetic transduction 
of MAP was quantified using signal-averaging, with ΔMAP tracked following AP 
group cardiac cycles. Following synchronous APs, ΔMAP was reduced in hypoxia 
(+1.8 (0.9) mmHg) and early recovery (+1.5 (0.7) mmHg) compared to baseline 
(+3.1 (2.2) mmHg). AP group-by-condition interactions show that at rest 
asynchronous APs attenuate MAP reductions compared to no AP activity (-0.4 (1.1) 
vs. -2.2 (1.2) mmHg, respectively), with no difference between AP groups in 
hypoxia, early, or late recovery. Sympathetic transduction of MAP is blunted in 
hypoxia and early recovery. At rest, asynchronous sympathetic APs contributes to 
neural regulation of MAP by attenuating nadir pressure responses. Abstract 
figure legend Seven healthy men underwent 20-min isocapnic hypoxia and 30-min 
recovery. The study tested the hypotheses that hypoxia would blunt the 
sympathetic transduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) following synchronous 
AP activity and that asynchronous APs would elicit smaller ΔMAP compared to 
synchronous APs. All sympathetic APs were detected and extracted from the 
filtered MSNA neurogram using a continuous wavelet transform with matched mother 
wavelet. AP groups were classified as synchronous (with MSNA burst), 
asynchronous (outside MSNA burst), and no AP activity. An effect of condition 
showed that following synchronous APs, ΔMAP was reduced in hypoxia and early 
recovery compared to baseline. AP group-by-condition interactions revealed that 
asynchronous APs attenuate MAP reductions compared to no AP activity under 
resting conditions. Our findings demonstrate that sympathetic transduction of 
MAP is blunted in hypoxia and remains diminished into early recovery. At rest, 
asynchronous AP activity contributes to MAP regulation by attenuating pressure 
reductions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

2115,"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) presents a high incidence in an emergency 
department (ED) and requires careful evaluation of the patient's risk level to 
ensure optimal management. The primary aim of this study was to externally 
validate and compare the performance of the Rockall score, Glasgow-Blatchford 
score (GBS), modified GBS and AIMS65 score to predict death and the need for an 
intervention among patients with UGIB. This was a cross-sectional observational 
study of patients consulting the ED of a Swiss tertiary care hospital with UGIB. 
Primary outcomes were the inhospital need for an intervention, including 
transfusion, or an endoscopic procedure or surgery or inhospital death. The 
secondary outcome was inhospital death. We included 1521 patients with UGIB, 
median age, 68 (52-81) years; 940 (62%) were men. Melena or hematemesis were the 
most common complaints in 1020 (73%) patients. Among 422 (28%) patients who 
needed an intervention or died, 76 (5%) died in the hospital. Accuracy of the 
scoring systems assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves showed that 
the Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding and modified GBSs had the highest discriminatory 
capacity to determine inhospital death or the need of an intervention [AUC, 0.77 
(95% CI, 0.75-0.80) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.76-0.81), respectively]. AIMS65 and the 
pre-endoscopic Rockall score showed a lower discrimination [AUC, 0.68 (95% CI, 
0.66-0.71) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.62-0.68), respectively]. For a GBS of 0, only one 
patient (0.8%) needed an endoscopic intervention. The modified 
Glasgow-Blatchford and Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding scores appear to be the most 
accurate scores to predict the need for intervention or inhospital death."
2116,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Palovarotene, a selective retinoic acid receptor γ 
agonist, is under investigation for the treatment of dry eye disease. This study 
aimed to determine the ocular and systemic safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics of palovarotene ophthalmic solution (PVO-OS) in healthy adults.
METHODS: This was a randomised, vehicle-controlled phase I study (NCT04762355; 
retrospectively registered). Participants received either PVO-OS (at 0.025, 0.05 
or 0.10 mg/mL) or a vehicle (placebo-to-match PVO-OS) once-daily or twice-daily 
for seven consecutive days. Safety was assessed by ocular and systemic 
assessments. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments were collected before 
and after dose administration.
RESULTS: Thirty-six participants were randomised to PVO-OS and 12 to the 
vehicle. Overall, 89 treatment-emergent ocular adverse events (TEOAEs) were 
reported by 22 participants (61.1%) receiving PVO-OS and ten TEOAEs were 
reported by five participants (41.7%) receiving the vehicle. Erythema, 
irritation and skin dryness of the eyelid were the most common TEOAEs in 
participants receiving PVO-OS. The incidence of TEOAEs and eyelid-related 
findings in the PVO-OS groups increased with ascending dose and frequency 
compared with participants treated with the vehicle. All TEOAEs were mild 
(96.6%) or moderate (3.4%) and resolved without sequelae. Plasma palovarotene 
concentrations were generally measurable for up to 3-4 h for 0.025 mg/mL and 
0.05 mg/mL and up to 12 h for 0.10 mg/mL dose regimens, independent of the 
frequency of administration.
CONCLUSIONS: PVO-OS was generally well tolerated at doses up to and including 
0.10 mg/mL twice daily. Similar pharmacokinetic profiles were observed for the 
once-daily and twice-daily regimens following multiple ascending doses of 
PVO-OS."
2117,"This study was aimed at investigating the effects of diet iron levels on the 
blood iron status, tissue iron content, mRNA levels, and the activity of 
iron-containing enzymes in different tissues of squabs. A total of 120 pairs of 
healthy Silver Feather King parental pigeons with similar average body weight 
and egg production were randomly divided into 5 groups with 8 replicates and 3 
pairs of pigeons per replicate. The five groups of breeding pigeons were fed an 
iron-unsupplemented basal diet and basal diet supplemented with 75, 150, 300, 
and 600 mg iron/kg, respectively. The diets were fed in the form of granular 
feed based on corn, soybean meal, wheat, and sorghum. A broken line model was 
used for regression analysis. The results showed that plasma iron (PI), serum 
ferritin, iron contents in crop milk and liver, liver catalase (CAT) activity, 
and heart succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity were affected by iron levels 
(P < 0.05). And PI, serum ferritin, iron content in crop milk, and heart SDH 
activity increased quadratically (P < 0.05), but the iron content and CAT 
activity in the liver decreased quadratically (P < 0.005) as dietary iron level 
increased. According to the broken-line model of serum ferritin fitting 
(P < 0.002), the optimal dietary iron level of breeding pigeons was estimated to 
be 193 mg/kg. In conclusion, serum ferritin is a sensitive index to evaluate the 
iron requirement of the breeding pigeon with two squabs, and the recommended 
iron supplemental level is 193 mg/kg."
2118,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are main public health concerns highly prevalent 
in industrialized societies where human health is threatened by a series of 
environmental pollutants, particularly heavy metal contaminants. We aimed to 
find out if blood heavy metals are associated with the 10-year risk of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in a nationally representative 
sample of US adults. We analyzed the cross-sectional data on blood heavy metals 
of 3268 non-Hispanic white participants aged 40-79 years from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018. We introduced a risk 
estimation algorithm, namely the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE), to assess 
the risk for ASCVD over a 10-year period. The 10-year risk for ASCVD was 
categorized as either reduced risk (< 7.5% risk) or elevated risk (≥ 7.5% risk). 
Blood lead, cadmium, and mercury were distributed into four quartiles. We used 
weighted multivariate logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) regression to detect the association of blood heavy metal exposure with 
10-year ASCVD risk. Following the adjustment of covariates, the adjusted odds 
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for elevated 10-year ASCVD risk 
for participants from the highest quartiles were 4.50 (2.88-7.02), 2.59 
(1.68-4.00), and 1.06 (0.66-1.71) for blood cadmium, lead, and mercury compared 
to the lowest quartiles, respectively. The RCS plot demonstrated that blood 
cadmium was linearly and positively associated with 10-year ASCVD risk (P for 
nonlinearity = 0.112). According to our findings, non-Hispanic whites aged 
40-79 years had a greater 10-year ASCVD risk as their blood lead and cadmium 
levels increased. Consequently, when establishing approaches for ASCVD 
prevention, blood heavy metals should be considered."
2119,"A 61-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for intraductal papillary

2120,"OBJECTIVES: To observe the efficacy and side effects of liraglutide in the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with severe obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA).
METHODS: The study conducted in an outpatient setting was a two-center, 
prospective randomized controlled study. T2DM patients with severe OSA were 
randomized to the control group (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and 
drug treatment without liraglutide) or the liraglutide group (CPAP and drug 
treatment including liraglutide). Demographic and clinical characteristics, 
sleep-disordered breathing indices, cardiac function indices, and side effects 
were evaluated and compared between the two groups before and after 3 months.
RESULTS: Of 90 patients, 45 were randomized to the intervention arm (with 
liraglutide) and 45 to the control arm (without liraglutide). One patient in the 
liraglutide group dropped out of the study on day 8 after enrollment due to 
obvious gastrointestinal symptoms. No significant differences were found between 
the two groups in baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, cardiac 
function indicators, or sleep disorder respiratory indices (P > 0.05). After 
3 months, the body mass index (BMI), apnea hypopnea index (AHI), and mean 
systolic blood pressure in the liraglutide treatment group were significantly 
lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The minimum oxygen saturation 
was significantly higher in the liraglutide group compared with that in the 
control group after 3 months of follow-up (P < 0.05). No difference was found 
between the two groups in the summary of side effects (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide combined with CPAP can effectively reduce BMI, lower 
mean systolic blood pressure, and improve AHI scores and hypoxia in T2DM 
patients with severe OSA. Liraglutide did not increase side effects."

2122,"This study is aimed at assessing the impact of simultaneous administration of 
GnRH and prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) 7 days prior to Ovsynch in Hariana cow. Two 
hundred cyclic cows (> 4 months postpartum) were assigned to control (n = 54) 
and pre-OV (n = 146). As per Ovsynch protocol, buserelin acetate (10 μg), 
cloprostenol (500 μg), and buserelin acetate (10 μg) were injected i.m. on days 
0, 7, and 9, respectively, in cows irrespective of treatment. But in pre-OV 
cows, buserelin acetate (10 μg) and cloprostenol (500 μg) were also injected 
i.m. simultaneously 7 days prior to initiate the Ovsynch protocol. Artificial 
insemination was performed between 18 and 24 h after the 2nd GnRH of Ovsynch in 
both treatments. Ultrasonography and blood sampling for hormonal analysis were 
done on each day of treatment, on day of AI, and 12 days post-AI. Pre-OV 
treatment resulted to increased (45.20% vs 29.62%; P < 0.05) pregnancy outcomes 
and higher (P < 0.01) ovulation rate to first GnRH of Ovsynch than control. Cows 
showing complete luteolysis in response to PGF2α of Ovsynch were also higher 
(P < 0.05) in pre-OV than control. Greater (P < 0.05) synchronization rate was 
recorded in pre-OV than control (86.76% and 68.75%). The circulating 
concentrations of estradiol on day of AI and progesterone on day 12 post-AI were 
higher (P < 0.01) in cows diagnosed pregnant than non-pregnant in both control 
and pre-OV treatment. In conclusion, simultaneous administration of GnRH and 
PGF2α 7 days before Ovsynch improved the synchronization rate and luteal profile 
in terms of CL area and hence resulted in higher conception rate in Hariana zebu

medication in pigs. BZD-containing drugs may induce cytochrome P450 isozymes 
(CYPs), particularly those members of the CYP1A subfamily. The current research 
evaluated the plasma and liver availability and metabolism of FBZ and its 
metabolites, oxfendazole (OFZ) and fenbendazole sulphone (FBZSO2), after the 
administration of the parent drug in feed, and characterized the effect of the 
sustained administration of the anthelmintic on the catalytic activities of 
xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in pig liver. Five female Landrace piglets 
remained untreated (controls), and other six were treated with a pre-mix of FBZ, 
combined with feed, for 9 consecutive days as usually is recommended. Blood 
samples were collected from each treated animal up to day 9 and analyzed by 
HPLC; all animals were slaughtered for preparation of liver microsomes. Plasma 
concentration ratios OFZ/FBZ and FBZSO2/OFZ increased significantly (p < 0.05) 
from the beginning to the end of drug exposure, which may indicate an enhanced 
conversion of FBZ into its metabolites. FBZ represented 45.8 ± 3.4% of the total 
anthelmintic molecules in liver tissue. Increased CYP1A-dependent 7-ethoxy 
(24.5-fold, p = 0.0032) and 7-methoxyresorufin (17.2-fold, p = 0.0006) 
O-dealkylase activities was observed in liver microsomes from FBZ-treated 
animals. In addition, a 64% increase (p = 0.042) in the rate of FBZ S-oxidation 
was observed in pigs treated with the anthelmintic drug compared to that 
measured in untreated animals. Thus, the continuous FBZ administration may 
accelerate its own in vivo hepatic metabolism through the CYP1A pathway."
2124,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the oncologic safety and surgical outcomes of endoscopic 
thyroidectomy (ET) performed via different surgical approaches for papillary 
thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of PTC patients who underwent ET 
between May 2015 and May 2021, at the Department of General Surgery, Beijing 
Friendship Hospital (affiliated with Capital Medical University). The patients 
were divided into three groups: the ET via breast approach (ETBA) group, the 
transoral ET vestibular approach (TOETVA) group, and the ET via transaxillary 
approach (ETTA) group. We evaluated the safety and surgical outcomes of each of 
these ET approaches.
RESULTS: A total of 490 patients were included in the analysis: 416 in the ETBA 
group, 57 in the TOETVA group, and 17 in the ETTA group. There were no 
significant differences among the groups in clinicopathologic characteristics or 
surgical procedures, or in the incidences of complications such as hematoma, 
subcutaneous emphysema, infection, and chyle. The incidences of transient and 
permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury were 1.4% and 4.3%, 
respectively, with no significant difference among the three groups. The 
incidences of transient and permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism were 
13.7% and 1.4%, respectively. The incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism in 
the TOETVA group was 1.7%, which was significantly lower than that in the ETBA 
group. The postoperative 1-, 3- and 5-year rates of disease-free survival were 
99.5%, 96.8%, and 95.9%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses 
showed that ET was not a significant risk factor for recurrence or metastasis 
(p = 0.83 and p = 0.49, respectively), regardless of the surgical approach.
CONCLUSIONS: TOETVA may be associated with a lower incidence of temporary 
hypoparathyroidism than ETBA. Apart from this difference, ETBA, ETTA and TOETVA 
showed comparable oncologic safety and surgical outcomes."
