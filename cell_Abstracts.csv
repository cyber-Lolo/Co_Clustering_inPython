(strength, kinetics) differ across contexts, and are under dynamic regulation. 
2. Rather than as a simple ON/OFF cellular switch, the PI3K signaling pathway 
should be viewed as a highly sensitive dial, whose accurate tuning is a 
prerequisite for a given cell’s optimal function. 3. Information transmission 
within the PI3K signaling pathway is not linear but features complex network 
properties whose understanding is necessary for successful pharmacological 
targeting in cancer. 4. Despite the relatively small number of known

leukemic cells often hijack its functionality for enhanced survival, 
uncontrolled proliferation and reprogramming of their microenvironment."
1,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to discuss current literature on novel therapies for 
antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in kidney transplantation with a focus on 
chronic AMR.
RECENT FINDINGS: IL-6/IL-6 receptor blockers appear promising in the treatment 
of chronic AMR. Blocking this pathway was shown to reduce human leucocyte 
antigen-antibodies, improve histologic inflammation and increase T-regulatory 
cells. Based on experience in desensitization, IgG degrading endopeptidase, 
imlifidase, could be effective in AMR. There have been case reports describing 
the successful use of plasma cell/natural killer-cell-directed anti-CD38 
antibody in the treatment of AMR. Off-target effects have been noted and 
strategies to mitigate these will be needed when using these agents. Complement 
inhibitors could be an effective add-on strategy to antibody-depleting therapies 
but their role in AMR needs to be better defined. Combining proteasome 
inhibitors and costimulation blockers has shown encouraging results in the 
prevention of AMR in animal models and is now being investigated in humans. 
Other novel strategies such as Fc neonatal receptor blockers which inhibit the 
recycling of pathogenic IgG and bispecific antibodies against B-cell maturation 
antigen/CD3+ T cells warrant further investigation.
SUMMARY: There are now a number of emerging therapies with varied targets and 
mechanism(s) of action that hold promise in the management of AMR and improving 
allograft survival."
2,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite the availability of potent antivirals, consensus 
guidelines and decades of research, cytomegalovirus (CMV) continues to be 
associated with negative outcomes after solid organ transplant. This has been 
attributed to postprophylaxis CMV infection and a lack of development of 
CMV-specific cell mediated immunity (CMI). A shift from a focus on antiviral 
prevention to a focus on CMI target attainment is needed to improve CMV outcomes 
after transplantation.
RECENT FINDINGS: There are many obstacles to CMI target attainment. Antiviral 
stewardship programs (AVS) have been employed to improve patient outcomes 
through appropriate antiviral use, reduction of unnecessary exposure and 
resistance mitigation. By focusing on the patient's unique substrate of 
conglomerate risk factors and addressing these factors specifically with 
evidenced based methodology, the AVS can address these obstacles, increasing 
rates of CMI and subsequently reducing risk of future CMV infection and negative 
outcomes.
SUMMARY: With its multidisciplinary composition utilizing decades of experience 
from antimicrobial stewardship principles and practices, the AVS is uniquely 
poised to facilitate the shift from a focus on prevention to CMI target 
attainment and be the supporting pillar for the frontline transplant clinician 
caring for transplant patients with CMV."
3,"The pearl oyster Pinctada imbricata radiata (Leach, 1814), from the Pacific 
Ocean, was one of the first species to reach via Suez the Mediterranean, 
colonizing the eastern basin and recently spreading to the western. The species 
showed to be able to adapt to a wide range of climatic, hydrological, and 
ecological conditions. Since 2000 it reached the Strait of Messina, where is now 
infesting the transitional waters of the oriented natural reserve ""Laguna di 
Capo Peloro."" Due to such resistance and adaptation ability, various assays were 
performed. Haemocyte morpho-functional aspects were evaluated in haemolymph 
samples fixed with 1% and 2% glutaraldehyde for optical and electron microscopy 
(TEM). The following assays were carried out: cell characterization using 
several dyes, detection of intra- and extracellular lipids, the capability of 
phagocytosis using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to produce superoxide 
anion (O2- ). Detection of several enzymes, such as acid and alkaline 
phosphatase, arylsulfatase, chloro-acetylesterase and β-glucuronidase was also 
assessed. Cell count was demonstrated to be abundant with a mean of 
8.263 × 106 mm2  ± 0.935 × 106 (SD). Two main cell populations were noticed: 
granulocytes and hyalocytes, both competent for phagocytosis, to produce O2- , 
and characterized by lipids. Based on the granule analysis, enzymatic activity 
was also demonstrated. The observations under TEM confirmed all the results 
obtained. This study supports the hypothesis that P. imbricata radiata can be 
usefully employed as a model organism in environmental biomonitoring. Moreover, 
since the species represent potential threats to native species and ecosystems, 
further insights into its biological adaptations in invaded ecosystems are 
recommended."
4,"Genetic alterations drive tumor onset and progression. However, the cross‑talk 
between tumor cells and the benign components of the surrounding stroma can also 
promote the initiation, progression and metastasis of solid tumors. These 
cellular and non‑cellular stromal components form the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), which co‑evolves with tumor cells. Their dynamic and mutualistic 
interactions are currently considered to be among the distinctive hallmarks of 
cancer. Biochemical and physical cues from the TME serve an essential role in 
regulating tumor onset and progression. They are also associated with resistance 
to treatment and poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Therefore, a deep 
understanding of the TME is vital for developing potent anticancer therapeutics 
and improving patient outcomes. The present review aims to review the biology of 
both cellular and non‑cellular constituents of the TME and novel findings 
regarding their contribution to core as well as emerging cancer hallmarks. The 
present review also describes key TME markers that are either targeted in 
interventional clinical trials or serve as promising potential anticancer 
therapies. Understanding TME components and their intercellular interactions is 
key toward identifying the mechanisms of progression and treatment resistance. 
Such understanding is of utmost significance for personalized and effective 
cancer therapy strategies."
5,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) remains one of the best molecules 
for developing targeted therapy for multiple human malignancies, including head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Small molecule inhibitors or 
antibodies targeting EGFR have been extensively developed in recent decades. 
Immunotoxin (IT)‑based therapy, which combines cell surface binding ligands or 
antibodies with a peptide toxin, represents another cancer treatment option. A 
total of 3 diphtheria toxin (DT)‑based fusion toxins that target human 
EGFR‑monovalent EGFR IT (mono‑EGF‑IT), bivalent EGFR IT (bi‑EGF‑IT), and a 
bispecific IT targeting both EGFR and interleukin‑2 receptor (bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT) 
were recently generated by the authors. Improved efficacy and reduced toxicity 
of bi‑EGF‑IT compared with mono‑EGF‑IT in immunocompromised HNSCC mouse models 
was reported. In the present study, bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT were generated using a unique 
DT‑resistant yeast expression system and evaluated the in vitro and in vivo 
efficacy and toxicity of the 3 EGF‑ITs in immunocompetent mice. The results 
demonstrated that while the three EGF‑ITs had different efficacies in vitro and 
in vivo against HNSCC, bi‑EGF‑IT and bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT had significantly improved 
in vivo efficacy and remarkably less off‑target toxicity compared with 
mono‑EGF‑IT. In addition, bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT was superior to bi‑EGF‑IT in reducing 
tumor size and prolonging survival in the metastatic model. These data suggested 
that targeting either the tumor immune microenvironment or enhancing the binding 
affinity could improve the efficacy of IT‑based therapy. Bi‑EGF‑IT and 
bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT represent improved candidates for IT‑based therapy for future 
clinical development."
6,"Cancer liquid biopsy (CLB) aims for the detection of circulating tumor cells, 
cell‑free DNA or RNA, and specifically expressed proteins, lipids and 
metabolites present in the bio‑fluids of patients. Rapid advances in 
technologies for sampling such bio‑specimens and for genomic sequencing have 
fostered the development of authority‑approved CLB tests in clinical practice 
for the early screening and diagnosis of malignancies. However, perhaps some 
solid tumors could have been reliably detected using CLB, while they were still 
too small to be found in patients using currently available imaging 
technologies. This could impose troublesome clinical scenarios. In this 
communication article, the author would like to propose a potential solution 
that eventually may be used to combat such unwanted embarrassing clinical issues 
by using one episode of targeted radiotheragnostics, namely OncoCiDia."
7,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer‑associated death 
in the world. Chemotherapy remains the primary treatment method for HCC. Despite 
advances in chemotherapy and modalities, recurrence and resistance limit 
therapeutic success. Salidroside (Sal), a bioactive component extracted from the 
rhizome of Rhodiola rosea L, exhibits a spectrum of biological activities 
including antitumor effects. In the present study, it was demonstrated that Sal 
could induce apoptosis and autophagy of 97H cells by using CCK‑8 assay, 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Hoechst33342 staining, MDC staining, 
western blotting. Pretreatment with Sal enhanced apoptosis and autophagy via 
upregulation of expression levels of Bax, Caspase‑3, Caspase‑9, light chain 
(LC)3‑II and Beclin‑1 proteins and downregulation of expression levels of Bcl‑2, 
LC3‑I and p62 protein in 97H cells. Furthermore, Sal was demonstrated to inhibit 
activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and, when combined with 
autophagy inhibitor chloroquine diphosphate (CQ), increased phosphorylation of 
PI3K, Akt and mTOR proteins. The combined treatment with Sal and CQ not only 
decreased Sal‑induced autophagy, but also accelerated Sal‑induced apoptosis. 
Therefore, Sal‑induced autophagy might serve a role as a defense mechanism in 
human liver cancer cells and its inhibition may be a promising strategy for the 
adjuvant chemotherapy of liver cancer."
8,"The mechanism underlying bladder cancer metastasis is associated with tumor 
angiogenesis. The present study aimed to evaluate the predictive role and value 
of an angiogenesis‑associated long non‑coding (lnc)RNA signature in patients 
with bladder cancer and the role of long intergenic non‑coding RNA (LINC)02321 
in the progression of this malignancy. Angiogenesis‑related lncRNAs were 
screened using Pearson correlation analysis and the signaturewas constructed 
using Cox regression analysis and evaluated using the receiver operating 
characteristic curve. LINC02321, which expressed the largest difference in 
bladder cancer, was screened using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The 
role of LINC02321 in the malignant progression of bladder cancer was evaluated 
using Transwell, wound healing and Cell Counting Kit 8 assays. A total of six 
angiogenesis‑associated lncRNAs (USP30‑AS1, LINC02321, PSMB8‑AS1, KRT7‑AS, 
LINC01767 and OCIAD1‑AS1) were identified as candidates for the prognostic 
signature using Cox regression analysis. The overall survival of patients in the 
low‑risk group was significantly longer compared with that in the high‑risk 
group, with the highest area under the curve value being 0.807. A nomogram was 
constructed based on the traditional clinical indicators (age, sex, grade, 
American Joint Committee on Cancer stage) and risk score of patients. Compared 
with the traditional clinical indicators, the risk score demonstrated better 
clinical prediction capacity for predicting the prognosis of patients with 
bladder cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas prediction and RT‑qPCR experimental 
results demonstrated that only LINC02321 was highly expressed in bladder cancer 
tissue and promoted the proliferation, invasion, migration and cisplatin 
resistance of the malignancy. Gene set enrichment, Pearson's correlation 
analysis and experimental results demonstrated that the VEGFA signalling pathway 
may be involved in the LINC02321‑regulated progression of bladder cancer. In 
conclusion, the six angiogenesis‑associated lncRNA signatures reported in the 
present study may be used to predict the prognosis of patients with bladder 
cancer, and LINC02321 promoted malignant progression of bladder cancer via the 
VEGFA signalling pathway."
9,"CXCR4 is a seven‑transmembrane‑spanning Gi‑coupled receptor for the SDF‑1 
chemokine and plays a critical role in cardiovascular development and 
post‑injury repair. However, the specific role of CXCR4 in cardiomyocytes is 
incompletely understood. It was hypothesized that CXCR4 activation in 
cardiomyocytes antagonizes β‑adrenoceptor/Gs signaling‑induced cardiac 
dysfunction. Cardiomyocyte‑specific CXCR4 knockout (CXCR4‑CMKO) mice were 
generated by crossing CXCR4fl/fl and MHC‑Cre+/‑ mice. Their cardiac structure 
and function in the basal state are equivalent to that of the control MHC‑Cre+/‑ 
littermates until at least 4 months old. However, following continuous 
subcutaneous administration of isoproterenol (Iso) via an osmotic mini‑pump, the 
ventricular myocardial contractility, dilation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and 
interstitial fibrosis are worse in CXCR4‑CMKO mice than in MHC‑Cre+/‑ 
littermates. In the cultured H9C2 cardiomyocytes, SDF‑1 treatment markedly 
attenuated Iso‑induced apoptosis and reduction in phospho‑Akt, and this 
protective effect was lost by knockdown of CXCR4 or by co‑treatment with Gi 
inhibitors. In conclusion, CXCR4 promotes cardiomyocyte survival and heart 
function during β‑adrenergic stress."
10,"The literature on the blood cells of Zovawk pigs is scanty; thus, this study was 
designed to elaborate the light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) characterization of blood cells of Zovawk pigs by LM and SEM. Twelve 
different blood samples were aseptically obtained from adult healthy Zovawk 
pigs, irrespective of sex. To determine the cytomorphological and cytochemical 
structures of the many produced constituents of blood, blood smears were stained 
with various stains. The blood samples were treated with various substrates for 
cytoenzymatic research, and the alterations were noted. A 1000× magnification 
Olympus Trinocular Research microscope was used to examine the smears. The blood 
samples were prepared for electron microscopy according to the standard 
procedure. The prepared samples were delivered to the Sophisticated Analytical 
Instrumentation Facility (SAIF), All India Institute of Medical Sciences 
(AIIMS), New Delhi, for SEM imaging. On LM, pig erythrocytes were spherical and 
nonnucleated. The cytoplasm of the neutrophils was spherical and included 
cytoplasmic granules. The eosinophils had prominent cytoplasmic granules and 
were round. Basophils were infrequently present and had cytoplasmic granules 
that were clear blue. The sizes of small, medium and large lymphocytes were 
noted. The monocytes were oval or circular. The platelets ranged in form from 
asymmetric to round. The blood samples were stained for cytochemical analyses 
using acid ferrocyanide stain for iron, Sudan black blue stain for lipids, 
toluidine blue stain for mucopolysaccharides, and periodic acid Schiff's stain 
for glycogen. The cytoenzymatic characteristics were evaluated and compared with 
substrates treated with acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, 
arylsulfatase, cytochrome oxidase, beta-glucuronidase, and succinate 
dehydrogenase. Erythrocytes appeared as biconcave disks under SEM. Two forms of 
leukocytes were observed, having a rough and pointed cell surface like a flower. 
It can be concluded that the LM and SEM morphology of blood cells of Zovawk pigs 
resembled other domestic animals, however, few differences were observed among 
the discussed animals."
11,"BACKGROUND: When aortic cells are under stress, such as increased hemodynamic 
pressure, they adapt to the environment by modifying their functions, allowing 
the aorta to maintain its strength. To understand the regulation of this 
adaptive response, we examined transcriptomic and epigenomic programs in aortic 
smooth muscle cells (SMCs) during the adaptive response to AngII (angiotensin 
II) infusion and determined its importance in protecting against aortic aneurysm 
and dissection (AAD).
METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell sequencing 
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) analyses in a mouse 
model of sporadic AAD induced by AngII infusion. We also examined the direct 
effects of YAP (yes-associated protein) on the SMC adaptive response in vitro. 
The role of YAP in AAD development was further evaluated in AngII-infused mice 
with SMC-specific Yap deletion.
RESULTS: In wild-type mice, AngII infusion increased medial thickness in the 
thoracic aorta. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an adaptive 
response in thoracic SMCs characterized by upregulated genes with roles in wound 
healing, elastin and collagen production, proliferation, migration, cytoskeleton 
organization, cell-matrix focal adhesion, and AKT and TGF-β signaling. 
ScATAC-seq analysis showed increased chromatin accessibility at regulatory 
regions of adaptive genes and revealed the mechanical sensor YAP/transcriptional 
enhanced associate domains as a top candidate transcription complex driving the 
expression of these genes (eg, Lox, Col5a2, Tgfb2). In cultured human aortic 
SMCs, cyclic stretch activated YAP, which directly bound to adaptive gene 
regulatory regions (eg, Lox) and increased their transcript abundance. 
SMC-specific Yap deletion in mice compromised this adaptive response in SMCs, 
leading to an increased AAD incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic stress triggers the systemic epigenetic induction of an 
adaptive response (eg, wound healing, proliferation, matrix organization) in 
thoracic aortic SMCs that depends on functional biomechanical signal 
transduction (eg, YAP signaling). Our study highlights the importance of the 
adaptive response in maintaining aortic homeostasis and preventing AAD in mice."
12,"Ischemic heart disease including myocardial infarction is still the leading 
cause of death worldwide. Although the survival early after myocardial 
infarction has been significantly improved by the introduction of percutaneous 
coronary intervention, long-term morbidity and mortality remain high. The 
elevated long-term mortality is mainly driven by cardiac remodeling processes 
triggering ischemic heart failure and electric instability. Despite the new 
developments in pharmaco-therapy of heart failure, we still lack targeted 
therapies for cardiac remodeling and fibrosis. Single-cell and genomic 
technologies allow us to map the human heart at unprecedented resolution and 
allow to gain insights into cellular and molecular heterogeneity. However, these 
technologies rely on digested tissue and isolated cells or nuclei and thus lack 
spatial information. Spatial information is critical to understand tissue 
homeostasis and disease and can be utilized to identify disease-driving cell 
populations and mechanisms including cellular cross-talk. Here, we discuss 
recent advances in single-cell and spatial genomic technologies that give 
insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms of cardiac remodeling after 
injury and can be utilized to identify novel therapeutic targets and pave the 
way toward new therapies in heart failure."
13,"OBJECTIVES: Stem cells of the apical papilla (SCAPs) provide promising 
candidates for dental pulp regeneration. Despite great advances in the 
transcriptional controls of the SCAPs fate, little is known about the regulation 
of SCAP differentiation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Short hairpin RNAs and full-length RNA were used to 
deplete or overexpress lysine demethylase 4D (KDM4D) gene expression. Western 
blotting, real-time RT-PCR, alizarin red staining, and scratch migration assays 
were used to study the role of KDM4D and the ribosomal protein encoded by RPS5 
in SCAPs. RNA microarray, chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and 
co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed to explore the underlying 
molecular mechanisms.
RESULTS: KDM4D enhanced the osteo/dentinogenic differentiation, migration, and 
chemotaxis of SCAPs. The microarray results revealed that 88 mRNAs (14 
upregulated and 74 downregulated) were differentially expressed in 
KDM4D-overexpressed SCAPs. ChIP results showed knock-down of KDM4D increased the 
level of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 in CNR1 promoter region. There were 37 possible 
binding partners of KDM4D. KDM4D was found to combine with RPS5, which also 
promoted the osteo/dentinogenic differentiation, migration, and chemotaxis of 
SCAPs.
CONCLUSIONS: KDM4D promoted the osteo/dentinogenic differentiation and migration 
potential of SCAPs in combination with RPS5, which provides a therapeutic clue 
for improving SCAPs-based dental tissue regeneration."
14,"PROBLEM: Interleukin 35 (IL-35) is involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis 
by suppressing immunoreaction and promoting endometrial cell proliferation. It 
may also be an essential cytokine in forming the immunosuppressive functions of 
regulatory B lymphocytes (Bregs). The involvement of Bregs in the pathogenesis 
of endometriosis has not been previously investigated. In this study, we 
determined the frequencies of different Breg subpopulations, namely, B10, 
immature B-cells, and plasmablasts, and their abilities to produce IL-35 in 
women with endometriosis compared to healthy women.
METHODS: The frequencies of different subpopulations of Bregs producing IL-35 
were measured in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis (total pool), 
women with deep infiltration endometriosis (DIE), women with ovarian 
endometriosis, and healthy women as a control by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We observed a decrease in the percentage of B10 cells and plasmablasts 
in women with endometriosis and an increase in the percentage of these Breg 
populations producing IL-35 in the same experimental group. Interestingly, we 
also revealed that women with DIE had increased percentages of B10 cells and 
plasmablasts producing IL-35.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings are the first to reveal the frequencies 
of different subpopulations of Bregs producing IL-35 in women with 
endometriosis. The results suggest that IL-35 expression in B lymphocytes could 
be used as a peripheral marker of endometriosis; however, further studies are 
needed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
15,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid membrane-bound particles involved in 
cell-to-cell communication through a delivery of regulatory molecules essential 
for physiological processes. Since EVs efficiently vectorize specific cargo 
molecules, they have been proposed as suitable vehicles for therapeutic agents. 
Drug loading into EVs can be achieved by active, exogenous strategies or by 
genetic modifications of vesicle-producing cells. With the aim to produce EVs 
conveying therapeutic proteins, we genetically engineered and compared HEK293 to 
tumor cells. Tetraspanin-based RFP fusions were found to be more stable and 
preferentially sorted into EVs in HEK293. EVs isolated from genetically modified 
HEK293 cells media were captured by cancer cells, efficiently delivering their 
cargo. Cathepsin B cleavage site introduced between CD9/CD81 and RFP was 
recognized by tumor specific proteases allowing the release of the reporter 
protein. Our results indicate HEK293 cells as a preferential system for the 
production of EVs and pave the way to the development of nano-platforms for the 
efficient delivery of therapeutic proteins and prodrugs to tumor cells."
16,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor leading cancer-associated 
high mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, the most commonly used drug 
therapeutics not only lack of target ability and efficiency, but also exhibit 
severe systemic toxicity to normal tissues. Thus, effective and targeted 
nanodrug of HCC therapy is emerging as a more important issue. Here, we design 
and develop the novel nanomicelles, namely Mannose-polyethylene glycol 
600-Nitroimidazole (Man-NIT). This micelle compound with high purity comprise 
two parts, which can self-assemble into nanoscale micelle. The outer shell is 
selected mannose as hydrophilic moiety, while the inner core is nitroimidazole 
as hydrophobic moiety. In the cell experiment, Man-NIT was more cellular uptake 
by HCCLM3 cells due to the mannose modification. Mannose as a kind of glucose 
transporter 1 (GLUT1) substrate, can specifically recognize and bind to 
over-expressed GLUT1 on carcinoma cytomembrane. The nitroimidazole moiety of 
Man-NIT was reduced by the over-expressed nitroreductase with reduced 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as the cofactor, resulting 
in transient deletion of NADPH and glutathione (GSH). The increase of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) in HCCLM3 cells disturbed the balance of redox, and finally 
caused the death of tumor cells. Additional in vivo experiment was conducted 
using twenty-four male BALB/c nude mice to build the tumor model. The results 
showed that nanomicelles were accumulated in the liver of mice. The tumor size 
and pathological features were obviously improved after nanomicelles treatment. 
It indicates that namomicelles have a tumor inhibition effect, especially 
Man-NIT, which may be a potential nanodrug of chemotherapeutics for HCC therapy."
17,"It is known that phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5 kinase (PIP5K) γ and 
phospholipase C (PLC) β3, working sequentially in the phosphoinositide cycle, 
are localized in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) somata and are involved in the 
regulation of pain and related sensations. However, the sites of their 
involvement have remained to be clarified. In the present study, 
immunoreactivity for PLCβ3 was distinct only in the central process of mouse 
DRG, but not in its peripheral process, in contrast to distinct 
PIP5Kγ-immunoreactivity in both peripheral and central DRG processes. No nerve 
terminals showing immunoreactivity for PLCβ3 were detected in any peripheral 
sensory fields, similar to PIP5Kγ-immunoreactivity. In DRG somata, 
PIP5Kγ-immunoreactivity was rather confined to the neurolemma in which dots and 
threads were discerned in 3D bright field light microscopy. This feature well 
corresponded to its discontinuous localization along the plasma membranes in 
immuno-electron microscopy. In contrast, PLCβ3-immunoreactivity occurred 
diffusely throughout the somata, but did not take distinct appearance of 
immunoreaction on neurolemma or plasma membranes, unlike 
PIP5Kγ-immunoreactivity. In addition, satellite glial cells were immunonegative 
for PLCβ3, but immunopositive for PIP5Kγ. The involvement of PLCβ3 in regulation 
of pain and related sensations is thus suggested to be mainly exerted at levels 
of the DRG soma and its upstream, but to be less significant in the peripheral 
sensory fields, similar to PIP5Kγ. The possibility is also suggested that PIP, 
PIP5Kγ-target, is localized heterogeneously, but PIP2, PLCβ3-target, is 
localized homogenously over the plane of the neuronal plasma membranes. RESEARCH 
HIGHLIGHTS: PIP5Kγ, different from PLCβ3, was localized heterogeneously on 
neuronal membranes, and this difference was demonstrated in 3D-bright field 
immuno-light and electron microscopy. Either PIP5Kγ or PLCβ3 was not detected in 
peripheral nerve terminals."
18,"INTRODUCTION: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant tumor in 
adult white populations. If BCCs are not treated for years, if they cause 
massive destruction of the surrounding tissues, if they are considered 
unresectable or not eligible for radiotherapy they become progressively ""locally 
advanced"" (laBCC) or metastatic (mBCC). These tumors are defined as 
'difficult-to-treat BCC'.
AREAS COVERED: A comprehensive search on PubMed was conducted to identify 
relevant literature about the several approved and recommended treatment options 
for the management of difficult-to-treat BCC published from January 2012 to July 
2022. Surgical options, radiotherapy, hedgehog inhibitors, immunotherapy and 
combined treatments are discussed. The keywords used were basal cell carcinoma; 
difficult-to-treat BCC; management of difficult-to-treat BCC; surgical therapy; 
radiotherapy; hedgehog inhibitors; immunotherapy.
EXPERT OPINION: Identifying the best approach to DTT BCCs is one of the main 
challenges for the dermato-oncologist. The introduction of HHI for the treatment 
of advanced BCCs has revolutionized the clinical management of DTT BCCs. The 
immune checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab has been approved for the treatment of 
locally advanced or metastatic BCC refractory to HHI therapy or in patients 
intolerant to HHI therapy. Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) play a key role in 
managing these complex patients."
19,"The aim of this study was to optimize a coculture in vitro model established 
between the human Müller glial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, 
mimicking the inner blood-retinal barrier, and to explore its resistance to 
damage induced by oxidative stress. A spontaneously immortalized human Müller 
cell line MIO-M1 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were plated 
together at a density ratio 1:1 and maintained up to the 8th passage (p8). The 
MIO-M1/HUVECs p1 through p8 were treated with increasing concentrations (range 
200-800 μM) of H2 O2 to evaluate oxidative stress induced damage and comparing 
data with single cell cultures. The following features were assayed p1 through 
p8: doubling time maintenance, cell viability using MTS assay, ultrastructure of 
cell-cell contacts, immunofluorescence for Vimentin and GFAP, molecular biology 
(q-PCR) for GFAP and CD31 mRNA. MIO-M1/HUVECs cocultures maintained distinct 
cell cytotype up to p8 as shown by flow cytometry analysis, without evidence of 
cross activation, displaying cell-cell tight junctions mimicking those found in 
human retina, only acquiring a slight resistance to oxidative stress induction 
over the passages. This MIO-M1/HUVECs coculture represents a simple, 
reproducible and affordable model for in vitro studies on oxidative 
stress-induced retinal damages."
20,"OBJECTIVES: Numerous diseases and disorders are associated with mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA) mutations, among which m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations in the 
12 S ribosomal RNA gene contribute to aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic 
hearing loss worldwide.
METHODS: A total of 76,842 qualified non-invasive prenatal (NIPT) samples were 
subjected to mtDNA mutation and haplogroup analysis.
RESULTS: We detected 181 m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations, 151 of which 
were subsequently sequenced for full-length mitochondrial genome verification. 
The positive predictive values for the m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations 
were 90.78% and 90.00%, respectively, a performance comparable to that attained 
with newborn hearing screening. Furthermore, mitochondrial haplogroup analysis 
revealed that the 12 S rRNA 1555A > G mutation was enriched in sub-haplotype 
D5[p = 0, OR = 4.6706(2.81-7.78)].
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the non-invasive prenatal testing of 
cell-free DNA obtained from maternal plasma can successfully detect m.1555A > G 
and m.1494C > T mutations."
21,"Five-year survival of pancreatic cancer (PC) remains low. Murine models may not 
adequately mimic human PC and can be too small for medical device development. A 
large animal PC model could address these issues. We induced and characterized 
pancreatic tumors in Oncopigs (transgenic swine containing KRASG12D and 
TP53R167H). Oncopigs underwent injection of adenovirus expressing Cre 
recombinase (AdCre) into one of the main pancreatic ducts. Resultant tumors were 
characterized by histology, cytokine expression, exome sequencing and 
transcriptome analysis. Ten out of fourteen Oncopigs (71%) had gross tumor 
within three weeks. At necropsy all of these subjects had gastric outlet 
obstruction secondary to pancreatic tumor and phlegmon. Oncopigs with injections 
without Cre recombinase and wild type pigs with AdCre injection did not show 
notable effect. Exome and transcriptome analysis of the porcine pancreatic 
tumors revealed similarity with the molecular signatures and pathways of human 
PC. While further optimization and validation of this porcine PC model would be 
beneficial, it is anticipated that this model will be useful for focused 
research and development of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies for PC."
22,"Dynamic regulation of wound physiological signals is the basis of wound healing. 
Conventional biomaterials delivering growth factors to drive wound healing leads 
to the passive repair of soft tissues because of the mismatch of wound healing 
stages. Meanwhile, the bioactivity of wound exudate is often restricted by 
oxidation and bacterial contamination. Herein, an extracellular matrix mimicked 
nanofiber/hydrogel interpenetrated network (NFHIN) was constructed with a 3D 
nanofibrous framework for cell immigration, and interfiled aerogel containing 
cross-linked hyaluronic acid and hyperbranched polyamidoamine to balance the 
wound microenvironment. The aerogel can collect wound exudate and transform into 
a polycationic hydrogel with contact-killing effects even against intracellular 
pathogens (bactericidal rate > 99.9% in 30 min) and real-time scavenging 
property of reactive oxygen species. After co-culturing with the NFHIN, the 
bioactivity of fibroblast in theex vivoblister fluid was improved by 389.69%. 
The NFHIN showed sustainable exudate management with moisture-vapor transferring 
rate (6000 g m-2×24 h), equilibrium liquid content (75.3%), Young's modulus 
(115.1 ± 7 kPa), and anti-tearing behavior similar to human skin. The NFHIN can 
collect and activate wound exudate, turning it from a clinical problem to an 
autoimmune-derived wound regulation system, showing potential for wound care in 
critical skin diseases."
23,"Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that affects primarily the retinal 
ganglion cells (RGCs). Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the major 
risk factors for glaucoma. The mainstay of current glaucoma therapy is limited 
to lowering IOP; however, controlling IOP in certain patients can be futile in 
slowing disease progression. The understanding of potential biomolecular 
processes that occur in glaucomatous degeneration allows for the development of 
glaucoma treatments that modulate the death of RGCs. Neuroprotection is the 
modification of RGCs and the microenvironment of neurons to promote neuron 
survival and function. Numerous studies have revealed effective neuroprotection 
modalities in animal models of glaucoma; nevertheless, clinical translation 
remains a major challenge. In this review, we select the most clinically 
relevant treatment strategies, summarize preclinical and clinical data as well 
as recent therapeutic advances in IOP-independent neuroprotection research, and 
discuss the feasibility and hurdles of each therapeutic approach based on 
possible pathogenic mechanisms. We also summarize the potential therapeutic 
mechanisms of various agents in neuroprotection related to glutamate 
excitotoxicity."
24,"Tuberculosis remains a global health threat with high morbidity. Dendritic cells 
(DCs) participate in the acute and chronic inflammatory responses to 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by directing the adaptive immune response and 
are present in lung granulomas. In macrophages, the interaction of lipid 
droplets (LDs) with mycobacteria-containing phagosomes is central to 
host-pathogen interactions. However, the data available for DCs are still a 
matter of debate. Here, we reported that bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) were 
susceptible to Mtb infection and replication at similar rate to macrophages. 
Unlike macrophages, the analysis of gene expression showed that Mtb infection 
induced a delayed increase in lipid droplet-related genes and proinflammatory 
response. Hence, LD accumulation has been observed by high-content imaging in 
late periods. Infection of BMDCs with killed H37Rv demonstrated that LD 
accumulation depends on Mtb viability. Moreover, infection with the attenuated 
strains H37Ra and M. bovis-BCG induced only an early transient increase in LDs, 
whereas virulent Mtb also induced delayed LD accumulation. In addition, 
infection with the BCG strain with the reintroduced virulence RD1 locus induced 
higher LD accumulation and bacterial replication when compared to parental BCG. 
Collectively, our data suggest that delayed LD accumulation in DCs is dependent 
on mycobacterial viability and virulence."
25,"Psoriasis is a predominantly Th17 cell-driven chronic autoinflammatory skin 
disorder. Brevilin A, a natural sesquiterpene lactone extracted from Centipeda 
minima, has been used as a traditional oriental medicine for allergic diseases 
for centuries. However, the effects of brevilin A on psoriasis have yet to be 
established. In this study, we investigated brevilin A to elucidate its 
potential effects on T cell activities in psoriasis, in animal models and 
patients. An imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis murine model was 
utilized. Experimental mice were administered different doses of brevilin A (5, 
10, 20 mg/kg respectively) for a duration of 5 days. Cutaneous manifestations 
were measured daily. Under hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC), acanthosis and proinflammatory cytokine expression 
in the dorsal skin of mice were detected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) was used for the measurement of IL-17A levels in serum samples. Naïve 
CD4+ T cells, isolated from mice spleen and lymph nodes and from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of psoriatic patients, were used to evaluate the 
effects of brevilin A on Th17 differentiation. In brevilin A-treated mice, 
brevilin A significantly reduced skin redness and scaling; acanthosis as well as 
IL-6, IL-17A, and ki-67 expressions were downregulated in the dorsal skin, and 
serum levels of IL-17A were lowered. Brevilin A also inhibited Th17 
differentiation. In conclusion, brevilin A demonstrated significant capability 
in ameliorating skin inflammation in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis and 
could modulate Th17 differentiation. Therefore, brevilin A is potentially 
pharmacologically effective in the treatment of psoriasis."
26,"Bone disease is among the defining characteristics of symptomatic Multiple 
Myeloma (MM). Imaging techniques such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
can identify plasma cell proliferation and quantify disease activity. This 
function renders these imaging tools as suitable not only for diagnosis, but 
also for the assessment of bone disease after treatment of MM patients. The aim 
of this article is to review FDG PET/CT and MRI and their applications, with a 
focus on their role in treatment response evaluation. MRI emerges as the 
technique with the highest sensitivity in lesions' detection and PET/CT as the 
technique with a major impact on prognosis. Their comparison yields different 
results concerning the best tool to evaluate treatment response. The 
inhomogeneity of the data suggests the need to address limitations related to 
these tools with the employment of new techniques and the potential for a 
complementary use of both PET/CT and MRI to refine the sensitivity and achieve 
the standards for minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation."
27,"Uterine leiomyomas usually arise from the uterine body (95%), and rarely from 
the cervix (0.6%) or other urogenital sites. Lipoleiomyomas are benign, uncommon 
variants of leiomyomas (0.03-0.2%), histologically composed of smooth muscle 
cells and mature adipocytes; they usually occur in the uterine body and 
exceptionally in the cervix. We performed the first systematic literature review 
of cervical lipoleiomyomas (PRISMA guidelines), presenting five new cases. 
Including our series, thirty-one detailed cases were reported in the literature 
(mainly in Asia). The age range was 35-74 years, revealing a higher mean age 
than conventional cervical leiomyomas (46.5 vs. 39.4 years). Patients were 
usually multiparous (94%), typically complaining of vaginal bleeding (11/31, 
36%), pelvic/abdominal pain (10/31, 32%), and/or urinary disturbances (6/31, 
19%) 1 week to 10 months before presentation. Clinical examination revealed a 
pedunculated tumor (48%), or prolapse of ≥1 pelvic organs (16%). Twenty-four 
(77%) patients underwent total hysterectomy ± additional surgery; simple 
myomectomy/excision was performed in five (16%) cases. Only one (3%) of our 
cases recurred 2 years after partial excision; no evidence of disease was found 
13 years after recurrence excision. Adipocytes occupied ≤50% of the tumor 
volume. Hyaline or myxoid changes and cartilaginous metaplasia were uncommon 
histological findings. Surgically challenging cases or pregnant patients may 
require expert gynecologists. Interventional radiology or conservative 
treatments were rarely proposed."
28,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a disease affecting upper and lower motor 
neurons. Although motor neuron death is the core event of ALS pathology, it is 
increasingly recognized that other tissues and cell types are affected in the 
disease, making potentially major contributions to the occurrence and 
progression of pathology. We review here the known cellular and molecular 
characteristics of muscle tissue affected by ALS. Evidence of toxicity in 
skeletal muscle tissue is considered, including metabolic dysfunctions, impaired 
proteostasis, and deficits in muscle regeneration and RNA metabolism. The role 
of muscle as a secretory organ, and effects on the skeletal muscle secretome are 
also covered, including the increase in secretion of toxic factors or decrease 
in essential factors that have consequences for neuronal function and survival."
29,"Disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is influenced by activation of 
circulating and synovial immune cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and monocytes 
are key cells that drive inflammation in RA. This study investigated if a 
relationship exists between disease activity in RA and circulating Treg and 
monocyte numbers and phenotypes. A potential sialic acid (Sia) mediated link 
between Tregs and monocytes was also probed in vitro. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from RA patient (n = 62) and healthy 
control (n = 21) blood using density gradient separation. Flow cytometry was 
used to count and phenotype Treg and monocyte subsets, and to sort healthy 
control Tregs for Sia cell culture experiments. The effects of Sia on activated 
Treg FoxP3 and NFκB expression was assessed by flow cytometry and concentrations 
of secreted TNFα, IL-10 and IFNγ determined by ELISA. High disease activity RA 
patients who were unresponsive to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (n = 
31), have significantly lower relative numbers (percentages) of CD4+CD25+CD127- 
Tregs (p &lt; 0.01) and memory CD45RA-FoxP3+ Tregs (p &lt; 0.01), compared to 
low disease activity responders (n = 24). Relative numbers of non-classical 
CD169+ monocytes are associated with disease activity in RA (p = 0.012). Sia 
reduced Treg expression of FoxP3, NFκB and cytokines in vitro. A strong 
association has been identified between non-classical CD169+ monocytes and 
post-treatment disease activity in RA. This study also indicates that Sia can 
reduce Treg activation and cytokine release. We postulate that such a reduction 
could be mediated by interaction with sialyted proteins captured by CD169+ 
monocytes."
30,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine predictive factors of early 
mortality and early rebleeding (≤30 days) following transarterial embolization 
(TAE) for treatment of acute gastrointestinal bleeding.
METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted for acute gastrointestinal bleeding 
to the interventional radiology department in a tertiary center between January 
2012 and January 2022 were included. Exclusion criteria were patients: (1) aged 
&lt; 18-year-old, (2) referred to the operation room without TAE, (3) treated 
for hemobilia, (4) with mesenteric hematoma, (5) lost to follow-up within 30 
days after the procedure. We evaluated pre and per-procedure clinical data, 
biological data, outcomes, and complications.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included: 55 (80.9%) experienced upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding and 13 (19.1%) lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Median 
age was 69 (61-74) years. There were 49 (72%) males. Median hemoglobin was 7.25 
(6.1-8.3) g/dL. There were 30 (50%) ulcers. Coils were used in 46 (67.6%) 
procedures. Early mortality was 15 (22.1%) and early rebleeding was 17 (25%). In 
multivariate analysis, hyperlactatemia (≥2 mmol/L) were predictive of early 
mortality (≤30 days). A high number of red blood cells units was associated with 
early rebleeding.
CONCLUSION: This study identified some predictive factors of 30-day mortality 
and early rebleeding following TAE. This will assist in patient selection and 
may help improve the management of gastrointestinal bleeding."
31,"Lung cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide. Numerous 
medications targeting specific molecular alterations in non-small cell lung 
cancer have been introduced in the last decade and have revolutionized the 
clinical management of the disease. Their use has brought to a parallel 
evolution of molecular testing techniques to identify alterations in druggable 
molecular targets within the genetic material of the tumors. To perform 
molecular testing, biopsy or surgery tissue specimens are needed, which in 
addition allow the histological characterization of the tumors. Unfortunately, 
in real-life practice not all the patients are suitable for biopsy or surgery 
procedures. The use of liquid biopsy for blood extracted tumoral DNA analysis is 
a promising approach in unbiopsied cases, but it is also weighted by several 
methodological and technical limitations. We report here a case of 
histologically undiagnosed lung cancer managed with a liquid biopsy and 
subsequently with anti-EGFR treatment. Our report highlights that the use of 
liquid biopsy molecular testing in specific clinical situations can offer 
treatment opportunities for fragile patients affected by lung cancer."
32,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common and 
devastating central nervous disease, the treatment of which faces many 
challenges to the medical community and society as a whole. Treatment measures 
based on oxidative stress of spinal motor neurons during SCI are expected to 
help restore biological functions of neurons under injury conditions. However, 
to date, there are no systematic reports regarding oxidative stress on spinal 
motor neuron injury. Our aim is to better understand and explain the influences 
and mechanisms of oxidative stress on spinal motor neurons during SCI.
METHODS: We first exposed VSC4.1 motor neurons to hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and 
evaluated the effects on cell viability, morphology, cycling, and apoptosis, 
with an emphasis on the changes to the cytoskeleton and the effect of 
N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) on these changes. Then, we investigated the effects of 
NAC on these cytoskeletal changes in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We found that H2 O2 caused severe damage to the normal cytoskeleton, 
leading to a reduction in neurite length and number, rearrangement of the actin 
cytoskeleton, and disorder of the microtubules and neurofilaments in VSC4.1. 
Importantly, NAC attenuated the oxidative damage of spinal motor neurons in 
vitro and in vivo, promoting the recovery of hindlimb motor ability in mice with 
SCI at the early stage of injury.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that oxidative stress plays an important role in 
the cytoskeleton destruction of spinal motor neurons in SCI, and treatment of 
SCI on this basis is a promising strategy. These findings will help to elucidate 
the role of oxidative stress in spinal motor neuron injury in SCI and provide 
references for further research into the study of the pathology and underlying 
mechanism of SCI."
33,"We describe our institutional experience of developing a liquid biopsy approach 
using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis for personalized medicine in cancer 
patients, focusing on the hurdles encountered during the multistep process in 
order to benefit other investigators wishing to set up this type of study in 
their institution. Blood samples were collected at the time of cancer surgery 
from 209 patients with one of nine different cancer types. Extracted tumor DNA 
and circulating cell-free DNA were sequenced using cancer-specific panels and 
the Illumina MiSeq machine. Almost half of the pairs investigated were 
uninformative, mostly because there was no trackable pathogenic mutation 
detected in the original tumor. The pairs with interpretable data corresponded 
to 107 patients. Analysis of 48 gene sequences common to both panels was 
performed and revealed that about 40% of these pairs contained at least one 
driver mutation detected in the DNA extracted from plasma. Here, we describe the 
choice of our overall approach, the selection of the cancer panels, and the 
difficulties encountered during the multistep process, including the use of 
several tumor types and in the data analysis. We also describe some case reports 
using longitudinal samples, illustrating the potential advantages and rewards in 
performing ctDNA sequencing to monitor tumor burden or guide treatment for 
cancer patients."
34,"It is now possible to estimate an individual's brain age via brain scans and 
machine-learning models. This validated technique has opened up new avenues for 
addressing clinical questions in neurology, and, in this review, we summarize 
the many clinical applications of brain-age estimation in neuropsychiatry and 
general populations. We first provide an introduction to typical neuroimaging 
modalities, feature extraction methods, and machine-learning models that have 
been used to develop a brain-age estimation framework. We then focus on the 
significant findings of the brain-age estimation technique in the field of 
neuropsychiatry as well as the usefulness of the technique for addressing 
clinical questions in neuropsychiatry. These applications may contribute to more 
timely and targeted neuropsychiatric therapies. Last, we discuss the practical 
problems and challenges described in the literature and suggest some future 
research directions."
35,"BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most prevalent type of 
lymphoma that is potentially curable by chemotherapy. Immunogenic cell death 
(ICD) is regarded as an essential process for the clearance of residual tumor 
cells. However, the impact of ICD on DLBCL remains unknown. Here, we tried to 
explore the prognostic role of ICD in DLBCL.
METHODS: A gene expression microarray of DLBCL was downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO). The genes involved in ICD were obtained via literature 
reviews. Then, based on univariate, multivariate, and LASSO Cox regression 
analysis, the ICD-related gene signature was identified. The effect of the 
ICD-related gene signature on DLBCL was explored. The chi-square test was used 
to compare complete response rate (CRR) and recurrence rate between high- and 
low-risk groups.
RESULTS: The signature based on 12 ICD-related genes could independently predict 
the overall survival of DLBCL. Furthermore, high risk was linked to lower CRR 
and higher recurrence rate. Then, a nomogram based on the ICD-related gene 
signature was established. The area under the curve of the prediction model 
reached 0.820 in the training set and 0.780 in the validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the ICD-related gene signature could be a 
novel prognostic indicator for DLCBL."
36,"Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is a major cause of liver-related disorders and together 
with cancer-associated fibroblasts can favor liver cancer development by 
modulating the tumor microenvironment. Advanced HF, characterized by an excess 
of extracellular matrix (ECM), is mediated by TGF- β1, that activates hepatic 
stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts. A TGF-β1 receptor inhibitor, LY2157299 or 
Galunisertib (GLY), has shown promising results against chronic liver 
progression in animal models, and we show that it can be further improved by 
enhancing GLYs bioavailability through encapsulation in polymeric 
polygalacturonic-polyacrylic acid nanomicelles (GLY-NMs). GLY-NMs reduced HF in 
an in vivo rat model of liver fibrosis induced by intraperitoneal injection of 
CCl4 as shown by the morphological, biochemical, and molecular biology 
parameters of normal and fibrotic livers. Moreover, GLY-NM was able to induce 
recovery from HF better than free GLY. Indeed, the encapsulated drug reduces 
collagen deposition, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, prevents fatty 
degeneration and restores the correct lobular architecture of the liver as well 
as normalizes the serum parameters and expression of the genes involved in the 
onset of HF. In summary, GLY-NM improved the pharmacological activity of the 
free TGF- β1 inhibitor in the in vivo HF treatment and thus is a candidate as a 
novel therapeutic strategy."

38,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment 
for many patients suffering from hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, inborn 
errors of metabolism or genetic disorders. Despite decades of successful HSCT, 
clinical outcomes are still far from satisfactory due to treatment-related 
complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cardiovascular 
complications (CVC). CVC may affect patients in the acute period post-HSCT; 
however, the occurrence is far higher among long-term survivors. Induction 
treatment using cardiotoxic treatments, e.g., anthracyclines and radiotherapy, 
conditioning regimens containing cyclophosphamide, and post-HSCT comorbidities, 
including GvHD, are factors contributing to CVC. Cardiac function evaluation 
prior to and post-transplantation is an important strategy for choosing the 
proper conditioning regimen, HSCT protocol and post-HSCT supportive care. 
Cardiac systolic function evaluation by echocardiography, in addition to serum 
cardiac biomarkers, such as troponins and brain natriuretic peptides, is 
recommended as a routine follow-up for HSCT patients. Angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II-receptor blockers, and beta-blockers, which 
are mostly used for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, might 
be used as treatments for HSCT-related CVC. In summary, the present review 
reveals the urgent need for further investigations concerning HSCT-related CVC 
both at the preclinical and clinical levels due to the lack of knowledge about 
CVC and its underlying mechanisms."
39,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a key role in cancer, 
influencing growth, proliferation, and survival of tumor cells. PIK3CA mutations 
are generally oncogenic and responsible for uncontrolled cellular growth. PI3K 
inhibitors (PI3Ki) can inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, although burdened by 
not easily manageable toxicity. Among PI3Ki, alpelisib, a selective p110α 
inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- PIK3CA 
mutant metastatic breast cancer (BC) that has progressed to a first line 
endocrine therapy. PIK3CA mutations are also present in triple negative BC 
(TNBC) and HER2+ BC, although the role of PI3K inhibition is not well 
established in these subtypes. In this review, we go through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway, describing most common mutations found in PI3K genes and how they can 
be detected. We describe the available biological and clinical evidence of 
PIK3CA mutations in breast cancers other than HR+/HER2-, summarizing clinical 
trials investigating PI3Ki in these subtypes."
40,"Nocardia seriolae is a major causative agent of fish nocardiosis that results in 
serious economic losses in the aquaculture industry. However, the virulence 
factors and pathogenic mechanisms of the bacterium are poorly understood. Here, 
a new N. seriolae strain AHLQ20-01 was isolated from the diseased Micropterus 
salmoides and identified by phenotypic examination combined with 16S rRNA 
sequencing. Subsequently, the potential virulence factors of the strain were 
analysed at genome level by whole-genome sequencing. The results showed that the 
whole-genome sequence derived from N. seriolae AHLQ20-01 circular chromosome 
contains 8,129,380 bp DNA with G + C content of 68.14%, and encompasses 7650 
protein-coding genes, 114 pseudo-genes, 3 rRNAs, 66 tRNAs and 36 non-coding 
RNAs. More importantly, a total of 139 genes, which mainly involved in adhesion, 
invasion, resistance to oxidative and nitrosative stress, phagosome arresting, 
iron acquisition system, toxin production and bacterial secretion systems, were 
identified as core virulence-associated genes. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of 
N. seriolae AHLQ20-01 to M. salmoides was further investigated through 
experimental infection. It was found that the LD50 value of the strain to M. 
salmoides was 9.3 × 106  colony forming unit/fish. Histopathological examination 
demonstrated typical granuloma with varying sizes in the liver, head kidney, 
spleen and heart of the experimentally infected fish. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase dUTP nick end labelling assay and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
staining showed that there were distinctly more apoptotic cells in all the 
tested tissues in the infection group, but not in the control group. Together, 
these findings provide the foundation to further explore the pathogenic 
mechanism of N. seriolae, which might contribute to the prevention and treatment 
of fish nocardiosis."
41,"Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors are 
important components of plant and metazoan innate immunity that can function as 
individual units or as pairs or networks. Upon activation, NLRs form 
multiprotein complexes termed resistosomes or inflammasomes. Although metazoan 
paired NLRs, such as NAIP/NLRC4, form hetero-complexes upon activation, the 
molecular mechanisms underpinning activation of plant paired NLRs, especially 
whether they associate in resistosome hetero-complexes, is unknown. In asterid 
plant species, the NLR required for cell death (NRC) immune receptor network is 
composed of multiple resistance protein sensors and downstream helpers that 
confer immunity against diverse plant pathogens. Here, we show that pathogen 
effector-activation of the NLR proteins Rx (confers virus resistance), and Bs2 
(confers bacterial resistance) leads to oligomerization of their helper NLR, 
NRC2. Activated Rx does not oligomerize or enter into a stable complex with the 
NRC2 oligomer and remains cytoplasmic. In contrast, activated NRC2 oligomers 
accumulate in membrane-associated puncta. We propose an activation-and-release 
model for NLRs in the NRC immune receptor network. This points to a distinct 
activation model compared with mammalian paired NLRs."
42,"BACKGROUND: Brain abscess (BA) is a rare, but severe infection and experimental 
BA animal models may prove crucial for advances in treatment. This review 
describes the development of experimental BA models and the clinical advances 
obtained from these, in a historical perspective.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experimental BA studies from inception until June 15, 
2022, were included by searching the PubMed and Embase databases. Inclusion 
required the use of an experimental BA animal model. Non-bacterial BA models, 
in vitro studies, veterinarian case-reports, and articles written in non-English 
language were excluded. Bias was not systematically assessed, and the review was 
not registered at the PROSPERO.
RESULTS: 79 studies were included. The majority of animal BA models have been 
based on small rodents using Staphylococcus aureus. The models have delineated 
the natural development of BA and provided detailed descriptions of the 
histopathological characteristics consisting of a necrotic centre surrounded by 
layers of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts encapsulated by a dense collagenous 
layer. Radiological studies of animal BA have been shown to correlate with the 
corresponding stages of human BA in both computed tomography and magnetic 
resonance imaging and may guide diagnosis as well as the timing of neurosurgical 
intervention. Moreover, pharmacokinetic studies of the intracavitary penetration 
of various antimicrobials have helped inform medical treatment of BA. Other 
studies have examined the diverse effects of corticosteroids including decreased 
cerebral oedema, intracranial pressure, and intracavitary drug concentration, 
whereas concerns on decreased or weakened capsule formation could not be 
confirmed. Finally, studies on the immunological response to BA have highlighted 
potential future immunomodulatory targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Animal models have been vital for improvements in the management of 
BA. Experimental BA models resembling human disease including polymicrobial 
infection by oral cavity flora in large animals are needed."
43,"INTRODUCTION: The most clinically useful concept in asthma is based on the 
intensity of treatment required to achieve good asthma control. Biomarkers to 
guide therapy are needed.
AIMS: To investigate the role of circulating levels of soluble urokinase 
plasminogen activator receptor suPAR as a marker for asthma severity.
METHODS: We recruited patients evaluated at the Asthma Clinic, University of 
Thessaly, Greece. Asthma severity and control were defined according to the GINA 
strategy and Asthma Contro Test (ACT). Anthropometrics, spirometry, fractional 
exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), suPAR, blood cell count, c-reactive protein (CRP), 
and analyses of kidney and liver function were obtained. Patients with a history 
of inflammatory, infectious, or malignant disease or other lung disease, more 
than 5 pack years of smoking history, or corticosteroid therapy were excluded.
RESULTS: We evaluated 74 asthma patients (69% female, mean age 57 ± 17 years, 
mean body mass index (BMI) 29 ± 6 kg/m2). In total, 24%, 13%, 6%, 5%, 29% and 
23% of the participants had mild well-controlled, mild uncontrolled, moderate 
well-controlled, moderate uncontrolled, severe well-controlled, and severe 
uncontrolled asthma, respectively. Overall, 67% had T2-high asthma, 26% received 
biologics (15% and 85% received omalizumab and mepolizumab, respectively), and 
34% had persistent airway obstruction. suPAR levels were significantly lower in 
asthmatics with moderate uncontrolled asthma than in patients with severe 
uncontrolled asthma without (2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 3.3 ± 0.7 ng/mL, p = 0.023) or with 
biologics (2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 3.6 ± 0.8 ng/mL, p = 0.029). No correlations were found 
between suPAR levels and age, BMI, T2 biomarkers, CRP, or spirometric 
parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: suPAR levels were higher in asthmatics with severe disease than in 
those with moderate uncontrolled asthma."
44,"Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction has become an important strategy for tumor 
therapy, which has shown outstanding therapeutic effects in clinical settings. 
However, unsatisfactory response rates and immune-related adverse effects limit 
the use of anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies. Here, we report the discovery and 
identification of S4-1, an innovative small-molecule inhibitor of PD-L1. In 
vitro, S4-1 effectively altered the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction, induced PD-L1 
dimerization and internalization, improved its localization to endoplasmic 
reticulum, and thus enhanced the cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells toward tumor cells. In vivo, S4-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth in 
both lung and colorectal cancer models, particularly in colorectal cancer, where 
it led to complete clearance of a portion of the tumor cells. Furthermore, S4-1 
induced T-cell activation and inversed the inhibitory tumor microenvironment, 
consistent with the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway blockade. These data support the 
continued evaluation of S4-1 as an alternative ICB therapeutic strategy."
45,"Over the past 50 years, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has played a critical role in the 
systemic chemotherapy of cancer patients. Bolus intravenous (IV) 5-FU infusion 
has been used due to the limitation of its extremely short half-life 
(10-15 min). This study used ultrasound (US) mediating 5-FU-loaded microbubbles 
(MBs) cavitation as a tool to increase local intratumoral 5-FU levels with a 
reduced dose of 5-FU (a single IV injection of 2.5 mg/kg instead of a single 
intraperitoneal injection of 25-200 mg/kg as used in previous studies in mice). 
The 5-FU-MBs were prepared with a 132 mg/mL albumin solution and a 0.30 mg/mL 
5-FU solution. The diameters of the MBs and 5-FU-MBs were 1.24 ± 0.85 and 
2.00 ± 0.53 µm (mean ± SEM), respectively, and the maximum loading efficiency of 
5-FU on MBs was 19.04 ± 0.25%. In the in vitro study, the cell viabilities of 
5-FU and 5-FU-MBs did not differ significantly, but compared with the 5-FU-MBs 
treatment-alone group, cell toxicity increased to 31% in the 5-FU-MBs + US group 
(p < 0.001). The biodistribution results indicated that the 5-FU levels of the 
tumors in small animals were significant higher for the 5-FU-MBs + US treatment 
than for either the 5-FU-MBs or 5-FU treatment with low 5-FU systemic treatment 
doses (2.5 mg/kg 5-FU IV). In small-animal treatment, 2.5 mg/kg 5-FU therapeutic 
IV doses injected into mice caused a more-significant reduction in tumor growth 
in the 5-FU-MBs + US group (65.9%) than in the control group after 34 days of 
treatment."
46,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The introduction of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) into 
C3 crops has been considered as a means of improving water-use efficiency. In 
this study, we investigated photosynthetic and leaf structural traits in F1 
hybrids between Cymbidium ensifolium (female C3 parent) and C. bicolor subsp. 
pubescens (male CAM parent) of the Orchidaceae.
METHODS: Seven F1 hybrids produced through artificial pollination and in vitro 
culture were grown in a greenhouse with the parent plants. Structural, 
biochemical, and physiological traits involved in CAM in their leaves were 
investigated.
KEY RESULTS: Cymbidium ensifolium accumulated very low levels of malate without 
diel fluctuation, whereas C. bicolor subsp. pubescens showed nocturnal 
accumulation and diurnal consumption of malate. The F1s also accumulated malate 
at night, but much less than C. bicolor subsp. pubescens. This feature was 
consistent with low nocturnal fixation of atmospheric CO2 in the F1s. δ 13C 
values of the F1s were intermediate between those of the parents. The leaf 
thickness was thicker in C. bicolor subsp. pubescens than in C. ensifolium, and 
those of the F1s were more similar to that of C. ensifolium. This was due to the 
difference in mesophyll cell size. The chloroplast coverage of mesophyll cell 
perimeter adjacent to intercellular air spaces of C. bicolor subsp. pubescens 
was lower than that of C. ensifolium, and those of the F1s were intermediate 
between them. Interestingly, one F1 had structural and physiological traits more 
similar to those of C. bicolor subsp. pubescens than the other F1s. 
Nevertheless, all F1s contained intermediate levels of phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxylase but as much pyruvate,Pi dikinase as C. bicolor subsp. pubescens.
CONCLUSIONS: CAM traits were intricately inherited in the F1 hybrids, the level 
of CAM expression varied widely among F1 plants, and the CAM traits examined 
were not necessarily co-ordinately transmitted to the F1s."
47,"OBJECTIVES: Inotodiol has been proven to have antitumor, antiviral, 
anti-inflammatory, and antiallergic properties. This study investigated the 
immunomodulatory capability of inotodiol in allergic rhinitis mice.
METHODS: Forty BALB/c mice were divided into four groups, 10 mice each: control 
(CON), allergic rhinitis with PBS treatment (AR), inotodiol treatment (AR+Ino), 
and dexamethasone treatment (AR+Dex). Episodes of sneezing and nose rubbing were 
counted. Cytokines in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) and immunoglobulin in blood serum 
were measured. Nasal mucosae from each group were used for protein, RT-PCR, and 
histological analyses. Splenocytes were cultured for evaluation of cytokine 
production in each group.
RESULTS: Symptoms of rubbing and sneezing improved in the group of AR+Ino and 
AR+Dex than in the AR. NLF in the AR+Ino and AR+Dex also showed a significant 
decrease in interleukin (IL)-5, IL-10, and IL-13 compared to the AR. In 
addition, the number of eosinophils, goblet cells, and mast cells were notably 
lower in the nasal mucosae of the AR+Ino and AR+Dex. IL-4 and IL-17A in the 
AR+Ino and AR+Dex groups were decreased compared to the AR. Chemokines related 
to mast cell degradation were also decreased in the AR+Ino and AR+Dex groups. 
Total immunoglobulin (Ig)E, specific IgE and OVA-specific IgG1, and histamine 
levels were also significantly lower in the AR+Ino and AR+Dex groups. IL-10 and 
IL-13 were notably increased in the splenocytes of the AR after OVA stimulation, 
while the other groups showed no change.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate inotodiol can help suppress allergic 
responses by immunomodulation activities. This article is protected by

48,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles 
comprising a core of neutral lipids surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer. LDs 
play important roles in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Mammalian 
ovaries have been hypothesized to use neutral lipids stored in LDs to produce 
the hormones and nutrients necessary for rapid follicular development; however, 
our understanding of LD synthesis remains incomplete. In this study, we 
generated transgenic reporter mice that express mCherry fused to HPos, a minimal 
peptide that localizes specifically to nascent LDs synthesized at the ER. With 
this tool for visualizing initial LD synthesis in ovaries, we found that LDs are 
synthesized continuously in theca cells but rarely in inner granulosa cells 
during early follicular development. Administration of exogenous gonadotropin 
enhances LD synthesis in the granulosa cells, suggesting that LD synthesis is 
hormonally regulated. By contrast, we observed copious LD synthesis in the 
corpus luteum, and excessive LDs accumulation in atretic follicles. Furthermore, 
we demonstrated that LD synthesis is synchronized with angiogenesis around the 
follicle and that suppressing angiogenesis caused defective LD biosynthesis in 
developing follicles. Overall, our study is the first to demonstrate a 
spatiotemporally regulated interplay between LD synthesis and neovascularization 
during mammalian follicular development."
49,"Intermediate frequency magnetic fields (IF-MFs) at ~85 kHz are one of the 
components of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. However, the available data 
needed for the assessment of the safety of organisms from IF-MF exposure are 
scarce. Thus, there is an imminent need to accumulate evidence-based assessment 
data. In particular, if humans are exposed to IF-MF due to an accident or 
trouble, they are at increased risk of being exposed to high-intensity IF-MF 
within a short period. The already existing exposure system was improved to a 
system that could intermittently expose animals at 3 s intervals. This system 
allows the exposure of a mouse to high-intensity IF-MF (frequency: 82.3 kHz; 
induced electric field: 87 V/m, which was 3.8 times the basic restriction level 
for occupational exposure in the ICNIRP guideline), while regulating the heat 
generated by the coil. In vivo genotoxicity after IF-MF exposure was assessed 
using micronucleus (MN) test, Pig-a assay, and gpt assay. The results of MN test 
and Pig-a assay in hematopoietic cells revealed that neither the reticulocytes 
nor the mature erythrocytes exhibited significant increases in the IF-MF-exposed 
group compared with that in the sham-exposed group. In germ cells, MN test and 
gpt assay outcomes showed that IF-MF exposure did not cause any genetic or 
chromosomal abnormality. Based on these data, there was no genotoxic effect of 
our set IF-MF exposure on somatic and germ cells. These findings can contribute 
to the widespread use of WPT systems as effective data of IF-MF safety 
assessment."
50,"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) integrates both immunological and 
non-immunological inputs to control cell survival and death. Small GTPases are 
versatile functional switches that lie on the very upstream in signal 
transduction pathways, of which duration of activation is very transient. The 
large number of homologous proteins and the requirement for site-directed 
mutagenesis have hindered attempts to investigate the link between small GTPases 
and IRF3. Here, we constructed a constitutively active mutant expression library 
for small GTPase expression using Gibson assembly cloning. Small-scale screening 
identified multiple GTPases capable of promoting IRF3 phosphorylation. 
Intriguingly, 27 of 152 GTPases, including ARF1, RHEB, RHEBL1, and RAN, were 
found to increase IRF3 phosphorylation. Unbiased screening enabled us to 
investigate the sequence-activity relationship between the GTPases and IRF3. We 
found that the regulation of IRF3 by small GTPases was dependent on TBK1. Our 
work reveals the significant contribution of GTPases in IRF3 signaling and the 
potential role of IRF3 in GTPase function, providing a novel therapeutic 
approach against diseases with GTPase overexpression or active mutations, such 
as cancer."
51,"Radiation-induced intestinal injury (RIII) is a common complication after 
radiation therapy in patients with pelvic, abdominal, or retroperitoneal 
tumours. Recently, in the model of DSS (Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt) -induced 
intestinal inflammatory injury, it has been found in the study that transgenic 
mice expressing hVDR in IEC (Intestinal Epithelial Cell) manifest highly 
anti-injury properties in colitis, suggesting that activated VDR in the 
epithelial cells of intestine may inhibit colitis by protecting the mucosal 
epithelial barrier. In this study, we investigated the effect of the expression 
and regulation of VDR on the protection of RIII, and the radiosensitivity in 
vitro experiments, and explored the initial mechanism of VDR in regulating 
radiosensitivity of IEC. As a result, we found that the expression of VDR in 
intestinal tissues and cells in mice can be induced by ionizing radiation. VDR 
agonists are able to prolong the average survival time of mice after radiation 
and reduce the radiation-induced intestinal injury. For lack of vitamin D, the 
radiosensitivity of intestinal epithelial cells in mice increased, which can be 
reduced by VDR activation. Ensuing VDR activation, the radiation-induced 
intestinal stem cells damage is decreased, and the regeneration and 
differentiation of intestinal stem cells is promoted as well. Finally, on the 
basis of sequencing analysis, we validated and found that VDR may target the 
HIF/PDK1 pathway to mitigate RIII. We concluded that agonism or upregulation of 
VDR expression attenuates radiation-induced intestinal damage in mice and 
promotes the repair of epithelial damage in intestinal stem cells."
52,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is a conventional chemotherapeutic drug for glioma, however, 
its clinical application and efficacy is severely restricted by its drug 
resistance properties. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA 
repair enzyme, which can repair the DNA damage caused by TMZ. A large number of 
clinical data show that reducing the expression of MGMT can enhance the 
chemotherapeutic efficacy of TMZ. Therefore, in order to improve the resistance 
of glioma to TMZ, an angiopep-2 (A2) modified nanoprodrug of polytemozolomide 
(P(TMZ)n) that combines with MGMT siRNA (siMGMT) targeting MGMT was developed 
(A2/T/D/siMGMT). It not only increased the amount of TMZ within tumor lesion 
site, but also reduced MGMT expression in glioma. The in vitro experiments 
indicated that the A2/T/D/siMGMT effectively enhanced the cellular uptake of TMZ 
and siMGMT, and resulted in a significant cell apoptosis and cytotoxicity in the 
glioma cells. The in vivo experiments showed that glioma growth was inhibited 
and the survival time of animals were prolonged remarkably after A2/T/D/siMGMT 
was injected via tail vein. The results showed that the therapeutic effect of 
A2/T/D/siMGMT in the treatment of glioma was significantly improved."
53,"BACKGROUND: We examined the effect of free tissue neurotization on speech and 
swallowing outcomes for patients undergoing reconstruction of hemiglossectomy 
defects with a radial forearm free flap (RFFF).
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in patients with oral cavity 
squamous cell carcinoma undergoing a hemiglossectomy and reconstruction with a 
RFFF. Functional outcomes including nutritional mode, range of liquids and 
solids, and speech understandability were analyzed 1-year post-treatment.
RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were included in this analysis, 41 of whom had 
neurotized flaps (49%). No significant differences in demographic or clinical 
variables were seen between the neurotized and non-neurotized groups. On 
multivariate analysis controlling for BMI, flap area, and N-classification, 
patients with neurotized flaps were significantly more likely to have normal 
range of liquids and solids and less likely to have a G-tube.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurotization of RFFF reconstructing hemiglossectomy defects 
results in decreased G-tube dependence and improved range of liquids and solids."
54,"Imidazole (IM) and salicylic acid (SA) have a significant class among the 
medical compound. These are widely used as topical drugs like antifungal, 
antibacterial, anticancer, immunosuppressive agent, etc. These two bioactive 
organic moieties are combined by a weak hydrogen bond formed by hydrogen 
transfer. The charge transfer (CT) complex of acceptor (SA) and donor (IM), has 
been synthesized at room temperature in methanol and confirmed by signal-crystal 
XRD, conductance and UV-visible spectroscopy. The X-ray crystallography provides 
the original structural information of CT complex and displays the existence of 
N+-H--O- bond between IM and SA. The physical properties such as (ECT), (RN), 
(ID), (f), (D) and (Δ G0) along with molar extinction coefficient (εCT) and 
formation constant (KCT) were estimated through UV-visible spectroscopy. Job's 
method and Benesi-Hildebrand equation suggested 1:1 stoichiometry of 
([IM]+[SA]-). The results indicate a complete transfer of hydrogen atom and CT 
complex formation with 1:1 molar ratio of IM and SA. Antimicrobial activity was 
veiled against different bacteria like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and 
Staphylococcus aureus; and different fungi as Fusarium oxysporum, Candida 
albicans and Aspergillus niger by disc diffusion method. CT complex was also 
tested for cytotoxic activity against lung cancer cell lines in comparison to 
breast cancer cell lines. Molecular docking provides the information of binding 
of [(IM)+(SA)-] with the cancer marker (1M17), which has substantial application 
for drug designing. The investigational studies were supplemented through 
time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) using basis set 
B3LYP/6-311G**. Through DFT calculations, HOMO→LUMO electronic energy gap (ΔE) 
was obtained."
55,"BACKGROUND: Cell and gene therapies promise durable benefits but face financial 
challenges from the uncertainty in their performance. Value-based purchasing 
arrangements (VBPAs) can address uncertainty but have been inhibited in the US 
by the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) approach to determining Medicaid Best 
Price (MBP) rebates. The likely effectiveness of MDRP reform proposals enabling 
VBPAs is examined in this study for durable cell and gene therapies.
METHODS: Monte Carlo simulations examined three potential reforms (Multiple Best 
Prices, Bundled Sales, and National Pooling) to determine the impact on payment 
misalignment, the required payer size to participate, and the percentage of 
total lives covered by a VBPA.
RESULTS: Simulation results suggest that 11% to 54% of commercial US lives would 
be feasibly covered by a VBPA depending on reform type and condition size. MPB 
reform achieved the highest commercial contracted percentage and lowest 
misalignment for commercial payers compared to National Pooling and Bundled 
Sales. State Medicaid plan results suggest lower extreme misalignment across all 
successfully contracted instances than commercial payers.
CONCLUSIONS: The Multiple Best Prices will likely enable VBPAs for many durable 
cell and gene therapies and larger payers. Further reforms may be needed to 
extend VBPAs to ultra-orphan conditions."
56,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a widespread mycotoxin in food and feed. Although the 
liver is the main target organ of AFB1, the intestine is the first exposure 
organ to AFB1. However, the mechanism by which AFB1 induced intestinal barrier 
dysfunction via regulating the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated myosin light 
chain kinase (MLCK) signaling pathway has rarely been studied. In vivo, AFB1 
exposure significantly decreased the small intestine length and increased the 
intestinal permeability. Meanwhile, AFB1 exposure markedly suppressed the 
protein expressions of FXR, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 and enhanced the 
protein expression of MLCK. In vitro, AFB1 exposure induced intestinal barrier 
dysfunction by the elevation in the FITC-Dextran 4 kDa flux and inhibition in 
the transepithelial electrical resistance in a dose-dependent manner. In 
addition, AFB1 exposure downregulated the mRNA and protein expressions of FXR, 
ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1, redistributed the ZO-1 protein, and enhanced the 
protein expressions of MLCK and p-MLC. However, fexaramine (Fex, FXR agonist) 
pretreatment markedly reversed the AFB1-induced FXR activity reduction, MLCK 
protein activation, and intestinal barrier impairment in vitro and in vivo. 
Moreover, pretreatment with the inhibition of MLCK with ML-7 significantly 
alleviated the AFB1-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and tight junction 
disruption in vitro. In conclusion, AFB1 induced intestinal barrier impairment 
via regulating the FXR-mediated MLCK signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo and 
provided novel insights to prevent mycotoxin poisoning in the intestine."
57,"Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) is an exceptionally rare type of breast carcinoma 
with a low-grade morphology and a favorable prognosis. It is postulated to be a 
type of invasive carcinoma arising in microglandular adenosis (MGA). We report a 
case of extensively spreading ACC of the breast with MGA-like features. 
Macroscopically, yellowish nodules were widely distributed throughout the right 
breast, up to the axilla, without mass formation. Microscopically, the tumor 
consisted of two distinct carcinoma components: one was multiple nodular lesions 
showing invasive carcinoma with fused solid nests, and the other was a widely 
spreading lesion exhibiting MGA-like features with uniform small single glands. 
Immunohistochemically, both components were negative for ER, PR, and HER2, and 
expressed EMA, S100 and lysozyme. The distinct morphology and molecular 
expression indicated ACC. The single glands in the MGA-like area lacked 
myoepithelial cells but were linearly surrounded by type IV collagen, a basement 
membrane component. This case supports the hypothesis that ACC and MGA have the 
same lineage and indicates that ACC is not necessarily a low-grade malignancy 
and can be aggressive."
58,"In plant cell walls, the hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) such as 
extensin contain oligoarabinofuranoside linked to a hydroxyproline (Hyp) 
residue. The mature arabinooligosaccharide was revealed to be a tetrasaccharide 
(α-L-Araf-(1->3)-β-L-Araf-(1->2)-β-L-Araf-(1->2)-β-L-Araf, L-Araf4), whose 
linkages are targets of the bifidobacterial and Xanthomonas 
arabinooligosaccharide-degrading enzymes (Figure 1). The L-Araf4 motif was 
cleaved by GH43 α-L-arabinofuranosidase (Arafase) and converted to an 
L-Araf3-linked structure. The latter is then cleaved by GH121 
β-L-arabinobiosidase (HypBA2), producing β-L-Araf-(1->2)-L-Ara 
(β-L-arabinobiose) and the mono-β-L-Araf linked to the HRGP backbone. In 
bifidobacteria, the β-L-arabinobiose is then hydrolyzed by GH127 β-L-Arafase 
(Bll1HypBA1), a mechanistically unique cysteine glycosidase. We recently 
identified its distantly related homologue from Xanthomonas euvesicatoria as 
GH146 β-L-Arafase along with the paralogues from Bifidobacterium longum, one of 
which, Bll4HypBA1 (BLLJ_0089), can degrade L-Araf1-Hyp in a way similarly to 
that of GH146. Since the chemical synthesis of extensin hydrophilic motif 1a 
(Figure 2), which possesses three distinct linkages that connect four oligoAraf 
residues [Hyp(L-Arafn) (n = 4, 3, 1)] was achieved previously, we precisely 
monitored the step-wise enzymatic cleavage in addition to potato lectin. The 
results unequivocally revealed that this enzyme specifically degrades the 
Hyp(L-Araf1) motif."
59,"OBJECTIVE: Despite successful endovascular therapy, a proportion of stroke 
patients exhibit long-term functional decline, regardless of the cortical 
reperfusion. Our objective was to evaluate the early activation of the adaptive 
immune response and its impact on neurological recovery in patients with large 
vessel occlusion (LVO).
METHODS: Nineteen (13 females, 6 males) patients with acute LVO were enrolled in 
a single-arm prospective cohort study. During endovascular therapy (EVT), blood 
samples were collected from pre and post-occlusion, distal femoral artery, and 
median cubital vein (controls). Cytokines, chemokines, cellular and functional 
profiles were evaluated with immediate and follow-up clinical and radiographic 
parameters, including cognitive performance and functional recovery.
RESULTS: In the hyperacute phase (within hours), adaptive immune activation was 
observed in the post-occlusion intra-arterial environment (post). Ischemic 
vascular tissue had a significant increase in T-cell-related cytokines, 
including IFN-γ and MMP-9, while GM-CSF, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-1a, and MIP-1b 
were decreased. Cellularity analysis revealed an increase in inflammatory IL-17+ 
and GM-CSF+ helper T-cells, while natural killer (NK), monocytes and B-cells 
were decreased. A correlation was observed between hypoperfused tissue, infarct 
volume, inflammatory helper, and cytotoxic T-cells. Moreover, helper and 
cytotoxic T-cells were also significantly increased in patients with improved 
motor function at 3 months.
INTERPRETATION: We provide evidence of the activation of the inflammatory 
adaptive immune response during the hyperacute phase and the association of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines with greater ischemic tissue and worsening recovery 
after successful reperfusion. Further characterization of these immune pathways 
is warranted to test selective immunomodulators during the early stages of 
stroke rehabilitation."
60,"BACKGROUND: The mechanism of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma 
transcript 1 (Malat1) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is still unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-141-3p and Malat1 in 
autophagy in TNBC under hypoxia.
METHOD: The expression levels of Malat1 and miR-141-3p were detected via 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein 
expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), HIF-2α, MMP9, p62 and 
LC3 were determined via western blotting. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used 
to detect cell viability, while a Transwell assay to detect cell proliferation 
and invasion. A luciferase assay was used to confirm the relationship between 
Malat1 and miR-141-3p.
RESULTS: A significant increase was observed in the expression level of Malat1 
and the autophagic activity in TNBC tissues and cells. The expression level of 
Malat1 was higher in a hypoxic environment, which can significantly promote the 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells by activating autophagy. 
HIF-1α, but not HIF-2α, was identified to induce the upregulation of Malat1 in 
TNBC cells. The dual-luciferase assay results identified a miR-141-binding site 
in Malat1. Malat1 knockdown and miR-141-3p overexpression were demonstrated to 
significantly inhibit autophagy, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation, 
invasion, and migration. Moreover, hypoxia can inhibit the effect of miR-141-3p 
on TNBC cells.
CONCLUSION: miR-141-3p could suppress autophagy and inhibit proliferation, 
migration, and invasion by targeting Malat1 in TNBC cells under hypoxia. The 
existence of the HIF-1α/Malat1/miR-141 axis plays a vital role in the 
development of TNBC and may be a target for the diagnosis and treatment of TNBC."
61,"The human lifespan is increasing, and mankind is aging. It is estimated that, 
until the year 2050, this population worldwide will reach 22% of the total world 
population. Along with aging, the human immunologic system changes, a process 
called immunosenescence or even inflammaging. The aging immune system increases 
mortality and morbidity in the elderly mainly because it loses its capacity to 
react against internal and external aggressions. There is a decrease in B and T 
lymphocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes lose the CD28 protein expression that is needed 
for co-stimulation, leading to reduced response to viral infections. This could 
be responsible for more deleterious consequences of coronavirus disease 
infection in the elderly. Besides that, the human brain ages, being more 
susceptible to damage and viral infections, such as COVID-19 infection. There 
are several pathways that could explain the susceptibility to the COVID-19 
infection in the elderly brain, one of them is binding to ACE 2 receptors in 
cerebral cells through the spike protein. It has been reported that glial cells 
and neurons, in addition to endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells in the 
brain, express the ACE 2 receptor, which would justify the neurological symptoms 
and consequences of the disease. This infection can have several clinical 
manifestations such as hemorrhagic stroke, delirium and long-term cognitive 
complaints, such as brain fog, polyneuropathies, short time memory complaints 
and insomnia. Although none of the studies could prove that there is a long-term 
neuronal damage, there are clinical sequelae that should be taken into account 
and more studies are necessary to know the consequences of the infection in the 
elderly brain."
62,"BACKGROUND: Onychomatricoma (OM) is a rare nail unit tumor with a characteristic 
presentation of fingerlike projections arising from the nail matrix. Due to the 
lack of transcriptome information, the mechanisms underlying its development are 
largely unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize molecular features involved in the disease 
pathogenesis.
METHODS: Digital spatial profiling (DSP) was conducted in 2 cases of OM and 
normal control nail units. Based on the histological evaluation, we selectively 
profiled 69 regions of interest covering epithelial and stromal compartments of 
each tissue section. Dermoscopic and histopathologic findings were reviewed in 6 
cases. Single-cell RNA sequencing of nail units and DSP were combined to define 
cell type contributions of OM.
RESULTS: We identified 173 genes upregulated in stromal compartments of OM 
compared to onychodermis, specialized nail mesenchyme. Gene ontology analysis of 
the upregulated genes suggested the role of Wnt pathway activation in OM 
pathogenesis. We also found PLA2G2A, a known modulator of Wnt signaling, is 
strongly and specifically expressed in the OM stroma. The potential role of Wnt 
pathway was further supported by strong nuclear localization of β-catenin in OM. 
Compared to the nail matrix epithelium, only a few genes were increased in OM 
epithelium. Deconvolution of nail unit cell types showed that onychofibroblasts 
are the dominant cell-type in OM stroma.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated spatial and single-cell multi-omics concluded that OM is 
a tumor that derives a significant proportion of its origin from 
onychofibroblasts and is associated with upregulation of Wnt signals, which play 
a key role in the disease pathogenesis."
63,"Single-cell sequencing has scientific impacts on better understanding the 
immunity. There is a rapid development in single cell-based databases and 
analytic tools to provide the potential of clinical and translational discovery. 
The understanding of single-cell based immunity needs a strong program and solid 
evidence of preclinical and clinical validation and evaluation. The current 
special topic issue on single cell and immunity aimed to provide a strong 
communication for the progress of single cell-based studies on immune cell 
functional diversity in development and disease. The topic has a clear scope on 
the application of single cell sequencing to better understand immune cell 
heterogeneities, functions, cell-cell interactions, responses and regulatory 
roles in systems immunology and diseases."
64,"AIMS: For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving neoadjuvant 
therapy, the major pathologic response (MPR) is defined as the percentage of 
residual viable tumor cells (%RVT) in the tumor bed of no more than 10%. It has 
been proposed as a predictor of survival in neoadjuvant therapy-treated cohorts. 
Nonetheless, the significance of %RVT in the pathological assessment of lung 
adenocarcinoma cohorts remains undetermined.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Overall, 152 lung adenocarcinoma patients were included in 
this retrospective study, among whom 67 received neoadjuvant targeted therapy 
and 85 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Clinicopathological characteristics, 
neoadjuvant treatment response, and survival status were investigated. The 
routinely adopted standard for MPR (%RVT ≤10%) failed to differentiate prognosis 
in the lung adenocarcinoma population. For the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort, 
the optimal %RVT cutoff value of RFS was 60%. However, this cutoff value was 
clinically insignificant in the neoadjuvant targeted therapy cohort. Hence, for 
these patients, we built a nomogram model including high-grade patterns and ypN 
stage to predict disease recurrence, demonstrating a high efficacy (a 
bootstrap-corrected C-index of 0.731).
CONCLUSIONS: %RVT served as a strong indicator of the prognosis of lung 
adenocarcinoma in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy but not 
neoadjuvant targeted therapy. Residual high-grade pathological patterns might 
substitute MPR in prognostic evaluation of lung adenocarcinoma post-targeted 
therapy."
65,"The glucocorticoid stress hormones affect brain function via high-affinity 
mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and lower-affinity glucocorticoid receptors 
(GRs). MR and GR not only differ in affinity for ligands, but also have 
distinct, sometimes opposite, actions on neuronal excitability and other 
cellular and higher-order parameters related to cerebral function. GR and MR 
messenger RNA (mRNA) levels are often used as a proxy for the responsiveness to 
glucocorticoids, assuming proportionality between mRNA and protein levels. This 
may be especially relevant for the MR, which because of its high affinity is 
already largely occupied at low basal (trough) hormone levels. Here we explore 
how GR and MR mRNA levels are associated with the expression of a shared target 
gene, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ, coded by Tsc22d3) with basal 
and elevated levels of corticosterone in male mice, using in situ hybridization. 
Depending on the hippocampal subfield and the corticosterone levels, mRNA levels 
of MR rather than GR mostly correlated with GILZ mRNA in the hippocampus and 
hypothalamus at the bulk tissue level. At the individual cell level, these 
correlations were much weaker. Using publicly available single-cell RNA 
sequencing data, we again observed that MR and GR mRNA levels were only weakly 
correlated with target gene expression in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. 
We conclude that MR mRNA levels can be limiting for receptor action, but many 
other cell-specific and region-specific factors ultimately determine 
corticosteroid receptor action. Altogether, our results argue for caution while 
interpreting the consequences of changed receptor expression for the response to 
glucocorticoids."
66,"C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) is a cytosolic tyrosine-protein kinase with an 
important role in regulating critical cellular decisions, such as cellular 
apoptosis, survival, proliferation, cytoskeletal organization and many others. 
Current knowledge on the CSK mechanisms of action, regulation and functions is 
still at an early stage, most of CSK's known actions and functions being 
mediated by the negative regulation of the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (SFKs) 
through phosphorylation. As SFKs play a vital role in apoptosis, cell 
proliferation and survival regulation, SFK inhibition by CSK has a pro-apoptotic 
effect, which is mediated by the inhibition of cellular signaling cascades 
controlled by SFKs, such as the MAPK/ERK, STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. 
Abnormal functioning of CSK and SFK activation can lead to diseases such as 
cancer, cardiovascular and neurological manifestations. This review describes 
apoptosis regulation by CSK, CSK inhibition of the SFKs and further explores the 
clinical relevance of CSK in important pathologies, such as cancer, autoimmune, 
autoinflammatory, neurologic diseases, hypertension and HIV/AIDS."
67,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the common cancers in males and its 
incidence keeps increasing globally. Approximately 81% of PCa is diagnosed 
during the early stage of the disease. The treatment options for prostate care 
include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, but these treatments often have 
side effects that may lead to issues such as impotence or decreased bowel 
function. Our central goal is to test the apoptotic effects of Vernonia 
amygdalina Delile (an edible medicinal plant that is relatively inexpensive, 
nontoxic, and virtually without side effects) for the prevention of PCa using 
human adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells as a test model.
METHODS: To address our central goal, PC-3 cells were treated with Vernonia 
amygdalina Delile (VAD). Cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were evaluated by 
Flow Cytometry assessment. Nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected by agarose 
gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: Flow cytometry data showed that VAD induced cell cycle arrest at the 
G0/G1 checkpoint and significantly upregulated caspase-3 in treated cells 
compared to the control cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis resulted in the 
formation of DNA ladders in VAD-treated cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inhibition of cancer cell growth, 
induction of cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis through caspase-3 activation and 
nucleosomal DNA fragmentation are involved in the therapeutic mechanisms of VAD 
as a candidate drug towards the prevention and/or treatment of PCa."
68,"Due to low incidence, there are no large prospective studies or clinical trials 
for small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the genitourinary system (GU), and most data 
are extrapolated from SCC of the lung. Using the SEER database, we analyzed 
incidence trends, overall survival, and cancer-specific survival using the 
log-rank test. Analysis of variables was performed using the Cox proportional 
hazards regression model. The analysis showed that SCC of the bladder and 
prostate were the most common types of GU SCC, with 1836 and 606 cases, 
respectively. In 2018, the incidence of SCC of the bladder and prostate was 
twice that of 2010 (P < 0.001). The overall survival and cancer-specific 
survival of patients with SCC of the bladder were significantly longer than 
those of patients with SCC of the prostate (P < 0.0001). SCC bladder patients 
with advanced age, more extensive growth, lymph node involvement, no surgical 
intervention, and the presence of the metastasis had worse survival outcomes 
(P < 0.05). The Asian/Pacific Islander race provided some survival benefits for 
patients with SCC of the bladder (P < 0.05). For patients with SCC of the 
prostate, only advanced age was a risk factor for poor outcomes (P < 0.05)."
69,"Cutaneous metastasis as the presenting sign of lung cancer is rare, with a poor 
prognosis and a life expectancy of 3 to 5 months. We present the complicated 
course of a 60-year-old woman with extensive metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer that presented as a back cyst. Due to the benign appearance of the cyst 
and the difficulty discovering the location of the primary malignancy, diagnosis 
and treatment were delayed. Unfortunately, once aggressive treatment was 
initiated at the request of the patient, she died 2 weeks later. This case 
highlights the importance of recognizing cutaneous lesions as a sign of internal 
malignancy and emphasizes multidisciplinary discussion that focuses on the 
patient's quality of life."
70,"Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm that accounts for 10% of all 
hematologic malignancies, characterized by malignant proliferation of monoclonal 
plasma cells in the bone marrow. It predominantly affects men 60 to 70 years of 
age. Plasmacytoma is a discrete mass of neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells that 
may be osseous or extramedullary. Though extramedullary plasmacytomas are 
uncommon, they can involve any tissue or organ. Only a few cases of pancreatic 
involvement have been reported. We report a case of a 78-year-old woman with a 
long-standing history of multiple myeloma noted to have pancreatic tail 
involvement with plasmacytoma with plasmablastic features. Multiple myeloma with 
plasmablastic transformation has a poor prognosis; hence, a multidisciplinary 
team approach is crucial to identify and initiate appropriate management in 
these cases."
71,"Systemic mastocytosis results from the spread of abnormal mast cells in 
different parts of the body, with variable clinical presentation. It is 
difficult to diagnose and to determine the appropriate therapy regimen. We 
present a case of a 53-year-old man diagnosed with KIT-negative advanced 
systemic mastocytosis based on the 2016 World Health Organization criteria. The 
patient presented with widespread symptoms that continued to worsen despite 
supportive therapy and traditional tyrosine kinase inhibitors. He was ultimately 
started on avapritinib, which reduced his tryptase level and provided 
symptomatic relief many years after his diagnosis."
72,"CONTEXT: Outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are reported inconsistently, 
with variability in definitions and measurement. Hence, it is difficult to 
compare intervention effectiveness and synthesise outcomes for systematic 
reviews and to create clinical practice guidelines. This uncertainty in the 
evidence makes it difficult to guide patient-clinician decision-making. One 
solution is a core outcome set (COS): an agreed minimum set of outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To describe outcome reporting, definitions, and measurement 
heterogeneity as the first stage in co-creating a COS for localised renal 
cancer.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically reviewed outcome reporting heterogeneity 
in effectiveness trials and observational studies in localised RCC. In total, 
2822 studies (randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control 
studies, systematic reviews) up to June 2020 meeting our inclusion criteria were 
identified. Abstracts and full texts were screened independently by two 
reviewers; in cases of disagreement, a third reviewer arbitrated. Data 
extractions were double-checked.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We included 149 studies and found that there was 
inconsistency in which outcomes were reported across studies and variability in 
the definitions used for outcomes that were conceptually the same. We structured 
our analysis using the outcome classification taxonomy proposed by Dodd et al. 
Outcomes linked to adverse events (eg, bleeding, outcomes linked to surgery) and 
renal injury outcomes (reduced renal function) were reported most commonly. 
Outcomes related to deaths from any cause and from cancer were reported in 44% 
and 25% of studies, respectively, although the time point for measurement and 
the analysis methods were inconsistent. Outcomes linked to life impact (eg, 
global quality of life) were reported least often. Clinician-reported outcomes 
are more frequently reported than patient-reported outcomes in the renal cancer 
literature.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review underscores the heterogeneity of outcome 
reporting, definitions, and measurement in research on localised renal cancer. 
It catalogues the variety of outcomes and serves as a first step towards the 
development of a COS for localised renal cancer.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed studies on localised kidney cancer and found that 
multiple terms and definitions have been used to describe outcomes. These are 
not defined consistently, and often not defined at all. Our review is the first 
phase in developing a core outcome set to allow better comparisons of studies to 
improve medical care."
73,"PURPOSE: Head and neck (HN) radiation (RT) treatment planning is complex and 
resource intensive. Deviations and inconsistent plan quality significantly 
affect clinical outcomes. We sought to develop a novel automated virtual 
integrative (AVI) knowledge-based planning application to reduce planning time, 
increase consistency, and improve baseline quality.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: An in-house write-enabled script was developed from a 
library of 668 previously treated HN RT plans. Prospective hazard analysis was 
performed, and mitigation strategies were implemented before clinical release. 
The AVI-planner software was retrospectively validated in a cohort of 52 recent 
HN cases. A physician panel evaluated planning limitations during initial 
deployment, and feedback was enacted via software refinements. A final second 
set of plans was generated and evaluated. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in addition to 
generalized evaluation metric and weighted experience score were used to compare 
normal tissue sparing between final AVI planner versus respective clinically 
treated and historically accepted plans. A t test was used to compare the 
interactive time, complexity, and monitor units for AVI planner versus manual 
optimization.
RESULTS: Initially, 86% of plans were acceptable to treat, with 10% minor and 4% 
major revisions or rejection recommended. Variability was noted in plan quality 
among HN subsites, with high initial quality for oropharynx and oral cavity 
plans. Plans needing revisions were comprised of sinonasal, nasopharynx, P-16 
negative squamous cell carcinoma unknown primary, or cutaneous primary sites. 
Normal tissue sparing varied within subsites, but AVI planner significantly 
lowered mean larynx dose (median, 18.5 vs 19.7 Gy; P < .01) compared with 
clinical plans. AVI planner significantly reduced interactive optimization time 
(mean, 2 vs 85 minutes; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: AVI planner reliably generated clinically acceptable RT plans for 
oral cavity, salivary, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx cancers. 
Physician-driven iterative learning processes resulted in favorable evolution in 
HN RT plan quality with significant time savings and improved consistency using 
AVI planner."
74,"PURPOSE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a deadly malignancy that is 
frequently diagnosed in patients with significant medical comorbidities. When 
delivering local and regional therapy, an exceedingly narrow therapeutic window 
is encountered, which often precludes patients from receiving aggressive 
curative therapy. Radiation therapy advances including particle therapy have 
been employed in an effort to expand this therapeutic window. Here we report 
outcomes with the use of proton therapy with curative intent and immunotherapy 
to treat patients diagnosed with high-risk NSCLC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were determined to be high risk if they had 
severe underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction, history of prior thoracic 
radiation therapy, and/or large volume or unfavorable location of disease (eg, 
bilateral hilar involvement, supraclavicular involvement). As such, patients 
were determined to be ineligible for conventional x-ray-based radiation therapy 
and were treated with pencil beam scanning proton beam therapy (PBS-PBT). 
Patients who demonstrated excess respiratory motion (ie, greater than 1 cm in 
any dimension noted on the 4-dimensional computed tomography simulation scan) 
were deemed to be ineligible for PBT. Toxicity was reported using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Overall survival 
and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 29 patients with high-risk NSCLC diagnoses were treated with 
PBS-PBT. The majority (55%) of patients were defined as high risk due to severe 
cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Most commonly, patients were treated definitively 
to a total dose of 6000 cGy (relative biological effectiveness) in 30 fractions 
with concurrent chemotherapy. Overall, there were a total of 6 acute grade 3 
toxicities observed in our cohort. Acute high-grade toxicities included 
esophagitis (n = 4, 14%), dyspnea (n = 1, 3.5%), and cough (n = 1, 3.5%). No 
patients developed grade 4 or higher toxicity. The majority of patients went on 
to receive immunotherapy, and high-grade pneumonitis was rare. Two-year 
progression-free and overall survival was estimated to be 51% and 67%, 
respectively. COVID-19 was confirmed or suspected to be responsible for 2 
patient deaths during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Radical PBS-PBT treatment delivered in a cohort of patients with 
high-risk lung cancer with immunotherapy is feasible with careful 
multidisciplinary evaluation and rigorous follow-up."
75,"INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) is an important treatment 
modality in metastatic NSCLC and management of immunotherapy-related adverse 
effects (irAEs) can be challenging. Retreatment after discontinuation of ICI 
because of irAEs is a frequent clinical dilemma with limited available data.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational study reviewed the 
clinical course of 30 patients with metastatic NSCLC in whom ICI had to be 
discontinued owing to a serious irAE after an initial objective response to 
therapy.
RESULTS: After ICI discontinuation, 14 patients (47%) developed a durable 
response of more than 6 months, seven patients (23%) developed oligoprogression 
treated with local radiotherapy leading to disease control, six patients (20%) 
had progression of disease within 6 months, and three patients (10%) died owing 
to a severe irAE.
CONCLUSIONS: A watchful waiting approach is justified after discontinuation of 
ICI owing to irAEs in patients with metastatic NSCLC with an initial response to 
therapy."
76,"Extracellular vesicles (EV) as drug delivery nanocarriers are under intense 
investigation. Although clinical-grade EVs have been produced on a large-scale, 
low yield and high production costs of natural EVs (nEV) limit the relevant 
industrial translation. Recent studies show that mechanical extrusion of cells 
can generate nEV-like cell-derived nanovesicles (CNV) which can also be used as 
drug nanocarriers. Moreover, in comparison with nEVs, CNVs have similar 
physicochemical properties. Nevertheless, a comprehensive comparison of cargo 
between nEVs and CNVs has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the aim of this 
study is to profile and compare CNVs to nEVs. Our results show that no 
significant difference was found in size, morphology, and classical markers 
between nEVs and CNVs derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. Protein sequencing data 
reveals the similarity of membrane proteins between the two groups was ~71%, 
while it was ~21% when pertaining to total protein cargo. Notably, a high 
similarity of membrane proteins was also found between nEVs and CNVs derived 
from eight additional cancer cell lines. Moreover, analysis of the top 1000 
small RNAs with RNA sequencing showed a ~65% similarity between the two groups. 
Altogether, we infer from the high similarity of membrane proteins and small RNA 
cargo that CNVs can be a good substitute for nEVs. In brief, our findings 
support previous studies with a notion that CNVs yield comparable performance 
with nEVs and could pave the way for clinical implementation of CNV-based 
therapeutics in the future."
77,"Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient, and deficiency of available Fe is one 
of the most important limiting factors for plant growth. In some species 
including Medicago truncatula, iron deficiency results in accumulation of 
riboflavin, a response associated with iron acquisition. However, how the 
plant's Fe status is integrated to tune riboflavin biosynthesis and how 
riboflavin levels affect iron acquisition and utilization remains largely 
unexplored. We report that protein kinase CIPK12 regulates ferric reduction by 
accumulation of riboflavin and its derivatives in roots of M. truncatula via 
physiological and molecular characterization of its mutants and over-expressing 
materials. Mutations in CIPK12 enhance iron accumulation and improve 
photosynthetic efficiency, whereas over-expression of CIPK12 shows the opposite 
phenotypes. The Calcineurin B-like proteins CBL3 and CBL8 interact with CIPK12, 
which negatively regulates the expression of genes encoding key enzymes in the 
riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. CIPK12 negatively regulates iron acquisition by 
suppressing accumulation of riboflavin and its derivatives in roots, which in 
turn influences ferric reduction activity by riboflavin-dependent electron 
transport under iron deficiency. Our findings uncover a new regulatory mechanism 
by which CIPK12 regulates riboflavin biosynthesis and iron-deficiency responses 
in plants. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
78,"Evidence that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease is already un-ravelling. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a 
bidirectional communication system that is not fully understood but includes 
neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. The progression of 
Alzheimer's disease is supported by mechanisms related to the imbalance in the 
gut microbiota and the development of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are at 
the origin of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in the composition of the gut 
microbiome led to dysregulation in the pathways governing this system. This 
leads to neurodegeneration through neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter 
dysregulation. Neurodegeneration and disruption of the blood-brain barrier are 
frontiers at the origin of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, bacteria populating 
the gut microbiota can secrete large amounts of amyloid proteins and 
lipopolysaccharides, which modulate signaling pathways and alter the production 
of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the pathogenesis of Alz-heimer's 
disease. Importantly, through molecular mimicry, bacterial amyloids may elicit 
cross-seeding of misfolding and induce microglial priming at different levels of 
the brain-gut-microbiota axis. The potential mechanisms of amyloid spreading 
include neuron-to-neuron or distal neuron spreading, direct blood-brain barrier 
crossing, or via other cells such as astrocytes, fibroblasts, microglia, and 
immune system cells. Gut microbiota metabolites, including short-chain fatty 
acids, pro-inflammatory factors, and neurotransmitters may also affect AD 
pathogenesis and associated cognitive decline. The purpose of this review is to 
summarize and discuss the current findings that may elucidate the role of gut 
microbiota in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the 
underlying mechanisms may provide new insights into novel therapeutic strategies 
for Alzheimer's disease, such as probiotics and targeted oligosaccharides."
79,"BACKGROUND: Despite the implementation of various cancer therapies, adequate 
therapeutic efficacy has not been achieved. A growing number of studies have 
been dedicated to the discovery of new molecules to combat refractory cancer 
cells efficiently. Recently, the use of a rare type of sugar, D-allose, has 
attracted the attention of research communities. In combination with the 
first-line treatment of cancers, including different types of radiotherapies and 
chemotherapies, D-allose has been detected with favorable complementary effects. 
Understanding the mechanism of therapeutic target molecules will enable us to 
develop new strategies for cancer patients that do not currently respond to the 
present therapies.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide a review of the effects of D-allose in cancer 
treatment, its mechanisms of action, and gaps in this field that require more 
investigations.
DISCUSSION: With rare exceptions, in many cancer types, including head and neck, 
lung, liver, bladder, blood, and breast, D-allose consistently has exhibited 
anticancer activity in vitro and/or in vivo. Most of the D-allose functions are 
mediated through thioredoxin-interacting protein molecules. D-allose exerts its 
effects via reactive oxygen species regulation, cell cycle arrest, metabolic 
reprogramming, autophagy, apoptosis induction, and sensitizing tumors to 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: D-allose has shown great promise for combating tumor cells with no 
side effects, especially in combination with first-line drugs; however, its 
potential for cancer therapy has not been comprehensively investigated in vitro 
or in vivo."
80,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is one of the prevalent neurological disorders 
characterized by disrupted synchronization between inhibitory and excitatory 
neurons. Disturbed membrane potential due to abnormal regulation of 
neurotransmitters and ion transport across the neural cell membrane 
significantly contributes to the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Potassium ion 
channels (KCN) regulate the resting membrane potential and are involved in 
neuronal excitability. Genetic alterations in the potassium ion channels (KCN) 
have been reported to result in the enhancement of the release of 
neurotransmitters, the excitability of neurons, and abnormal rapid firing rate, 
which lead to epileptic phenotypes, making these ion channels a potential 
therapeutic target for epilepsy. The aim of this study is to explore the 
variations reported in different classes of potassium ion channels (KCN) in 
epilepsy patients, their functional evaluation, and therapeutic strategies to 
treat epilepsy targeting KCN.
METHODOLOGY: A review of all the relevant literature was carried out to compile 
this article.
RESULT: A large number of variations have been reported in different genes 
encoding various classes of KCN. These genetic alterations in KCN have been 
shown to be responsible for disrupted firing properties of neurons. 
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the main therapeutic strategy to treat epilepsy. 
Some patients do not respond favorably to the AEDs treatment, resulting in 
pharmacoresistant epilepsy.
CONCLUSION: Further to address the challenges faced in treating epilepsy, recent 
approaches like optogenetics, chemogenetics, and genome editing, such as 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), are emerging 
as target-specific therapeutic strategies."
81,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Periodontium is an important tooth-supporting tissue 
composed of both hard (alveolar bone and cementum) and soft (gingival and 
periodontal ligament) sections. Due to the multi-tissue architecture of 
periodontium, reconstruction of each part can be influenced by others. This 
review focuses on the bone section of the periodontium and presents the 
materials used in tissue engineering scaffolds for its reconstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following databases (2015 to 2021) were 
electronically searched: ProQuest, EMBASE, SciFinder, MRS Online Proceedings 
Library, Medline, and Compendex. The search was limited to English-language 
publications and in vivo studies.
RESULTS: Eighty-three articles were found in primary searching. After applying 
the inclusion criteria, seventeen articles were incorporated into this study.
CONCLUSIONS: In complex periodontal defects, various types of scaffolds, 
including multilayered ones, have been used for the functional reconstruction of 
different parts of periodontium. While there are some multilayered scaffolds 
designed to regenerate alveolar bone/periodontal ligament/cementum tissues of 
periodontium in a hierarchically organized construct, no scaffold could so far 
consider all four tissues involved in a complete periodontal defect. The 
progress and material considerations in the regeneration of the bony part of 
periodontium are presented in this work to help investigators develop tissue 
engineering scaffolds suitable for complete periodontal regeneration."
82,"World Health Organization has reported an estimated 1.5 million deaths directly 
due to diabetes in 2019. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in its 
National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020, says that 1 in 10 United States 
residents has diabetes. This rapid progression of diabetes is noteworthy despite 
significant advances in the field of antidiabetic medicine. The critical 
challenges in treatment are dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. 
The latest research has also linked diabetes to carcinogenesis. The diabetic 
condition leads to the acceleration of cell growth, proliferation, migration, 
inflammation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and inhibition of apoptosis in cancer 
cells. In addition, diabetic complications of nephropathy, retinopathy, 
neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery 
disease, and stroke increase morbidity. Amidst all these challenges, a ray of 
hope is the advent of nanocarriers. The nano size helps in the targeted and 
controlled delivery of drugs. In addition, nanocarrier formulation helps in the 
delivery of acid-labile and enzyme-labile molecules, and plant-based 
macromolecules via the oral route. Its use in the form of dendrimers, ethosomes, 
niosomes, transfersomes, and polymeric nanoparticles is established. In 
addition, different polymers used to formulate nanocarriers are also established 
for targeting in diabetes. Thus, this review aims to compile approaches 
involving the use of nanocarriers for the betterment of pharmacotherapy of 
diabetes and to provide a way ahead for researchers in the field."

84,"Bioorthogonal catalysis mediated by Pd-based transition metal catalysts has 
sparked increasing interest in combating diseases. However, the catalytic and 
therapeutic efficiency of current Pd0 catalysts is unsatisfactory. Herein, 
inspired by the concept that ligands around metal sites could enable enzymes to 
catalyze astonishing reactions by changing their electronic environment, LM-Pd 
catalyst with liquid metal (LM) as an unusual modulator has been designed to 
realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for tumor inhibition. LM matrix can 
serve as a ""ligand"" to afford an electron-rich environment to stabilize the 
active Pd0 and promote nucleophilic turnover of the p-allylpalladium species to 
accelerate the uncaging process. Besides, the photothermal properties of LM can 
lead to the enhanced removal of tumor cells by photo-enhanced catalysis and 
photothermal effect. We believe that our work will broaden the application of LM 
and motivate the design of bioinspired bioorthogonal catalysts."
85,"RNF7 has been reported to play critical roles in various cancers. However, the 
underlying mechanisms of RNF7 in glioma development remain largely unknown. 
Herein, the expression level of RNF7 was examined in tissues by quantitative 
real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The effect of RNF7 on 
glioma progression was measured by performing CCK-8 and apoptosis assays, cell 
cycle-related experiments and animal experiments. The effect of RNF7 on PI3K/AKT 
signalling pathway was tested by Western blotting. First, we found that RNF7 was 
upregulated in tumour tissue compared with normal brain tissue, especially in 
high-grade glioma, and the high expression of RNF7 was significantly related to 
tumour size, Karnofsky Performance Scale score and a poor prognosis. Second, 
RNF7 overexpression facilitated tumour cell cycle progression and cell 
proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. Conversely, RNF7 knockdown suppressed 
tumour cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and facilitated apoptosis. 
Furthermore, follow-up mechanistic studies indicated that RNF7 could facilitate 
glioma cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and inhibit apoptosis by 
activating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. This study shows that RNF7 can 
clearly promote glioma cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression 
and inhibiting apoptosis by activating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. 
Targeting the RNF7/PI3K/AKT axis may provide a new perspective on the prevention 
or treatment of glioma."
86,"Among histone deacetylases, HDAC6 is unusual in its cytoplasmic localization. 
Its inhibition leads to hyperacetylation of non-histone proteins, inhibiting 
cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis. Ricolinostat (ACY-1215) is a selective 
inhibitor of the histone deacetylase HDAC6 with proven efficacy in the treatment 
of malignant diseases, but anaemia is one of the most frequent side effects. We 
investigated here the underlying mechanisms of this erythroid toxicity. We first 
confirmed that HDAC6 was strongly expressed at both RNA and protein levels in 
CD34+ -cells-derived erythroid progenitors. ACY-1215 exposure on CD34+ -cells 
driven in vitro towards the erythroid lineage led to a decreased cell count, an 
increased apoptotic rate and a delayed erythroid differentiation with 
accumulation of weakly hemoglobinized immature erythroblasts. This was 
accompanied by drastic changes in the transcriptomic profile of primary cells as 
shown by RNAseq. In erythroid cells, ACY-1215 and shRNA-mediated HDAC6 knockdown 
inhibited the EPO-dependent JAK2 phosphorylation. Using acetylome, we identified 
14-3-3ζ, known to interact directly with the JAK2 negative regulator LNK, as a 
potential HDAC6 target in erythroid cells. We confirmed that 14-3-3ζ was 
hyperacetylated after ACY-1215 exposure, which decreased the 14-3-3ζ/LNK 
interaction while increased LNK ability to interact with JAK2. Thus, in addition 
to its previously described role in the enucleation of mouse fetal liver 
erythroblasts, we identified here a new mechanism of HDAC6-dependent control of 
erythropoiesis through 14-3-3ζ acetylation level, LNK availability and finally 
JAK2 activation in response to EPO, which is crucial downstream of EPO-R 
activation for human erythroid cell survival, proliferation and differentiation."
87,"OBJECTIVES: Androgen receptor (AR) play a key role in the onset and progression 
of prostate cancer. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a polyphenolic compound 
and the active ingredient in green tea, which is involved in modulating gene 
expression through epigenetic alterations. Previous studies have shown that EGCG 
at low concentrations reduces the expression of AR and prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) in the LNCaP cell line of prostate cancer. In this study, the effect of 
higher EGCG concentrations on AR and PSA expression in LNCaP prostate cancer 
cell line was investigated.
METHODS: In this study, LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was used and after MTT 
test, concentrations of 40, 60 and 80 μg/mL EGCG were used for treatment. Then, 
the expression of AR and PSA genes was evaluated by RT-PCR. AR protein 
expression was also assessed by Western blotting.
RESULTS: The present study showed that treatment of LNCaPs cells by EGCG reduces 
cell proliferation. The IC50 value was 42.7 μg/mL under experimental conditions. 
It was also observed that EGCG at concentrations of 40 and 80 μg/mL increased 
the expression of AR and PSA (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the effect of EGCG on AR expression 
was different at different concentrations, so that unlike previous studies, 
higher concentrations of EGCG (80 and 40 μg/mL) increased AR and PSA expression. 
It seems that due to the toxic effects of EGCG in high concentrations on cancer 
cells and the possibility of its effect on normal cells, more caution should be 
exercised in its use."
88,"Bistortae Rhizoma (Quanshen), a dried rhizome of Polygonum bistorta L., is 
edited in Chinese Pharmacopiea as only one of species of Polygonum. There are 
many adulterants were used as Quanshen such as ""Eryeliao,"" ""Taipingyangliao"" and 
""Daogenliao"" because of its remarkable functions. Previous researches had shown 
that there were not significant differences among them. Therefore, it is 
necessary to conduct a comprehensive authentication of these herbs samples. 
Analyses of the microscopic features of the powders and transverse sections of 
herbs are the most significant measures of accreditation of the quality of 
traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, microscopic observation of powders 
of the herbs and cross-sectional tissues were performed by using common light 
microscopy, polarized light microscopy and combining PCA analysis to identify 
Quanshen and three adulterants. We found that calcium oxalate clusters can be a 
good microscopic marker index to distinguish Quabshen and Eryeliao. In addition, 
Quanshen and the other two can be further distinguished by the characteristics 
of cork layer cells and vascular bundles on transverse section of the rhizome. 
Our results showed that the approach, microscopic features and digital 
characterization, is efficient, convenient, and reliable."
89,"Unlike birds and mammals, many teleosts have homomorphic sex chromosomes and 
changes in the chromosome carrying the sex-determining locus, termed 
""turnovers"", are common. Recent turnovers allow studies of several interesting 
questions. One question is whether the new sex-determining regions evolve to 
become completely non-recombining, and if so, how and why. Another is to test 
the prediction that evolutionary changes that benefit one sex will accumulate in 
the newly sex-linked region. To study these questions, we analyzed the genome 
sequences of two seahorse species of the Syngnathidae, a fish group in which 
many species evolved a unique structure, the male brood pouch. We find that both 
seahorse species have XY sex chromosome systems, and their sex chromosome pairs 
are not homologs, implying that at least one turnover event has occurred. The 
Y-linked regions respectively occupy 63.9% and 95.1% of the entire chromosome of 
the two species, and do not exhibit extensive sequence divergence with their 
X-linked homologs. We find evidence for occasional recombination between the 
extant sex chromosomes that may account for their homomorphic pattern. We argue 
that these Y-linked regions did not evolve by recombination suppression after 
the turnover. Instead, it can be explained by the ancestral nature of low 
crossover rate at the corresponding chromosome location. With such an ancestral 
crossover landscape, a turnover can instantly create an extensive Y-linked 
region. Finally, we investigate the adaptive evolution of male pouch related

90,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in tumour 
initiation and progression. However, little is known about their contributions 
to p53-related bladder cancer (BC) inhibition.
METHODS: By using high-throughput sequencing, we screened the expression 
profiles of lncRNAs in BC and adjacent non-tumour tissues. The roles of a novel 
lncRNA, named LNPPS [a lncRNA for programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) and p53 
stability], were determined by gain- and loss-of-function assays. RNA pull-down 
followed by mass spectrometry analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation assays and other 
immunoprecipitation assays were performed to reveal the interactions among 
LNPPS, PDCD5 and p53, and the regulatory effect of LNPPS on the complex 
ubiquitination network comprising PDCD5, p53 and mouse double minute 2 homologue 
(MDM2).
RESULTS: LNPPS was downregulated in BC and markedly inhibited the viability of 
BC cells by inducing PDCD5/p53-related apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. 
Mechanistically, LNPPS, serving as a scaffold, connected PDCD5 and p53 with 
nucleotides (nt) located at 121-251 nt and 251-306 nt of LNPPS, respectively. 
This process allowed LNPPS to protect PDCD5 from proteasomal degradation by 
blocking its K20 site ubiquitination. On the other hand, the increased 
interaction between PDCD5 and p53 displaced p53 from the MDM2-p53 ubiquitination 
complex, resulting in an increase in p53 expression and related apoptosis 
levels. Moreover, LNPPS could induce the accumulation of PDCD5 and p53 in the 
nucleus and exert a synergistic effect on the prevention of protein degradation. 
In addition, we confirmed that the downregulation of LNPPS in BC was mediated by 
the decreased N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) modification.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight a novel cross-talk between LNPPS and the 
PDCD5/p53/MDM2 ubiquitination axis in BC development, indicating its potential 
as a therapeutic target for BC patients."
91,"Neutrophil elastase (NE) plays a key role in chronic inflammation and acute 
responses to infection and injury. Effective diseases interventions thus call 
for precise identification of NE to aid clinical application of such diseases. 
However, the detection process suffers from this interference of structural 
changes of NE. Herein, we introduce a molecular probe with high biocompatibility 
to overcome the interference, which was achieved by combining theoretical 
calculation and experimental that permits highly specific and sensitive 
detection of NE in cells and in vivo. The upregulated NE accumulation was 
specifically measured in inflammation by ratiometric photoacoustic and 
near-infrared fluorescence imaging, and providing a new method for developing 
more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes."
92,"BACKGROUND: Circumferential liposuction may cause a dilution anemia due to a 
high volume of infiltrated tumescent. Studies analyzing the percentage of 
absorbed tumescent as well as the safe limit of tumescent infiltration are 
currently lacking.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to calculate the average volume uptake of 
administered fluids in power-assisted liposuction. Furthermore, we sought to 
calculate a practical formula to determine the amount of fluid that can safely 
be administered without inducing symptomatic dilution anemia or hypervolemia.
METHODS: Patients undergoing circumferential liposuction with power-assisted 
tumescent infiltration were included in a prospective clinical study. All 
relevant administered and excreted volumes during and after the operation were 
collected. Preoperative versus postoperative hemogram results were compared and 
the hemodynamic parameters were followed for 24 hours. The average volume uptake 
was calculated based on the measured volumes, as well as the ratio between 
administered volumes and the patient's blood volume.
RESULTS: 30 patients were included during September 2021. The average volume 
uptake was 58% for a calculated 1.11 to 1 infiltration to aspiration ratio. 
There was a mean drop of 1.9 g/dl and 4.6% for the postoperative Hb and Hct, 
respectively, with a stable Red Blood Cell level. All patients remained 
hemodynamically stable without the need for blood transfusion or prolonged 
oxygen need. The average tumescent versus blood volume ratio was 85.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: In circumferential liposuction with power-assisted infiltration, 
the infiltrated tumescent volume should remain below 85% of the patient's blood 
volume to minimize the risk of a symptomatic dilution anemia or hypervolemia."
93,"The efficient and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst is of great 
significance to boost power generation and pollutant degradation in microbial 
fuel cells (MFCs). Although transition metal-nitrogen-codoped carbon materials 
are an important class of ORR catalysts, copper-nitrogen-codoped carbon is not 
considered a suitable MFC cathode catalyst due to the insufficient performance 
and especially instability. Herein, we report a three-dimensional (3D) 
hierarchical porous copper, nitrogen, and boron codoped carbon (3DHP Cu-N/B-C) 
catalyst synthesized by the dual template method. The introduced B atom as an 
electron donor increases the electron density around the Cu-Nx active site, 
which significantly promotes the efficiency of the ORR process and stabilizes 
the active site by preventing demetallization. Thus, the 3DHP Cu-N/B-C catalyst 
exhibited excellent ORR performance with the half-wave potential of 0.83 V (vs 
reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte and 0.68 V (vs 
RHE) in a 50 mM PBS electrolyte. Meanwhile, 3DHP Cu-N/B-C had satisfactory 
stability with 94.16% current retention after 24 h of chronoamperometry test, 
which is better than that of 20% Pt/C. The MFCs using 3DHP Cu-N/B-C not only 
showed a maximum power density of up to 760.14 ± 19.03 mW m-2 but also operating 
durability of more than 50 days. Moreover, the 16S rDNA sequencing results 
presented that the 3DHP Cu-N/B-C catalyst had a positive effect on the microbial 
community of the MFC with more anaerobic electroactive bacteria in the anode 
biofilm and fewer aerobic bacteria in the cathode biofilm. This study provides a 
new approach for the development of Cu-based ORR electrocatalysts as well as 
guidance for the rational design of high-performance MFCs."
94,"OBJECTIVES: When primary treatment has been inadequate, nivolumab and axitinib 
are often used as a secondary treatments for patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC). However, there have been few reports comparing the efficacy 
and safety of these drugs.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 58 patients treated with nivolumab and 
57 patients treated with axitinib as secondary treatment between April 2013 and 
December 2019. We then assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of the 
treatments in both groups.
RESULTS: The most common primary therapy was sunitinib (61.7%). Both nivolumab 
and axitinib groups showed no significant differences in terms of the objective 
response rate and disease control rate (p = 0.280 and p = 0.518, respectively). 
Importantly, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) seemed to 
be similar in patients treated with nivolumab and axitinib (p = 0.527 and 
p = 0.266, respectively), irrespective of the objective response to primary 
therapy. Furthermore, a Cox proportional hazards model showed that pretreatment 
Karnofsky Performance Status was significantly associated with PFS and OS. 
Although the incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the 
patients treated with axitinib, there was no significant difference in time to 
treatment failure between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab and axitinib showed similar clinical benefits as 
secondary treatment in patients with mRCC; thus, they should be an option in 
sequential therapy following treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
Future studies and feasible therapeutic biomarkers would help predict the 
clinical response to TKIs or immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with mRCC."
95,"Many heterotrophic microbial eukaryotes are size-selective feeders. Some 
microorganisms increase their size by forming multicellular colonies. We used 
choanoflagellates, Salpingoeca helianthica, which can be unicellular or form 
multicellular colonies, to study effects of multicellularity on vulnerability to 
predation by the raptorial protozoan predator, Amoeba proteus, which capture 
prey with pseudopodia. Videomicrography used to measure behavior of interacting 
S. helianthica and A. proteus revealed that large choanoflagellate colonies were 
more susceptible to capture than were small colonies or single cells. Swimming 
colonies produced larger flow fields than did swimming unicellular 
choanoflagellates, and the distance of S. helianthica from A. proteus when 
pseudopod formation started was greater for colonies than for single cells. Prey 
size did not affect the number of pseudopodia formed and time between their 
formation, pulsatile kinematics and speed of extension by pseudopodia, or 
percent of prey lost by the predator. S. helianthica did not change swimming 
speed or execute escape maneuvers in response to being pursued by pseudopodia, 
so size-selective feeding by A. proteus was due to predator behavior rather than 
prey escape. Our results do not support the theory that the selective advantage 
of becoming multicellular by choanoflagellate-like ancestors of animals was 
reduced susceptibility to protozoan predation."
96,"Histone proteins, building blocks of chromatins, participate in enzymatic 
reactions in cells heated at around 45°C though in vitro the denaturation of 
histones significantly proceeds at a similar temperature. It implies that 
unidentified mechanisms prevent thermal denaturation of histones in vivo. 
However, studies on the histone structures in the heated cells have been scarce. 
Here, we analyzed the secondary structures of histone H2A-H2B proteins 
originating from the heated cells using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The 
secondary structure contents of the H2A-H2B extracted from the heated cells 
differed from those of H2A-H2B both native and denatured in vitro but reverted 
to the native structures by incubating the heated cells at 37°C within 2 h. Such 
structural flexibility may play a role in protecting genomic functions governed 
by chromatin structures from heat stresses."
97,"The major autoantigens for pemphigus are desmogleins (Dsgs), cell-cell adhesive 
structure proteins, one of the desmosomal cadherins. Recent progress in 
molecular biology has revealed that IgG autoantibodies of classical pemphigus 
react with Dsg1 or Dsg3. Desmocollins (Dscs) also belong to the cadherin 
supergene family that provides structure to the desmosomes and play an important 
role in cell-to-cell adhesion. In addition to the presence of four desmosomal 
Dsg isoforms, i.e. Dsg1-4, Dsc1, 2 and 3, all of which are derived from 
different genes, Dsc1 has been previously identified as the target antigen of 
IgA autoantibodies in the subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD)-type of 
intercellular IgA dermatosis. In addition to the IgA anti-Dsc1 autoantiboides, 
the presence of IgG anti-Dsc autoantibodies is described in patients of some 
autoimmune bullous diseases. In particular, the current pemphigus detecting 
autoantibodies to Dscs has shown a tendency in atypical variants of pemphigus. 
Therefore, autoantibodies against Dscs alone may cause detachment of cell-cell 
adhesion in the epidermis in some pemphigus. However, except for the findings of 
a few in vitro and in vivo studies, there is currently no clear evidence for the 
pathogenicity of anti-Dsc autoantibodies in pemphigus, whereas significance of 
anti-Dsg autoantibodies is well established. This article describes the 
structure and function of the Dscs, and explores the evidence regarding the 
pathogenic role of anti-Dsc autoantibodies in pemphigus."
98,"TP53 missense mutations that express highly stabilized mutant p53 protein 
(mutp53) driving tumorigenesis have been witnessed in a considerable percentage 
of human cancers. The attempt to induce degradation of mutp53 has thus been an 
attractive strategy to realize precise antitumor therapy, but currently, there 
has been no FDA-approved medication for mutp53 cancer. Herein, we discovered a 
small molecule compound crizotinib, an FDA-approved antitumor drug, exhibited 
outstanding mutp53-degrading capability. Crizotinib induced 
ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation of wide-spectrum mutp53 but not 
the wild-type p53 protein. Degradation of mutp53 by crizotinib eliminated 
mutp53-conferred gain-of-function (GOF), leading to reduced cell proliferation, 
migration, demise, and cell cycle arrest, as well as enhanced sensitivity to 
doxorubicin-elicited killing in mutp53 cancer. To alleviate the side effects and 
improve the therapeutic effect, we adopted poly(ethylene 
glycol)-polylactide-co-glycolide (PEG-PLGA) nanomicelles to deliver the 
hydrophobic drugs doxorubicin and crizotinib, demonstrating that crizotinib 
nanomicelles effectively enhanced doxorubicin-elicited anticancer efficacy in a 
p53Y220C pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo via mutp53 degradation induced 
by crizotinib, manifesting its promising application in clinical practice. Our 
work therefore revealed that crizotinib exerted significant synergistic 
chemotherapy with doxorubicin and suggested a novel combination therapeutic 
strategy for targeting p53 cancer in further clinical application."
99,"BACKGROUND: Tumor size and consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) are crucial for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis. However, the optimal CTR cutoff 
remains unclear. Whether tumor size and CTR are independent prognostic factors 
for part-solid NSCLC is under debate. Here, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic 
impacts of CTR and tumor size on NSCLC, especially on part-solid NSCLC.
METHODS: We reviewed 1366 clinical T1 NSCLC patients who underwent surgical 
treatment. Log-rank test and Cox regression analyses were adopted for prognostic 
evaluation. The ""surv_cutpoint"" function was used to identify the optimal CTR 
and tumor size cutoff values.
RESULTS: There were 416, 510, and 440 subjects with pure ground-glass opacity 
(pGGO), part-solid, and pure solid nodules. The 5-year overall survival 
(disease-free survival) for patients with pGGO, part-solid, and pure solid 
nodules were 99.5% (99.5%), 97.3% (95.8%), and 90.4% (78.9%), respectively. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that CTR was an independent 
prognostic factor for the whole patients, and the optimal CTR cutoff was 0.99. 
However, for part-solid NSCLC, CTR was not independently associated with 
survival, even if categorized by the optimal cutoffs. The predicted optimal 
cutoffs of total tumor size and solid component size were 2.4 and 1.4 cm for 
part-solid NSCLC. Total tumor size (HR = 6.21, 95% CI: 1.58-24.34, p = 0.009) 
and solid component size (HR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.04-5.92, p = 0.045) grouped by 
the cutoffs were significantly associated with part-solid NSCLC prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: CTR was an independent prognostic factor for the whole NSCLC, but 
not for the part-solid NSCLC. Tumor size was still meaningful for part-solid 
NSCLC."
100,"Diphencyprone (DPCP) is a hapten that causes a delayed-type hypersensitivity 
reaction when applied topically. It has clinical uses in the treatment of 
various conditions such as melanoma metastases, warts, and alopecia areata, but 
the mechanisms are currently not well understood in humans. To further 
characterize the immunologic effects of DPCP, the authors performed a proteomic 
analysis of normal skin of eight healthy volunteers following a single 
application of DPCP and compared them with placebo-treated skin from the same 
volunteers. A total of 96 proteins were examined using the Olink immuno-oncology 
panel at 3 days (peak response), 14 days (partially resolved response), and 
120 days (completely resolved response). Our analysis revealed significant 
upregulation of markers of immune cell activation (interleukin [IL] 8), vascular 
and tissue remodeling (matrix metallopeptidase 12 [MMP12], nitric oxide synthase 
3 [NOS3]), antineoplastic markers (granzyme B [GZMB]), and the Th1 axis 
(interferon gamma [IFNG], chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand [CXCL] 9, CXCL10, 
CXCL11) at days 3 and 14 compared with placebo (p < 0.05). In addition, several 
negative regulators of immune function such as programmed cell death 1 (PD1), 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) (p < 0.001), and lymphocyte activation 
gene 3 (LAG3) (p < 0.05) were significantly upregulated at days 3 and 14. This 
induction of negative regulators may explain the seemingly paradoxical 
therapeutic benefits of DPCP in autoimmune conditions such as alopecia areata. 
The current analysis also indicated IL-4 upregulation only at day 3, followed by 
IL-12 upregulation only at day 14, suggesting a transient Th2 response followed 
by Th1 polarization. Overall, these data suggest a complex and evolving 
immunological delayed-type hypersensitivity response to a single application of 
DPCP over time. Future proteomic studies of samples from patients with melanoma 
metastases, warts, and alopecia areata treated long term with DPCP are needed to 
further evaluate its pharmacologic mechanisms."
101,"AIM: The progression of atherosclerosis can lead to the occurrence of multiple 
cardiovascular diseases (coronary heart disease, etc.). E prostanoid receptor-3 
(EP3) is known to participate in the progression of atherosclerosis. This study 
aimed to investigate the mechanism by which EP3 modulates the development of 
atherosclerosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: ApoE-/- mice were used to construct in vivo model of 
atherosclerosis. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were stimulated with 
oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to construct in vitro model of 
atherosclerosis. mRNA expressions were assessed by qRT-PCR, and western blot was 
applied to assess the protein levels. CCK-8 assay was applied to assess the cell 
viability. The inflammatory cytokines levels were assessed by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry was applied to assess cell apoptosis. In 
vivo experiment was constructed to investigate the impact of EP3 in 
atherosclerosis development. L-798106 (EP3 inhibitor) significantly inhibited 
the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in atherosclerosis in vivo. EP3 
inhibitor (L-798106) significantly reversed ox-LDL-caused HASMCs injury via 
inhibiting the apoptosis and inflammatory responses (P < 0.05). The levels of 
interleukin-17 (IL-17) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in HASMCs 
were elevated by ox-LDL, whereas L-798106 or knockdown of cyclic AMP (cAMP) 
response element-binding protein (CREB) notably restored this phenomenon 
(P < 0.05). EP3 overexpression further aggravated ox-LDL-induced inflammation in 
HASMCs, and EP3 up-regulated the levels of IL-17 and ICAM-1 in ox-LDL-treated 
HASMCs (P < 0.05). EP3 up-regulation promoted the inflammatory responses in 
ox-LDL-treated HASMCs through mediation of cAMP/protein kinase A 
(PKA)/CREB/IL-17/ICAM-1 axis (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: EP3 inhibitor alleviates ox-LDL-induced HASMC inflammation via 
mediation of cAMP/PKA/CREB/IL-17/ICAM-1 axis. Our study might shed new lights on 
discovering novel strategies against atherosclerosis."
102,"Bronchiolar adenoma (BA)/ciliated muconodular papillary tumor (CMPT) is defined 
as a benign tumor composed of epithelial and basal cells. Recently, some cases 
with driver mutations or malignant transformation have been observed. Thus, 
whether BA/CMPT is benign or malignant remains controversial. We herein report 
an extremely rare case of a 68-year-old woman with a CMPT accompanied by 
adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). BA/CMPT existed inside the AIS. The BA/CMPT 
component did not show any driver mutations; however, the AIS component had an 
EGFR driver mutation in exon 19. The accumulation of cases and further studies 
are needed to discuss the malignant potential of BA/CMPT."
103,"We present a microplate assay for the detection of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 which 
involves the preadsorption of carboxy-modified polystyrene microspheres to the 
microplate wells and their self-assembly leading to the formation of a photonic 
crystal colloidal array (PCCA). PCCA is then cross-linked with amino-modified 
aptamers selected for viral cell surface glycoproteins, i.e., S1-protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 and gp120 of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), to develop an 
aptamer-linked photonic crystal assay (ALPA). ALPA is then utilized as a 
proof-of-concept method for the detection of S1-protein, gp120, and two whole 
viruses, i.e., SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, as well. The aptamers are stable at room 
temperature and can bind with the viruses' proteins via hydrogen bonding. This 
binding leads to color generation from PCCA, and the signal can easily be 
measured and quantified by a UV/vis spectrometer. The assay carries the 
advantage of a two-step detection process by the addition of the virus sample 
directly to a 96-well microplate and incubation of 5 min followed by convenient 
detection through a UV/vis-spectrometer. The assay does not require any 
additional reagents and can be customized for similar viruses utilizing specific 
aptamers targeting their cell surface receptors."
104,"Stabilization of cathode catalysts in hydrogen-fueled proton-exchange membrane 
fuel cells (PEMFCs) is paramount to their widespread commercialization. 
Targeting that aim, Pt-Au alloy catalysts with various compositions (Pt95Au5, 
Pt90Au10, and Pt80Au20) prepared by magnetron sputtering were investigated. The 
promising stability improvement of the Pt-Au catalyst, manifested in suppressed 
platinum dissolution with increasing Au content, was documented over an extended 
potential range up to 1.5 VRHE. On the other hand, at elevated concentrations, 
Au showed a detrimental effect on oxygen reduction reaction activity. A 
systematic study involving complementary characterization techniques, 
electrochemistry, and Monte Carlo simulations based on density functional theory 
data enabled us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the 
composition-activity-stability relationship to find optimal Pt-Au alloying for 
maintaining the activity of platinum and improving its resistance to 
dissolution. According to the results, Pt-Au alloy with 10% gold represent the 
most promising composition retaining the activity of monometallic Pt while 
suppressing Pt dissolution by 50% at the upper potential limit of 1.2 VRHE and 
by 20% at devastating 1.5 VRHE."
105,"Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) has been demonstrated to be an 
effective strategy for cancer treatment. In this work, we have developed a new 
agent Ir-VPA, which exhibits the cell death mode switching between apoptosis and 
autophagy due to the distinct level of HDAC6 inhibition. Ir-VPA indicates the 
best anticancer activity to HeLa cells, and could be hydrolyzed due to the high 
expression of the esterase in HeLa cells. Ir-VPA could accumulate in nuclei, 
induce severe DNA damages and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. The anticancer 
mechanism of Ir-VPA to HeLa cells was dependent on the HDAC6 inhibitory 
performance, as the caspase dependent apoptosis at low concentration (IC50) and 
autophagy with the autophagy flux blockage at high concentration (2xIC50). This 
is resulted from the distinct inhibitory levels of HDAC6, as moderate/complete 
inhibition at the concentration of IC50 /2xIC50.In the presence of autophagic 
inhibitor chloroquine, the apoptotic population elevated from 32.7% to 61.7%, 
indicating that Ir-VPA could activate apoptotic process through the 
autophagolysosome fusion inhibition. Ir-VPA also exhibits excellent 
antiproliferative behavior to 3D HeLa multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs). 
This work not only provided a new HDAC6 inhibitor and novel anticancer mechanism 
for the effective treatment of cervical cancer, but also demonstrated the 
strategy to conjugate the metal fragment with active organic drug to enhance the 
anticancer performance."
106,"Freestanding membranes of CuCl2-implanted TpPa covalent organic frameworks 
(COFs) were mechanochemically produced. The resulting membrane had a high I2 
adsorption capacity (566.78 g·mol-1) in cyclohexane, which corresponds to 2.2I2 
per unit cell with 1.3I2 immobilized on 3Cl- ions (60%) and 0.9 on 3N atoms 
(40%). Upon being placed in aqueous media, the membrane released 61.1% of its 
loaded I2 mainly by its Cl- ions within 10 min and the remaining 38.9% mainly 
from its N atoms within about 5 h. Thanks to that, the COF membranes loaded with 
1.5 mg of I2 could be repetitively utilized to kill about 108 CFU/mL E. coli in 
0.5-3 min at least five times, after which the membranes could retain their 
bactericidal activity for 4 h against 108 CFU/mL E. coli. This highlights the 
promising application of I2-loaded TpPa-CuCl2 COF membranes for instant and 
sustained disinfection."
107,"BACKGROUND: A preoperative-progesterone intervention increases disease-free 
survival in patients with breast cancer, with an unknown underlying mechanism. 
We elucidated the role of non-coding RNAs in response to progesterone in human 
breast cancer.
METHODS: Whole transcriptome sequencing dataset of 30 breast primary tumors (10 
tumors exposed to hydroxyprogesterone and 20 tumors as control) were re-analyzed 
to identify differentially expressed non-coding RNAs followed by real-time PCR 
analyses to validate the expression of candidates. Functional analyses were 
performed by genetic knockdown, biochemical, and cell-based assays.
RESULTS: We identified a significant downregulation in the expression of a long 
non-coding RNA, Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule antisense DSCAM-AS1, in 
response to progesterone treatment in breast cancer. The progesterone-induced 
expression of DSCAM-AS1 could be effectively blocked by the knockdown of 
progesterone receptor (PR) or treatment of cells with mifepristone 
(PR-antagonist). We further show that knockdown of DSCAM-AS1 mimics the effect 
of progesterone in impeding cell migration and invasion in PR-positive breast 
cancer cells, while its overexpression shows an opposite effect. Additionally, 
DSCAM-AS1 sponges the activity of miR-130a that regulates the expression of ESR1 
by binding to its 3'-UTR to mediate the effect of progesterone in breast cancer 
cells. Consistent with our findings, TCGA analysis suggests that high levels of 
miR-130a correlate with a tendency toward better overall survival in patients 
with breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a mechanism involving the 
DSCAM-AS1/miR-130a/ESR1 genomic axis through which progesterone impedes breast 
cancer cell invasion and migration. The findings highlight the utility of 
progesterone treatment in impeding metastasis and improving survival outcomes in 
patients with breast cancer."
108,"BACKGROUND: Fibroids are benign tumors of the female reproductive tract 
originating from the myometrial smooth muscle cells. They are a frequent 
occurrence in women of childbearing age but their incidence is rare after 
menopause. In addition, there is a remote possibility of malignant 
transformation to leiomyosarcoma in less than 1% of cases.
CASE PRESENTATION: We hereby report a case of large fibroid in a postmenopausal 
Indian female with rapid growth, raising the suspicion of malignant 
transformation into leiomyosarcoma. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histopathology report confirmed it to be 
benign leiomyoma without any evidence of neoplasia.
CONCLUSION: Sudden enlargement of leiomyoma in postmenopausal women should not 
be ignored due to possible malignant transformation and is to be dealt 
immediately with hysterectomy followed by histopathology."
109,"PURPOSE: Angiogenesis is involved in many pathological and physiological 
processes and is mainly driven by hypoxia. Karyopherin subunit alpha 2 (KPNA2), 
a member of the nuclear transport protein family, was recently shown to be 
induced by hypoxia in various types of tumours, so we aimed to investigate the 
role and mechanism of KPNA2 in angiogenesis under hypoxia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After overexpression or knockdown of KPNA2 in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by adenovirus vector infection, the 
tube formation, proliferation and migration of HUVEC under hypoxia were detected 
by tubule formation assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining and 
Transwell assay, respectively. After overexpression or knockdown of KPNA2 in a 
murine hindlimb ischemia model by local injection of purified adenovirus vector 
into the gastrocnemius muscle, blood flow changes were examined with a laser 
Doppler system. Changes in KPNA2-binding proteins under hypoxia were detected by 
immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and co-immunoprecipitation 
(Co-IP). The effect of KPNA2 on signal transducer and activator of transcription 
3 (STAT3) was detected by Western blotting and quantitative RT‒PCR.
RESULTS: KPNA2 was upregulated in the HUVEC hypoxia model and murine hindlimb 
ischemia model. Overexpression of KPNA2 increased the proliferation, migration 
and tube formation of HUVEC under hypoxia, while knockdown of KPNA2 reduced the 
proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVEC. Overexpression of KPNA2 
promoted the restoration of blood flow in the murine hindlimb ischemia model, 
while knockout of KPNA2 inhibited the restoration of blood flow in the murine 
hindlimb ischemia model. Mechanistically, hypoxia promoted the binding of STAT3 
to KPNA2. Overexpression of KPNA2 promoted STAT3 phosphorylation and then 
upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 
2(ANGPT2), whereas knockdown of KPNA2 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and then 
downregulated VEGF and ANGPT2.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that hypoxia promotes the binding of STAT3 to 
KPNA2 and KPNA2 promotes angiogenesis under hypoxia by promoting the binding of 
STAT3 and JAK1 and regulating STAT3 phosphorylation."
110,"The standard therapies in lymphoma have predominantly focused on targeting tumor 
cells with less of a focus on the tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a 
critical role in favoring tumor growth and survival. Such an approach may result 
in increasingly refractory disease with progressively reduced responses to 
subsequent treatments. To overcome this hurdle, targeting the TME has emerged as 
a new therapeutic strategy. The TME consists of T and B lymphocytes, 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and other components. Understanding the 
TME can lead to a comprehensive approach to managing lymphoma, resulting in 
therapeutic strategies that target not only cancer cells, but also the 
supportive environment and thereby ultimately improve survival of lymphoma 
patients. Here, we review the normal function of different components of the 
TME, the impact of their aberrant behavior in B cell lymphoma and the current 
TME-direct therapeutic avenues."

800,000 global neonatal deaths each year are attributed to deviations from 
recommended best practices in infant feeding. Identifying factors promoting 
ideal breastfeeding practices may facilitate efforts to decrease neonatal and 
infant death rates and progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development 
Goals set for 2030. Though numerous studies have identified the benefits of 
breastfeeding in reducing the risk of childhood undernutrition, infection and 
illness, and mortality in low- and middle-income countries, no studies have 
explored predictors of breastfeeding practices in rural eastern Ethiopia, where 
undernutrition is widespread. The aim of this study is to examine predictors of 
infant feeding practices in Haramaya, Ethiopia, using a multi-level conceptual 
framework.
METHODS: This study uses data collected from household questionnaires during the 
Campylobacter Genomics and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (CAGED) project 
among 102 households in the Haramaya woreda, Eastern Hararghe Zone, Eastern 
Ethiopia, and investigates factors influencing breastfeeding practices: early 
initiation, prelacteal feeding, and untimely complementary feeding.
RESULTS: Nearly half (47.9%) of infants in this study were non-exclusively 
breastfed (n = 96). Generalized liner mixed effects models of breastfeeding 
practices revealed that prelacteal feeding may be a common practice in the 
region (43.9%, n = 98) and characterized by gender differences (p = .03). No 
factors evaluated were statistically significantly predictive of early 
initiation and untimely complementary feeding (82% and 14%, respectively). 
Severely food insecure mothers had more than 72% lower odds of early 
breastfeeding initiation, and participants who self-reported as being illiterate 
had 1.53 times greater odds of untimely complementary feeding (95% CI, 
[0.30,7.69]) followed by male children having 1.45 greater odds of being 
untimely complementary fed compared to female (95% CI,[0.40,5.37]).
CONCLUSIONS: This study found high rates of prelacteal feeding and low 
prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding, with girls more likely to be exclusively 
breastfed. While no predictors evaluated in this multi-level framework were 
associated with prevalence of early initiation or complementary feeding, rates 
may be clinically meaningful in a region burdened by undernutrition. Findings 
raise questions about gendered breastfeeding norms, the under-examined role of 
khat consumption on infant feeding, and the complex factors that affect 
breastfeeding practices in this region. This information may be used to guide 
future research questions and inform intervention strategies."
112,"BACKGROUND: Extremolytes enable microbes to withstand even the most extreme 
conditions in nature. Due to their unique protective properties, the small 
organic molecules, more and more, become high-value active ingredients for the 
cosmetics and the pharmaceutical industries. While ectoine, the industrial 
extremolyte flagship, has been successfully commercialized before, an 
economically viable route to its highly interesting derivative 5-hydroxyectoine 
(hydroxyectoine) is not existing.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate high-level hydroxyectoine production, using 
metabolically engineered strains of C. glutamicum that express a 
codon-optimized, heterologous ectD gene, encoding for ectoine hydroxylase, to 
convert supplemented ectoine in the presence of sucrose as growth substrate into 
the desired derivative. Fourteen out of sixteen codon-optimized ectD variants 
from phylogenetically diverse bacterial and archaeal donors enabled 
hydroxyectoine production, showing the strategy to work almost regardless of the 
origin of the gene. The genes from Pseudomonas stutzeri (PST) and Mycobacterium 
smegmatis (MSM) worked best and enabled hydroxyectoine production up to 97% 
yield. Metabolic analyses revealed high enrichment of the ectoines inside the 
cells, which, inter alia, reduced the synthesis of other compatible solutes, 
including proline and trehalose. After further optimization, C. glutamicum Ptuf 
ectDPST achieved a titre of 74 g L-1 hydroxyectoine at 70% selectivity within 
12 h, using a simple batch process. In a two-step procedure, hydroxyectoine 
production from ectoine, previously synthesized fermentatively with C. 
glutamicum ectABCopt, was successfully achieved without intermediate 
purification.
CONCLUSIONS: C. glutamicum is a well-known and industrially proven host, 
allowing the synthesis of commercial products with granted GRAS status, a great 
benefit for a safe production of hydroxyectoine as active ingredient for 
cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. Because ectoine is already available 
at commercial scale, its use as precursor appears straightforward. In the 
future, two-step processes might provide hydroxyectoine de novo from sugar."
113,"BACKGROUND: Sterile alpha motif domain and histidine-aspartate domain-containing 
protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a DNA end resection factor, which is involved in DNA 
damage repair and innate immunity. However, the role of SAMHD1 in anti-tumor 
immunity is still unknown. This study investigated the effects of SAMHD1 on 
stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-type I interferon (IFN) pathway and 
radiation-induced immune responses.
METHODS: The roles of SAMHD1 in the activation of cytosolic DNA sensing STING 
pathway in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells were investigated with flow 
cytometry, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting and qPCR. The combined effects of 
SAMHD1 silencing and radiation on tumor cell growth and STING pathway activation 
were also evaluated with colony formation and CCK8 assay. The Lewis lung cancer 
mouse model was used to evaluate the combined efficiency of SAMHD1 silencing and 
radiotherapy in vivo. Macrophage M1 polarization and cytotoxic T cell 
infiltration were evaluated with flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulated in the cytosol of 
SAMHD1-deficient lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, accompanied by upregulated 
DNA sensor IFN-γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and activated STING pathway. The 
translocation of IFI16 from nucleus to cytosol was detected in SAMHD1-deficient 
cells. IFI16 and STING were acquired in the activation of STING-IFN-I pathway in 
SAMHD1-deficient cells. SAMHD1 silencing in LUAD cells promoted macrophage M1 
polarization in vitro. SAMHD1 silencing synergized with radiation to activate 
ssDNA-STING-IFN-I pathway, inhibit proliferation, promote apoptosis and regulate 
cell cycle. SAMHD1 silencing cooperated with radiotherapy to inhibit tumor 
growth and increase CD86+MHC-IIhigh M1 proportion and CD8+ T cell infiltration 
in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: SAMHD1 deficiency induced IFN-I production through cytosolic 
IFI16-STING pathway in LUAD cells. Moreover, SAMHD1 downregulation and radiation 
cooperated to inhibit tumor growth and enhance anti-tumor immune responses 
through macrophage M1 polarization and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Combination of 
SAMHD1 inhibition and radiotherapy may be a potentially therapeutic strategy for 
LUAD patients."
114,"BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of glial cell communication is involved in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathogenesis, and the recent study reported that astrocytic 
secreted interleukin-3 (IL-3) participated in astrocyte-microglia crosstalk and 
restricted AD pathology in mice, but the effect of IL-3 on the pathological 
progression of AD in human is still unclear.
METHODS: A total of 311 participants with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-3, 
soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), and AD 
biomarkers were included from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). We assessed the associations of IL-3 with sTREM2 and AD biomarkers at 
baseline, and with cognitive change in longitudinal study. The mediation models 
were used to explore the potential mechanism of how IL-3 affects AD pathology.
RESULTS: We found that CSF IL-3 was significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 and 
CSF AD core biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau, and t-tau) at baseline, and was also 
markedly related to cognitive decline in longitudinal analysis. Moreover, 
mediation analysis revealed that CSF IL-3 modulated the level of CSF sTREM2 and 
contributed to tau pathology (as measured by CSF p-tau/t-tau) and subsequent 
cognitive decline. In addition, Aβ pathology (as measured by CSF Aβ42) affected 
the development of tau pathology partly by modifying the levels of CSF IL-3 and 
CSF sTREM2. Furthermore, the effect of Aβ pathology on cognitive decline was 
partially mediated by the pathway from CSF IL-3 and CSF sTREM2 to tau pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence to suggest that IL-3 is linked to 
sTREM2 and mediates the correlation between Aβ pathology to tau pathology. It 
indicates that IL-3 may be a major factor in the spreading from Aβ pathology to 
tau pathology to cognitive impairment."
115,"BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common and serious complication of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). LN pathogenesis is not fully understood. Axl 
receptor tyrosine kinase is upregulated and contributes to the pathogenic 
progress in LN. We have reported that Axl disruption attenuates nephritis 
development in mice.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles with RNA-seq 
using renal cortical samples from nephritic mice. Axl-KO mice were bred onto a 
B6.lpr spontaneous lupus background, and renal disease development was followed 
and compared to the Axl-sufficient B6.lpr mice. Finally, anti-glomerular 
basement membrane (anti-GBM) Ab-induced nephritic mice were treated with Axl 
small molecule inhibitor, R428, at different stages of nephritis development. 
Blood urine nitrogen levels and renal pathologies were evaluated.
RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis revealed that renal Axl activation contributed 
to cell proliferation, survival, and motility through regulation of the Akt, 
c-Jun, and actin pathways. Spontaneous lupus-prone B6.lpr mice with Axl 
deficiency showed significantly reduced kidney damages and decreased T cell 
infiltration compared to the renal damage and T cell infiltration in 
Axl-sufficient B6.lpr mice. The improved kidney function was independent of 
autoAb production. Moreover, R428 significantly reduced anti-GBM 
glomerulonephritis at different stages of GN development compared to the 
untreated nephritic control mice. R428 administration reduced inflammatory 
cytokine (IL-6) production, T cell infiltration, and nephritis disease activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study emphasize the important role of Axl 
signaling in LN and highlight Axl as an attractive target in LN."
116,"BACKGROUND: The restoration of the functional ability of mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) using epigenetic modification is very promising for patients with weak 
osteogenesis ability. This study focused on the acceleration of osteogenesis 
from MSCs using microRNA (miRNA)2861 and a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), LK.
METHODS: We performed MSCs penetration test of complex between the LK peptides 
and miRNA 2861. Three different experiments were performed to investigate the 
effects of miRNA 2861 on osteogenic differentiation in MSCs: 1) intensity of 
alizarin red staining, which reflects the status of mineralization by 
osteoblasts; 2) gene expression related to osteoblast differentiation; and 3) 
confirmation of corresponding protein translation for comparison with RNA 
expression levels.
RESULTS: We found that cLK effectively delivered miRNA 2861 into the cytoplasm 
of human MSCs and accelerated osteogenic differentiation from MSCs, as well as 
mineralization.
CONCLUSION: The complex of miRNA 2861 with LK may have a positive effect on the 
osteogenic differentiation from MSCs and mineralization. Therapies using miRNAs 
combined with LK may be good candidates for the augmentation of osteogenesis in 
patients."
117,"PURPOSE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), a secreted 
protein associated with inflammation, is believed to possess momentous and 
multiple anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective properties. However, the role 
and potential mechanism of TSG-6 in cervical disk degeneration (CDD) are still 
not clear. Hence, we aimed to explore the effect of TSG-6 on CDD.
METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was applied to detect the expression level 
of TSG-6 and IL-1β in normal and degenerated nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues. 
Then, qRT-PCR and western blot were adopted to test the TSG-6 protein expression 
after IL-1β treatment (10 ng/mL) in human NP cells (HNPCs). After 
over-expressing TSG-6, qRT-PCR was also utilized to evaluate the expression of 
TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6 and the synthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs), 
western blot to check the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins 
[collagen II, aggrecan, and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3)], pain-related 
molecules (CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; NGF, nerve growth factor; SP, 
substance P), and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related proteins.
RESULTS: Briefly speaking, TSG-6 and IL-1β expression levels were significantly 
increased in CDD patient tissues; and IL-1β treatment could significantly 
increase TSG-6 expression in HNPCs. Further research revealed that, in addition 
to greatly promoting sGAGs synthesis, TSG-6 over-expression also inhibited 
TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6 expression and ECM degradation in IL-1β-induced HNPCs. 
(The collagen II and aggrecan expression was up-regulated and MMP-3 expression 
was down-regulated.) Furthermore, over-expression of TSG-6 could decrease the 
levels of CGRP, NGF, and SP protein expression and activate the PI3K/Akt 
signaling pathway in IL-1β-treated HNPCs.
CONCLUSION: TSG-6 inhibits inflammatory responses, ECM degradation, and 
expression of pain-related molecules in IL-1β-induced HNPCs by activating the 
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."
118,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is one of the main treatments for esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (ESCC), but its efficacy is limited by radioresistance. MicroRNAs 
play a crucial role in posttranscriptional regulation, which is linked to the 
cancer response to radiation.
METHODS: We successfully established a radioresistant cell line model by using 
fractionated irradiation. qRT-PCR was adopted to detect the expression of 
miR-4443 in human normal esophageal cell lines, tumor cells, and radioresistant 
cells. Next, CCK-8, colony formation, apoptosis, and cell cycle assays were used 
to assess the biological effect of miR-4443. Weighted gene coexpression network 
analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify potential radiosensitivity-related 
genes. Additionally, we predicted the probable targets of the miRNA using 
bioinformatic methods and confirmed them using Western blot.
RESULTS: miR-4443 was significantly upregulated in radioresistant ESCC cells. 
Enhancement of miR-4443 further decreased the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells, 
while inhibition of miR-4443 increased the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells. 
Notably, miR-4443 modulated radiosensitivity by influencing DNA damage repair, 
apoptosis, and G2 cycle arrest. By using WGCNA and experimental validation, we 
identified PTPRJ as a key target for miRNA-4443 to regulate radiosensitivity. 
The effects of miR-4443 overexpression or inhibition could be reversed by 
increasing or decreasing PTPRJ expression.
CONCLUSION: In this study, miR-4443 is found to promote radiotherapy resistance 
in ESCC cells by regulating PTPRJ expression, which provides a new perspective 
and clue to alleviate radioresistance."
119,"BACKGROUND: Parental imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that leads to 
monoallelic expression of a subset of genes depending on their parental origin. 
Imprinting disorders (IDs), caused by disturbances of imprinted genes, are a set 
of rare congenital diseases that mainly affect growth, metabolism and 
development. To date, there is no accurate model to study the physiopathology of 
IDs or test therapeutic strategies. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
are a promising cellular approach to model human diseases and complex genetic 
disorders. However, aberrant hypermethylation of imprinting control regions 
(ICRs) may appear during the reprogramming process and subsequent culture of 
iPSCs. Therefore, we tested various conditions of reprogramming and culture of 
iPSCs and performed an extensive analysis of methylation marks at the ICRs to 
develop a cellular model that can be used to study IDs.
RESULTS: We assessed the methylation levels at seven imprinted loci in iPSCs 
before differentiation, at various passages of cell culture, and during 
chondrogenic differentiation. Abnormal methylation levels were found, with 
hypermethylation at 11p15 H19/IGF2:IG-DMR and 14q32 MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR, 
independently of the reprogramming method and cells of origin. Hypermethylation 
at these two loci led to the loss of parental imprinting (LOI), with biallelic 
expression of the imprinted genes IGF2 and DLK1, respectively. The epiPS™ 
culture medium combined with culturing of the cells under hypoxic conditions 
prevented hypermethylation at H19/IGF2:IG-DMR (ICR1) and MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR, as 
well as at other imprinted loci, while preserving the proliferation and 
pluripotency qualities of these iPSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: An extensive and quantitative analysis of methylation levels of 
ICRs in iPSCs showed hypermethylation of certain ICRs in human iPSCs, especially 
paternally methylated ICRs, and subsequent LOI of certain imprinted genes. The 
epiPS™ culture medium and culturing of the cells under hypoxic conditions 
prevented hypermethylation of ICRs in iPSCs. We demonstrated that the 
reprogramming and culture in epiPS™ medium allow the generation of control iPSCs 
lines with a balanced methylation and ID patient iPSCs lines with unbalanced 
methylation. Human iPSCs are therefore a promising cellular model to study the 
physiopathology of IDs and test therapies in tissues of interest."
120,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among women. Approximately 15-20% of 
all breast cancers are highly invasive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 
lack estrogen, progesterone, and ERBB2 receptors. TNBC is challenging to treat 
due to its aggressive nature with far fewer targeted therapies than other breast 
cancer subtypes. Current treatments for patients with TNBC consist of cytotoxic 
chemotherapies, surgery, radiation, and in some instances PARP inhibitors and 
immunotherapy. To advance current therapeutics, we repurposed mebendazole (MBZ), 
an orally available FDA-approved anthelmintic that has shown preclinical 
efficacy for cancers. MBZ has low toxicity in humans and efficacy in multiple 
cancer models including breast cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, 
colon cancer, pancreatic and thyroid cancer. MBZ was well-tolerated in a phase I 
clinical trial of adults recently diagnosed with glioma. We determined that the 
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of MBZ in four breast cancer cell 
lines is well within the range reported for other types of cancer. MBZ reduced 
TNBC cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and caused G2/M cell cycle arrest. 
MBZ reduced the size of primary tumors and prevented lung and liver metastases. 
In addition, we uncovered a novel mechanism of action for MBZ. We found that MBZ 
reduces integrin β4 (ITGβ4) expression and cancer stem cell properties. ITGβ4 
has previously been implicated in promoting ""cancer stemness,"" which may 
contribute to the efficacy of MBZ. Collectively, our results contribute to a 
growing body of evidence suggesting that MBZ should be considered as a 
therapeutic to slow tumor progression and prevent metastasis."
121,"BACKGROUND: Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a member of 
the genus Betacoronavirus, is the causative agent of neurological disease in 
pigs. No effective therapeutics are currently available for PHEV infection. 
Resveratrol has been shown to exert neuroprotective and antiviral effects. Here 
resveratrol was investigated for its ability to inhibit PHEV replication in 
nerve cells and central nervous system tissues.
METHODS: Anti-PHEV effect of resveratrol was evaluated using an in vitro 
cell-based PHEV infection model and employing a mouse PHEV infection model. The 
collected cells or tissues were used for quantitative PCR analysis, western blot 
analysis, or indirect immunofluorescence assay. The supernatants were collected 
to quantify viral loads by TCID50 assay in vitro. EC50 and CC50 were determined 
by dose-response experiments, and the ratio (EC50/CC50) was used as a 
selectivity index (SI) to measure the antiviral versus cytotoxic activity.
RESULTS: Our results showed that resveratrol treatment reduced PHEV titer in a 
dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibition concentration of 6.24 μM. A 
reduction of > 70% of viral protein expression and mRNA copy number and a 
19-fold reduction of virus titer were achieved when infected cells were treated 
with 10 µM resveratrol in a pre-treatment assay. Quantitative PCR analysis and 
TCID50 assay results revealed that the addition of 10 μM resveratrol to cells 
after adsorption of PHEV significantly reduced 56% PHEV mRNA copy number and 
eightfold virus titer. 10 µM resveratrol treatment reduced 46% PHEV mRNA copy 
number and fourfold virus titer in virus inactivation assay. Moreover, the in 
vivo data obtained in this work also demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited 
PHEV replication, and anti-PHEV activities of resveratrol treatment via 
intranasal installation displayed better than oral gavage.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that resveratrol exerted antiviral effects 
under various drug treatment and virus infection conditions in vitro and holds 
promise as a treatment for PHEV infection in vivo."
122,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer and the 
second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. CRC patients present with 
an increase in pathogens in their gut microbiota, such as polyketide 
synthase-positive bacteria (pks +) and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis 
(ETBF). The pks + Escherichia coli promotes carcinogenesis and facilitates CRC 
progression through the production of colibactin, a genotoxin that induces 
double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). ETBF is a procarcinogenic bacterium producing 
the B. fragilis toxin (bft) that promotes colorectal carcinogenesis by 
modulating the mucosal immune response and inducing epithelial cell changes.
METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from healthy controls (N = 62) and CRC 
patients (N = 94) from the province of Québec (Canada), and a bacterial DNA 
extraction was performed. Fecal DNA samples were then examined for the presence 
of the pks island gene and bft using conventional qualitative PCR.
RESULTS: We found that a high proportion of healthy controls are colonized by 
pks + bacteria (42%) and that these levels were similar in CRC patients (46%). 
bft was detected in 21% of healthy controls and 32% of CRC patients, while 
double colonization by both pks + bacteria and ETBF occurred in 8% of the 
healthy controls and 13% of the CRC patients. Most importantly, we found that 
early-onset CRC (< 50 years) patients were significantly less colonized with 
pks + bacteria (20%) compared to late-onset CRC patients (52%).
CONCLUSIONS: Healthy controls had similar levels of pks + bacteria and ETBF 
colonization as CRC patients, and their elevated levels may place both groups at 
greater risk of developing CRC. Colonization with pks + bacteria was less 
prevalent in early-compared to late-onset CRC."
123,"Semantic dementia (SD) is a clinical subtype of frontotemporal dementia 
consistent with the neuropathological diagnosis frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration (FTLD) TDP type C, with characteristic round TDP-43 protein 
inclusions in the dentate gyrus. Despite this striking clinicopathological 
concordance, the pathogenic mechanisms are largely unexplained forestalling the 
development of targeted therapeutics. To address this, we carried out laser 
capture microdissection of the dentate gyrus of 15 SD patients and 17 
non-demented controls, and assessed relative protein abundance changes by 
label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. To identify SD specific proteins, we 
compared our results to eight other FTLD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) proteomic 
datasets of cortical brain tissue, parallel with functional enrichment analyses 
and protein-protein interactions (PPI). Of the total 5,354 quantified proteins, 
151 showed differential abundance in SD patients (adjusted P-value < 0.01). 
Seventy-nine proteins were considered potentially SD specific as these were not 
detected, or demonstrated insignificant or opposite change in FTLD/AD. 
Functional enrichment indicated an overrepresentation of pathways related to the 
immune response, metabolic processes, and cell-junction assembly. PPI analysis 
highlighted a cluster of interacting proteins associated with adherens junction 
and cadherin binding, the cadherin-catenin complex. Multiple proteins in this 
complex showed significant upregulation in SD, including β-catenin (CTNNB1), 
γ-catenin (JUP), and N-cadherin (CDH2), which were not observed in other 
neurodegenerative proteomic studies, and hence may resemble SD specific 
involvement. A trend of upregulation of all three proteins was observed by 
immunoblotting of whole hippocampus tissue, albeit only significant for 
N-cadherin. In summary, we discovered a specific increase of cell adhesion 
proteins in SD constituting the cadherin-catenin complex at the synaptic 
membrane, essential for synaptic signaling. Although further investigation and 
validation are warranted, we anticipate that these findings will help unravel 
the disease processes underlying SD."
124,"Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) require chemotherapy due to 
late detection, rapid disease progression, and low surgical resection rate. 
Tumor cell lines are extremely important in cancer research for drug discovery 
and development. Here, we established and characterized a new intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma cell line, ICC-X1. STR testing confirmed the absence of 
cross-contamination and high similarity to the original tissue. ICC-X1 exhibited 
typical epithelial morphology and formed tumor spheres in the suspension 
culture. The population doubling time was approximately 48 h. The cell line had 
a complex hypotriploid karyotype. The cell line exhibited a strong migration 
ability in vitro and cell inoculation into BALB/c nude mice led to the formation 
of xenografts. Additionally, ICC-X1 cells were sensitive to gemcitabine and 
paclitaxel but resistant to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. RNA sequencing 
revealed that the upregulated cancer-related genes were mainly enriched in 
several signaling pathways, including the TNF signaling pathway, NOD-like 
receptor signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The downregulated 
cancer-related genes were mainly enriched in the Rap1 signaling pathway and 
Hippo signaling pathway among other pathways. In conclusion, we have created a 
new ICC cell line derived from Chinese patients. This cell line can be used as a 
preclinical model to study ICC, specifically tumor metastasis and drug 
resistance mechanisms."
125,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits mitochondrial dysfunctions 
associated with dysregulated metabolism, brain inflammation, synaptic loss, and 
neuronal cell death. As a key protein serving as the mitochondrial gatekeeper, 
the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) that controls metabolism and Ca2+ 
homeostasis is positioned at a convergence point for various cell survival and 
death signals. Here, we targeted VDAC1 with VBIT-4, a newly developed inhibitor 
of VDAC1 that prevents its pro-apoptotic activity, and mitochondria dysfunction.
METHODS: To address the multiple pathways involved in AD, neuronal cultures and 
a 5 × FAD mouse model of AD were treated with VBIT-4. We addressed multiple 
topics related to the disease and its molecular mechanisms using immunoblotting, 
immunofluorescence, q-RT-PCR, 3-D structural analysis and several behavioral 
tests.
RESULTS: In neuronal cultures, amyloid-beta (Aβ)-induced VDAC1 and p53 
overexpression and apoptotic cell death were prevented by VBIT-4. Using an 
AD-like 5 × FAD mouse model, we showed that VDAC1 was overexpressed in neurons 
surrounding Aβ plaques, but not in astrocytes and microglia, and this was 
associated with neuronal cell death. VBIT-4 prevented the associated 
pathophysiological changes including neuronal cell death, neuroinflammation, and 
neuro-metabolic dysfunctions. VBIT-4 also switched astrocytes and microglia from 
being pro-inflammatory/neurotoxic to neuroprotective phenotype. Moreover, VBIT-4 
prevented cognitive decline in the 5 × FAD mice as evaluated using several 
behavioral assessments of cognitive function. Interestingly, VBIT-4 protected 
against AD pathology, with no significant change in phosphorylated Tau and only 
a slight decrease in Aβ-plaque load.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction with its 
gatekeeper VDAC1 is a promising target for AD therapeutic intervention, and 
VBIT-4 is a promising drug candidate for AD treatment."
126,"BACKGROUND: With the largest cattle population in Africa and vast swathes of 
fertile lands infested by tsetse flies, trypanosomosis is a major challenge for 
Ethiopian farmers. Managing the problem strategically and rationally requires 
comprehensive and detailed information on disease and vector distribution at the 
national level. To this end, the National Institute for Control and Eradication 
of Tsetse and Trypanosomosis (NICETT) developed a national atlas of tsetse and 
African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) for Ethiopia.
METHODS: This first edition of the atlas focused on the tsetse-infested areas in 
western Ethiopia. Data were collected between 2010 and 2019 in the framework of 
national surveillance and control activities. Over 88,000 animals, mostly 
cattle, were tested with the buffy-coat technique (BCT). Odour-enhanced traps 
were deployed in approximately 14,500 locations for the entomological surveys. 
Animal- and trap-level data were geo-referenced, harmonized and centralized in a 
single database.
RESULTS: AAT occurrence was confirmed in 86% of the districts surveyed 
(107/124). An overall prevalence of 4.8% was detected by BCT in cattle. The mean 
packed cell volume (PCV) of positive animals was 22.4, compared to 26.1 of the 
negative. Trypanosoma congolense was responsible for 61.9% of infections, T. 
vivax for 35.9% and T. brucei for 1.7%. Four tsetse species were found to have a 
wide geographic distribution. The highest apparent density (AD) was reported for 
Glossina pallidipes in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region 
(SNNPR) (3.57 flies/trap/day). Glossina tachinoides was the most abundant in 
Amhara (AD 2.39), Benishangul-Gumuz (2.38), Gambela (1.16) and Oromia (0.94) 
regions. Glossina fuscipes fuscipes and G. morsitans submorsitans were detected 
at lower densities (0.19 and 0.42 respectively). Only one specimen of G. 
longipennis was captured.
CONCLUSIONS: The atlas establishes a reference for the distribution of tsetse 
and AAT in Ethiopia. It also provides crucial evidence to plan surveillance and 
monitor control activities at the national level. Future work on the atlas will 
focus on the inclusion of data collected by other stakeholders, the broadening 
of the coverage to tsetse-free areas and continuous updates. The extension of 
the atlas to data on control activities is also envisaged."
127,"BACKGROUND: The surface coating of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticle (MNPs) 
drives their intracellular trafficking and degradation in endolysosomes, as well 
as dictating other cellular outcomes. As such, we assessed whether MNP coatings 
might influence their biodistribution, their accumulation in certain organs and 
their turnover therein, processes that must be understood in vivo to optimize 
the design of nanoformulations for specific therapeutic/diagnostic needs.
RESULTS: In this study, three different MNP coatings were analyzed, each 
conferring the identical 12 nm iron oxide cores with different physicochemical 
characteristics: 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APS), dextran (DEX), and 
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). When the biodistribution of these MNPs was 
analyzed in C57BL/6 mice, they all mainly accumulated in the spleen and liver 
one week after administration. The coating influenced the proportion of the MNPs 
in each organ, with more APS-MNPs accumulating in the spleen and more DMSA-MNPs 
accumulating in the liver, remaining there until they were fully degraded. The 
changes in the physicochemical properties of the MNPs (core size and magnetic 
properties) was also assessed during their intracellular degradation when 
internalized by two murine macrophage cell lines. The decrease in the size of 
the MNPs iron core was influenced by their coating and the organ in which they 
accumulated. Finally, MNP degradation was analyzed in the liver and spleen of 
C57BL/6 mice from 7 days to 15 months after the last intravenous MNP 
administration.
CONCLUSIONS: The MNPs degraded at different rates depending on the organ and 
their coating, the former representing the feature that was fundamental in 
determining the time they persisted. In the liver, the rate of degradation was 
similar for all three coatings, and it was faster than in the spleen. This 
information regarding the influence of coatings on the in vivo degradation of 
MNPs will help to choose the best coating for each biomedical application 
depending on the specific clinical requirements."
128,"BACKGROUND: Sushi domain-containing protein 4 (SUSD4) is a recently discovered 
protein with unknown cellular functions. We previously revealed that SUSD4 can 
act as complement inhibitor and as a potential tumor suppressor.
METHODS: In a syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer, tumors expressing SUSD4 
had a smaller volume compared with the corresponding mock control tumors. 
Additionally, data from three different expression databases and online analysis 
tools confirm that for breast cancer patients, high mRNA expression of SUSD4 in 
the tumor tissue correlates with a better prognosis. In vitro experiments 
utilized triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (BT-20 and MDA-MB-468) stably 
expressing SUSD4. Moreover, we established a cell line based on BT-20 in which 
the gene for EGFR was knocked out with the CRISPR-Cas9 method.
RESULTS: We discovered that the Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) 
interacts with SUSD4. Furthermore, triple-negative breast cancer cell lines 
stably expressing SUSD4 had higher autophagic flux. The initiation of autophagy 
required the expression of EGFR but not phosphorylation of the receptor. 
Expression of SUSD4 in the breast cancer cells led to activation of the tumor 
suppressor LKB1 and consequently to the activation of AMPKα1. Finally, autophagy 
was initiated after stimulation of the ULK1, Atg14 and Beclin-1 axis in SUSD4 
expressing cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study we provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism 
of action whereby SUSD4 acts as an EGFR inhibitor without affecting the 
phosphorylation of the receptor and may potentially influence the recycling of 
EGFR to the plasma membrane."
129,"BACKGROUND: Airway fibrosis is one of the pathological characteristics of severe 
asthma. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β has been known to promote 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition formation and to play a role in the 
progression of tissue fibrosis. Cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2) 
and fibronectin (FN) are well-known markers of EMT and fibrosis. However, 
whether AREG is involved in TGF-β-induced CCN2 and FN expression in human lung 
epithelial cells is unknown.
METHODS: AREG and FN were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining on 
ovalbumin-challenged mice. CCN2 and FN expression were evaluated in human lung 
epithelial (A459) cells following TGF or AREG treatment for the indicated times. 
Secreted AREG from A549 cells was detected by ELISA. Cell migration was observed 
by a wound healing assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to detect the 
c-Jun binding to the CCN2 promoter.
RESULTS: AREG and FN expression colocalized in lung tissues from mice with 
ovalbumin-induced asthma by immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, TGF-β caused 
the release of AREG from A549 cells into the medium. Smad3 siRNA down-regulated 
AREG expression. AREG also stimulated CCN2 and FN expression, JNK and c-Jun 
phosphorylation, and cell migration in A549 cells. AREG small interfering (si) 
RNA inhibited TGF-β-induced expression of CCN2, FN, and cell migration. 
Furthermore, AREG-induced CCN2 and FN expression were inhibited by EGFR siRNA, a 
JNK inhibitor (SP600125), and an activator protein-1 (AP-1) inhibitor 
(curcumin). EGFR siRNA attenuated AREG-induced JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. 
Moreover, SP600125 downregulated AREG-induced c-Jun phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: These results suggested that AREG mediates the TGF-β-induced EMT in 
human lung epithelial cells through EGFR/JNK/AP-1 activation. Understanding the 
role of AREG in the EMT could foster the development of therapeutic strategies 
for airway remodeling in severe asthma."
130,"BACKGROUND: Ginsenoside compound K (GC-K) potentially alleviates ulcerative 
colitis involved in gut microbiota, which is significantly associated with the 
occurrence and development of colitis. However, the effect and mechanism of GC-K 
on anti-colitis in relation to gut microbiota are not clear. This study focused 
on the prevention and mechanism of GC-K on Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced 
colitis of mice pertinent to gut microbiota.
METHODS: DSS was used to establish a chronic colitis mouse model. Body weight 
analysis, colon length measurement, HE staining, and inflammatory factors levels 
were processed in animal experiments. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze 
Th17/Treg cells in the mouse spleen and blood. 16S rRNA sequencing was utilized 
to analyze gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was 
employed to verify the anti-colitis efficacy of GC-K by reshaping gut 
microbiota.
RESULTS: GC-K significantly relieved colitis-related symptoms due to decreased 
disease activity index (DAI) scores, spleen weight, and increased colon length. 
Additionally, the tight junction proteins were increased, and the 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-17, were decreased 
after GC-K treatment. Furthermore, Bacteroides spp. significantly increased 
after modeling. Moreover, FMT experiments confirmed that GC-K-driven gut 
microbiota greatly relieved DSS-induced colitis.
CONCLUSION: GC-K alleviated colitis via the modulation of gut microbiota."
131,"BACKGROUND: Itaconic acid, an unsaturated C5 dicarbonic acid, has significant 
market demand and prospects. It has numerous biological functions, such as 
anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative in medicine, and is an 
essential renewable platform chemical in industry. However, the development of 
industrial itaconic acid production by Aspergillus terreus, the current standard 
production strain, is hampered by the unavoidable drawbacks of that species. 
Developing a highly efficient cell factory is essential for the sustainable and 
green production of itaconic acid.
RESULTS: This study employed combinatorial engineering strategies to construct 
Escherichia coli cells to produce itaconic acid efficiently. Two essential genes 
(cis-aconitate decarboxylase (CAD) encoding gene cadA and aconitase (ACO) 
encoding gene acn) employed various genetic constructs and plasmid combinations 
to create 12 recombination E. coli strains to be screened. Among them, E. coli 
BL-CAC exhibited the highest titer with citrate as substrate, and the induction 
and reaction conditions were further systematically optimized. Subsequently, 
employing enzyme evolution to optimize rate-limiting enzyme CAD and synthesizing 
protein scaffolds to co-localize ACO and CAD were used to improve itaconic acid 
biosynthesis efficiency. Under the optimized reaction conditions combined with 
the feeding control strategy, itaconic acid titer reached 398.07 mM (51.79 g/L) 
of engineered E. coli BL-CAR470E-DS/A-CS cells as a catalyst with the highest 
specific production of 9.42 g/g(DCW) among heterologous hosts at 48 h.
CONCLUSIONS: The excellent catalytic performance per unit biomass shows the 
potential for high-efficiency production of itaconic acid and effective 
reduction of catalytic cell consumption. This study indicates that it is 
necessary to continuously explore engineering strategies to develop 
high-performance cell factories to break through the existing bottleneck and 
achieve the economical commercial production of itaconic acid."
132,"INTRODUCTION: Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) and T 
cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) have overlapping 
histological features that make their diagnosis challenging. Insulin-like growth 
factor II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is a recently proposed diagnostic marker 
for Hodgkin's lymphoma. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of 
IMP3 in differentiating NLPHL from THRLBCL.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
blocks from 56 patients (28 NLPHL and 28 large B cell lymphoma (LBCL, including 
16 THRLBCL and 12 DLBCL, NOS) cases based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) were 
included. Sample sections were stained for IMP3 using IHC method. Moderate to 
strong staining in at least 10% of tumor cells was considered positive IMP3 
expression.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 41.25 ± 16.08 years old. The majority 
of the patients were male. There was a significant age difference between NLPHL 
(34.61 ± 16.44 years old) and LBCL (47.89 ± 12.85 years) groups (p = 0.001). No 
significant difference was seen in gender and site between NLPHL and LBCL 
groups. The expression of IMP3 was mainly strong in LBCL group, while it was 
heterogeneously distributed among NLPHL samples ranging from weak to strong 
(p < 0.001). It was determined that strong IMP3 expression at 55.00% can 
differentiate LBCL from NLPHL with 71.4% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that IMP3 may be a good complement in 
differentiating NLPHL cases from THRLBCL."
133,"BACKGROUND: There had been isolated reports of the presence of novel Theileria 
annulata genotypes based on the 18S rRNA gene sequence data from India, Pakistan 
and Saudi Arabia; but, these studies were restricted to limited field samples. 
Additionally, no comparative study has been conducted on all the isolates of 
this parasite from different countries whose sequences are available in the 
nucleotide databases. Therefore, we aimed to study the genetic diversity of T. 
annulata based on all available nearly complete 18S rRNA gene sequences in the 
GenBank™. Out of a total of 312 gene sequences of T. annulata available in the 
NCBI database, only 70 nearly complete sequences (> 1527 bp) were used for 
multiple sequence alignment.
RESULTS: The maximum likelihood tree obtained using TN93 + G + I model 
manifested two major clades. All the valid host-cell transforming Theileria 
species clustered in one clade. The T. annulata designated sequences occupying 
this clade clustered together, excluding two isolates (DQ287944 and EU083799), 
and represented the true T. annulata sequences (n = 54). DQ287944 and EU083799 
exhibited close association with Theileria lestoquardi. In addition, 14 Indian 
sequences formed a large monophyletic group with published Theileria orientalis 
sequences. The broad range of sequence identity (95.8-100%) of T. annulata 
designated sequences indicated the presence of different Theileria spp. A closer 
analysis revealed the presence of three Theileria spp., namely, T. annulata, T. 
orientalis, and two isolates (DQ287944 and EU083799) closely related to T. 
lestoquardi. The true T. annulata sequences manifested 98.8-100% nucleotide 
identity within them. EU083799 and 14 misidentified Indian T. annulata sequences 
exhibited the highest similarity with T. lestoquardi (98.6-98.8%) and T. 
orientalis (98.0-99.9%) in comparison with the other Theileria spp. of domestic 
and wild ruminants.
CONCLUSION: In the course of analyzing the genetic diversity of T. annulata, we 
identified the nearly complete 18S rRNA gene sequences of other Theileria spp. 
that have not only been misidentified as T. annulata in the GenBank™, but are 
also published as T. annulata. Moreover, a high level of sequence conservation 
was noticed in the 18S rRNA gene of true T. annulata and T. orientalis 
sequences."
134,"Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with multifaceted drug resistance mechanisms 
(e.g., tumour microenvironment [TME], tumour heterogeneity, and immune evasion). 
Natural products are interesting repository of bioactive molecules, especially 
those with anticancer activities. Prodigiosin, a red pigment produced by 
Serratia marcescens, possesses inherent anticancer characteristics, showing 
interesting antitumour activities in different cancers (e.g., breast, gastric) 
with low or without harmful effects on normal cells. The present review 
discusses the potential role of prodigiosin in modulating and reprogramming the 
metabolism of the various immune cells in the TME, such as T and B lymphocytes, 
tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), natural killer (NK) cells, and 
tumour-associated dendritic cells (TADCs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
(MDSCs) which in turn might introduce as an immunomodulator in cancer therapy."
135,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has insidious onset, late clinical diagnosis and 
high recurrence rate, which leads to poor quality of patient life. Therefore, it 
is necessary to further explore the pathogenesis and therapy targets of NPC. 
BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B (BUB1B) was found to be 
up-regulated in a variety of cancers, but only two previous study showed that 
BUB1B was overexpressed in NPC and the sample size was small. The clinical role 
of BUB1B expression and its underlying mechanism in NPC require more in-depth 
research. Immunohistochemical samples and public RNA-seq data indicated that 
BUB1B protein and mRNA expression levels were up-regulated in NPC, and summary 
receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that BUB1B expression level 
had a strong ability to distinguish NPC tissues from non-NPC tissues. Gene 
ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes were performed and revealed 
that BUB1B and its related genes were mainly involved in cell cycle and DNA 
replication. Protein- Protein Interaction were built to interpret the BUB1B 
molecular mechanism. Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) could be the upstream 
regulation factor of BUB1B, which was verified by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation 
Sequencing samples. In summary, BUB1B was highly expressed in NPC, and HDAC2 may 
affect cell cycle by regulating BUB1B to promote cancer progression."
136,"BACKGROUND: Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare kind of anterior segment 
dysgenesis (ASD). The most common ocular features of ARS are posterior 
embryotoxon and iris hypoplasia, while some patients may manifest as corneal 
opacity and edema. However, the current understanding of how ARS affects the 
cornea is still incomplete. This study reports a novel histopathological finding 
of ARS, complicating corneal abnormalities, including congenital corneal opacity 
and irreversible endothelial decompensation.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 6 eyes of 3 ARS patients, 5 of which 
underwent keratoplasty for irreversible endothelial decompensation from May 2016 
to January 2019. No eye had a history of surgery. We reviewed the data of 
epidemiology, clinical manifestations and histopathologic examinations.
RESULTS: Five eyes developed irreversible endothelial decompensation, among 
which 4 were born with corneal opacity. One eye exhibited transparent cornea but 
showed a continuous loss of endothelial cells in the absence of surgery and 
elevated intraocular pressure thereafter. Anterior segment optical coherence 
tomography photographs showed that anterior synechia existed in the area with 
corneal opacities, where we found the interlayer splitting of the Descemet 
membrane inserted by hypoplastic iris and a basement membrane-like structure 
under a light microscope.
CONCLUSION: Anterior synechia might be associated with corneal abnormalities in 
ARS patients. The novel histopathologic finding revealed the internal relation 
between anterior segment dysgenesis and would help explore the inner mechanism 
of corneal abnormalities in ARS."
137,"BACKGROUND: In the late phase of production, ducks untimely cease laying, 
leading to a lower feed conversion. Liver plays a vital role in the synthesis 
and transport of yolk materials during egg formation in birds. However, the 
molecular mechanism of liver in ceased-laying duck is far from clear, higher 
resolution and deeper analysis is needed. Sing-cell RNA-sequencing of 
10 × Genomics platform can help to map the liver single cell gene expression 
atlas of Shaoxing duck and provide new insights into the liver between 
egg-laying and ceased-laying ducks.
RESULTS: About 20,000 single cells were profiled and 22 clusters were 
identified. All the clusters were identified as 6 cell types. The dominant cell 
type is hepatocyte, accounted for about 60% of all the cells. Of note, the 
heterogeneity of cells between egg-laying duck and ceased-laying duck mainly 
occurred in hepatocytes. Cells of cluster 3 and 12 were the unique hepatocyte 
states of egg-laying ducks, while cells of cluster 0 and 15 were the unique 
hepatocyte states of ceased-laying ducks. The expression mode of yolk precursor 
transporters, lipid metabolizing enzymes and fibrinogens were different in 
hepatocytes between egg-laying duck and ceased-laying duck. APOV1, VTG2, VTG1, 
APOB, RBP, VTDB and SCD might be activated in egg-laying ducks, while APOA1, 
APOA4, APOC3, FGB and FGG might be activated in ceased-laying ducks.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study further proofs that APOV1 and APOB play key roles in egg 
production, rather than APOA1 and APOA4. It is also the first to detect a 
correlation between the higher expression of APOC3, FGB, FGG and ceased-laying 
in duck."
138,"BACKGROUND: AT1 receptor gene (AGTR1) is related to essential hypertension (EH), 
and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and arterial stiffness are common 
complications of EH. This study aimed to explore the association between AGTR1 
genotype and LVH and arterial stiffness in EH patients.
METHODS: A total of 179 EH patients were recruited in this study. Oral 
exfoliated cells were collected from each patient, and the genetic polymorphism 
of AGTR1(rs4524238) was assessed using a gene sequencing platform. The outcomes 
were LVH and arterial stiffness.
RESULTS: Among 179 patients, 114 were with AGTR1 genotype of GG (57 males, aged 
59.54 ± 13.49 years) and 65 were with AGTR1 genotype of GA or AA (36 males, aged 
61.28 ± 12.79 years). Patients with AGTR1 genotype of GG were more likely to 
have LVH (47 [41.23%] vs. 14 [21.54%], P = 0.006) and arterial stiffness (30 
[26.32%] vs. 8 [12.31%], P = 0.036). The AGTR1 polymorphism frequency was in 
accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.291). The multivariate 
logistic regression showed that AGTR1 genotype of GA or AA was independently 
associated with lower risk of LVH (OR = 0.344, 95%CI 160~0.696, P = 0.003) and 
arterial stiffness (OR = 0.371, 95%CI 0.155~0.885, P = 0.025) after adjusting 
for gender, age, and diabetes.
CONCLUSION: EH patients with the AGTR1 genotype of GA or AA were at lower risk 
for LVH and arterial stiffness than those with the GG genotype."
139,"Our previous study using systems vaccinology identified an association between 
the sterol regulatory binding protein (SREBP) pathway and humoral immune 
response to vaccination in humans. To investigate the role of SREBP signaling in 
modulating immune responses, we generated mice with B cell- or CD11c+ 
antigen-presenting cell (APC)-specific deletion of SCAP, an essential regulator 
of SREBP signaling. Ablation of SCAP in CD11c+ APCs had no effect on immune 
responses. In contrast, SREBP signaling in B cells was critical for antibody 
responses, as well as the generation of germinal centers,memory B cells and bone 
marrow plasma cells. SREBP signaling was required for metabolic reprogramming in 
activated B cells. Upon mitogen stimulation, SCAP-deficient B cells could not 
proliferate and had decreased lipid rafts. Deletion of SCAP in germinal center B 
cells using AID-Cre decreased lipid raft content and cell cycle progression. 
These studies provide mechanistic insights coupling sterol metabolism with the 
quality and longevity of humoral immunity."
140,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells have an immunosuppressive function and highly express 
the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment; however, the 
function of PD-1 in tumor-infiltrating (TI) Treg cells remains controversial. 
Here, we showed that conditional deletion of PD-1 in Treg cells delayed tumor 
progression. In Pdcd1fl/flFoxp3eGFP-Cre-ERT2(+/-) mice, in which both 
PD-1-expressing and PD-1-deficient Treg cells coexisted in the same tissue 
environment, conditional deletion of PD-1 in Treg cells resulted in impairment 
of the proliferative and suppressive capacity of TI Treg cells. PD-1 antibody 
therapy reduced the TI Treg cell numbers, but did not directly restore the 
cytokine production of TI CD8+ T cells in TC-1 lung cancer. Single-cell analysis 
indicated that PD-1 signaling promoted lipid metabolism, proliferation and 
suppressive pathways in TI Treg cells. These results suggest that PD-1 ablation 
or inhibition can enhance antitumor immunity by weakening Treg cell lineage 
stability and metabolic fitness in the tumor microenvironment."
141,"Lung fibroblasts play an important role in subepithelial fibrosis, one feature 
for airway remodeling. IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-M was shown to 
involve fibrosis formation in airways and lung through regulation of 
inflammatory responses. IRAK-M is expressed by lung fibroblasts, whether IRAK-M 
has direct impact on lung fibroblasts remains unclear. In this investigation, we 
evaluated in vitro effect of IRAK-M on phenotypes of lung fibroblasts by 
silencing or overexpressing IRAK-M. Murine lung fibroblasts (MLg) were 
stimulated with house dust mite (HDM), IL-33, and transforming growth factor 
(TGF) β1. Techniques of small interfering RNA or expression plasmid were 
employed to silence or overexpress IRAK-M in MLg fibroblast cells. 
Proliferation, migration, invasiveness, and fibrosis-related events were 
evaluated. Significant upregulation of IRAK-M expression in MLg cells was caused 
by these stimuli. Silencing IRAK-M significantly increased proliferation, 
migration, and invasiveness of lung fibroblasts regardless of stimulating 
conditions. By contrast, IRAK-M overexpression significantly inhibited 
proliferation and motility of MLg lung fibroblasts. IRAK-M overexpression also 
significantly decreased the expression of fibronectin, collagen I, and α-SMA in 
MLg cells. Under stimulation with TGFβ1 or IL-33, IRAK-M silencing reduced MMP9 
production, while IRAK-M overexpression increased MMP9 production. Modulation of 
IRAK-M expression affected cytokines production, either decreased or increased 
expression of TNFα and CXCL10 by the cells regardless of stimulation. Our in 
vitro data reveal that IRAK-M directly impacts on lung fibroblasts through 
modulation of cellular motility, release of inflammatory, and fibrotic cytokines 
of lung fibroblasts. These might suggest a new target by regulation of IRAK-M in 
slowing airway remodeling."
142,"Bone marrow studies currently provide a lot of valuable information in the 
diagnostics of hematological diseases including hematopoietic stem cells 
disorders. Our studies on low-molecular weight organic compounds in bone marrow 
stem cell niche in various pathogenic conditions, revealed relatively high 
variability of histamine levels in different groups of hematological diseases. 
It was also found that serotonin levels were significantly lower than those 
typically measured in peripheral blood as well as many have the influence on 
stem cells proliferative potential. This paper presents findings from 
quantitative and statistical analyses of histamine and serotonin levels. Bone 
marrow collected from patients undergoing routine diagnostic procedures for 
hematological diseases and receiving inpatient treatment were analyzed. 
Histamine and serotonin levels were measured using hydrophilic interaction 
liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Obtained 
data were analyzed statistically and correlated with the diagnosed groups of 
hematological diseases and the parameters of complete blood counts. Histamine 
was found in all tested samples, including those from patients without 
malignancy, and the reported levels were comparable to the reference values in 
blood. This observation allows us to assume that bone marrow cells can produce 
and accumulate histamine. Moreover, the statistical analysis revealed a 
significant relationship between histamine levels and diagnosed mastocytosis, 
and between histamine levels and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Different results 
were obtained for serotonin, and its concentrations in most cases were below the 
limit of quantification of the method used (< 0.2 ng/mL), which can only be 
compared to peripheral blood plasma. In a few cases, significantly higher 
serotonin levels were observed and it concerned diseases associated with an 
increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow."
143,"Biofilms are cell assemblies embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix formed by 
microorganisms of a single or many different species. This matrix in which they 
are embedded protects the bacteria from external influences and antimicrobial 
effects. The biofilm structure that microorganisms form to protect themselves 
from harsh environmental conditions and survive is found in nature in many 
different environments. These environments where biofilm formation occurs have 
in common that they are in contact with fluids. The gene expression of bacteria 
in complex biofilm differs from that of bacteria in the planktonic state. The 
differences in biofilm cell expression are one of the effects of community life. 
Means of quorum sensing, bacteria can act in coordination with each other. At 
the same time, while biofilm formation provides many benefits to bacteria, it 
has positive and negative effects in many different areas. Depending on where 
they occur, biofilms can cause serious health problems, contamination risks, 
corrosion, and heat and efficiency losses. However, they can also be used in 
water treatment plants, bioremediation, and energy production with microbial 
fuel cells. In this review, the basic steps of biofilm formation and biofilm 
regulation in the model organism Escherichia coli were discussed. Finally, the 
methods by which biofilm formation can be detected and monitored were briefly 
discussed."
144,"In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified that has caused significant morbidity 
and mortality worldwide. Like all RNA viruses, severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) evolves over time through random mutation 
resulting in genetic variations in the population. Although the currently 
approved coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines can be given to those over 5 years of 
age and older in most countries, strikingly, the number of people diagnosed 
positive for SARS-Cov-2 is still increasing. Therefore, to prevent and control 
this epidemic, early diagnosis of infected individuals is of great importance. 
The current detection of SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus variants are mainly based on 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Although the sensitivity of 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is high, it has some 
disadvantages, for example, multiple temperature changes, long detection time, 
complicated operation, expensive instruments, and the need for professional 
personnel, which brings considerable inconvenience to the early diagnosis of 
this virus. This review comprehensively summarizes the development and 
application of various current detection technologies for novel coronaviruses, 
including isothermal amplification, CRISPR-Cas detection, serological detection, 
biosensor, ensemble, and microfluidic technology, along with next-generation 
sequencing. Those findings offer us a great potential to replace or combine with 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detection to achieve the purpose 
of allowing predictive diagnostics and targeted prevention of SARS-Cov-2 in the 
future."
145,"Sperm cells are target cells for both estrogens and xenoestrogens. Due to the 
specific structure of spermatozoa, these hormonal compounds may act on sperm in 
a non-genomic mechanism only. However, the ESR-mediated signaling pathways are 
still poorly understood. In this study, we obtained 119 samples from male 
participants of Caucasian descent who donated semen for standard analysis. We 
analyzed gene expression of estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and their 
coregulators-proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), and 
cellular kinase c-Src (SRC). RNA level was established using reverse-transcribed 
RNA as a template, followed by a polymerase chain reaction. Proteins' presence 
was confirmed by western blot and immunocytochemistry techniques. ""Normal"" 
values of semen parameters were defined as follows: > 32% sperm with progressive 
motility, > 4% sperm cells with normal morphology, > 15 × 106 sperm per 
mL, > 58% live spermatozoa and leukocyte amount < 106 cells per mL, according to 
WHO 2010 reference. Semen parameters that deviated from these ""normal"" values 
were labeled as ""abnormal"". Gene expression ratios revealed significant, 
moderate, and negative correlations for ESR1/ESR2 and weak, negative ESR2/PELP1 
correlations in the subgroup of patients with abnormal values of semen 
parameters. In addition, SRC/PELP1 was moderately and positively correlated in 
the subgroup with parameters within the reference values established by WHO 
2010. Our study showed that both PELP1 scaffolding protein and SRC kinase might 
influence semen quality via ESRs. It seems that not the expression of a single 
gene may affect the sperm quality, but more gene-to-gene mutual ratio. 
Characterization of estrogen-signaling pathway-related genes' modulated 
expression in sperm cells could aid in better understanding sperm biology and 
quality."
146,"This study aimed to explore the role of ribosomal protein L8 (RPL8) in 
controlling hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) development. We measured RPL8 
expression, apoptosis, cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, 
glucose uptake, lactate production, and the ATP/ADP ratio of LIHC cells to 
investigate the effect of RPL8 on LIHC. Bioinformatic analysis was employed to 
analyse RPL8 expression and its potential mechanism in LIHC. RPL8 was 
upregulated in LIHC tissues and cells. RPL8 silencing accelerated apoptosis and 
suppressed viability, growth, and movement of LIHC cells. Additionally, RPL8 
silencing inhibited glycolysis in LIHC cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 
that RPL8 is regulated by the upstream transcription factor upstream stimulating 
factor 1 (USF1) and activates the mTORC1 signalling pathway. USF1 overexpression 
eliminated the inhibitory effect of RPL8 silencing in LIHC cells. RPL8 
overexpression increased cell growth, movement, and glycolysis in LIHC. However, 
inhibition of the mTORC1 signalling pathway eliminated the effect of RPL8 
overexpression on LIHC cells. In conclusion, RPL8 may affect LIHC progression by 
regulating the mTORC1 signalling pathway."
147,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is implicated in the injury of several organs, including 
the brain resulting in neuronal damage, which may lead to cognitive impairment 
and dementia. Additionally, it is linked to inflammation, cytokine release, 
apoptosis and various degenerative conditions. Astrocytes and microglia might 
have a role in mediating these processes. Caffeine, a psychoactive beverage, has 
been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive and memory impairment. This study 
proposes anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic role of caffeine, which can be 
mediated via microglia/astrocyte activation and overexpression of 
pro-inflammatory molecules. T2D was induced in rats by feeding with high fat 
high sugar diet and injecting a single low dose streptozotocin (STZ) 
intraperitoneally. Other diabetic rats were given caffeine orally (in two doses) 
for 5 weeks, starting 1 week before STZ injection. Measurement of plasma 
cytokines, TNFα and IL6, was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) technique. After sacrificing animals, brains were obtained and processed 
for histological evaluation. Immunohistochemistry was also performed using the 
following primary antibodies, anti-astrocyte marker GFAP, anti-microglia marker 
CD11b and apoptotic marker (anti-cleaved caspase-3). There was upregulation of 
IL6 and TNF-α in diabetic rats. Additionally, histological evaluation of the 
hippocampus of diabetic rats revealed cellular degeneration. There was increased 
immunostaining of GFAP, CD11b and cleaved caspase-3 in diabetic rats. 
Pretreatment with caffeine to diabetic rats, resulted in improvement of 
structural changes and decrease in cytokine levels and immuno-markers, 
expression, and this was in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, caffeine had 
an ameliorative role in enhancing hippocampal degenerative changes in T2D."
148,"Homeostasis of the oviductal infundibulum epithelium is continuously regulated 
by signaling pathways under physiological and pathological conditions. Herein, 
we investigated the expression of hedgehog (Hh) signaling-related components in 
the murine oviductal infundibulum, which is known to maintain homeostasis in the 
adult epithelium. Additionally, using autoimmune disease-prone 
MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice showing abnormal morphofunction of the 
ciliated epithelium of the infundibulum related to the oviductal inflammation, 
we examined the relationship between Hh signaling and pathology of the 
infundibulum. The expression and localization of Pax8, a marker for progenitor 
cells in the oviductal epithelium, and Foxj1, a marker for ciliogenesis, were 
examined in the infundibulum. The results showed that Pax8 was downregulated and 
Foxj1 was upregulated with aging, suggesting that homeostasis of the 
infundibulum epithelium of MRL/lpr mice was disturbed at 6 months of age. In all 
mice, the motile cilia of ciliated epithelial cells in the infundibulum harbored 
Hh signaling pathway-related molecules: patched (Ptch), smoothened (Smo), and 
epithelial cells harbor Gli. In contrast, Ptch, Smo, and Gli2 were significantly 
downregulated in the infundibulum of MRL/lpr mice at 6 months of age. The 
expression levels of Pax8 and Foxj1 were significantly positively correlated 
with those of Ptch1, Smo, and Gli2. Hh signaling is thought to be involved in 
homeostasis of the ciliated epithelium in the infundibulum. In MRL/lpr mice, 
which show exacerbated severe systemic autoimmune abnormalities, molecular 
alterations in Hh signaling-related components are considered to interact with 
local inflammation in the infundibulum, leading to disturbances in epithelial 
homeostasis and reproductive function."
149,"Over the last decade, the use of targeted therapies and immune therapies led to 
drastic changes in the management lung cancer and translated to improved 
survival outcomes. This growing arsenal of therapies available for the 
management of non-small cell lung cancer added more complexity to treatment 
decisions. The genomic profiling of tumors and the molecular characterization of 
the tumor microenvironment gradually became essential steps in exploring and 
identifying markers that can enhance patient selection to facilitate treatment 
personalization and narrow down therapy options. The advent of innovative 
diagnostic platforms, such as next-generation sequencing and plasma genotyping 
(also known as liquid biopsies), has aided in this quest. Currently, programmed 
cell death ligand 1 expression remains the most recognized and fully validated 
predictive biomarker of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Other markers 
such as tumor mutational burden, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, driver 
mutations, and other molecular elements of the tumor microenvironment bear the 
potential to be predictive tools; however, the majority are still 
investigational. In this review, we describe the advances noted thus far on 
currently validated as well as novel emerging biomarkers that have the potential 
to guide the use of immunotherapy agents in the management of non-small cell 
lung cancer."
150,"Engineered destruction of target proteins by recruitment to the cell's 
degradation machinery has emerged as a promising strategy in drug discovery. The 
majority of molecules that facilitate targeted degradation do so via a select 
number of ubiquitin ligases, restricting this therapeutic approach to tissue 
types that express the requisite ligase. Here, we describe a new strategy of 
targeted protein degradation through direct substrate recruitment to the 26S 
proteasome. The proteolytic complex is essential and abundantly expressed in all 
cells; however, proteasomal ligands remain scarce. We identify potent peptidic 
macrocycles that bind directly to the 26S proteasome subunit PSMD2, with a 
2.5-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy complex structure revealing a binding 
site near the 26S pore. Conjugation of this macrocycle to a potent BRD4 ligand 
enabled generation of chimeric molecules that effectively degrade BRD4 in cells, 
thus demonstrating that degradation via direct proteasomal recruitment is a 
viable strategy for targeted protein degradation."
151,"Stress-coping strategies have been implicated in depression. The control of 
stress coping may improve the symptom and higher prevalence of depression during 
the postpartum period in women. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying 
stress coping remain to be fully elucidated in postpartum women. In this study, 
we examined how locus coeruleus-noradrenergic (LC-NA) neurons, which have been 
associated with both stress coping and depression, regulate changes in coping 
style induced by subchronic exposure to unfamiliar male mice as a social threat 
in postpartum female mice. In contrast to virgin females, dams exposed to 
unfamiliar males daily for four consecutive days showed reduced immobility 
duration in the forced swim test, indicating that exposure to unfamiliar males 
decreased passive stress coping in dams. Exposure to unfamiliar males also 
decreased sucrose palatability in the sucrose preference test and suppressed the 
crouching behavior in the maternal care test but did not affect anxiety-like 
behavior in the hole-board test in dams. In fiber photometry analyses, LC-NA 
neurons showed differential activity between dams and virgin females in response 
to unfamiliar males. Chemogenetic inhibition of LC-NA neurons during exposure to 
unfamiliar males prevented the social threat-induced decrease in immobility 
duration in the forced swim test in dams. Furthermore, inhibition or activation 
of LC-NA neurons exacerbated crouching behavior in dams. These results indicate 
that LC-NA neurons regulate the social threat-induced decrease in passive stress 
coping and relieve social threat-induced inhibition of maternal care in 
postpartum female mice."
152,"With the rising number of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT), clinicians are more likely to encounter infectious 
complications in immunocompromised hosts, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
infection. Besides the high mortality of CMV end-organ disease, patients with 
detectable CMV viremia may have worse outcomes and decreased survival even in 
the absence of end-organ disease. In view of the implications on morbidity and 
mortality, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and initiate 
antiviral drugs promptly when CMV infection is confirmed. High-risk patients 
should be identified in order to provide optimal management. Additionally, novel 
antiviral agents with a good safety profile and minor adverse events are now 
available for prophylaxis in high-risk patients and for treatment of resistant 
or refractory CMV infection. The following review provides concise, yet 
comprehensive, guidance on the burden and risk factors of CMV in this 
population, as well as an update on the latest evidence for the management of 
CMV infection."
153,"Complex mixtures of unknown contaminants present a challenge to identify 
toxicological risks without using large numbers of animals and labor-intensive 
screens of all organs. This study examined soil extracts from a 
legacy-contaminated pesticide packaging and blending site. HepG2 cytotoxicity 
was used as an initial screen of 18 soil samples; then, three extracts (A, B and 
C) from different locations at the study site were used for testing in animals. 
The first two extracts were identified as the most toxic in vitro, and the 
latter extract obtained from a location further from these two toxic sampling 
sites. Then, target organ toxicities were identified following biweekly oral 
gavage for one month of three soil extracts (0.1% in polyethylene glycol or PEG) 
compared to vehicle control in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 9-10/group). 
Exposure to extract A significantly increased neutrophils and lymphocytes 
compared to control. In contrast, all extracts increased plasma α-2 
macroglobulin and caused mild-to-moderate lymphocytic proliferation within the 
spleen white pulp, all indicative of inflammation. Rats exposed to all soil 
extracts exhibited acute tubular necrosis. Cholinesterase activity was 
significantly reduced in plasma, but not brain, after exposure to extract A 
compared to control. Increased hepatic ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase activity 
compared to control was observed following exposure to extracts A and B. 
Exposure to soil extract C in rats showed a prolonged QTc interval in 
electrocardiography as well as increased brain lipid peroxidation. Candidate 
contaminants are organochlorine, organophosphate/carbamate pesticides or 
metabolites. Overall, HepG2 cytotoxicity did not successfully predict the 
neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity observed with extract C but was more successful 
with suspected hydrocarbon toxicities in extracts A and B. Caution should be 
taken when extrapolating the observation of no effects from in vitro cell 
culture to in vivo toxicity, and better cell culture lines or assays should be 
explored."
154,"Cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction and heart failure have been the 
leading cause of death worldwide for more than 20 years, and new treatments 
continue to be investigated. Heart transplantation, a curative treatment for 
severe cardiac dysfunction, is available to only a small number of patients due 
to the rarity of donors and high costs. Cardiac regenerative medicine using 
embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells is expected to be a new 
alternative to heart transplantation, but it has problems such as induction of 
immune response, tumor formation, and low survival rate of transplanted cells. 
On the other hand, there has been a focus on cell-free therapy using 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) due to their high biocompatibility and target 
specificity. Exosomes, one type of EV, play a role in the molecular transport 
system in vivo and can be considered a drug delivery system (DDS) innate to all 
living things. Exosomes contain nucleic acids and proteins, which are 
transported from secretory cells to recipient cells. Molecules in exosomes are 
encapsulated in a lipid bilayer, which allows them to exist stably in body 
fluids without being affected by nuclease degradation enzymes. Therefore, the 
therapeutic use of exosomes as DDSs has been widely explored and is being used 
in clinical trials and other clinical settings. This review summarizes the 
current topics of EVs as DDSs in cardiac disease."
155,"Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning 
regimens have expanded use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(HCT) in AML to include older and medically less-fit patients, but relative 
efficacies and toxicities remain poorly defined. Here, we analyzed outcomes from 
343 adults transplanted in remission after RIC (n = 137) or NMA (n = 206) 
conditioning between 2006 and 2021. The characteristics of RIC and NMA HCT 
patients were similar except that RIC patients were younger and their time 
between most recent remission achievement and allografting was shorter. There 
were no significant differences in relapse risk, relapse-free survival (RFS), 
overall survival (OS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) between RIC and NMA HCT 
patients, both overall (relapse: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80, P = 0.27; RFS: 
HR = 0.93, P = 0.61; OS: HR = 0.93, P = 0.66; NRM: HR = 1.13, P = 0.59) and when 
patients were stratified by pre-HCT measurable residual disease (MRD) status. 
After multivariable adjustment, there was no statistically significant 
association between conditioning intensity and relapse (HR = 0.69, P = 0.088), 
RFS (HR = 0.86, P = 0.37), OS (HR = 0.89, P = 0.49), or NRM (HR = 1.37, 
P = 0.19). In this non-randomized cohort of adults undergoing allografting for 
AML in first or second remission at our center, we could not detect 
statistically significant differences in outcomes between those assigned to RIC 
and those assigned to NMA conditioning."
156,"Tissue morphogenesis, homoeostasis and repair require cells to constantly 
monitor their three-dimensional microenvironment and adapt their behaviours in 
response to local biochemical and mechanical cues. Yet the mechanical parameters 
of the cellular microenvironment probed by cells in vivo remain unclear. Here, 
we report the mechanics of the cellular microenvironment that cells probe in 
vivo and in situ during zebrafish presomitic mesoderm differentiation. By 
quantifying both endogenous cell-generated strains and tissue mechanics, we show 
that individual cells probe the stiffness associated with deformations of the 
supracellular, foam-like tissue architecture. Stress relaxation leads to a 
perceived microenvironment stiffness that decreases over time, with cells 
probing the softest regime. We find that most mechanical parameters, including 
those probed by cells, vary along the anteroposterior axis as mesodermal 
progenitors differentiate. These findings expand our understanding of in vivo 
mechanosensation and might aid the design of advanced scaffolds for tissue 
engineering applications."
157,"We recently nominated cytokine signaling through the Janus-kinase-signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway as a potential AD 
drug target. As hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has recently been shown to inactivate 
STAT3, we hypothesized that it may impact AD pathogenesis and risk. Among 
109,124 rheumatoid arthritis patients from routine clinical care, HCQ initiation 
was associated with a lower risk of incident AD compared to methotrexate 
initiation across 4 alternative analyses schemes addressing specific types of 
biases including informative censoring, reverse causality, and outcome 
misclassification (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] of 0.92 [0.83-1.00], 
0.87 [0.81-0.93], 0.84 [0.76-0.93], and 0.87 [0.75-1.01]). We additionally show 
that HCQ exerts dose-dependent effects on late long-term potentiation (LTP) and 
rescues impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity prior to significant 
accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 mice. 
Additionally, HCQ treatment enhances microglial clearance of Aβ1-42, lowers 
neuroinflammation, and reduces tau phosphorylation in cell culture-based 
phenotypic assays. Finally, we show that HCQ inactivates STAT3 in microglia, 
neurons, and astrocytes suggesting a plausible mechanism associated with its 
observed effects on AD pathogenesis. HCQ, a relatively safe and inexpensive drug 
in current use may be a promising disease-modifying AD treatment. This 
hypothesis merits testing through adequately powered clinical trials in at-risk 
individuals during preclinical stages of disease progression."
158,"Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous 
micro-deletion in the WS critical region (WSCR) and is characterized by 
hyper-sociability and neurocognitive abnormalities. Nonetheless, whether and to 
what extent WSCR deletion leads to epigenetic modifications in the brain and 
induces pathological outcomes remains largely unknown. By examining DNA 
methylation in frontal cortex, we revealed genome-wide disruption in the 
methylome of individuals with WS, as compared to typically developed (TD) 
controls. Surprisingly, differentially methylated sites were predominantly 
annotated as introns and intergenic loci and were found to be highly enriched 
around binding sites for transcription factors that regulate neuronal 
development, plasticity and cognition. Moreover, by utilizing enhancer-promoter 
interactome data, we confirmed that most of these loci function as active 
enhancers in the human brain or as target genes of transcriptional networks 
associated with myelination, oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation, cognition and 
social behavior. Cell type-specific methylation analysis revealed aberrant 
patterns in the methylation of active enhancers in neurons and OLs, and 
important neuron-glia interactions that might be impaired in individuals with 
WS. Finally, comparison of methylation profiles from blood samples of 
individuals with WS and healthy controls, along with other data collected in 
this study, identified putative targets of endophenotypes associated with WS, 
which can be used to define brain-risk loci for WS outside the WSCR locus, as 
well as for other associated pathologies. In conclusion, our study illuminates 
the brain methylome landscape of individuals with WS and sheds light on how 
these aberrations might be involved in social behavior and physiological 
abnormalities. By extension, these results may lead to better diagnostics and 
more refined therapeutic targets for WS."
159,"INTRODUCTION: Meta-analyses implicate immune dysfunction in depression 
confirming increased levels of circulating immune proteins (e.g., cytokines) in 
depression cases compared to controls. White blood cells (WBC) both produce and 
are influenced by cytokines, and play key roles in orchestrating innate and 
adaptive immune responses, but their role in depression remains unclear. 
Therefore, a systematic review of studies of various WBC subsets in depression 
is required for a greater understanding of the nature of immune dysfunction in 
this illness.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and PsycINFO databases (inception to 5th April 2022) 
and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of identified studies 
comparing absolute count and/or relative percentage of flow cytometry-derived 
WBC subsets between depression cases and controls. Selected studies were quality 
assessed. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included and 27 studies (n = 2277) were 
meta-analysed. We report an increase in mean absolute counts of WBC (seven 
studies; standardised mean difference [SMD] = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.61-1.53; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 64%), granulocytes (two studies; SMD = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.45-2.68; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 0%), neutrophils (four studies; SMD = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.23-1.58; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 82%), monocytes (seven studies; SMD = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.19-1.01; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 66%), CD4+ helper T cells (11 studies; SMD = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.15-0.45; 
P < 0.01; I2 = 0%), natural killer cells (11 studies; SMD = 1.23; 95% CI, 
0.38-2.08; P < 0.01; I2 = 95%), B cells (10 studies; SMD = 0.30; 95% CI, 
0.03-0.57; P = 0.03; I2 = 56%), and activated T cells (eight studies; 
SMD = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24-0.66; P < 0.01; I2 = 0%) in depression, compared to 
controls. Fewer studies reported relative percentage, indicating increased 
neutrophils and decreased total lymphocytes, Th1, and Th2 cells in depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression is characterised by widespread alterations in 
circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells, consistent with dysfunction in both 
innate and adaptive immunity. Immune cells could be useful biomarkers for 
illness subtyping and patient stratification in future immunotherapy trials of 
depression, along with cytokines, other biomarkers, and clinical measures."
160,"The review discusses the diagnostic application of biosensors as point-of-care 
devices in the COVID-19 pandemic. Biosensors are important analytical tools that 
can be used for the robust and effective detection of infectious diseases in 
real-time. In this current scenario, the utilization of smart, efficient 
biosensors for COVID-19 detection is increasing and we have included a few smart 
biosensors such as smart and intelligent based biosensors, plasmonic biosensors, 
field effective transister (FET) biosensors, smart optical biosensors, surface 
enhanced raman scattering (SERS) biosensor, screen printed electrode (SPE) based 
biosensor, molecular imprinted polymers (MIP) based biosensor, MXene based 
biosensor and Metal-Organic frame smart sensor. Their significance as well as 
the benefits and drawbacks of each kind of smart sensor are mentioned in depth. 
Furthermore, we have compiled a list of various biosensors which have been 
developed across the globe for COVID-19 and have shown the promise as commercial 
detection devices. Significant challenges in the development of effective 
diagnostic methods were discussed and recommendations have been made for better 
diagnostic outcomes to manage the ongoing pandemic effectively."
161,"Development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is regulated by a series of genetic and 
microenvironmental alterations. Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) is a secreted 
glycoprotein that is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and 
modulates inflammation. However, the role of OLFM4 in CRC is uncertain. Here we 
aimed to explore the function of OLFM4 in CRC in vivo and in vitro. The mRNA 
expression of OLFM4 was up-regulated in precursor lesions with dysplasia or 
ulcerative colitis but was reduced in CRC. OLFM4 neutralizing antibody 
suppressed inflammation-mediated early-stage CRC formation in an AOM/DSS 
colitis-associated cancer model. OLFM4 knockdown cells exhibited increased cell 
proliferation and motility in vitro and in vivo. Ablation of OLFM4 increased 
tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft experiments. In addition, OLFM4 
knockdown cells showed elevated expression of colon cancer stem cell markers 
including CD133, resulting in increased metastasis via epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition signaling. This study demonstrated that OLFM4 regulates inflammation 
and cancer progression differently; ablation of OLFM4 promotes cancer metastasis 
via stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results suggest a new 
route for controlling cancer progression and metastasis."
162,"Growing evidence has suggested that lncRNAs play a significant role in the 
development of colorectal adenocarcinoma. LncRNA LINC02535 was a potential novel 
lncRNA marker of neoplastic processes of the colon. Nevertheless, the function 
and mechanisms of LINC02535 in colorectal adenocarcinoma remain unclear. 
Proteins levels were measured by western blotting. EdU, CCK-8, Transwell, and 
wound healing assays were performed to investigate the function of LINC02535 in 
colorectal adenocarcinoma. The distribution of LINC02535 in cells was evaluated 
by subcellular fractionation assay. The interaction among RNAs was identified by 
luciferase reporter and RIP assays. In this study, our findings revealed that 
LINC02535 was highly expressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Knockdown of 
LINC02535 inhibited colorectal adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion. Mechanistically, LINC02535 bound with miR-30d-5p and worked as a 
competing endogenous RNA to facilitate the expression of messenger RNA 
chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1). miR-30d-5p directly targeted 
the sequence of CHD1 3'-untranslated region. Notably, CHD1 upregulation 
abolished the suppressive influence of LINC02535 inhibition on the malignant 
phenotypes of colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Overall, it was disclosed that 
LINC02535 played an oncogenic role in colorectal adenocarcinoma progression by 
sponging miR-30d-5p to upregulate CHD1 expression."
163,"To explore the fitting effect of the ARIMA, GM(1,1), and RANSAC model in the 
changes of white blood cells (WBC) in benzene-exposed workers, and select the 
optimal model to predict the WBC count of workers. Among 350 employees in an 
aerospace process manufacturing enterprise in Nanjing, workers with 10 years of 
benzene exposure were selected, and used Excel software to organize the WBC 
data, and the ARIMA model and RANSAC model were established by R software, and 
the GM(1, 1) model was established by DPS software, and the magnitude of the 
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of fitting three models to WBC counts was 
compared. The MAPE based on the ARIMA(2,1,2) model is 6.78%, the MAPE based on 
the GM(1,1) model is 5.19%, and the MAPE based on the RANSAC model is 6.37%, so 
the GM( 1,1) model was more suitable for fitting the trend of WBC counts in 
benzene exposed workers in this study. The GM(1,1) model is suitable for fitting 
WBC counts in a small sample size and can provide a short-term prediction of WBC 
counts in benzene-exposed workers and provide basic information for occupational 
health risk assessment of workers."
164,"The rice water weevil, Oryzophagus oryzae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an 
economically important pest of flooded rice paddies throughout South America, 
and species with similar life histories are present in many rice-producing 
regions globally (collectively referred to here as RWWs). Plant resistance is a 
key strategy for management of RWWs; however, the mechanisms responsible for 
rice resistance to RWWs are poorly understood. We investigated morphoanatomical 
and biochemical plant traits potentially involved in rice resistance to O. 
oryzae. Resistance-associated traits were characterized in two cultivars, 'Dawn' 
(resistant) and 'BRS Pampa CL' ('Pamp' = susceptible), which were selected from 
among six cultivars on 2-year field screenings. Anatomical and morphological 
traits of leaf tissues from 'Pamp' and 'Dawn' were similar, which perhaps 
explains the lack of antixenosis during host plant selection. However, 
significant antibiosis effects were found. The activities of antioxidant enzymes 
involved in plant defense, as well the content of hydroxycinnamic and 
hydroxybenzoic acids derivatives and lignin, were higher in roots of 'Dawn' than 
in 'Pamp', over the period of larval infestation in the field. Additionally, 
'Dawn' exhibited a root sclerenchyma arranged in three layers of lignified 
cells, which differed from the arrangement of cells in 'Pamp', regardless of 
larval infestation. Our results provide the first evidence for specific 
resistance-related traits associated with mortality and malnutrition of RWWs in 
rice."
165,"Transcriptional addiction is recognized as a valid therapeutic target in cancer, 
whereby the dependency of cancer cells on oncogenic transcriptional regulators 
may be pharmacologically exploited. However, a comprehensive understanding of 
the key factors within the transcriptional machinery that might afford a useful 
therapeutic window remains elusive. Herein, we present a cross-omics 
investigation into the functional specialization of the transcriptional cyclin 
dependent kinases (tCDKs) through analysis of high-content genetic dependency, 
gene expression, patient survival, and drug response datasets. This analysis 
revealed specialization among tCDKs in terms of contributions to cancer cell 
fitness, clinical prognosis, and interaction with oncogenic signaling pathways. 
CDK7 and CDK9 stand out as the most relevant targets, albeit through distinct 
mechanisms of oncogenicity and context-dependent contributions to cancer 
survival and drug sensitivity. Genetic ablation of CDK9, but not CDK7, mimics 
the effect on cell viability the loss of key components of the transcriptional 
machinery. Pathway analysis of genetic co-dependency and drug sensitivity data 
show CDK7 and CDK9 have distinct relationships with major oncogenic signatures, 
including MYC and E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, and the unfolded 
protein response. Altogether, these results inform the improved design of 
therapeutic strategies targeting tCDKs in cancer."
166,"Fibroblasts are a major cell population that perform critical functions in the 
wound healing process. In response to injury, they proliferate and migrate into 
the wound space, engaging in extracellular matrix (ECM) production, remodeling, 
and contraction. However, there is limited knowledge of how fibroblast functions 
are altered in diabetes. To address this gap, several state-of-the-art 
microscopy techniques were employed to investigate morphology, migration, ECM 
production, 2D traction, 3D contraction, and cell stiffness. Analysis of 
cell-derived matrix (CDM) revealed that diabetic fibroblasts produce thickened 
and less porous ECM that hindered migration of normal fibroblasts. In addition, 
diabetic fibroblasts were found to lose spindle-like shape, migrate slower, 
generate less traction force, exert limited 3D contractility, and have increased 
cell stiffness. These changes were due, in part, to a decreased level of active 
Rac1 and a lack of co-localization between F-actin and Waskott-Aldrich syndrome 
protein family verprolin homologous protein 2 (WAVE2). Interestingly, deletion 
of thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) in diabetic fibroblasts rescued these phenotypes and 
restored normal levels of active Rac1 and WAVE2-F-actin co-localization. These 
results provide a comprehensive view of the extent of diabetic fibroblast 
dysfunction, highlighting the regulatory role of the TSP2-Rac1-WAVE2-actin axis, 
and describing a new function of TSP2 in regulating cytoskeleton organization."
167,"Cellular senescence caused by oncogenic stimuli is associated with the 
development of various age-related pathologies through the senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP is mediated by the activation of cytoplasmic 
nucleic acid sensors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the 
accumulation of nucleotide ligands in senescent cells is unclear. In this study, 
we revealed that the expression of RNaseH2A, which removes ribonucleoside 
monophosphates (rNMPs) from the genome, is regulated by E2F transcription 
factors, and it decreases during cellular senescence. Residual rNMPs cause 
genomic DNA fragmentation and aberrant activation of cytoplasmic nucleic acid 
sensors, thereby provoking subsequent SASP factor gene expression in senescent 
cells. In addition, RNaseH2A expression was significantly decreased in aged 
mouse tissues and cells from individuals with Werner syndrome. Furthermore, 
RNaseH2A degradation using the auxin-inducible degron system induced the 
accumulation of nucleotide ligands and induction of certain tumourigenic 
SASP-like factors, promoting the metastatic properties of colorectal cancer 
cells. Our results indicate that RNaseH2A downregulation provokes SASP through 
nucleotide ligand accumulation, which likely contributes to the pathological 
features of senescent, progeroid, and cancer cells."
168,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of in situ adeno-associated virus 
(AAV)-mediated gene delivery into the human corneal limbal region via targeted 
sub-limbal injection technique. Human cadaveric corneal tissues were fixed on an 
artificial anterior chamber. Feasibility of sub-limbal injection technique was 
tested using trypan blue and black India ink. An enhanced green fluorescent 
protein (eGFP) encoding AAV DJ was injected into sub-limbal region. After AAV 
injection, corneal tissues were incubated in air-lift culture and prepared for 
immunohistochemical analysis. Cell survivial and expression of eGFP, stem cell 
markers (p63α and cytokeratin 19 (KRT19)), and differentiation marker 
cytokeratin 3 (KRT3) were evaluated using confocal microscopy. Both trypan blue 
and black India ink stained and were retained sub-limbally establishing 
specificity of the injection technique. Immunohistochemical analysis of corneas 
injected with AAV DJ-eGFP indicated that AAV-transduced cells in the limbal 
region co-express eGFP, p63α, and KRT19 and that these transduced cells were 
capable of differentiating to KRT3 postitive corneal epithelial cells. Our 
sub-limbal injection technique can target cells in the human limbus in a 
reproducible and efficient manner. Thus, we demonstrate that in situ injection 
of corneal limbus may provide a feasible mode of genetic therapy for corneal 
disorders with an epithelial etiology."
169,"Cardiomyopathies have unresolved genotype-phenotype relationships and lack 
disease-specific treatments. Here we provide a framework to identify 
genotype-specific pathomechanisms and therapeutic targets to accelerate the 
development of precision medicine. We use human cardiac electromechanical 
in-silico modelling and simulation which we validate with experimental hiPSC-CM 
data and modelling in combination with clinical biomarkers. We select 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a challenge for this approach and study genetic 
variations that mutate proteins of the thick (MYH7R403Q/+) and thin filaments 
(TNNT2R92Q/+, TNNI3R21C/+) of the cardiac sarcomere. Using in-silico techniques 
we show that the destabilisation of myosin super relaxation observed in 
hiPSC-CMs drives disease in virtual cells and ventricles carrying the 
MYH7R403Q/+ variant, and that secondary effects on thin filament activation are 
necessary to precipitate slowed relaxation of the cell and diastolic 
insufficiency in the chamber. In-silico modelling shows that Mavacamten corrects 
the MYH7R403Q/+ phenotype in agreement with hiPSC-CM experiments. Our in-silico 
model predicts that the thin filament variants TNNT2R92Q/+ and TNNI3R21C/+ 
display altered calcium regulation as central pathomechanism, for which 
Mavacamten provides incomplete salvage, which we have corroborated in 
TNNT2R92Q/+ and TNNI3R21C/+ hiPSC-CMs. We define the ideal characteristics of a 
novel thin filament-targeting compound and show its efficacy in-silico. We 
demonstrate that hybrid human-based hiPSC-CM and in-silico studies accelerate 
pathomechanism discovery and classification testing, improving clinical 
interpretation of genetic variants, and directing rational therapeutic targeting 
and design."
170,"Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) develop thoracic aortic aneurysms as the 
aorta presents excessive elastin breaks, fibrosis, and vascular smooth muscle 
cell (vSMC) death due to mutations in the FBN1 gene. Despite elaborate vSMC to 
aortic endothelial cell (EC) signaling, the contribution of ECs to the 
development of aortic pathology remains largely unresolved. The aim of this 
study is to investigate the EC properties in Fbn1C1041G/+ MFS mice. Using en 
face immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we showed that EC alignment with 
blood flow was reduced, EC roundness was increased, individual EC surface area 
was larger, and EC junctional linearity was decreased in aortae of Fbn1C1041G/+ 
MFS mice. This modified EC phenotype was most prominent in the ascending aorta 
and occurred before aortic dilatation. To reverse EC morphology, we performed 
treatment with resveratrol. This restored EC blood flow alignment, junctional 
linearity, phospho-eNOS expression, and improved the structural integrity of the 
internal elastic lamina of Fbn1C1041G/+ mice. In conclusion, these experiments 
identify the involvement of ECs and underlying internal elastic lamina in MFS 
aortic pathology, which could act as potential target for future MFS 
pharmacotherapies."
171,"Dampened immunity and impaired wound healing in diabetic patients may lead to 
diabetic foot ulcer disease, which is the leading cause of limb amputations and 
hospitalization. On the other hand, cancer is the most significant cause of 
mortality globally, accounting for over 10 million fatalities in 2020, or nearly 
one in every six deaths. Plants and herbs have been used to treat chronic 
diseases due to their essential pharmaceutical attributes, such as mitigating 
drug resistance, ameliorating systemic toxicities, reducing the need for 
synthetic chemotherapeutic agents,and strengthening the immune system. The 
present study has been designed to evaluate the effects of Tribulus terrestris 
on wound healing, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory responses against HepG-2 liver 
cancer cell line. Two solvents (methanol and ethanol) were used for root 
extraction of T. terrestris. The wound healing potential of the extracts was 
studied on diabetic cell culture line by scratch assay. The anti-oxidant and 
cytotoxic potentials were evaluated by in vitro assays against HepG2 cell line. 
The methanolic root extract resulted in the coverage of robust radical 
scavenging or maximum inhibition of 66.72%,potent cytotoxic activity or reduced 
cell viability of 40.98%, and anti-diabetic activity having mighty α-glucosidase 
inhibition of 50.16% at a concentration of 80 μg/ml. Significant reduction in 
the levels of LDH leakage (56.38%), substantial ROS (48.45%) and SOD (72.13%) 
activities were recorededMoreover, gene expression analysis demonstrated the 
down-regulation of inflammatory markers (TNF-α, MMP-9, Bcl-2, and AFP) in HepG-2 
cells when treated with T. terresteris methanolic extract as compared to stress. 
Furthermore, the down-regulation of inflammatory markers was validated through 
ELISA-mediated protein estimation of IL-1β and TNF-α. It is expected that this 
study will lay a foundation and lead to the development of efficient but 
low-cost, natural herbs extract-based dressing/ointment for diabetic patients 
and identify potential drug metabolites to treat out-of-whack inflammatory 
responses involved in cancer onset, progression, and metastasis."
172,"Myocardin-related transcription factors A and B (MRTFs) are coactivators of 
Serum Response Factor (SRF), which controls fundamental biological processes 
such as cell growth, migration, and differentiation. MRTF and SRF 
transcriptional activity play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) growth, which represents the second leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality in humans worldwide. We, therefore, searched for druggable targets in 
HCC that regulate MRTF/SRF transcriptional activity and can be exploited 
therapeutically for HCC therapy. We identified the G protein-coupled 
lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) as a novel interaction partner of 
MRTF-A and Filamin A (FLNA) using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-(FRET) 
and proximity ligation assay (PLA) in vitro in HCC cells and in vivo in 
organoids. We found that LPAR1 promotes FLNA phosphorylation at S2152 which 
enhances the complex formation of FLNA and MRTF-A, actin polymerization, and 
MRTF transcriptional activity. Pharmacological blockade or depletion of LPAR1 
prevents FLNA phosphorylation and complex formation with MRTF-A, resulting in 
reduced MRTF/SRF target gene expression and oncogene-induced senescence. Thus, 
inhibition of the LPAR1-FLNA-MRTF-A interaction represents a promising strategy 
for HCC therapy."
173,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is emerging in genetic diagnoses as it provides 
functional support for the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance. 
However, the use of amniotic fluid (AF) cells for RNA-seq has not yet been 
explored. Here, we examined the expression of clinically relevant genes in AF 
cells (n = 48) compared with whole blood and fibroblasts. The number of 
well-expressed genes in AF cells was comparable to that in fibroblasts and much 
higher than that in blood across different disease categories. We found AF cells 
RNA-seq feasible and beneficial in prenatal diagnosis (n = 4) as transcriptomic 
data elucidated the molecular consequence leading to the pathogenicity upgrade 
of variants in CHD7 and COL1A2 and revising the in silico prediction of a 
variant in MYRF. AF cells RNA-seq could become a reasonable choice for postnatal 
patients with advantages over fibroblasts and blood as it prevents invasive 
procedures."
174,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prominent causes of cancer-associated 
mortality in the world, with chemoresistance representing one of the leading 
causes of treatment failure. However, the mechanisms governing such 
chemoresistance remain incompletely understood. In this study, the role of DYRK2 
as a mediator of CRC cell drug resistance and the associated molecular 
mechanisms were assessed by evaluating human tumor tissue samples, CRC cell 
lines, and animal model systems. Initial analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas 
database and clinical tissue microarrays revealed significant DYRK2 
downregulation in CRC in a manner correlated with poor prognosis. We further 
generated LoVo CRC cells that were resistant to the chemotherapeutic drug 5-FU, 
and found that such chemoresistance was associated with the downregulation of 
DYRK2 and a more aggressive mesenchymal phenotype. When DYRK2 was overexpressed 
in these cells, their proliferative, migratory, and invasive activities were 
reduced and they were more prone to apoptotic death. DYRK2 overexpression was 
also associated with enhanced chemosensitivity and the inhibition of 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction in these LoVo 5-FUR cells. 
Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that DYRK2 bound to Twist and promoted 
its proteasomal degradation. In vivo studies further confirmed that the 
overexpression of DYRK2 inhibited human CRC xenograft tumor growth with 
concomitant Twist downregulation. Overall, these results thus highlight DYRK2 as 
a promising therapeutic target in CRC worthy of further investigation."
175,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are part of proteoglycan family. They are 
composed of heparan sulfate (HS)-type glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains covalently 
linked to a core protein. By interacting with growth factors and/or receptors, 
they regulate numerous pathways including Wnt, hedgehog (Hh), bone morphogenic 
protein (BMP) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways. They act as inhibitor 
or activator of these pathways to modulate embryonic and adult stem cell fate 
during organ morphogenesis, regeneration and homeostasis. This review summarizes 
the knowledge on HSPG structure and classification and explores several 
signaling pathways regulated by HSPGs in stem cell fate. A specific focus on 
hair follicle stem cell fate and the possibility to target HSPGs in order to 
tackle hair loss are discussed in more dermatological and cosmeceutical 
perspectives."
176,"Since Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was linked as the predominant etiology of 
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in 2008, three additional human polyomaviruses 
(HPyV) have been definitively linked to cutaneous diseases-trichodysplasia 
spinulosa virus (TSPyV) and human polyomavirus 6 and 7 (HPyV6, HPyV7). TSPyV 
contributes to the development of trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS), and HPyV6/7 is 
associated closely with the eruption of pruritic and dyskeratotic dermatoses 
(PDD). Clinically, MCC is treated with surgical excision and radiation with 
adjuvant chemotherapy, although newer treatment options include immune 
checkpoint inhibition. These novel immunotherapies hold promise for the 
treatment of metastatic MCC, but resistance and side effects prevent a 
significant proportion of patients from realizing their benefits. Based on 
previous case reports, the standard of care for the less deadly but disfiguring 
cutaneous disease TS include immunosuppressant (IS) reduction, the use of 
antivirals such as cidofovir (CDV) or valganciclovir (VGCV), or a combination of 
these treatments. Similar treatments were attempted for PDD, but oral acitretin 
was found to be most effective. As MCC, TS, and PDD are rare diseases, further 
research is required for effective treatments. In this review, we summarize 
clinical trials, preclinical studies, and case reports that present outcomes and 
side effects of current and emerging treatments for HPyV-associated cutaneous 
diseases, offering a comprehensive resource for clinical application and 
prospective clinical trials."
177,"OBJECTIVE: Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is the main limitation of 
extended liver resection. The molecular mechanism and the role of leukocytes in 
the development of PHLF remain to be unveiled. We aimed to address the impact of 
serine proteases (SPs) on the acute phase after liver resection by intravitally 
analyzing leukocyte recruitment and changes in hemodynamics and microcirculation 
of the liver.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice undergoing 60% partial hepatectomy were treated with 
aprotinin (broad-spectrum SP inhibitor), tranexamic acid (plasmin inhibitor), or 
vehicle. Sham-operated animals served as controls. In-vivo fluorescence 
microscopy was used to quantify leukocyte-endothelial interactions immediately 
after, as well as 120 min after partial hepatectomy in post-sinusoidal venules, 
along with measurement of sinusoidal perfusion rate and post-sinusoidal shear 
rate. Recruitment of leukocytes, neutrophils, T-cells, and parameters of liver 
injury were assessed in tissue/blood samples.
RESULTS: Leukocyte recruitment, sinusoidal perfusion failure rate, and shear 
rate were significantly increased in mice after 60% partial hepatectomy compared 
to sham-operated animals. The inhibition of SPs or plasmin significantly 
attenuated leukocyte recruitment and improved the perfusion rate in the remnant 
liver. ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil recruitment significantly increased 
after 60% partial hepatectomy and were strongly reduced by plasmin inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment in the liver in 
response to the increment of sinusoidal shear rate were hallmarks in the acute 
phase after liver resection. SPs mediated leukocyte recruitment and contributed 
to the impairment of sinusoidal perfusion in an ICAM-1-dependent manner in the 
acute phase after liver resection."
178,"Lifelong social impairments are common in individuals with prenatal alcohol 
exposure (PAE), and preclinical studies have identified gestational day (G)12 as 
a vulnerable timepoint for producing social deficits following binge-level PAE. 
While moderate (m)PAE also produces social impairments, the long-term 
neuroadaptations underlying them are poorly understood. Activity of the 
projection from the basolateral amygdala to the prelimbic cortex (BLA → PL) 
leads to social avoidance, and the PL is implicated in negative social 
behaviours, making each of these potential candidates for the neuroadaptations 
underlying mPAE-induced social impairments. To examine this, we first 
established that G12 mPAE produced sex-specific social impairments lasting into 
adulthood in Sprague-Dawley rats. We then chemogenetically inhibited the 
BLA → PL using clozapine N-oxide (CNO) during adult social testing. This 
revealed that CNO reduced social investigation in control males but had no 
effect on mPAE males or females of either exposure, indicating that mPAE 
attenuated the role of this projection in regulating male social behaviour and 
highlighting one potential mechanism by which mPAE affects male social behaviour 
more severely. Using whole-cell electrophysiology, we also examined mPAE-induced 
changes to PL pyramidal cell physiology and determined that mPAE reduced cell 
excitability, likely due to increased suppression by inhibitory interneurons. 
Overall, this work identified two mPAE-induced neuroadaptations that last into 
adulthood and that may underlie the sex-specific vulnerability to mPAE-induced 
social impairments. Future research is necessary to expand upon how these 
circuits modulate both normal and pathological social behaviours and to identify 
sex-specific mechanisms, leading to differential vulnerability in males and 
females."
179,"Many disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), including alcohol use 
disorder (AUD), are associated with induction of proinflammatory neuroimmune 
signalling and neurodegeneration. In previous studies, we found increased 
expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), activated NF-κB p65 (RELA), and other 
proinflammatory signalling molecules. Proinflammatory NADPH oxidases generate 
reactive oxygen species, which are linked to neurodegeneration. We tested the 
hypothesis that AUD increased RELA activation increases NADPH oxidase-oxidative 
stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress cell death cascades in association 
with neuronal cell death in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In the AUD 
OFC, we report mRNA induction of several NADPH oxidases, the dual oxidase DUOX2, 
and the oxidative stress lipid peroxidation marker 4-HNE and the DNA oxidation 
marker 8-OHdG that correlate with RELA, a marker of proinflammatory NF-κB 
activation. This was accompanied by increased expression of the ER 
stress-associated regulator protein glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), 
transmembrane sensors activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), protein kinase 
RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring 
kinase/endonuclease 1 (pIRE1), and the pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP 
homologous protein (CHOP). Expression of NADPH oxidase-oxidative stress markers 
correlate with ER stress-associated molecules. Induction of oxidative stress and 
ER stress signalling pathways correlate with expression of cell death-associated 
caspases and neuronal cell loss. These data support the hypothesis that 
proinflammatory RELA-mediated induction of NADPH oxidase-oxidative stress and ER 
stress-associated signalling cascades is associated with neuronal cell death in 
the post-mortem human OFC of individuals with AUD."
180,"Gene expression studies offer promising opportunities to better understand the 
processes underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD). As cell types differ in their 
function, gene expression profiles will typically vary across cell types. When 
studying bulk tissue, failure to account for this cellular diversity has a 
detrimental impact on the ability to detect disease associations. We therefore 
assayed the transcriptomes of 32,531 individual nuclei extracted from the 
nucleus accumbens (NAc) of nine donors with AUD and nine controls (72% male). 
Our study identified 17 clearly delineated cell types. We detected 26 
transcriptome-wide significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that mainly 
involved medium spiny neurons with both D1-type and D2-type dopamine receptors, 
microglia (MGL) and oligodendrocytes. A higher than expected number of DEGs 
replicated in an existing single nucleus gene expression study of alcohol 
dependence in the prefrontal cortex (enrichment ratio 1.91, p value 0.019) with 
two genes remaining significant after a Bonferroni correction. Our most 
compelling result involved CD53 in MGL that replicated in the same cell type in 
the prefrontal cortex and was previously implicated in studies of DNA 
methylation, bulk gene expression and genetic variants. Several DEGs were 
previously reported to be associated with AUD (e.g., PER1 and MGAT5). The DEGs 
for MSN.3 seemed involved in neurodegeneration, disruption of circadian rhythms, 
alterations in glucose metabolism and changes in synaptic plasticity. For MGL, 
the DEGs implicated neuroinflammation and immune-related processes and for OLI, 
disruptions in myelination. This identification of the specific cell-types from 
which the association signals originate will be key for designing proper 
follow-up experiments and, eventually, novel clinical interventions."
181,"Recently, it has been suggested that central and peripheral toxicities 
identified in persons with substance use disorder (SUD) could be partially 
associated with an imbalance in reactive oxygen species and antioxidant 
defenses. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate 
whether SUD is associated with oxidative stress and to identify biomarkers 
possibly more affected by this condition. We have included studies that analysed 
oxidant and antioxidant markers in individuals with SUD caused by stimulants, 
alcohol, nicotine, opioids, and others (cannabis, inhalants, and polysubstance 
use). Our analysis showed that persons with SUD show higher oxidant markers and 
lower antioxidant markers than healthy controls. SUD was associated specifically 
with higher levels of oxidant markers malondialdehyde, thiobarbituric acid 
reactive substances and lipid peroxidation. Conversely, the antioxidant 
superoxide dismutase and the total antioxidant capacity/status were lowered in 
the SUD group. A meta-regression analysis revealed that persons with alcohol use 
disorder had higher oxidative stress estimates than those with stimulant use 
disorder. Moreover, individuals evaluated during abstinence showed smaller 
antioxidant effect sizes than non-abstinent ones. Our findings suggest a clear 
oxidative imbalance in persons with SUD, which could lead to cell damage and 
result in multiple associated comorbidities, particularly accelerated aging."
182,"Chronic opioid exposure causes structural and functional changes in brain 
circuits, which may contribute to opioid use disorders. Synaptic cell-adhesion 
molecules are prime candidates for mediating this opioid-evoked plasticity. 
Neuroligin-3 (NL3) is an X-linked postsynaptic adhesion protein that shapes 
synaptic function at multiple sites in the mesolimbic dopamine system. We 
therefore studied how genetic knockout of NL3 alters responses to chronic 
morphine in male mice. Constitutive NL3 knockout caused a persistent reduction 
in psychomotor sensitization after chronic morphine exposure and change in the 
topography of locomotor stimulation produced by morphine. This latter change was 
recapitulated by conditional genetic deletion of NL3 from cells expressing the 
Drd1 dopamine receptor, whereas reduced psychomotor sensitization was 
recapitulated by conditional genetic deletion from dopamine neurons. Without NL3 
expression, dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area exhibited diminished 
activation following chronic morphine exposure, by measuring in vivo calcium 
signals with fibre photometry. This altered pattern of dopamine neuron activity 
may be driven by aberrant forms of opioid-evoked synaptic plasticity in the 
absence of NL3: dopamine neurons lacking NL3 showed weaker synaptic inhibition 
at baseline, which was subsequently strengthened after chronic morphine. In 
total, our study highlights neurobiological adaptations in dopamine neurons of 
the ventral tegmental area that correspond with increased behavioural 
sensitivity to opioids and further suggests that NL3 expression by dopamine 
neurons provides a molecular substrate for opioid-evoked adaptations in brain 
function and behaviour."
183,"BACKGROUND: Hox genes encode transcription factors that are important for 
establishing the body plan. Hoxa5 is a member of the mammalian Hox5 paralogous 
group that regulates the patterning and morphology of the cervical-thoracic 
region of the axial skeleton. Hoxa5 also plays crucial functions in lung 
morphogenesis.
RESULTS: We generated a Hoxa5eGFP reporter mouse line using CRISPR technology, 
allowing real-time visualization of Hoxa5 expression. Hoxa5eGFP recapitulates 
reported embryonic Hoxa5 mRNA expression patterns. Specifically, Hoxa5eGFP can 
be visualized in the developing mouse neural tube, somites, lung, diaphragm, 
foregut, midgut, among other organs. In the stomach, posteriorly biased 
Hoxa5eGFP expression correlates with a drastic morphological reduction of the 
corpus in Hox5 paralogous mutants. Expression of Hoxa5eGFP in the lung continues 
in all lung fibroblast populations through postnatal and adult stages.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified cell types that express Hoxa5 in postnatal and adult 
mouse lungs, including various fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. This 
reporter line will be a powerful tool for studies of the function of Hoxa5 
during mouse development, homeostasis, and disease processes. This article is

184,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a novel format of advanced therapeutical 
medicinal products (ATMPs). They can act regenerative or immune-modulatory as 
cell therapy substitutes or as a platform for designer exosomes. The 
biotechnological production of therapeutic EVs is still very much uncharted 
territory so standardized host cells, production setups and isolation methods 
are not yet implemented. In this work, we present a tangential flow filtration 
(TFF) and fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC)-based size exclusion 
chromatography (SEC) purification setup that is compatible for industry 
applications. Moreover, we evaluated a series of potential host cell lines 
regarding their EV productivity, characteristics, and biological functionality. 
It was found that telomerase-immortalized Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stromal 
cells (WJ-MSC/TERT273) secrete high amounts of EVs per cell with regenerative 
capabilities. On the other hand, Cevec's amniocyte producer cells® (CAP®) and 
human embryonic kidney (HEK293) suspension cells are suitable platforms for 
designer EVs with high yields. Finally, we aimed to boost the EV secretion of 
HEK293 cells via chemical adjuvants and verified four compounds that heighten 
cellular EV secretion in a presumably cAMP-dependent manner. A combination of 
fenoterol, iodoacetamide and dinitrophenol increased the EV yield in HEK293 
cells 3-fold and cellular secretion rate 5-fold. This article is protected by

186,"Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are cell envelope spanning protein complexes 
that Gram-negative bacteria use to inject a diverse arsenal of antibacterial 
toxins into competitor cells. Recently, Wang et al. reported that the H2-T6SS of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa delivers the peptidoglycan recycling amidase, AmpDh3, 
into the periplasm of recipient cells where it is proposed to act as a 
peptidoglycan degrading toxin (Wang et al., 2020). They further reported that 
PA0808, the open reading frame downstream of AmpDh3, encodes an immunity protein 
that localizes to the periplasm where it binds to and inactivates 
intercellularly delivered AmpDh3, thus protecting against its toxic activity. 
Given that AmpDh3 has an established role in cell wall homeostasis and that no 
precedent exists for cytosolic enzymes moonlighting as T6SS effectors, we 
attempted to replicate these findings. We found that cells lacking PA0808 are 
not susceptible to bacterial killing by AmpDh3 and that PA0808 and AmpDh3 do not 
physically interact in vitro or in vivo. Additionally, we found no evidence that 
AmpDh3 is exported from cells, including by strains with a constitutively active 
H2-T6SS. Finally, subcellular fractionation experiments and a 1.97 Å crystal 
structure reveals that PA0808 does not contain a canonical signal peptide or 
localize to the correct cellular compartment to confer protection against a cell 
wall targeting toxin. Taken together, these results cast doubt on the assertion 
that AmpDh3-PA0808 constitute an H2-T6SS effector-immunity pair."
187,"Porous carbon is considered an attractive host material for high-energy sulfur 
electrodes. In this study, we propose the design of a porous carbon-based sulfur 
electrode for the formulation of high-energy Li-S batteries; it achieves 
impregnation of porous carbon with up to 80 vol. % sulfur and a reduction in 
both the conductive agent and binder content. Therefore, less solvent could be 
used during slurry casting to inhibit crack formation following electrode 
drying. In addition, the utilisation of two distinct electrically conducting 
networks enabled reduced battery polarisation, resulting in a battery with a 
capacity of 690 mAh g-1 (even after 100 cycles). Finally, pouch cells were 
prepared to characterise the practical performance of the optimised cathode; 
this yields a capacity of 741 mAh and cathode energy density of 1001 Wh kg-1. 
These findings are expected to guide the further development of 
high-energy-density cathode materials for Li-S batteries."
188,"OBJECTIVES: Human-derived pulp stem cells play key roles during dentinogenesis. 
Erythropoietin is reportedly involved in osteoblastogenesis and facilitates bone 
formation. However, the mechanism is still unknown. This research was to study 
the potential of Erythropoietin in enhancing odontoblastic differentiation of 
human-derived pulp stem cells and to determine the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: The human-derived pulp stem cells were treated with Erythropoietin, 
EphB4 inhibitor, and MAPK inhibitors, and the odontoblastic differentiation was 
measured by ALP staining, ALP activity assay, alizarin red S staining and their 
quantitative analysis, and RT-qPCR of DSPP, DMP1, OCN, and RUNX2. The direct 
pulp capping model was established to evaluate the formation of tertiary dentin 
after treatment with Erythropoietin. Western blot assay was conducted to assess 
relevant protein expressions in the phosphorylated EphB4 and MAPK pathway.
RESULTS: The results showed that Erythropoietin promoted odontoblastic 
differentiation of human-derived pulp stem cells at 20 U/ml. Erythropoietin 
induced tertiary dentin formation in vivo. The potential mechanism of this was 
upregulating phosphorylated EphB4 and phosphorylated MAPK; furthermore, this 
effect could be decreased by EphB4 inhibitors, which inhibited MAPK 
phosphorylation. Blockage of MAPK pathways attenuated human-derived pulp stem 
cells odontoblastic differentiation, suggesting that MAPK pathways are involved.
CONCLUSION: Erythropoietin induced tertiary dentin formation in vivo. And 
Erythropoietin enhanced human-derived pulp stem cells odontoblastic 
differentiation via the EphB4-mediated MAPK signaling pathway."
189,"OBJECTIVE: Endothelial cell (EC) coupling occurs through gap junctions and 
underlies cerebral blood flow regulation governed by inward-rectifying (KIR ) 
channels. This study addressed effects of KIR channel activity on EC coupling 
before and during Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Intact EC tubes (width: ~90-100 μm; length: ~0.5 mm) were freshly 
isolated from posterior cerebral arteries of young Pre-AD (1-3 months) and aged 
AD (13-18 months) male and female 3xTg-AD mice. Dual intracellular 
microelectrodes applied simultaneous current injections (±0.5-3 nA) and membrane 
potential (Vm ) recordings in ECs at distance ~400 μm. Elevated extracellular 
potassium ([K+ ]E ; 8-15 mmol L-1 ; reference, 5 mmol L-1 ) activated KIR 
channels.
RESULTS: Conducted Vm (∆Vm ) responses ranged from ~-30 to 30 mV in response to 
-3 to +3 nA (linear regression, R2 ≥0.99) while lacking rectification for charge 
polarity or axial direction of spread. Conduction slope decreased ~10-20% during 
15 mmol L-1 [K+ ]E in Pre-AD males and AD females. 15 mmol L-1 [K+ ]E decreased 
conduction at lower thresholds in AD animals (~±20 mV) versus Pre-AD (~±25 mV). 
AD increased (~10-15%) conducted hyperpolarization during 8-12 mmol L-1 [K+ ]E .
CONCLUSIONS: Brain endothelial KIR channel activity modulates bidirectional 
spread of vasoreactive signals with enhanced regulation of EC coupling during AD 
pathology."
190,"AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the incidence and degree of 
postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions(POAs) in secondary laparoscopic 
procedures and assess the power of the preoperative levels of tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha(TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta(IL-1β) and selected peripheral 
inflammatory biomarkers(PIBs) in the prediction of the development and extent of 
POA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 103 patients who had 
previously undergone at least one or more laparoscopic abdominal or 
gynecological operations. We examined TNF-α, IL-1β, and PIBs, namely C-reactive 
protein, white blood cell count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and systemic immune-inflammation index(SII) 
according to the presence, location, and score of adhesions determined during 
secondary laparoscopic procedures.
RESULTS: Only age, postoperative adhesion index(PAI) score, NLR, SII, TNF-α, and 
IL-1β resulted in a significant difference in the existence of adhesion(P<0.05). 
The correlation analysis of TNF-α with variables showed that the PAI score and 
IL 1β levels had a significantly positive correlation.
CONCLUSION: The presence and extent of POA could be predicted by examining the 
preoperative TNF-α level in patients who had laparoscopic abdominal surgery 
previously. We could overcome adverse events during secondary laparoscopic 
procedures by assessing high-risk patients and integrating a personalized 
surgical approach to managing selected patients."
191,"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a complex treatment used in 
malignancies and some non-malignant diseases. The informed consent process for 
HCT can also be complex due to patient- and process-related barriers. The

checklist. As a result of the realities of HCT, we highlight some potential 
pitfalls to the informed consent process including uncertainty, sociocultural 
and communication barriers, and decisional regret. The purpose of this 
comprehensive review is to highlight unique situations which can result in 
failure of the informed consent process. We also offer potential solutions to 
these pitfalls, primarily making the informed consent more patient focused 
through dynamic and continuous processes to mitigate decisional regret."
192,"BACKGROUND: The relatively low aqueous solubility of EW-7197 that was

compare the efficacy of different routes of administering EW-7197 
(2-fluoro-N-[(5-[6-methylpyridin-2-yl]-4-[(1,2,4)triazolo(1,5-a)pyridin-6-yl]-1H-imidazol-2-yl)methyl]aniline) 
and EW-7197·hydrobromide (HBr), with improved aqueous solubility, for inhibiting 
peritoneal adhesion in a rat model.
METHODS: After peritoneal adhesion induction, 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
randomly divided into 5 groups with 6 rats in each: group A, sham control; group 
B, orally administered 25 mg/kg of EW-7197·HBr for 7 days; group C, locally 
administered 25 mg/kg of EW-7197·HBr; group D, orally administered 20 mg/kg of 
EW-7197 for 7 days; and group E, locally administered 20 mg/kg of EW-7197. Gross 
examination, histologic staining (hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome), 
and immunohistochemical analyses (Ki-67 and α-smooth muscle actin marker 
[α-SMA]) were performed to evaluate the efficacy of both drugs.
RESULTS: All procedures were technically successful. All treatment groups, 
except for group C, showed significantly reduced incidence, quality, tenacity, 
fibrosis, and collagen deposition scores and lowered expressions of Ki-67- and 
α-SMA-positive cells compared with group A. When comparing between groups, all 
scores were significantly lower in group B than in group C (all P < .001), 
whereas no significant difference was noted in any of the scores between groups 
D and E and groups B and E (all P > .05).
CONCLUSION: Orally administering EW-7197·HBr and both orally and locally 
administering EW-7197 significantly prevented peritoneal adhesion formation, and 
orally administering EW-7197·HBr was the most effective overall."
193,"AIM: To explore the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics 
and whole-lesion apparent diffusion coefficient histogram analysis of brain 
metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the differentiation of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with brain metastases from NSCLC 
were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were subtyped into EGFR 
mutation (23 cases) and wild-type (25 cases) groups. Whole-lesion histogram 
metrics were derived from the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and 
imaging features were evaluated according to conventional MRI. Student's t-test 
or Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-squared test, and receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis were performed to discriminate the two groups and to 
determine the diagnostic efficacy of ADC histogram parameters.
RESULTS: EGFR mutation group had more multiple brain metastases, less 
peritumoural brain oedema (PTBO), and lower peritumoural brain oedema index 
(PTBO-I) than EGFR wild-type group (all p<0.05). In addition, 90th and 75th 
percentiles of ADC and maximum ADC in the EGFR mutation group were significantly 
higher than in the EGFR wild-type group (all p<0.05). Ninetieth percentile of 
ADC had the highest area under the curve (AUC; 0.711), and it was found to 
outperform 75th percentile of ADC (AUC, 0.662; p=0.039) and maximum ADC (AUC, 
0.681).
CONCLUSIONS: Whole-lesion ADC histogram analysis and MRI features of brain 
metastasis from NSCLC are expected to be potential biomarkers to non-invasively 
differentiate the EGFR mutation status."
194,"Cost and availability have often dictated the use of heterologous/alien 
prolactins in experiments, particularly in vivo. The assumption has been that 
what is initiated in the target cell is representative of the homologous hormone 
since many heterologous mammalian prolactins bind to and activate rodent 
receptors. Here, we examined gene expression in mouse liver in response to a 
7-day treatment with recombinant mouse prolactin (mRecPRL), recombinant ovine 
prolactin (oRecPRL) and pituitary extract ovine prolactin (oPitPRL). Having 
established mouse ribosomal protein S9 as the most stable reference gene in the 
liver in the absence and presence of prolactin treatment, we examined expression 
of the two most highly expressed prolactin receptors (PRLRs) and three members 
of the Cyp3a group of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes by qRTPCR. For short form (SF) 
3 PRLR, mRecPRL doubled expression while for oRecPRL and oPitPRL expression was 
only 1.3-fold control. For the long form (LF) PRLR, changes were similar to 
those seen for SF 3 PRLR, such that the SF3:LF PRLR ratio remained the same. 
Expression of the Cyp3as was also dependent on the prolactin origin and, 
although mRecPRL always stimulated, the other PRLs caused varying results. 
Compared to control, Cyp3a16 was stimulated 12-fold by mRecPRL, 3-fold by 
oRecPRL, and 6-fold by oPitPRL. For Cyp3a41, mRecPRL was 3.7-fold control, 
oRecPRL was without effect, and oPitPRL was 2-fold control. Importantly, for 
Cyp3a44, mRecPRL stimulated 2-fold, whereas both oRecPRL and oPitPRL had an 
opposite, inhibitory effect, with expression at 0.5-fold control. We conclude 
that homologous hormone had the largest stimulatory effect on expression of all 
measured genes and that by contrast heterologous hormone showed reduced 
activity, no activity, or opposite activity, depending on the gene being 
analyzed. Thus, experimentation using alien heterologous PRL may lead to 
inaccurate conclusions."
195,"Myoepithelial carcinomas (MECs) of soft tissue are rare and aggressive tumors 
affecting young adults and children, but their molecular landscape has not been 
comprehensively explored through genome sequencing. Here, we present the 
whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and RNA sequencing 
findings of two MECs. Patients 1 and 2 (P1, P2), both male, were diagnosed at 27 
and 37 yr of age, respectively, with shoulder (P1) and inguinal (P2) soft tissue 
tumors. Both patients developed metastatic disease, and P2 died of disease. P1 
tumor showed a rhabdoid cytomorphology and a complete loss of INI1 (SMARCB1) 
expression, associated with a homozygous SMARCB1 deletion. The tumor from P2 
showed a clear cell/small cell morphology, retained INI1 expression and strong 
S100 positivity. By WES and WGS, tumors from both patients displayed low tumor 
mutation burdens, and no targetable alterations in cancer genes were detected. 
P2's tumor harbored an EWSR1::KLF15 rearrangement, whereas the tumor from P1 
showed a novel ASCC2::GGNBP2 fusion. WGS evidenced a complex genomic event 
involving mainly Chromosomes 17 and 22 in the tumor from P1, which was 
consistent with chromoplexy. These findings are consistent with previous reports 
of EWSR1 rearrangements (50% of cases) in MECs and provide a genetic basis for 
the loss of SMARCB1 protein expression observed through immunohistochemistry in 
10% of 40% of MEC cases. The lack of additional driver mutations in these tumors 
supports the hypothesis that these alterations are the key molecular events in 
MEC evolution. Furthermore, the presence of complex structural variant patterns, 
invisible to WES, highlights the novel biological insights that can be gained 
through the application of WGS to rare cancers."
196,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been approved in 
malignancies associated with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants, such 
as breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. In malignancies not 
associated with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants, the therapeutic 
relevance of PARP inhibitors is less clear. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
is known to demonstrate somatic alterations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. The current 
report is on a gentleman with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with a somatic 
BRCA2 pathogenic variant, who was effectively treated with olaparib. 
Furthermore, we discuss the existing data for use of PARP inhibitors in NSCLC. 
This study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing in identifying 
gene mutations and demonstrates how such information can be used to select 
targeted therapies in patients with actionable molecular alterations."
197,"Although germline cells are considered to be functionally ""immortal"", both the 
germline and supporting somatic cells in the gonad within an organism will 
experience aging. With increased age at parenthood, the age-related decline in 
reproductive success has become an important biological issue for an aging 
population. However, molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive aging across 
sexes in vertebrates remain poorly understood. To decipher molecular drivers of 
vertebrate gonadal aging across sexes, we perform longitudinal characterization 
of the gonadal transcriptome throughout lifespan in the naturally short-lived 
African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri). By combining mRNA-seq and 
small RNA-seq from 26 individuals, we characterize the aging gonads of young 
adult, middle-aged, and old female and male fish. We analyze changes in 
transcriptional patterns of genes, transposable elements (TEs), and piRNAs. We 
find that testes seem to undergo only marginal changes during aging. In 
contrast, in middle-aged ovaries, the timepoint associated with peak female 
fertility in this strain, PIWI pathway components are transiently downregulated, 
TE transcription is elevated, and piRNA levels generally decrease, suggesting 
that egg quality may already be declining at middle-age. Furthermore, we show 
that piRNA ping-pong biogenesis declines steadily with age in ovaries, while it 
is maintained in aging testes. To our knowledge, this dataset represents the 
most comprehensive transcriptomic dataset for vertebrate gonadal aging. This 
resource also highlights important pathways that are regulated during 
reproductive aging in either ovaries or testes, which could ultimately be 
leveraged to help restore aspects of youthful reproductive function."
198,"The lab on a chip is utilized as a background and a substrate for creating a 
proper flow for cellular processes in medicine. In this study, the concepts of 
cell isolation and cell transfer methods have been discussed. After that, the 
device of separation and transfer systems has been designed, simulated, and 
verified by placing the frequency of particle separation and droplet formation, 
which is tried to introduce a new device that can be used in cellular studies. 
The optimal operation conditions for the problem have also been investigated. 
High separation efficiency (99%) could be achieved when the velocity of the 
sample inlet in the microchannel separator is 180 μm/s. Also, a microfluidic 
device for droplet generation has been designed to transfer the isolated cells 
to the culture medium. For this purpose, the frequency of droplet production 
must be synchronized with particle ejection frequency and equals 9.09 Hz. This

199,"To treat large-scale wounds or chronic ulcers, it is highly desirable to develop 
multifunctional wound dressings that integrate antibacterial and angiogenic 
properties. While many biomaterials have been fabricated as wound dressings for 
skin regeneration, few reports have addressed the issue of complete skin 
regeneration due to the lack of vasculature and hair follicles. Herein, an 
instructive poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P34HB) fibrous wound 
dressing that integrates an antibacterial ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pro-angiogenic 
dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) is successfully prepared via electrospinning. The 
resultant dressings exhibit suitable flexibility with tensile strength and 
elongation at break up to 4.08 ± 0.18 MPa and 354.8 ± 18.4%, respectively. The 
in vitro results revealed that the groups of P34HB/CIP/DMOG dressings presented 
excellent biocompatibility on cell proliferation and significantly promote the 
spread and migration of L929 cells in both transwell and scratch assays. 
Capillary-like tube formation is also significantly enhanced in the 
P34HB/CIP/DMOG group dressings. Additionally, dressings from the P34HB/CIP and 
P34HB/CIP/DMOG groups show a broad spectrum of antimicrobial action against 
Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. In vivo 
studies further demonstrated that the prepared dressings in the P34HB/CIP/DMOG 
group not only improved wound closure, increased re-epithelialization and 
collagen formation, as well as reduced inflammatory response but also increased 
angiogenesis and remodeling, resulting in complete skin regeneration and hair 
follicles. Collectively, this work provides a simple but efficient approach for 
the design of a versatile wound dressing with the potential to have a 
synergistic effect on the rapid stimulation of angiogenesis as well as 
antibacterial activity in full-thickness skin repair."
200,"BACKGROUND: Compared with inhalation anesthesia, propofol-based total 
intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) improves long-term outcomes after cancer surgery. 
However, its effect on patients undergoing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
surgery remains unclear. We aimed to compare the oncological outcomes of TIVA 
and inhalation anesthesia after curative resection of early-stage NSCLC.
METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of patients diagnosed with stage I or 
II NSCLC who underwent curative resection at a tertiary university hospital 
between January 2010 and December 2017. The primary outcomes were 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) according to anesthesia 
type.
RESULTS: We included 1,508 patients with stage I/II NSCLC. The patients were 
divided into the TIVA (n = 980) and inhalation (n = 528) groups. The two groups 
were well balanced in terms of baseline clinical characteristics. The TIVA group 
showed a better RFS (7.7 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.37-8.02) than 
the inhalation group (6.8 years; 95% CI, 6.30-7.22, P = 0.003). Similarly, TIVA 
was superior to inhalation agents with respect to OS (median OS, 8.4 years [95% 
CI, 8.08-8.69] vs. 7.3 years [95% CI, 6.81-7.71]; P < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox 
regression analysis revealed that TIVA was an independent prognostic factor 
related to recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% CI] 1.04-1.47, P = 0.014) and 
OS (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.12-1.72, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Propofol-based TIVA was associated with better RFS and OS than 
inhalation anesthesia in patients with stage I/II NSCLC who underwent curative 
resection."
201,"Red algal polysaccharide is a good potential medical resource. Different red 
algal polysaccharides have different structural characteristics and rich 
biological activities. Previous studies have identified some structural 
information of sulfated polysaccharide (GNP, 25.8 kDa) from red algae, Gelidium 
crinale and found that GNP has excellent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and 
anti-tumor activities. On this basis, this study investigated the effect of GNP 
on atherosclerosis, which is closely related to antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory mechanisms and usually coexists and interacts with 
hypertension. This study investigated the inhibitory activity of GNP on 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its mechanism on oxidized low-density 
lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced HUVEC atherosclerosis. The results showed that GNP 
inhibits the up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules and oxidized low-density 
lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1). GNP can regulate mitogen-activated protein 
kinases (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and PI3K/AKT signal pathways, 
inhibit apoptosis, invasion and migration. Meanwhile, GNP (IC50 = 269.2 μg/mL) 
antagonizes ACE by competitive binding mode, and it can reduce systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). It provides a 
theoretical basis for GNP as a potential substance for the prevention and 
treatment of atherosclerosis."
202,"Systematic phytochemical investigation on the Mongolian medicinal herb 
Lomatogonium carinthiacum led to the isolation of 12 monoterpenoids including 
three new secoiridoids (1, 2 and 4) and one new iridoid glycoside (13), one new 
monoterpenoid alkaloid (3), and three new sesquiterpenoids (14-16). 
Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis (including 1D and 2D NMR, and HRESIMS) and 
quantum chemistry computations (including ECD and NMR calculations) were applied 
to elucidate their structures. Weak immunosuppressive activities were observed 
for the new isolates via inhibiting T cell proliferation and cytokine IFN-γ 
secretion in vitro."
203,"With the improvement of single-cell measurement techniques, there is a growing 
awareness that individual differences exist among cells, and protein expression 
distribution can vary across cells in the same tissue or cell line. Pinpointing 
the protein subcellular locations in single cells is crucial for mapping 
functional specificity of proteins and studying related diseases. Currently, 
research about single-cell protein location is still in its infancy, and most 
studies and databases do not annotate proteins at the cell level. For example, 
in the human protein atlas database, an immunofluorescence image stained for a 
particular protein shows multiple cells, but the subcellular location annotation 
is for the whole image, ignoring intercellular difference. In this study, we 
used large-scale immunofluorescence images and image-level subcellular locations 
to develop a deep-learning-based pipeline that could accurately recognize 
protein localizations in single cells. The pipeline consisted of two deep 
learning models, i.e. an image-based model and a cell-based model. The former 
used a multi-instance learning framework to comprehensively model protein 
distribution in multiple cells in each image, and could give both image-level 
and cell-level predictions. The latter firstly used clustering and heuristics 
algorithms to assign pseudo-labels of subcellular locations to the segmented 
cell images, and then used the pseudo-labels to train a classification model. 
Finally, the image-based model was fused with the cell-based model at the 
decision level to obtain the final ensemble model for single-cell prediction. 
Our experimental results showed that the ensemble model could achieve higher 
accuracy and robustness on independent test sets than state-of-the-art methods."
204,"OBJECTIVE: We undertook this study to examine the functional basis for epistasis 
between endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) and HLA-B27 in 
experimental spondyloarthritis (SpA).
METHODS: ERAP1-knockout rats were created using genome editing and bred with 
HLA-B27/human β2 -microglobulin-transgenic (HLA-B27-Tg) rats and HLA-B7-Tg rats. 
The effects of ERAP1 deficiency on HLA allotypes were determined using 
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, flow cytometry, allogeneic T cell 
proliferation assays, and gene expression analyses. Animals were examined for 
clinical features of disease, and tissue was assessed by histology.
RESULTS: ERAP1 deficiency increased the ratio of folded to unfolded (β2 m-free) 
HLA-B27 heavy chains, while having the opposite effect on HLA-B7. Furthermore, 
in rats with ERAP1 deficiency, HLA-B27 misfolding was reduced, while free 
HLA-B27 heavy chain dimers on the cell surface and monomers were increased. The 
effects of ERAP1 deficiency persisted during up-regulation of HLA-B27 and led to 
a reduction in endoplasmic reticulum stress. ERAP1 deficiency reduced the 
prevalence of arthritis in HLA-B27-Tg rats by two-thirds without reducing 
gastrointestinal inflammation. Dendritic cell abnormalities attributed to the 
presence of HLA-B27, including reduced allogeneic T cell stimulation and loss of 
CD103-positive/major histocompatibility complex class II-positive cells, were 
not rescued by ERAP1 deficiency, while excess Il23a up-regulation was mitigated.
CONCLUSION: ERAP1 deficiency reduced HLA-B27 misfolding and improved folding 
while having opposing effects on HLA-B7. The finding that HLA-B27-Tg rats had 
partial protection against SpA in this study is consistent with genetic evidence 
that loss-of-function and/or reduced expression of ERAP1 reduces the risk of 
ankylosing spondylitis. Functional studies support the concept that the effects 
of ERAP1 on HLA-B27 and SpA may be a consequence of how peptides affect the 
biology of this allotype rather than their role as antigenic determinants."
205,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver 
diseases worldwide, with a global prevalence of approximately 30%. However, the 
prevalence of NAFLD has been variously reported depending on the comorbidities. 
The rising prevalence of obesity in both the adult and pediatric populations is 
projected to consequently continue increasing NAFLD prevalence. It is a major 
cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD has a variety of clinical phenotypes and heterogeneity 
due to the complexity of pathogenesis and clinical conditions of its occurrence, 
resulting in various clinical prognoses. In this article, we briefly described 
the basic definition of NAFLD and classified the subtypes based on current

206,"Sialic acids are key mediators of cell function, particularly with regard to 
cellular interactions with the surrounding environment. Reagents that modulate 
the display of specific sialyl glycoforms at the cell surface would be useful 
biochemical tools and potentially allow for therapeutic intervention in numerous 
challenging chronic diseases. While multiple strategies are being explored for 
the control of cell surface sialosides, none that shows high selectivity between 
sialyltransferases or that targets a specific sialyl glycoform has yet to 
emerge. Here, we describe a strategy to block the formation of α2,8-linked 
sialic acid chains (oligo- and polysialic acid) through the use of 8-keto-sialic 
acid as a chain-terminating metabolic inhibitor that, if incorporated, cannot be 
elongated. 8-Keto-sialic acid is nontoxic at effective concentrations and serves 
to block polysialic acid synthesis in cancer cell lines and primary immune 
cells, with minimal effects on other sialyl glycoforms."
207,"Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral 
semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semitransparent 
chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of 
their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. We 
observe a reversal of circular selectivity in photocurrent generation when 
changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk-heterojunction cells. 
The change in selectivity can be explained by a space charge limitation on the 
collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one 
of the circular polarizations of near-infrared light by the chiral non-fullerene 
acceptor. The space charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of 
frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents. This article is

208,"INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer. As metastasis and 
recurrence are main causes of CRC death, it is of great significance to find 
prognostic biomarkers.
METHODS: Data related to CRC were collected from GEO database. The patients were 
grouped based on clinical information, and the differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were obtained by differential analysis. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment 
analyses were conducted based on DEGs. Cox combined with LASSO regression 
analysis was applied to screen out the key genes that used to build the 
prognostic model. Survival curve and receiver operating characteristic curve 
were employed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the model. Cox 
regression analysis was applied to determine the independence of risk score. 
GSEA and GSVA analyses were performed on patients with different risks according 
to the risk model scores, and the prognostic nomogram was plotted combined with 
clinical data. Also, qRT-PCR was applied to examine the expression status of the 
screened signatures in clinical cases.
RESULTS: We obtained 302 DEGs by dividing CRC patients into early-stage and 
advanced-stage groups. The results of enrichment analyses demonstrated that the 
DEGs were mainly concentrated in tissues of extracellular matrix, epithelial 
cell proliferation, and cell adhesion-related pathways. Regression identified 9 
hub genes notably correlated with prognosis, including CLK1, SLC2A3, LIPG, 
EPHB2, ATOH1, PLCB4, GZMB, CKMT2, and CXCL11. The validation of the risk model 
proved that the risk model was accurate and could independently determine the 
prognosis of patients. Finally, differences were found in pathway activity of 
extracellular matrix secretion, plaque secretion, Notch signaling pathway, and 
tight junctions in high-risk and low-risk patients. In addition to LIPG and 
CKMT2, other feature genes were notably overexpressed in CRC tumor tissues.
CONCLUSION: The results proved that the expression levels of the 9 biomarkers 
could be used to predict the prognosis of CRC patients."
209,"The strains designed PP-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 isolated from soils, were 
Gram-stain-positive rods, facultative anaerobe, endospore-forming bacteria. The 
strains produced l-lactic acid from glucose. They showed positive for catalase 
but negative for oxidase, nitrate reduction and arginine hydrolysis. Strains 
P-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 were closely related to Weizmannia coagulans LMG 6326T 
(97.27-97.64%) and W. acidiproducens KCTC 13078T (96.46-96.74%) based on 16S 
rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively. They contained meso-diaminopimelic 
acid in cell wall peptidoglycan and had seven isoprene units (MK-7) as the 
predominant menaquinone. The major cellular fatty acids of strain PP-18T were 
iso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0, iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C15:0. The ANIb and ANIm values 
among the genomes of strains PP-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 are above 99.4% while their 
ANIb and ANIm values among them and W. coagulans LMG 6326T and W. acidiproducens 
KCTC 13078T were ranged from 76.61 to 79.59%. These 3 strains showed the digital 
DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values of 20.7-23.6% when compared with W. 
coagulans LMG 6326T and W. acidiproducens DSM 23148T. The DNA G + C contents of 
strains PP-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 were 45.82%, 45.86% and 45.86%, respectively. The 
major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and 
phosphoglycolipids. The results of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics 
and whole-genome analysis indicated that the strains PP-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 
should be represented as a novel species within the genus Weizmannia for which 
the name Weizmannia acidilactici sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is PP-18T

210,"Cryopreservation of red blood cells (RBCs) is imperative for transfusion 
therapy, while cryoprotectants are essential to protect RBCs from cryoinjury 
under freezing temperatures. Trehalose has been considered as a biocompatible 
cryoprotectant that naturally accumulates in organisms to tolerate anhydrobiosis 
and cryobiosis. Herein, we report a feasible protocol that enables glycerol-free 
cryopreservation of human RBCs by integration of the synthesized trehalose 
lipids and dissociative trehalose through ice tuning and membrane stabilization. 
Typically, in comparison with sucrose monolaurate or trehalose only, trehalose 
monolaurate was able to protect cell membranes against freeze stress, achieving 
96.9 ± 2.0% cryosurvival after incubation and cryopreservation of human RBCs 
with 0.8 M trehalose. Moreover, there were slight changes in cell morphology and 
cell functions. It was further confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry and 
osmotic fragility tests that the moderate membrane-binding activity of trehalose 
lipids exerted cell stabilization for high cryosurvival. The aforementioned 
study is likely to provide an alternative way for glycerol-free cryopreservation 
of human RBCs and other types of cells."
211,"HOXA9 is commonly upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it confers 
poor prognosis. Characterising the protein interactome of endogenous HOXA9 in 
human AML, we identified a chromatin complex of HOXA9 with the nuclear matrix 
attachment protein-SAFB. SAFB perturbation phenocopied HOXA9 knockout to 
decrease AML proliferation, increase differentiation and apoptosis in vitro and 
prolonged survival in vivo. Integrated genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic 
analyses further demonstrated that the HOXA9-SAFB-chromatin complex associates 
with NuRD and HP1g to repress the expression of factors associated with 
differentiation and apoptosis, including NOTCH1, CEBPd, S100A8, and CDKN1A. 
Chemical or genetic perturbation of NuRD and HP1g -associated catalytic activity 
also triggered differentiation, apoptosis and the induction of these 
tumor-suppressive genes. Importantly, this mechanism is operative in other 
HOXA9-dependent AML genotypes. This mechanistic insight demonstrates active 
HOXA9-dependent differentiation block as a potent mechanism of disease 
maintenance in AML, that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention via 
therapies targeting the HOXA9/SAFB interface and/or NuRD and HP1g activity."
212,"Cellulose is a structural linear polysaccharide that is naturally produced by 
plants and bacteria, making it the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. The 
hierarchical structure of cellulose from the nano- to microscale is intimately 
linked to its biosynthesis and the ability to process this sustainable resource 
for materials applications. Despite this, the morphology of bacterial cellulose 
microfibrils and their assembly into higher order structures, as well as the 
structural origins of the alternating crystalline and disordered supramolecular 
structure of cellulose, have remained elusive. In this work, we employed 
high-resolution transmission electron and atomic force microscopies to study the 
morphology of bacterial cellulose ribbons at different levels of its structural 
hierarchy and provide direct visualization of nanometer-wide microfibrils. The 
non-persistent twisting of cellulose ribbons was characterized in detail, and we 
found that twists are associated with nanostructural defects at the bundle and 
microfibril levels. To investigate the structural origins of the persistent 
disordered regions that are present along cellulose ribbons, we employed a 
correlative super-resolution light and electron microscopy workflow and observed 
that the disordered regions that can be seen in super-resolution fluorescence 
microscopy largely correlated with the ribbon twisting observed in electron 
microscopy. Unraveling the hierarchical assembly of bacterial cellulose and the 
ultrastructural basis of its disordered regions provides insights into its 
biosynthesis and susceptibility to hydrolysis. These findings are important to 
understand the cell-directed assembly of cellulose, develop new cellulose-based 
nanomaterials, and develop more efficient biomass conversion strategies."
213,"Both cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share some 
common risk factors (e.g., age, obesity, oxidative stress, inflammation, 
hypertension) that contribute to their overlapping pathogenesis, indicating a

potential connection at the protein level, we study the potential cross-seeding 
(heterotypic interactions) between CVD-associated atrial natriuretic peptide 
(ANP) and AD-associated β-amyloid (Aβ). Collective aggregation and cell assays 
demonstrate the cross-seeding of ANP with different Aβ species including 
monomers, oligomers, and fibrils with high binding affinity (KD = 1.234-1.797 
μM) in a dose-dependent manner. Such ANP-induced cross-seeding also modifies the 
Aβ aggregation pathway, fibril morphology, and cell deposition pattern by 
inhibiting Aβ fibrillization from small aggregates, disassembling preformed Aβ 
fibrils, and alleviating Aβ-associated cytotoxicity. Finally, using transgenic 
C. elegans worms that express the human muscle-specific Aβ1-42, ANP can also 
effectively delay Aβ-induced worm paralysis, decrease Aβ plaques in worm brains, 
and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, confirming its in vivo 
inhibition ability to prevent neurodevelopmental toxicity in worms. This work 
discovers not only a new cross-seeding system between the two disease-related 
proteins but also a new finding that ANP possesses a new biological function as 
an Aβ inhibitor in the nonaggregated state."
214,"Aim: To identify genes associated with the prognosis of head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma (HNSC) and potential molecular targets for therapy. Materials and 
Methods: Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Human Protein Atlas, 
University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer, LinkedOmics, cBioPortal, Cell 
Counting Kit 8, and polymerase chain reaction were used in this study. Results: 
The expression level of nuclear transport factor 2 (NUTF2) was elevated in HNSC 
tissues and was associated with poor prognosis in HNSC patients. NUTF2-targeted 
intervention inhibited the proliferation of HNSC cells. SEC61G, which was 
positively correlated with NUTF2, was decreased in HNSC cells with NUTF2 
suppression. Conclusions: NUTF2 may be correlated with the prognosis and 
development of HNSC, laying the foundation for future studies on the potential 
role of NUTF2 in HNSC."
215,"Aims: In this study, we determined whether different genotypes of 
drug-metabolizing enzymes are associated with the therapeutic effects of 
gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: A retrospective 
analysis of 112 patients with stage III or IV NSCLC was performed. The clinical 
characteristics of these patients, including progression-free survival (PFS), 
outcome of gefitinib treatment, and relationship between the genotypes of 
rs1065852/rs2242480 and prognosis, were analyzed. Results: The rs1065852 CT/TT 
genotype was associated with worse prognosis than the CC type (p = 0.0306), and 
the median PFS was lower than that with the CC type (287 days vs. 350 days). 
Compared with those with CC+CC genotypes, individuals carrying T alleles 
(CT/TT+CT/TT) at rs1065852/rs2242480 had a poorer prognosis, and the median PFS 
of CT/TT+CT/TT at rs1065852/rs2242480 was significantly lower than that of the 
CC+CC type (188 days vs. 444.5 days). Conclusions: Genotypes of the 
drug-metabolizing enzymes rs1065852 and rs2242480 have an impact on the 
prognosis of patients with NSCLC treated with gefitinib."
216,"The DNA-origami technique has enabled the engineering of transmembrane nanopores 
with programmable size and functionality, showing promise in building biosensors 
and synthetic cells. However, it remains challenging to build large (>10 nm), 
functionalizable nanopores that spontaneously perforate lipid membranes. Here, 
we take advantage of pneumolysin (PLY), a bacterial toxin that potently forms 
wide ring-like channels on cell membranes, to construct hybrid DNA-protein 
nanopores. This PLY-DNA-origami complex, in which a DNA-origami ring corrals up 
to 48 copies of PLY, targets the cholesterol-rich membranes of liposomes and red 
blood cells, readily forming uniformly sized pores with an average inner 
diameter of ∼22 nm. Such hybrid nanopores facilitate the exchange of 
macromolecules between perforated liposomes and their environment, with the 
exchange rate negatively correlating with the macromolecule size (diameters of 
gyration: 8-22 nm). Additionally, the DNA ring can be decorated with 
intrinsically disordered nucleoporins to further restrict the diffusion of 
traversing molecules, highlighting the programmability of the hybrid nanopores. 
PLY-DNA pores provide an enabling biophysical tool for studying the 
cross-membrane translocation of ultralarge molecules and open new opportunities 
for analytical chemistry, synthetic biology, and nanomedicine."
217,"Nowadays, lithium-ion batteries are required to have a higher energy density and 
safety because of their wide applications. Current commercial separators have 
poor wettability and thermal stability, which significantly impact the 
performance and safety of batteries. In this study, a class of boehmite 
particles with different grain sizes was synthesized by adjusting hydrothermal 
temperatures and used to fabricate boehmite/polyacrylonitrile (BM/PAN) 
membranes. All of these BM/PAN membranes can not only maintain excellent thermal 
dimensional stability above 200 °C but also have good electrolyte wettability 
and high porosity. More interestingly, the BM/PAN membranes' thermal shutdown 
temperature can be adjusted by changing the grain size of boehmite particles. 
The lithium-ion batteries assembled with BM/PAN separators exhibit different 
thermal stability phenomena at 150 °C and have excellent rate performance and 
cycle stability at room temperature. After 120 cycles at 1C, the LiFePO4 
half-cell assembled by the best BM/PAN separator has almost unchanged discharge 
capacity, whereas the capacity retention of Celgard 2325 is only about 85%. 
Meanwhile, the NCM523 half-cell assembled with the best BM/PAN separator shows 
superb cycle stability after 500 cycles at 8C, with a capacity retention of 79% 
compared with 56% for Celgard 2325."
218,"Chemical immunotherapeutic strategies including Antibody Recruiting Molecules 
(ARMs) direct immune-mediated clearance of diseased cells or pathogens. ARMs are 
bivalent small molecules containing an antibody-binding domain (ABD) and a 
target-binding domain (TBD) to recruit endogenous serum antibodies to highly 
overexpressed tumour antigens for immune mediated clearance. ARM function relies 
on a high tumour antigen valency, limiting function against lower antigen 
expressing tumours. To address this limitation, we report a tuneable multivalent 
immune recruitment platform (MIR) to amplify/stabilize antibody recruitment to 
cells with lower antigen valencies. An initial set of polymeric ARMs (pARMs) 
were synthesized and screened to evaluate ABD/TBD copy number, ratio, and steric 
occlusion on specific immune induction. Most pARMs demonstrate simultaneous high 
avidity binding to anti-dinitrophenyl antibodies and prostate specific membrane 
antigens on prostate cancer. Optimized pARMs mediated enhanced and specific 
anti-cancer immune function against lower antigen expressing prostate cancer 
cells compared to an analogous monovalent ARM."
219,"Tetramethrin is a widely applied type I chiral pyrethroid insecticide that 
exists as a mixture of four isomers. In the present study, its stereoselective 
cytotoxicity, bioaccumulation, degradation, and metabolism were investigated for 
the first time at the enantiomeric level in detail by using a sensitive chiral 
high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS/MS) 
method. Results showed that among rac-tetramethrin and its four enantiomers, the 
trans (+)-1R,3R-tetramethrin had the strongest inhibition effect on the PC12 
cells. In the earthworm exposure trial, the concentration of trans 
(-)-1S,3S-tetramethrin was 0.94-8.92 times in earthworms (cultivated in natural 
soil) and 1.67-5.01 times (cultivated in artificial soil) higher than trans 
(+)-1R,3R-tetramethrin, respectively. In the greenhouse experiment, the trans 
(+)-1R,3R-tetramethrin and cis (+)-1R,3S-tetramethrin were preferentially 
degraded. Furthermore, for rat liver microsome in vitro incubation, the maximum 
metabolism rate of cis (-)-1S,3R-tetramethrin was 1.50 times higher than its 
antipodes. Altogether, the aim of this study was to provide a scientific and 
reasonable reference for the possibility of developing a single enantiomer to 
replace the application of rac-tetramethrin, which could possess better 
bioactivity and lower ecotoxicity, and thus permit more reliable and accurate 
environmental monitoring and risk assessment."
220,"Humic substances (HS) are the most abundant forms of natural organic matter on 
the earth surface. Comprised of decomposed plant and animal materials rich in 
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur complexes, HS facilitate global 
carbon and nitrogen cycling and the transport of anthropogenic contaminants. 
While it is known that HS also interact with organisms at different trophic 
levels to produce beneficial and harmful effects whether HS exert these 
biological effects through accumulation remains unknown. Current radiolabeling 
techniques, which only detect the amount of accumulated radiolabels, cannot 
visualize the transport and accumulation behavior of HS. Here, using a 
label-free method based on pump-probe microscopy, we show HS entered the 
protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, zebrafish embryos, and human cells and 
exerted direct effects on these organisms. HS accumulated in the nucleus of T. 
thermophila, chorion pore canals of zebrafish embryos, and nucleus of intestinal 
and lung cells in a concentration- and time-dependent way. Epigenetic and 
transcriptomics assays show HS altered chromatin accessibility and gene 
transcription in T. thermophila. In zebrafish larvae, HS induced neurotoxicity, 
altering spontaneous muscle contraction and locomotor activity. Detailed images 
showing HS accumulation in our study reveal new insights on the ecological and 
environmental behavior of HS."
221,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) is a key regulator of tissue growth and 
development in response to growth hormone stimulation. In the skeletal system, 
IGF-1 derived from osteoblasts and chondrocytes are essential for normal bone 
development; however, whether bone marrow (BM)-resident cells provide distinct 
sources of IGF-1 in the adult skeleton remains elusive. Here, we show that BM 
stromal cells (BMSCs) and megakaryocytes/platelets (MKs/PLTs) express the 
highest levels of IGF-1 in adult long bones. Deletion of Igf1 from BMSCs by 
Lepr-Cre leads to decreased bone formation, impaired bone regeneration, and 
increased BM adipogenesis. Importantly, reduction of BMSC-derived IGF-1 
contributes to fasting-induced marrow fat accumulation. In contrast, deletion of 
Igf1 from MKs/PLTs by Pf4-Cre leads to reduced bone formation and regeneration 
without affecting BM adipogenesis. To our surprise, MKs/PLTs are also an 
important source of systemic IGF-1. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from Pf4-Cre; 
Igf1f/fmice showed compromised osteogenic potential both in vivo and in vitro, 
suggesting that MK/PLT-derived IGF-1 underlies the therapeutic effects of PRP. 
Taken together, this study identifies BMSCs and MKs/PLTs as two important 
sources of IGF-1 that coordinate to maintain and regenerate the adult skeleton, 
highlighting reciprocal regulation between the hematopoietic and skeletal 
systems."
222,"Single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis is the gold standard approach to 
identifying molecularly defined cell phenotypes. However, this approach cannot 
be used for dynamics measurements such as live-cell imaging. Here, we developed 
a multifunctional robot, the automated live imaging and cell picking system 
(ALPS) and used it to perform single-cell RNA sequencing for microscopically 
observed cells with multiple imaging modes. Using robotically obtained data that 
linked cell images and the whole transcriptome, we successfully predicted 
transcriptome-defined cell phenotypes in a noninvasive manner using cell 
image-based deep learning. This noninvasive approach opens a window to determine 
the live-cell whole transcriptome in real time. Moreover, this work, which is 
based on a data-driven approach, is a proof of concept for determining the 
transcriptome-defined phenotypes (i.e., not relying on specific genes) of any 
cell from cell images using a model trained on linked datasets."
223,"The nuclear long non-coding RNA LUCAT1 has previously been identified as a 
negative feedback regulator of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine 
expression in human myeloid cells. Here, we define the mechanistic basis for the 
suppression of inflammatory gene expression by LUCAT1. Using comprehensive 
identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry as well as RNA 
immunoprecipitation, we identified proteins important in processing and 
alternative splicing of mRNAs as LUCAT1-binding proteins. These included 
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C, M, and A2B1. Consistent with this 
finding, cells lacking LUCAT1 have altered splicing of selected immune genes. In 
particular, upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, the splicing of the nuclear 
receptor 4A2 (NR4A2) gene was particularly affected. As a consequence, 
expression of NR4A2 was reduced and delayed in cells lacking LUCAT1. 
NR4A2-deficient cells had elevated expression of immune genes. These 
observations suggest that LUCAT1 is induced to control the splicing and 
stability of NR4A2, which is in part responsible for the anti-inflammatory 
effect of LUCAT1. Furthermore, we analyzed a large cohort of patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease as well as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. In these patients, LUCAT1 levels were elevated and in both diseases, 
positively correlated with disease severity. Collectively, these studies define 
a key molecular mechanism of LUCAT1-dependent immune regulation through 
post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs highlighting its role in the regulation 
of inflammatory disease."
224,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are a heterogeneous group of 
cells with expansion, differentiation, and repopulation capacities. How HSPCs 
orchestrate the stemness state with diverse lineage differentiation at steady 
condition or acute stress remains largely unknown. Here, we show that zebrafish 
mutants that are deficient in an epigenetic regulator Atf7ip or Setdb1 
methyltransferase undergo excessive myeloid differentiation with impaired HSPC 
expansion, manifesting a decline in T cells and erythroid lineage. We find that 
Atf7ip regulates hematopoiesis through Setdb1-mediated H3K9me3 modification and 
chromatin remodeling. During hematopoiesis, the interaction of Atf7ip and Setdb1 
triggers H3K9me3 depositions in hematopoietic regulatory genes including cebpβ 
and cdkn1a, preventing HSPCs from loss of expansion and premature 
differentiation into myeloid lineage. Concomitantly, loss of Atf7ip or Setdb1 
derepresses retrotransposons that instigate the viral sensor Mda5/Rig-I like 
receptor (RLR) signaling, leading to stress-driven myelopoiesis and 
inflammation. We find that ATF7IP or SETDB1 depletion represses human leukemic 
cell growth and induces myeloid differentiation with retrotransposon-triggered 
inflammation. These findings establish that Atf7ip/Setdb1-mediated H3K9me3 
deposition constitutes a genome-wide checkpoint that impedes the myeloid 
potential and maintains HSPC stemness for diverse blood cell production, 
providing unique insights into potential intervention in hematological 
malignancy."
225,"Cephalotaxines harbor great medical potential, but their natural source, the 
endemic conifer Cephalotaxus is highly endangered, creating a conflict between 
biotechnological valorization and preservation of biodiversity. Here, we 
construct the whole biosynthetic pathway to the 1-phenethylisoquinoline 
scaffold, as first committed compound for phenylethylisoquinoline alkaloids 
(PIAs), combining metabolic modeling, and transcriptome mining 
of Cephalotaxus hainanensis to infer the biosynthesis for PIA precursor. We 
identify a novel protein, ChPSS, driving the Pictet-Spengler condensation and 
show that this enzyme represents the branching point where PIA biosynthesis 
diverges from the concurrent benzylisoquinoline-alkaloids pathway. We also 
pinpoint ChDBR as crucial step to form 4-hydroxydihydrocinnamaldehyde diverging 
from lignin biosynthesis. The elucidation of the early PIA pathway represents an 
important step toward microbe-based production of these pharmaceutically 
important alkaloids resolving the conflict between biotechnology and 
preservation of biodiversity."
226,"Decline in mitochondrial function underlies aging and age-related diseases, but 
the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in these processes remains 
elusive. To investigate patterns of mtDNA mutations, it is particularly 
important to quantify mtDNA mutations and their associated pathogenic effects at 
the single-cell level. However, existing single-cell mtDNA sequencing approaches 
remain inefficient due to high cost and low mtDNA on-target rates. In this 
study, we developed a cost-effective mtDNA targeted-sequencing protocol called 
single-cell sequencing by targeted amplification of multiplex probes (scSTAMP) 
and experimentally validated its reliability. We then applied our method to 
assess single-cell mtDNA mutations in 768 B lymphocytes and 768 monocytes from a 
76-y-old female. Across 632 B lymphocyte and 617 monocytes with medium mtDNA 
coverage over >100×, our results indicated that over 50% of cells carried at 
least one mtDNA mutation with variant allele frequencies (VAFs) over 20%, and 
that cells carried an average of 0.658 and 0.712 such mutation for B lymphocytes 
and monocytes, respectively. Surprisingly, more than 20% of the observed 
mutations had VAFs of over 90% in either cell population. In addition, over 60% 
of the mutations were in protein-coding genes, of which over 70% were 
nonsynonymous, and more than 50% of the nonsynonymous mutations were predicted 
to be highly pathogenic. Interestingly, about 80% of the observed mutations were 
singletons in the respective cell populations. Our results revealed mtDNA 
mutations with functional significance might be prevalent at advanced age, 
calling further investigation on age-related mtDNA mutation dynamics at the 
single-cell level."
227,"The retromer is a heteromeric protein complex that localizes to endosomal 
membranes and drives the formation of endosomal tubules that recycle membrane 
protein cargoes. In plants, the retromer plays essential and canonical functions 
in regulating the transport of vacuolar storage proteins and the recycle of 
endocytosed plasma membrane proteins (PM); however, the mechanisms underlying 
the regulation of assembly, protein stability, and membrane recruitment of the 
plant retromer complex remain to be elucidated. In this study, we identify a 
plant-unique endosomal regulator termed BLISTER (BLI), which colocalizes and 
associates with the retromer complex by interacting with the retromer core 
subunits VPS35 and VPS29. Depletion of BLI perturbs the assembly and membrane 
recruitment of the retromer core VPS26-VPS35-VPS29 trimer. Consequently, 
depletion of BLI disrupts retromer-regulated endosomal trafficking function, 
including transport of soluble vacuolar proteins and recycling of endocytosed 
PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins from the endosomes back to the PM. Moreover, genetic 
analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants reveals BLI and core retromer interact 
genetically in the regulation of endosomal trafficking. Taken together, we 
identified BLI as a plant-specific endosomal regulator, which functions in 
retromer pathway to modulate the recycling of endocytosed PM proteins and the 
trafficking of soluble vacuolar cargoes."
228,"Androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variants (AR-SVs) promote prostate cancer 
(PCa) growth by orchestrating transcriptional reprogramming. Mechanisms by which 
the low complexity and intrinsically disordered primary transactivation domain 
(AF-1) of AR and AR-SVs regulate transcriptional programming in PCa remains 
poorly defined. Using omics, live and fixed fluorescent microscopy of cells, and 
purified AF-1 and AR-V7 recombinant proteins we show here that AF-1 and the 
AR-V7 splice variant form molecular condensates by liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) that exhibit disorder characteristics such as rapid 
intracellular mobility, coactivator interaction, and euchromatin induction. The 
LLPS and other disorder characteristics were reversed by a class of 
small-molecule-selective AR-irreversible covalent antagonists 
(SARICA) represented herein by UT-143 that covalently and selectively bind to 
C406 and C327 in the AF-1 region. Interfering with LLPS formation with UT-143 or 
mutagenesis resulted in chromatin condensation and dissociation of AR-V7 
interactome, all culminating in a transcriptionally incompetent complex. 
Biochemical studies suggest that C327 and C406 in the AF-1 region are critical 
for condensate formation, AR-V7 function, and UT-143's irreversible AR 
inhibition. Therapeutically, UT-143 possesses drug-like pharmacokinetics and 
metabolism properties and inhibits PCa cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our 
work provides critical information suggesting that clinically important AR-V7 
forms transcriptionally competent molecular condensates and covalently engaging 
C327 and C406 in AF-1, dissolves the condensates, and inhibits its function. The 
work also identifies a library of AF-1-binding AR and AR-SV-selective covalent 
inhibitors for the treatment of PCa."
229,"Adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) therapies suffer from a number of limitations 
(e.g., poor control of solid tumors), and while combining ACT with cytokine 
therapy can enhance effectiveness, this also results in significant side 
effects. Here, we describe a nanotechnology approach to improve the efficacy of 
ACT therapies by metabolically labeling T cells with unnatural sugar 
nanoparticles, allowing direct conjugation of antitumor cytokines onto the T 
cell surface during the manufacturing process. This allows local, concentrated 
activity of otherwise toxic cytokines. This approach increases T cell 
infiltration into solid tumors, activates the host immune system toward a Type 1 
response, encourages antigen spreading, and improves control of aggressive solid 
tumors and achieves complete blood cancer regression with otherwise noncurative 
doses of CAR-T cells. Overall, this method provides an effective and easily 
integrated approach to the current ACT manufacturing process to increase 
efficacy in various settings."
230,"Target of Rapamycin Complex I (TORC1) is a central regulator of metabolism in 
eukaryotes that responds to a wide array of negative and positive inputs. The 
GTPase-activating protein toward Rags (GATOR) signaling pathway acts upstream of 
TORC1 and is comprised of two subcomplexes. The trimeric GATOR1 complex inhibits 
TORC1 activity in response to amino acid limitation by serving as a 
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the TORC1 activator RagA/B, a component of 
the lysosomally located Rag GTPase. The multi-protein GATOR2 complex inhibits 
the activity of GATOR1 and thus promotes TORC1 activation. Here we report that 
Wdr59, originally assigned to the GATOR2 complex based on studies performed in 
tissue culture cells, unexpectedly has a dual function in TORC1 regulation in 
Drosophila. We find that in the ovary and the eye imaginal disc brain complex, 
Wdr59 inhibits TORC1 activity by opposing the GATOR2-dependent inhibition of 
GATOR1. Conversely, in the Drosophila fat body, Wdr59 promotes the accumulation 
of the GATOR2 component Mio and is required for TORC1 activation. Similarly, in 
mammalian HeLa cells, Wdr59 prevents the proteolytic destruction of GATOR2 
proteins Mio and Wdr24. Consistent with the reduced levels of the 
TORC1-activating GATOR2 complex, Wdr59KOs HeLa cells have reduced TORC1 activity 
which is restored along with GATOR2 protein levels upon proteasome inhibition. 
Taken together, our data support the model that the Wdr59 component of the 
GATOR2 complex functions to promote or inhibit TORC1 activity depending on 
cellular context."
231,"The cochlea's ability to discriminate sound frequencies is facilitated by a 
special topography along its longitudinal axis known as tonotopy. Auditory hair 
cells located at the base of the cochlea respond to high-frequency sounds, 
whereas hair cells at the apex respond to lower frequencies. Gradual changes in 
morphological and physiological features along the length of the cochlea 
determine each region's frequency selectivity, but it remains unclear how 
tonotopy is established during cochlear development. Recently, sonic hedgehog 
(SHH) was proposed to initiate the establishment of tonotopy by conferring 
regional identity to the primordial cochlea. Here, using mouse genetics, 
we provide in vivo evidence that regional identity in the embryonic cochlea acts 
as a framework upon which tonotopy-specific properties essential for frequency 
selectivity in the mature cochlea develop. We found that follistatin (FST) is 
required for the maintenance of apical cochlear identity, but dispensable for 
its initial induction. In a fate-mapping analysis, we found that FST promotes 
expansion of apical cochlear cells, contributing to the formation of the apical 
cochlear domain. SHH, in contrast, is required both for the induction and 
maintenance of apical identity. In the absence of FST or SHH, mice produce a 
short cochlea lacking its apical domain. This results in the loss of 
apex-specific anatomical and molecular properties and low-frequency-specific 
hearing loss."
232,"Methionine (MET) contributes to brain function and is required for proper 
functioning of the central nervous system. However, exceptionally high levels of 
MET and its metabolites in plasma have been found to be toxic and can lead to 
cell alterations. Long-term exposure to MET has been shown to mimic psychotic 
symptoms in schizophrenic patients and rodents. The present study evaluated 
behavioral and neurochemical effects of long-term exposure to MET in zebrafish. 
Five groups of zebrafish were exposed to MET at a concentration of 4.5 mM for 7 
days, along with acute exposure to 25 μM of clozapine and 750, 1000, and 1250 μM 
of metoclopramide. In contrast, the normal group was exposed to only water and 
dimethyl sulfoxide. After the treatment, social interaction, anxiety, memory, 
and locomotion of zebrafish and serotonin levels in zebrafish brains were 
evaluated. Our results showed that metoclopramide was not only beneficial in 
improving MET-induced cognitive impairment but it also prevented social 
withdrawal in zebrafish exposed to MET. In addition, metoclopramide reversed 
anxiety-like behavior, as indicated by significant changes in locomotion 
activity. Despite slight changes in serotonin levels in the zebrafish brain, an 
in vitro serotonin assay failed to demonstrate significant differences between 
the disease control, normal, and two treatment groups. Finally, results from the 
study showed that repeated administration of MET induced schizophrenia-like 
symptoms, although metoclopramide ameliorated the MET-mediated negative symptoms 
and cognitive deficits in zebrafish. Overall, our findings suggest a new 
perspective to further explore the antipsychotic properties of metoclopramide."
233,"Background: High frequency of Helicobacter pylori infection and the unknown mode 
of transmission prompted us to investigate H. pylori-wild housefly relationship. 
H. pylori causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and stomach cancer. H. pylori 
persists in the gut of the experimentally infected houseflies. The existence of 
H. pylori strains isolated from wild houseflies, on the other hand, has never 
been documented. Methods: In this study, 902 wild houseflies from different 
sites were identified as Musca domestica, then 60 flies were screened by 
traditional microbiological techniques and H. pylori-specific 16S rRNA gene. The 
antibiotic resistance (ART) was investigated phenotypically. Wild housefly gut 
bacterial isolates were further evaluated genotypically to have 23S rRNA gene 
mutation related to clarithromycin resistance. To find efficient therapeutic 
alternatives, the potency of three plant extracts (garlic, ginger, and lemon) 
and the wasp, Vespa orientalis venom was evaluated against H. pylori. The 
cytotoxic effect of the crude wasp venom, the most potent extract, against Vero 
and Colon cancer (Caco2) cell lines was investigated using the 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Results: All 
isolates from houseflies were positive. The isolated bacteria have variable 
resistance to frequently used antibiotics in all isolates. Minimum inhibitory 
concentration values of 15.625 mg/mL for both ginger and lemon extracts, 
7.8125 mg/mL for garlic extract, and 0.0313 mg/mL for wasp venom were recorded. 
Wasp venom has the most potent antibacterial activity compared with the four 
antibiotics that are currently used in therapies against H. pylori. Conclusion: 
We conclude that wild houseflies can play a role in disseminating H. pylori. The 
housefly gut may be a suitable environment for the horizontal transfer of ART 
genes among its associated microbiome and H. pylori. Wasp venom proved its 
potential activity as a new and effective anti-H. pylori drug for both 
therapeutic and preventative usage."
234,"Background: Patients with osteoporosis (OP) have a high risk of bone fracture. 
Abnormal bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) differentiation is an essential 
process of OP development. In recent years, photobiomodulation has been shown to 
effectively promote BMSC proliferation. However, the mechanism by which 
photobiomodulation promotes BMSC proliferation is unclear. Long noncoding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) are essential mediators in multiple biological processes. The lncRNA 
maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is a novel lncRNA gene and is related to cell 
proliferation. Studies have indicated that MEG3 serves as a promotor in BMSC 
proliferation. Objective: To investigate the effects and mechanisms of 800 nm 
light-emitting diode (LED) photobiomodulation in BMSC proliferation. Materials 
and methods: The BMSCs collected from mouse tibias and femurs were irradiated by 
800 nm LED for 180 sec. CCK-8 assay was used to detect the cell viability. A 
dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine IncRNA MEG3 acted as a 
miR-217-5p sponge. We used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) and western blot to detect the mRNA and protein levels of MEG3, 
miR-217-5p, Notch2, Hes1, Hey2. Results: In the present study, we revealed that 
photobiomodulation (800 nm LED) could increase the mRNA level of MEG3, and 
protein levels of Notch2, Hes1, and Hey2. Moreover, we also identified that 
upregulated MEG3 could act as a miR-217-5p sponge to activate the Notch 
signaling pathway. Conclusions: The current study revealed the MEG3-related 
mechanism of photobiomodulation treatment in OP and identified potential gene 
therapies for OP."
235,"Halite (NaCl mineral) has exhibited the potential to preserve microorganisms for 
millions of years on Earth. This mineral was also identified on Mars and in 
meteorites. In this study, we investigated the potential of halite crystals to 
protect microbial life-forms on the surface of an airless body (e.g., 
meteorite), for instance, during a lithopanspermia process (interplanetary 
travel step) in the early Solar System. To investigate the effect of the 
radiation of the young Sun on microorganisms, we performed extensive simulation 
experiments by employing a synchrotron facility. We focused on two exposure 
conditions: vacuum (low Earth orbit, 10-4 Pa) and vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) 
radiation (range 57.6-124 nm, flux 7.14 W/m2), with the latter representing an 
extreme scenario with high VUV fluxes comparable to the amount of radiation of a 
stellar superflare from the young Sun. The stellar VUV parameters were estimated 
by using the very well-studied solar analog of the young Sun, κ1 Cet. To 
evaluate the protective effects of halite, we entrapped a halophilic archaeon 
(Haloferax volcanii) and a non-halophilic bacterium (Deinococcus radiodurans) in 
laboratory-grown halite. Control groups were cells entrapped in salt crystals 
(mixtures of different salts and NaCl) and non-trapped (naked) cells, 
respectively. All groups were exposed either to vacuum alone or to vacuum plus 
VUV. Our results demonstrate that halite can serve as protection against vacuum 
and VUV radiation, regardless of the type of microorganism. In addition, we 
found that the protection is higher than provided by crystals obtained from 
mixtures of salts. This extends the protective effects of halite documented in 
previous studies and reinforces the possibility to consider the crystals of this 
mineral as potential preservation structures in airless bodies or as vehicles 
for the interplanetary transfer of microorganisms."
236,"Membrane protein engineering exhibits great potential for cell 
functionalization. Although genetic strategies are sophisticated for membrane 
protein engineering, there still exist some issues, including transgene 
insertional mutagenesis, laborious, complicated procedures, and low tunability. 
Herein, we report a DNA-templated anchoring of exogenous proteins on living cell 
membranes to realize programmable functionalization of living cells. Using DNA 
as a scaffold, the model cell membranes are readily modified with proteins, on 
which the density and ratio of proteins as well as their interactions can be 
precisely controlled through predictable DNA hybridization. Then, the natural 
killer (NK) cells were engineered to gain the ability to eliminate the immune 
checkpoint signaling at the NK-tumor synapse, which remarkably promoted NK cell 
activation in immunotherapy. Given the versatile functions of exogenous proteins 
and flexible designs of programmable DNA, this method has the potential to 
facilitate membrane-protein-based cell engineering and therapy."
237,"A pulldown using a biotinylated natural product of interest in the 
17β-hydroxywithanolide (17-BHW) class, physachenolide C (PCC), identified the 
bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family of proteins (BRD2, BRD3, and 
BRD4), readers of acetyl-lysine modifications and regulators of gene 
transcription, as potential cellular targets. BROMOscan bromodomain profiling 
and biochemical assays support PCC as a BET inhibitor with increased selectivity 
for bromodomain (BD)-1 of BRD3 and BRD4, and X-ray crystallography and NMR 
studies uncovered specific contacts that underlie the potency and selectivity of 
PCC toward BRD3-BD1 over BRD3-BD2. PCC also displays characteristics of a 
molecular glue, facilitating proteasome-mediated degradation of BRD3 and BRD4. 
Finally, PCC is more potent than other withanolide analogues and gold-standard 
pan-BET inhibitor (+)-JQ1 in cytotoxicity assays across five prostate cancer 
(PC) cell lines regardless of androgen receptor (AR)-signaling status."
238,"Background: Direct pulp capping is a vital pulp therapy, which stimulates 
differentiation of stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs). SCAPs have 
multipotential capacity to differentiate into types of cells, contributing to 
the regeneration of tissues. Objective: Considering the promising effects of 
dental-capping materials, we aim to investigate the effect of dental dressing 
materials combined with laser therapy on the percentage of SCAP viability and 
the consequent dental regeneration capacity. Methods: We collected two immature 
third molar teeth and isolated SCAPs through collagenase type I enzymatic 
activity. Isolated SCAPs were then cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's 
medium and α-minimum essential medium enriched with 15% and 10% fetal bovine 
serum, respectively. After reaching 70-80% confluency, cells were seeded in a 
96-well plate and then treated with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), enamel 
matrix derivative (EMD), biodentine, and low level laser therapy (LLLT) alone 
and in combination for 24, 48, and 168 h. After that, cell survival rate was 
assessed using (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) 
(MTT) assay. Results: We found that combination of MTA, EMD, and LLLT as well as 
that of biodentine, EMD, and LLLT could lead to significant increase of SCAP 
viability as compared with other treatment groups. Combination of MTA and 
biodentine with EMD could also show increased level of SCAP proliferation and 
viability. However, MTA and biodentine alone reduced SCAP survival rate in all 
time points. Conclusions: Our conclusion is that LLLT can serve as an enhancer 
of SCAP proliferation and differentiation rate when added to dental-capping 
agents such as MTA, EMD, and biodentine. Thus, LLLT combination with effective 
capping materials will serve as a promising option for dental tissue repair."
239,"It is known that nitric oxide (NO) is a gas and synthesized from l-arginine by 
the NO synthase (NOS) in vascular endothelial cells. The diffused NO activates 
the guanosine monophosphate, which initiates a series of intracellular events, 
leading to physiological response such as vasodilation. There are three 
different types of NOS, namely endothelial constitutive NOS (ecNOS), neuronal 
NOS (nNOS), and cytokine-inducible NOS (iNOS). The ecNOS and nNOS are expressed 
constitutively at low levels and can be activated rapidly by an increase in 
cytoplasmic calcium ions. In contrast, the iNOS is induced when macrophages are 
activated by cytokine, resulting in the induction of pathophysiological effects. 
Lymph flow is known to stimulate the release of NO from lymphatic endothelial 
cells (LEC) and then produce the relaxation of lymphatic smooth muscle cells. 
The NO also plays a key role in the control of lymphatic pump activity in vivo. 
Many studies have shown the NO-mediated findings in various kinds of lymph 
vessels. However, there is no or little study to demonstrate the effects of 
lymph flow on the molecular expression of ecNOS mRNA and the protein. In 
addition, little study is available for clarifying the relationship between NO 
and sympathetic nerve fibers in the regulation of lymph transport and 
production. Therefore, in this review, the experimental findings of lymph 
flow-mediated increases in the ecNOS mRNA and the protein in LEC are 
demonstrated in detail. In addition, the roles of NO and aminergic nerve fibers 
in the physiological control system of lymph transport and production are 
discussed."
240,"Water present on early Mars is often assumed to have been habitable. In this 
study, experiments were performed to investigate the habitability of 
well-defined putative martian fluids and to identify the accompanying potential 
formation of biosignatures. Simulated martian environments were developed by 
combining martian fluid and regolith simulants based on the chemistry of the 
Rocknest sand shadow at Gale Crater. The simulated chemical environment was 
inoculated with terrestrial anoxic sediment from the Pyefleet mudflats (United 
Kingdom). These enrichments were cultured for 28 days and subsequently 
subcultured seven times to ensure that the microbial community was solely grown 
on the defined, simulated chemistry. The impact of the simulated chemistries on 
the microbial community was assessed by cell counts and sequencing of 16S rRNA 
gene profiles. Associated changes to the fluid and precipitate chemistries were 
established by using ICP-OES, IC, FTIR, and NIR. The fluids were confirmed as 
habitable, with the enriched microbial community showing a reduction in 
abundance and diversity over multiple subcultures relating to the selection of 
specific metabolic groups. The final community comprised sulfate-reducing, 
acetogenic, and other anaerobic and fermentative bacteria. Geochemical 
characterization and modeling of the simulant and fluid chemistries identified 
clear differences between the biotic and abiotic experiments. These differences 
included the elimination of sulfur owing to the presence of sulfate-reducing 
bacteria and more general changes in pH associated with actively respiring cells 
that impacted the mineral assemblages formed. This study confirmed that a system 
simulating the fluid chemistry of Gale Crater could support a microbial 
community and that variation in chemistries under biotic and abiotic conditions 
can be used to inform future life-detection missions."
241,"Linezolid has been reported to restore erythromycin susceptibility in 
erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This phenomenon has not been 
reported in enterococci and the mechanisms involved therein are still unknown. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved and the 
effect of combining linezolid with erythromycin on erythromycin-resistant 
enterococci. Checkerboard techniques were used to determine drug interactions, 
and 12 of 14 isolates showed a synergistic effect between erythromycin and 
linezolid (fractional inhibitory concentration <0.5). We observed that the 
erm(B) gene, which encodes a dimethyltransferase responsible for erythromycin 
resistance, was expressed from transposon Tn1545 in the tested 
erythromycin-resistant enterococci. After exposure to linezolid, erm(B)-mediated 
rRNA dimethylation at A2071 could not be detected, and the erm(B) gene was lost 
following acquisition of erythromycin susceptibility. Thus, in conclusion, 
linezolid combined with erythromycin exerts a synergistic effect against 
erythromycin-resistant enterococci. Linezolid treatment suppressed 
erm(B)-mediated rRNA dimethylation at A2071, which could lead to loss of the 
erm(B) gene."
242,"Two new ester alkaloids were isolated from Portulaca oleracea L., identified as 
(5-aminofuran-2-yl) methyl acetate (1) named oleracone N and 4(S)-ethyl 
3-acetamido-3-(dihydroxyamino) propanoate (2) named oleracone O. The structures 
were elucidated via spectroscopic methods, including 1 D and 2 D NMR, 
UHPLC-ESI-QTOF/MS and CD spectrometry technique. It was suggested that both 
oleracone N and oleracone O could significantly inhibit inflammatory factors 
IL-1β and TNF-α in RAW 264.7 cells induced by LPS."
243,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases without a 
care standard and show variability in treatment outcomes. This Spanish, 
observational, prospective study ERASME (CEL-SMD-2012-01) assessed the evolution 
of newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve high-risk MDS patients (according to 
IPPS-R). 204 patients were included: median age 73.0 years, 54.4% males, 69.6% 
0-1 ECOG, and 94.6% with comorbidities. Active treatment was the most common 
strategy (52.0%) vs. stem cell transplantation (25.5%) and supportive 
care/watchful-waiting (22.5%). Overall (median) event-free survival was 
7.9 months (9.1, 8.3, and 5.3); progression-free survival: 10.1 months (12.9, 
12.8, and 4.3); and overall survival: 13.8 months (15.4, 14.9; 8.4), 
respectively, with significant differences among groups. Adverse events (AEs) of 
≥3 grade were reported in 72.6% of patients; serious AEs reported in 60.6%. 
33.1% of patients died due to AEs. Three patients developed second primary 
malignant neoplasms (median: 8.2 months). Our study showed better outcomes in 
patients receiving active therapy early after diagnosis."
244,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown rapid 
global spread and resulted in a significant death toll worldwide. In this study, 
we aimed to design a multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 based on 
structural proteins S, M, N and E. We identified B and T cell epitopes and then 
the antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity and similarity of predicted epitopes 
were analyzed. T-cell epitopes were docked with corresponding HLA alleles. 
Consequently, the selected T and B-cell epitopes were included in the final 
construct. All selected epitopes were connected with different linkers and 
Flagellin and pan-HLA DR binding epitopes (PADRE) as an adjuvant were used in 
the vaccine construct. Furthermore, molecular docking was used to evaluate the 
complex between the final vaccine construct and two alleles, HLA-A*02:01 and 
HLA-DRB1*01:01. Finally, codons were optimized for in silico cloning into pET28a 
(+) vector using SnapGene. The final vaccine construct comprised 11 CTL, HTL and 
B-cell epitopes corresponding to 394 amino acid residues. In silico evaluation 
showed that the designed vaccine might potentially promote an immune response. 
Further in vivo pre-clinical and clinical testing is required to determine the 
safety and efficacy of the designed vaccine. This article is protected by

245,"In accord with International Conference on Harmonization S7B guidelines, an in 
vitro human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay is one component of an 
integrated risk assessment for delayed ventricular repolarization. Function of 
hERG could be affected by direct (acute) mechanisms, or by indirect (chronic) 
mechanisms. Some approved oligonucleotide therapeutics had submitted hERG data 
to regulatory agents, which were all collected with the same protocol used for 
small-molecule testing (incubation time <20 min; acute), however, 
oligonucleotides have unique mechanisms and time courses of action (indirect). 
To reframe the hERG testing strategy for silencing RNA (siRNA), an investigation 
was performed to assess the time course for siRNA-mediated inhibition of hERG 
function and gene expression. Commercially available siRNAs of hERG were 
evaluated in a stable hERG-expressed cell line by whole-cell voltage clamp using 
automated electrophysiology and polymerase chain reaction. In the acute hERG 
study, no effects were observed after treatment with 100 nM siRNA for 20 min. 
The chronic effects of 100 nM siRNAs on hERG function were evaluated and 
recorded over 8-48 h following transfection. At 8 h there was no significant 
effect, whereas 77% reduction was observed at 48 h. Measurement of hERG mRNA 
levels demonstrated a 79% and 93% decrease of hERG mRNA at 8 and 48 h, 
respectively, consistent with inhibition of hERG transcription. The results 
indicate that an anti-hERG siRNA requires a long exposure time (48 h) in the 
hERG assay to produce a maximal reduction in hERG current; short exposures 
(20 min-8 h) had no effect. These findings imply that off-target profiling of 
novel oligonucleotides could benefit from using hERG protocol with long 
incubation times to de-risk potential off-target (indirect) effects on the hERG 
channel. This hERG assay modification may be important to consider if the 
findings are used to support an integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessment 
for QTc (the duration of the QT interval adjusted for heart rate) prolongation."
246,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) is a poorly characterized member 
of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family. Functional analysis of the 
ERK3 signaling pathway has been hampered by a lack of knowledge about the 
substrates and downstream effectors of the kinase. Here, we used large-scale 
quantitative phosphoproteomics and targeted gene silencing to identify direct 
ERK3 substrates and gain insight into its cellular functions. Detailed 
validation of one candidate substrate identified the gelsolin/villin family 
member supervillin (SVIL) as a bona fide ERK3 substrate. We show that ERK3 
phosphorylates SVIL on Ser245 to regulate myosin II activation and cytokinesis 
completion in dividing cells. Depletion of SVIL or ERK3 leads to increased 
cytokinesis failure and multinucleation, a phenotype rescued by wild type SVIL 
but not by the non-phosphorylatable S245A mutant. Our results unveil a new 
function of the atypical MAP kinase ERK3 in cell division and the regulation of 
cell ploidy."
247,"People with sickle cell disease (pwSCD) are at risk of developing lung 
conditions that complicate their sickle cell disease (SCD) but often face 
healthcare access barriers. An interdisciplinary SCD-pulmonary clinic was 
created in 2014 at Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) to address access 
barriers that may prevent optimized treatment. We hypothesize that pwSCD and 
pulmonary disease would have fewer hospitalizations for acute chest syndrome 
(ACS), asthma, and vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) in the two years after their 
initial SCD-pulmonary clinic visit compared to the two years prior. From 
2014-2020,119 pwSCD were evaluated in the SCD-pulmonary clinic and followed at 
NCH for at least two years before and after this visit. Acute care outcomes, 
pulmonary function, polysomnography, echocardiogram, laboratory, and medication 
prescribing data were collected and analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed ranked 
and McNemar's tests. The median number of acute care visits for ACS (p<0.001) 
and asthma (p=0.006) were significantly lower during the two years after pwSCD's 
initial SCD-pulmonary clinic evaluation compared to the two years prior. Asthma 
and allergic rhinitis were more frequently diagnosed and prescriptions for 
hydroxyurea (p=0.005) and inhaled corticosteroids (p=0.005) were more common in 
the post SCD-pulmonary clinic period. The median number of prescribed systemic 
corticosteroids was lower in the two years following SCD-pulmonary clinic 
evaluation (p<0.0001). Lactate dehydrogenase and white blood cell counts also 
significantly decreased. Implementing a multidisciplinary SCD-pulmonary clinic 
is feasible and may allow improved management of pulmonary problems and lead to 
improvements in health and acute care utilization."
248,"OBJECTIVE: The T1GER (A Study of SIMPONI to Arrest β-cell Loss in Type 1 
Diabetes) study showed many metabolic benefits of the tumor necrosis factor-α 
blocker golimumab in children and young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). 
Off-therapy effects are reported.
RESEARCH DESIGNS AND METHODS: T1GER was a phase 2, placebo-controlled, 
randomized trial in which golimumab or placebo was administered for 52 weeks to 
participants 6-21 years old diagnosed with T1D within 100 days of randomization. 
Assessments occurred during the 52-week on-therapy and 52-week off-therapy 
periods.
RESULTS: After treatment was stopped, C-peptide area under the curve (AUCs) 
remained greater in the treatment versus control group. At weeks 78 and 104, the 
golimumab group had lower reductions in the 4-h C-peptide AUC baseline than the 
placebo group, where specifically the golimumab group had reductions of 0.31 and 
0.41 nmol/L, and the placebo group had reductions of 0.64 and 0.74 nmol/L. There 
were also trends in less insulin use, higher peak C-peptide levels and those in 
partial remission, and higher peak C-peptide levels in the golimumab group. 
Golimumab responders, defined as having an increase or minimal loss of C-peptide 
AUC and/or being in partial remission at week 52, showed even greater 
improvements in most metabolic parameters on and off therapy and had less 
hypoglycemia during the off-therapy period versus placebo. Adverse events, 
including infections, were similar between the groups during all time periods of 
the study.
CONCLUSIONS: In children and young adults with new-onset T1D, golimumab 
preserved endogenous β-cell function and resulted in other favorable metabolic 
parameters on and off therapy. A subpopulation had disease stabilization while 
on therapy, with improved metabolic parameters off therapy."
249,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells found in a variety of 
tissues in the body, including but not limited to bone marrow, adipose tissue, 
umbilical cord, and umbilical cord blood. Given their immunomodulatory effect 
and ability to be readily isolated from several tissues, they have great 
potential to be used as a therapeutic agent in a variety of immune-mediated 
disorders. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a persistent and relapsing immune skin 
condition that has recently become more common in several species such as 
humans, canines, equines, and felines. The use of MSCs to treat AD has piqued 
the great interest of researchers in recent years. In this article, we review 
the recent understanding of AD pathology and advances in preclinical and 
clinical studies of MSCs, MSCs-derived conditional media and exosomes as 
therapeutic tools to treat AD."
250,"The goal for the present study was to investigate whether previous infection 
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may compromise 
embryo morphokinetics and implantation. For that, a historical cohort study was 
performed in a private university-affiliated in vitro fertilization center. The 
study included 1628 embryos from 88 patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection (ICSI) cycles. Patients were age-matched in a 1:3 ratio to either a 
coronavirus disease (COVID) group, including patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 
immunoglobulin test (n = 22 patients, 386 embryos), or a control group, 
including patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin test (n = 66, 1242 
embryos). The effect of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 on morphokinetic 
events and ICSI outcomes was evaluated. Embryos derived from patients in the 
COVID group presented longer time to pronuclei appearance and fading, time to 
form two, three, four and five cells, and time to blastulation. The durations of 
the third cell cycle and to time to complete synchronous divisions were also 
significantly increased in the COVID group compared with the control group, 
whereas known implantation diagnosis score Day 5 ranked significantly lower in 
the COVID group. No differences were observed between the COVID and control 
groups on clinical outcomes. In conclusion, patients planning parenthood, who 
have recovered from COVID-19 infection, must be aware of a possible effect of 
the infection on embryo development potential."
251,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with familial early-onset dementia (EOD) pose a unique 
opportunity for gene identification studies.
METHODS: We present the phenotype and whole-exome sequencing (WES) study of an 
autosomal dominant EOD family. Candidate genes were examined in a set of 
dementia cases and controls (n = 3712). Western blotting was conducted of the 
wild-type and mutant protein of the final candidate.
RESULTS: Age at disease onset was 60 years (range 56 to 63). The phenotype 
comprised mixed amnestic and behavioral features, and parkinsonism. 
Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers, and a positron emission tomography 
amyloid study suggested Alzheimer's disease. WES and the segregation pattern 
pointed to a nonsense mutation in the TRIM25 gene (p.C168*), coding for an E3 
ubiquitin ligase, which was absent in the cohorts studied. Protein studies 
supported a loss-of-function mechanism.
DISCUSSION: This study supports a new physiopathological mechanism for brain 
amyloidosis. Furthermore, it extends the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases 
dysfunction in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
HIGHLIGHTS: A TRIM25 nonsense mutation (p.C168*) is associated with autosomal 
dominant early-onset dementia and parkinsonism with biomarkers suggestive of 
Alzheimer's disease. TRIM25 protein studies support that the mutation exerts its 
effect through loss of function. TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is known for 
its role in the innate immune response but this is the first report of 
association with neurodegeneration. The role of TRIM25 dysfunction in 
development of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration merits a new line of research."
252,"BACKGROUND: Cytopathologic analysis is feasible and provides detailed 
morphological characterisation of head and neck lesions.
AIMS: To integrate the available data published on fine-needle aspiration 
cytology (FNAC) used for the diagnosis of plasma cell neoplasms (PCN) of the 
head and neck region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Searches on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus 
were performed to compile data from case reports/case series published in 
English. The Joanna Briggs Institute tool was used for the critical appraisal of 
studies.
RESULTS: A total of 82 studies comprising 102 patients were included in this 
review. There was a predilection for men (68.6%) (male/female ratio: 2.1:1). 
Individuals in their 50s (29.4%), 60s (22.5%), and 70s (22.5%) were more often 
affected. The thyroid gland (26.2%) was the main anatomical location, followed 
by scalp (15.5%), neck/cervical region (15.5%), jaws (13.6%), and major salivary 
glands (13.6%). For FNAC analysis, a smear was employed in 41 (40.6%) cases and 
a cell block was used in four (3.9%). In 56 (55.4%) reports, no cytological 
methods were available. Morphologically, 34 (56.7%) cases had a diagnosis of PCN 
with agreement between cytopathology and histopathology. The rate of wrong 
diagnoses when using cytology was 27.5%. Immunophenotyping was performed in 49 
(48%) of the cases. The 69-month disease-free survival rate was 60.2%, while the 
27-month overall survival rate was 64.1%.
CONCLUSION: This study reinforces that FNAC can be an ancillary tool in the 
first step towards the diagnosis of PCN of the head and neck region, especially 
when applying a cell block for cytological analysis."
253,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to every corner of the world and seriously 
affected our health and daily activities in the past three years; thereby, it is 
still urgent to develop various simple, quick, and accurate methods for early 
detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
transmission. Nanozymes, a kind of nanomaterial with intrinsic enzyme-mimicking 
activity, have emerged as a suitable alternative for both therapy and diagnosis 
of SARS-CoV-2. Here, ultrasensitive and ultrafast MIL-101(CuFe)-CD147 biosensors 
are established for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by a simple colorimetric method. 
A MIL-101(CuFe) metal-organic framework has excellent peroxidase-like activity 
due to the synergistic effect of Fe and Cu atoms. In addition, the 
MIL-101(CuFe)-CD147 biosensor shows great potential to detect the various 
variants of SARS-CoV-2 due to the universal receptor of CD147. The enzyme-based 
biosensor for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 achieves a very low limit of detection 
(about 3 PFU/mL) within 30 min. Therefore, the present method provides a new 
generation of an alternative approach for highly sensitive and visual diagnosis 
of COVID-19."
254,"The growth of crystalline Li-based oxide thin films on silicon substrates is 
essential for the integration of next-generation solid-state lithionic and 
electronic devices including on-chip microbatteries, memristors, and sensors. 
However, growing crystalline oxides directly on silicon typically requires high 
temperatures and oxygen partial pressures, which leads to the formation of 
undesired chemical species at the interface compromising the crystal quality of 
the films. In this work, we employ a 2 nm gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) buffer layer 
on Si substrates in order to grow crystalline thin films of Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), a 
well-known active material for lithium-ion batteries. The ultrathin γ-Al2O3 
layer enables the formation of a stable heterostructure with sharp interfaces 
and drastically improves the LTO crystallographic and electrochemical 
properties. Long-term galvanostatic cycling of 50 nm LTO films in liquid-based 
half-cells demonstrates a high capacity retention of 91% after 5000 cycles at 
100 C. Rate capability tests showcase a specific charge of 56 mA h g-1 at an 
exceptional C-rate of 5000 C (15 mA cm-2). Moreover, with sub-millisecond 
current pulse tests, the reported thin-film heterostructure exhibits rapid 
Li-ion (de)intercalation, which could lead to fast switching timescales in 
resistive memory devices and electrochemical transistors."
255,"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (OPAC) are 
the predominant catabolites of quercetin glycosides, such as quercetin 
4'-O-β-glucoside from the onion, produced by intestinal microbiota. Although 
each catabolite has been reported to protect the cells from acetaldehyde-induced 
cytotoxicity, the effect of their combination remains to be clarified. The 
purpose of this study was to determine whether the combination of DOPAC and OPAC 
enhances the resistance against the acetaldehyde-induced oxidative stress in the 
cultured hepatocytes. The pretreatment of the combination of DOPAC (5 μM) and 
OPAC (5 μM) showed the significant protection against the acetaldehyde- and 
hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity, even though each compound at the same 
concentration did not. This combination also significantly inhibited the 
intracellular dichlorofluorescin diacetate-detectable reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) level, whereas the solo treatment did slightly, suggesting that reducing 
mechanisms of ROS or compounds that enhance ROS production are involved in the 
cytoprotective effect. The combinatory treatment significantly enhanced the gene 
expression of not only the aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), but also 
glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit, the first rate-limiting enzyme of 
glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Accordingly, both the intracellular GSH level and 
the total ALDH activity were enhanced by DOPAC plus OPAC. Involvement of GSH in 
the cytoprotection as well as ALDH up-regulation by the combination were 
confirmed by the experiments using a GSH biosynthesis inhibitor, buthionine 
sulfoximine. Taken together, the present results suggested that the quercetin 
microbiota catabolites concertedly protect the cells from acetaldehyde through a 
pre-enhanced resistance against oxidative stress by the GSH-dependent 
up-regulation of ALDHs."
256,"The CRISPR-Cas system has been used as a convenient tool for genome editing 
because the nuclease that cuts the target DNA and the guide RNA that recognizes 
the target are separated into modules. Cas12f1, which has a smaller size than 
that of other Cas nucleases, is easily loaded into vectors and is emerging as a 
new genome editing tool. In this study, AsCas12f1 was used to negatively select 
only Escherichia coli cells obtained by oligonucleotide-directed genome editing. 
Although double-, triple-, and quadruple-base substitutions were accurately and 
efficiently performed in the genome, the performance of single-base editing was 
poor. To resolve this limitation, we serially truncated the 3'-end of sgRNAs and 
determined the maximal truncation required to maintain the target DNA cleavage 
activity of Cas12f1. Negative selection of single-nucleotide-edited cells was 
efficiently performed with the maximally 3'-truncated sgRNA-Cas12f1 complex in 
vivo. Moreover, Sanger sequencing showed that the accuracy of single-nucleotide 
substitution, insertion, and deletion in the microbial genome was improved. 
These results demonstrated that a truncated sgRNA approach could be widely used 
for accurate CRISPR-mediated genome editing."

CLPs to evolve independently with functions that do not require chitinase 
activity. CLPs normally function during inflammatory responses, wound healing, 
and host defense, but when they persist at excessive levels at sites of chronic 
inflammation and in tissue-remodeling disorders, they correlate positively with 
disease progression and poor prognosis. Little is known, however, about their 
physiological function. Drosophila melanogaster has six CLPS, termed Imaginal 
disc growth factors (Idgfs), encoded by Idgf1, Idgf2, Idgf3, Idgf4, Idgf5, and 
Idgf6. In this study we developed tools to facilitate characterization of the 
physiological roles of the Idgfs by deleting each of the Idgf genes using the 
CRISPR/Cas9 system and assessing loss-of-function phenotypes. Using null lines, 
we showed that loss-of-function for all six Idgf proteins significantly lowers 
viability and fertility. We also showed that Idgfs play roles in epithelial 
morphogenesis, maintaining proper epithelial architecture and cell shape, 
regulating E-cadherin and cortical Actin, and remarkably, protecting these 
tissues against CO2 exposure. Defining the normal molecular mechanisms of CLPS 
is key to understanding how deviations tip the balance from a physiological to a 
pathological state."
259,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a form of RNAs that lack coding potential. The role 
of such circRNAs in dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) osteo/odontogenic 
differentiation remains to be determined. In this study, circRNA expression 
profiles in DPSC osteo/odontogenic differentiation process were analyzed by 
RNA-seq. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the differential expression of 
circ_0005044, miR-296-3p, and FOSL1 in DPSC osteogenic differentiation process. 
Circ_0005044, miR-296-3p, and FOSL1 were knocked down or overexpressed. 
Osteoblastic activity and associated mineral activity were monitored via 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red S (ARS) staining. Interactions 
between miR-296-3p, circ_0005044, and FOSL1 were assessed through luciferase 
reporter assays. Finally, an in vivo system was used to confirm the relevance of 
circ_0005044 to osteoblastic differentiation. As results, we detected 
significant circ_0005044 and FOSL1 upregulation in DPSC osteo/odontogenic 
differentiation process, as well as concomitant miR-296-3p downregulation. When 
knocking down circ_0005044 or overexpressed miR-296-3p, this significantly 
inhibited osteogenesis. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-296-3p was 
capable of binding to conserved sequences in the wild-type forms of both the 
circ_0005044 and FOSL1. Furthermore, knocking down circ_0005044 in vivo 
significantly attenuated bone formation. Therefore, the 
circ_0005044/miR-2964-3p/FOSL1 axis regulates DPSC osteo/odontogenic 
differentiation, which may provide potential molecular targets for dental-pulp 
complex regeneration."
260,"IMPORTANCE: Extant data on the performance of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
score models in people living with HIV have not been synthesized.
OBJECTIVE: To synthesize available data on the performance of the various CVD 
risk scores in people living with HIV.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase were searched from inception through January 31, 
2021.
STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies (1) were chosen based on cohort design, (2) 
included adults with a diagnosis of HIV, (3) assessed CVD outcomes, and (4) had 
available data on a minimum of 1 CVD risk score.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Relevant data related to study characteristics, 
CVD outcome, and risk prediction models were extracted in duplicate. Measures of 
calibration and discrimination are presented in tables and qualitatively 
summarized. Additionally, where possible, estimates of discrimination and 
calibration measures were combined and stratified by type of risk model.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Measures of calibration and discrimination.
RESULTS: Nine unique observational studies involving 75 304 people (weighted 
average age, 42 years; 59 490 male individuals [79%]) living with HIV were 
included. In the studies reporting these data, 86% were receiving antiretroviral 
therapy and had a weighted average CD4+ count of 449 cells/μL. Included in the 
study were current smokers (50%), patients with diabetes (5%), and patients with 
hypertension (25%). Ten risk prediction scores (6 in the general population and 
4 in the HIV-specific population) were analyzed. Most risk scores had a moderate 
performance in discrimination (C statistic: 0.7-0.8), without a significant 
difference in performance between the risk scores of the general and 
HIV-specific populations. One of the HIV-specific risk models (Data Collection 
on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs Cohort 2016) and 2 of the general 
population risk models (Framingham Risk Score [FRS] and Pooled Cohort Equation 
[PCE] 10 year) had the highest performance in discrimination. In general, models 
tended to underpredict CVD risk, except for FRS and PCE 10-year scores, which 
were better calibrated. There was substantial heterogeneity across the studies, 
with only a few studies contributing data for each risk score.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis 
suggest that general population and HIV-specific CVD risk models had comparable, 
moderate discrimination ability in people living with HIV, with a general 
tendency to underpredict risk. These results reinforce the current 
recommendations provided by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association guidelines to consider HIV as a risk-enhancing factor when 
estimating CVD risk."
261,"Bacteria rely on protein systems for regulation in response to external 
environmental signals. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging and tracking has 
elucidated the complex mechanism of these protein systems in a variety of 
bacteria. We recently investigated Vibrio cholerae, the Gram-negative bacterium 
responsible for the human cholera disease, and its regulation of the production 
of toxins and virulence factors through the membrane-localized transcription 
factors TcpP and ToxR. These experiments determined that TcpP and ToxR work 
cooperatively under steady-state conditions, but measurements of how these 
dynamical interactions change over the course of environmental perturbations 
were precluded by the traditional preparation of bacterial cells confined on 
agarose pads. Here, we address this gap in technology and access single-molecule 
dynamics during real-time changes by implementing two alternative sample 
preparations: microfluidic devices and chitosan-coated coverslips. We report the 
first demonstration of single-molecule tracking within live bacterial cells in a 
microfluidic device. Additionally, using the chitosan-coated coverslips, we show 
that real-time environmental changes impact TcpP-PAmCherry dynamics, activating 
a virulence condition in the bacteria about 45 min after dropping to pH 6 and 
about 20 min after inducing ToxR expression. These new technology advances open 
our ability for new experiments studying a variety of bacteria with 
single-molecule imaging and tracking during real-time environmental 
perturbations."
262,"The development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) has been severely 
restricted by metallic Zn anode issues, including Zn dendrites and 
uncontrollable side reactions. The direct interfacial modification of a Zn anode 
is a facile and effective strategy that has been favored by researchers. Herein, 
we propose an acrylic-bonded stationary layer as an artificial solid electrolyte 
interface (SEI) for the Zn anode to manipulate the Zn plating/stripping. The 
constructed modification layer is made of zinc acrylate cross-linked to form a 
three-dimensional (3D) porous structure, which can induce uniform deposition of 
zinc ions and balance the local electric field, thus achieving homogeneous 
nucleation and uniform Zn deposition. More importantly, this fabricated layer is 
chemically bonded to the zinc surface and can tolerate prolonged zinc deposition 
without shedding compared with conventional physical coatings. Consequently, the 
Zn/Zn symmetric cells, Zn/Na0.92V2O5·nH2O (NaVO) full cells, and Zn hybrid 
supercapacitors using this acrylic-bonded modified anode demonstrate greatly 
improved cycle performance."
263,"The effects of combined administration of red ginseng (RG) extracts and 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on immunostimulatory activity and tumor 
metastasis inhibition were investigated in mice. For the immunostimulatory 
activity, splenocyte proliferation, natural killer (NK) cell activity, including 
the production of granzyme B (GrB) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and serum level 
of cytokine such as IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-21 were assessed. Peyer's 
patch cells obtained from mice administered with RG+GABA were cultured, and the 
cytokine level in the culture supernatant and bone marrow (BM) cell 
proliferation activity were examined. The proliferative activity of splenocytes 
was significantly higher in the RG-GABA treatment group than in RG or GABA alone 
(P < .05). In the experimental tumor metastasis model, oral administration of 
RG+GABA showed a higher antitumor metastatic effect compared to that of RG or 
GABA alone. Oral administration of RG+GABA significantly augmented NK 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity against YAC-1 tumor cells. In addition, the 
production of GrB and IFN-γ was stimulated in the culture supernatant of NK 
cells and YAC-1 cells. Serum concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-21 in mice 
with RG+GABA were significantly higher compared to the corresponding blood 
levels in mice administered with RG or GABA alone. The RG+GABA group showed 
significant BM cell proliferation and increased production of IL-6 and 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor compared to that in the 
monotherapy groups. Therefore, RG may have a synergistic effect with GABA for 
enhancing the host defense system such as BM proliferation and NK cell activity 
in a tumor metastasis model."
264,"Purpose: To investigate the antifibrotic effect of ZD6474 in human pterygium 
fibroblasts (HPFs) and angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs) compared with mitomycin C (MMC). Methods: Pterygium and tenon 
fibroblasts were isolated from patients undergoing surgery to culture HPFs and 
human tenon fibroblasts (HTFs). The effects of ZD6474 on HPF, HTF, and HUVEC 
proliferation and migration were detected using CCK8 and wound-healing assays, 
respectively. Fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) were 
evaluated by western blotting [transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)1/2 and 
snail] and immunofluorescence (vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin). The 
antiangiogenic effect of ZD6474 on HUVECs was assessed using a tube formation 
assay. To determine the potential mechanism, the expression of phosphorylated 
AKT (p-AKT) and phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) was evaluated by treatment with 
ZD6474 via western blotting. Results: ZD6474 robustly inhibited the 
proliferation and migration of HPFs rather than HTFs compared with those in the 
MMC group (**P < 0.01). In HPFs, fibrosis and EMT (vimentin, TGF-β1/2, and 
snail) were significantly reversed by ZD6474. MMC (>50 μg/mL) significantly 
reduced HTF viability, whereas ZD6474 (<5 μM/mL) did not decrease HTF viability. 
HUVEC proliferation and migration were clearly decreased, and tube formation was 
notably interrupted by ZD6474. Activation of p-AKT and p-mTOR was inhibited by 
ZD6474 treatment of HPFs and HUVECs. Conclusion: ZD6474 is more effective than 
MMC in reducing fibrosis and EMT in HPFs. In addition, ZD6474 was less toxic to 
HTFs. ZD6474 also exhibited antiangiogenic effects in HUVECs. This study may aid 
in the development of novel agents to prevent pterygium recurrence after 
pterygium excision."
265,"Background: Circular RNAs (circ-RNAs) have been demonstrated to influence 
initiation, drug resistance, and metastasis of tumors. However, the effects of 
circular-phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (circ-PGAM1) on matrine resistance in 
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unknown. Materials and Methods: The 
reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used 
to determine gene expression. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP 
nick end labeling (TUNEL) and cell colony formation assays were used to evaluate 
NSCLC apoptosis and cell proliferation after indicated treatments, respectively. 
Results: circ-PGAM1 was upregulated in human NSCLC cell lines (H1299 and A549) 
compared with the human normal lung epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells. circ-PGAM1 
overexpression reversed the matrine treatment-induced inhibition on 
proliferation of NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) and rescued the matrine 
treatment-stimulated apoptosis of these cells. miR-326 was demonstrated to 
interact with circ-PGAM1. circ-PGAM1 knockdown enhanced the antitumor effect of 
matrine on NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis, which was reversed by miR-326 
inhibition. The authors also identified CXCR5 as a key downstream target of 
miR-326 in A549 cells. Conclusions: circ-PGAM1 enhances matrine resistance of 
NSCLC cells through the miR-326/CXCR5 axis. The authors' findings provide new 
insights into NSCLC-targeted therapy."
266,"As efficient nonprecious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), 
Fe-N-C materials are one of the most promising alternatives to Pt-based 
catalysts for fuel cells and metal-air batteries. However, the intrinsically low 
density of key active sites like FeN4 moieties hampers their commercial 
applications. Herein, we provide a smart strategy to construct a candied 
haws-like Fe-N-C catalyst (CH-FeNC) with broadened carbon interplanar spacing 
(>4 Å), starting with trehalose as a structure-built brick coupled with a 
zinc-zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-8) and polyaniline (PANI) and then 
followed by copyrolysis carbonization of them. The obtained CH-FeNC exhibits 
half-wave potentials of 0.92 and 0.90 V (vs RHE) before and after 10,000 cycles 
in 0.1 M KOH, which are superior to the 0.90 and 0.85 V obtained by commercial 
Pt/C for ORR. The power density of a homemade zinc-air battery equipped with the 
catalyst is up to 131 mW cm-2, greater than that of Pt/C (124 mW cm-2). The 
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results and density functional 
theory (DFT) theoretical calculations reveal that there exists enriched zigzag 
or armchair edge-hosted FeN4 active sites, located at the abundant interface 
between carbon components in this composite. Furthermore, the unique broadened 
carbon interlayer spacing plays a key role in deciding the ORR rate in alkaline 
but not in acidic environments because there exists a fifth ligand of active Fe 
in the form of FeN4 centers coupled with SO42- and ClO4- from acids."
267,"The rapid development of antibiotic resistance has been considered a major 
threat to public health. Nanomaterials have risen to be an effective weapon to 
tackle this problem through multiple antibacterial mechanisms. The improved and 
tailored physiochemical properties of fine-tuned secondary nanoarchitectures 
contribute to the superior bactericidal actions of metal oxide structures. 
However, it is still challenging to construct secondary structures through mild 
green manufacturing methods. Here, we report the preferred antibacterial ZnO 
nanocrystal clusters formed by a green structure-tuning synthesis process, in 
which the primary ZnO nanoparticles with sizes <10 nm were assembled into 
different forms of clusters depending on the zinc salt concentration and 
temperature. ZnO clusters with a stable loose-assembly structure and a rougher 
surface exhibited better bactericidal ability with minimal inhibitory 
concentrations of 0.5 and 0.1 mg/mL against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus 
aureus, respectively. The underlying mechanism is related to enhancing contact 
with bacteria, releasing small ZnO nanoparticles, and generating additional 
reactive oxygen species, which could aggravate the damage to bacterial cell 
membrane and eventually lead to bacterial death. Furthermore, attachment of 
phenolic compounds from olive leaf extract would promote membrane penetration by 
ZnO nanoparticles, resulting in the improvement of antibacterial activities, 
which profit from the green route mediated by Olea europaea leaf extract that 
could structure-tune ZnO nanocrystal clusters in one simple step that retains 
the active ingredients on the nanoparticles. This work proposes a feasible and 
clean strategy to improve the structure-bioactivity relationship of ZnO by 
controlling its growth into a preferable structure, and the developed ZnO 
clusters have a good prospect in antibacterial applications because of their 
excellent performance and green fabrication method."
268,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Post radiation mucosal ulcers (PRMU) after treatment for 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) can have a huge negative impact on 
patients' quality of life, but little is known concerning risk factors and the 
impact of fraction size. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the 
pattern of PRMU development and to identify risk factors after a 
hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy boost (SBRT) compared to 
conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for OPSCC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study (N = 332) of 
OPSCC patients with ≥ 1-year disease-free survival, treated with 46 Gy Intensity 
Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) (2 Gy fractions) followed by either an SBRT boost 
of 16.5 Gy (5.5 Gy fractions) (N = 180), or 24 Gy IMRT (2 Gy fractions) 
(N = 152). PRMU (grade ≥ 2) was scored when observed > three months after the 
last radiotherapy (RT) fraction (CTCAE v5.0). Potential risk factors were 
analyzed with Cox regression models using death as competing risk. Dose at the 
PRMU site was calculated by projecting delineated PRMU on the planning CT.
RESULTS: All cases of PRMU (N = 64) occurred within 24 months; all were grade 2. 
The cumulative incidence at 2 years in the SBRT boost group was 26% (N = 46) vs. 
12% (N = 18) for conventional fractionation (p = 0.003). Most PRMU developed 
within nine months (N = 48). PRMU occurring > nine months (N = 16) were mainly 
observed in the SBRT boost group (N = 15). Sex (p = 0.048), acute tube feeding 
(p = < 0.001), tumor subsite tonsil (p = 0.001), and N stage (p = 0.017) were 
associated with PRMU risk at multivariable regression in the hypofractionated 
SBRT boost group. All 25 delineated PRMU were located within the high dose 
regions.
CONCLUSION: The risk of PRMU should be included in the cost benefit analysis 
when considering future research using a hypofractionated SBRT boost for OPSCC 
patients."
269,"The uncontrollable growth of lithium (Li) dendrites and the instability of the 
Li/electrolyte interface hinder the development of next-generation rechargeable 
lithium metal batteries. The combination of inorganic nanoparticles and polymers 
as the artificial SEI layer shows great potential in regulating lithium-ion 
flux. Here, we design spatially confined LiF nanoparticles in an aligned polymer 
matrix as the artificial SEI layer. A high dielectric polymer matrix homogenizes 
the electric field near the surface of lithium metal. Aligned pores with LiF 
nanoparticles promote the lithium-ion transport across the artificial SEI layer. 
The synergistic effect of the highly polar β-phase PVDF and LiF nanoparticles 
provides high stability over 900 h for the Li//Li symmetrical cell. Besides, a 
Li//LFP full battery equipped with this artificial layer shows good performance 
in the commercial carbonate electrolyte, demonstrating the great potential of 
this protective film in lithium metal batteries."
270,"IMPORTANCE: Rituximab and other B-cell-depleting therapies blunt humoral 
responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, particularly when the vaccine is administered 
within 6 months of an infusion. Whether this translates into an increased risk 
of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether rituximab treatment is associated with an 
increased risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 among SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated 
persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether delaying vaccination more than 
6 months after rituximab treatment is associated with decreased risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used Kaiser 
Permanente Southern California's electronic health record to identify 
individuals from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2022, who had MS and who had 
been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.
EXPOSURES: Rituximab treatment compared with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) 
that do not interfere with vaccine efficacy or being untreated (no or other DMT 
group). Among rituximab-treated patients, the exposure was receiving at least 1 
vaccine dose more than 6 months after their last infusion compared with 
receiving all vaccine doses 6 months or less since their last infusion.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was hospitalization due to COVID-19 
infection. The odds of infection resulting in hospitalization following 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were adjusted for race and ethnicity, advanced MS-related 
disability; vaccine type; booster dose; and, among rituximab-treated only 
analyses, cumulative rituximab dose and dose at last infusion. Exposures, 
outcomes, and covariates were collected from the electronic health record.
RESULTS: Among 3974 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated people with MS (mean [SD] age, 55.3 
[15] years; 2982 [75.0%] female; 103 [2.6%] Asian or Pacific Islander; 634 
[16.0%] Black; 953 [24.0%] Hispanic; 2269 [57.1%] White; and 15 [0.3%] other 
race or ethnicity), rituximab-treated patients (n = 1516) were more likely to be 
hospitalized (n = 27) but not die (n = 0) compared with the 2458 individuals 
with MS receiving no or other DMTs (n = 7 and n = 0, respectively; adjusted odds 
ratio [aOR] for hospitalization, 7.33; 95% CI, 3.05-17.63). Receiving messenger 
RNA (mRNA) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.90; P = .03) and 
receiving a booster vaccination (aOR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.64; P = .002) were 
independently associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. 
Among vaccinated rituximab-treated individuals with MS, receiving any 
vaccination dose more than 6 months after the last rituximab infusion was 
associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (aOR, 0.22; 95% CI, 
0.10-0.49).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study's findings suggest that 
rituximab-treated people with MS should be strongly encouraged to receive mRNA 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and boosters more than 6 months after their last rituximab 
infusion whenever possible. The low absolute risk of hospitalization for 
COVID-19 among mRNA-vaccinated individuals with MS should not preclude use of 
rituximab, which has marked efficacy, cost, and convenience advantages over 
other DMTs."
271,"IMPORTANCE: Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is usually curable; 
however, a subset of patients develops poor outcomes, including local 
recurrence, nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, and disease-specific death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate all evidence-based reports of patient risk factors and 
tumor characteristics associated with poor outcomes in primary cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma and to identify treatment modalities that minimize poor 
outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS databases were searched for studies of 
the topic in humans, published in the English language, from database inception 
through February 8, 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Two authors independently screened the identified articles and 
included those that were original research with a sample size of 10 patients or 
more and that assessed risk factors and/or treatment modalities associated with 
poor outcomes among patients with primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction was performed by a single author, 
per international guidelines. The search terms, study objectives, and protocol 
methods were defined before study initiation. A total of 310 studies were 
included for full-text assessment. Owing to heterogeneity of the included 
studies, a random-effects model was used. Data analyses were performed from May 
25 to September 15, 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For studies of risk factors, risk ratios and 
incidence proportions; and for treatment studies, incidence proportions.
RESULTS: In all, 129 studies and a total of 137 449 patients with primary 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and 126 553 tumors were included in the 
meta-analysis. Several patient risk factors and tumor characteristics were 
associated with local recurrence, nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, 
disease-specific death, and all-cause death were identified. Among all factors 
reported by more than 1 study, the highest risks for local recurrence and 
disease-specific death were associated with tumor invasion beyond subcutaneous 
fat (risk ratio, 9.1 [95% CI, 2.8-29.2] and 10.4 [95% CI, 3.0- 36.3], 
respectively), and the highest risk of any metastasis was associated with 
perineural invasion (risk ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.3-11.1). Patients who received 
Mohs micrographic surgery had the lowest incidence of nearly all poor outcomes; 
however, in some results, the 95% CIs overlapped with those of other treatment 
modalities.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis identified the prognostic value of 
several risk factors and the effectiveness of the available treatment 
modalities. These findings carry important implications for the prognostication, 
workup, treatment, and follow-up of patients with primary cutaneous squamous 
cell carcinoma.

272,"PURPOSE: Dual-specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) inactivates factors in the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, activated in uveal 
melanoma (UM) by mutations in upstream G-protein α subunits GNAQ/11 in >90% 
cases. This study examined whether DUSP4 (1) protein expression in primary UM 
(pUM) was a biomarker of metastatic risk and (2) knockdown sensitized UM cells 
to therapeutic agents, selumetinib or doxorubicin.
METHODS: DUSP4 mRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and DUSP4 protein 
expression examined using immunohistochemistry in 28 cases of pUM were evaluated 
for association with clinical, genetic, and histological features. In vitro 
cytotoxic drug assays tested the efficacy of selumetinib and doxorubicin in UM 
cell lines with/without small interfering RNA DUSP4 gene silencing.
RESULTS: DUSP4 protein expression was observed in 93% of cases, with strong 
nuclear positivity in 79%. Despite higher DUSP4 messenger RNA levels in disomy 
3/wild-type BAP1 UM, there was no significant association of nDUSP4 protein with 
these metastatic risk predictors or outcome. DUSP4 expression in UM cell lines 
varied. DUSP4 silencing in Mel202, MP46, and MP41 cells did not affect ERK1/2 or 
phospho-ERK levels. Despite increased phospho-ERK levels in Mel285, no cell line 
showed enhanced sensitivity to selumetinib/doxorubicin.
CONCLUSIONS: DUSP4 protein expression is not a biomarker of UM metastatic risk. 
DUSP4 plays a complex role in oncogenesis, as reported in other cancers, and 
further work is required to fully understand its functional role in the MAPK 
pathway.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the role of phosphatases, such as DUSP4, 
in the control of intracellular signaling cascades will facilitate our ability 
to identify successful treatment options."
273,"BACKGROUND: Transcription factor LEF1 is a downstream mediator of the 
Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. It is expressed in dermal papilla and 
surrounding cells in the hair follicle, promoting cell proliferation and 
differentiation.
RESULTS: Here we report that LEF1 is also expressed all through the hair cycle 
in the terminal Schwann cells (TSCs), a component of the lanceolate complex 
located at the isthmus. The timing of LEF1 appearance at the isthmus coincides 
with that of hair follicle innervation. LEF1 is not found at the isthmus in the 
aberrant hair follicles in nude mice. Instead, LEF1 in TSCs is found in the de 
novo hair follicles reconstituted on nude mice by stem cells chamber graft 
assay. Cutaneous denervation experiment demonstrates that the LEF1 expression in 
TSCs is independent of nerve endings. At last, LEF1 expression in the 
interfollicular epidermis during the early stage of skin development is 
significantly suppressed in transgenic mice with TCF3 overexpression.
CONCLUSION: We reveal the expression dynamics of LEF1 in skin during development 
and hair cycle. LEF1 expression in TSCs indicates that the LEF1/Wnt signal might 
help to establish a niche at the isthmus region for the lanceolate complex, the 
bulge stem cells and other neighboring cells. This article is protected by

274,"Surface anchored polymer brushes prepared by surface-initiated controlled 
radical polymerization (SI-CRP) have raised considerable interest in 
biomaterials and bioengineering. However, undesired residues of noxious 
transition metal catalysts critically restrain their widespread biomedical 
applications. Herein, we present a robust and biocompatible surface-initiated 
controlled radical polymerization catalyzed by a Sn(0) sheet (SI-Sn0CRP) under 
ambient conditions. Through this approach, microliter volumes of vinyl monomers 
with diverse functions (heterocyclic, ionic, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic) could 
be efficiently converted to homogeneous polymer brushes. The excellent 
controllability of SI-Sn0CRP strategy is further demonstrated by the exquisite 
fabrication of predetermined block and patterned polymer brushes through chain 
extension and photolithography, respectively. Additionally, in virtue of 
intrinsic biocompatibility of Sn, the resultant polymer brushes present 
transcendent affinity toward blood and cell, in marked contrast to those of 
copper-based approaches. This strategy could provide an avenue for the 
controllable fabrication of biocompatible polymer brushes toward biological 
applications."
275,"The current study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of 
3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) in combination with bioenhancer 
piperine in lateral fluid percussion injury-induced TBI in experimental rats. 
Fluid percussion injury was introduced in the rat brain by delivering 50 mmHg of 
pressure for 3 min to the exposed brain. AKBA 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg orally, and 
AKBA (25 mg/kg, p.o.) in combination with piperine (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) were 
administered from day 1 to day 14 to the assigned groups. On the 1st, 7th, and 
14th day, behavioral parameters were checked. On the 15th day, animals were 
euthanized. In TBI rat model, AKBA-piperine combination significantly restored 
the altered performance of grip strength, rotarod test, open field task, narrow 
beam task (beam crossing time and no. of foot slips), and Morris water maze 
(escape latency and time spent in target quadrant) (p < 0.001 vs TBI control). 
Furthermore, the AKBA-piperine combination significantly reduced 
pro-inflammatory cytokine level in TBI rat model (&p < 0.001 vs TBI control). 
The combined effect of AKBA and piperine significantly restored oxidative stress 
parameters level, catecholamines level, and neurotransmitters level (p < 0.001 
vs TBI control). Further findings showed that the AKBA-piperine combination 
prevented histopathological changes (p < 0.001), and the immunohistological 
study confirmed increased Nrf2-positive cells (p < 0.001 vs TBI control) and 
reduced nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) expression (p < 0.001 vs TBI control, 
p < 0.01 vs TBI + AKBA 50 mg/kg) in the cortical region following AKBA-piperine 
administration. The present study concluded that AKBA along with piperine 
achieved anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, and also prevented 
neuronal injury via targeting Nrf2 and NFkB expressions."
276,"Hyperlipidemia is an important risk factor in the development and progression of 
tendon pathology, however its role in aggravating rotator cuff tendon injury 
(RCTI) is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the expression status of key 
extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the tendon tissues and tenocytes under 
hyperlipidemia. Shoulder rotator cuff (RC) tendon tissues harvested from the 
swine model of hyperlipidemia displayed alterations in histomorphometry and the 
expression status of major ECM component proteins including COL-I, COL-III, 
COL-IV, COL-V, COL-VI, MMP2, and MMP9. Similarly, the LDL- and oxLDL-challenged 
tenocytes displayed altered expression of the same proteins at both 
transcriptional and translational levels. In addition, the lipid uptake and 
cellular reactive oxygen radicals predominated in the lipid-challenged tenocytes 
compared to the control. Overall, the LDL-treated cells displayed predominant 
pathological alterations compared to the ox-LDL-treated cells. Further 
understanding regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the tendon 
matrisome alteration and subsequent aggravated RCTI pathology in hyperlipidemia 
could open novel translational avenues in the management of RCTI."
277,"The cellular prion protein (PrPC), in its native conformation, performs numerous 
cellular and cognitive functions in brain tissue. However, despite the cellular 
prion research in recent years, there are still questions about its 
participation in oxidative and neurodegenerative processes. This study aims to 
elucidate the involvement of PrPC in the neuroprotection cascade in the presence 
of oxidative stressors. For that, astrocytes from wild-type mice and knockout to 
PrPC were subjected to the induction of oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2) and with the toxic oligomer of the amyloid β protein (AβO). We observed 
that the presence of PrPC showed resistance in the cell viability of astrocytes. 
It was also possible to monitor changes in basic levels of metals and associate 
them with an induced damage condition, indicating the precise role of PrPC in 
metal homeostasis, where the absence of PrPC leads to metallic unbalance, 
culminating in cellular vulnerability to oxidative stress. Increased caspase 3, 
p-Tau, p53, and Bcl2 may establish a relationship between a PrPC and an induced 
damage condition. Complementarily, it has been shown that PrPC prevents the 
internalization of AβO and promotes its degradation under oxidative stress 
induction, thus preventing protein aggregation in astrocytes. It was also 
observed that the presence of PrPC can be related to translocating SOD1 to cell 
nuclei under oxidative stress, probably controlling DNA damage. The results of 
this study suggest that PrPC acts against oxidative stress activating the 
cellular response and defense by displaying neuroprotection to neurons and 
ensuring the functionality of astrocytes."
278,"Hepatoblastoma is the most common type of hepatic tumors occurring in children 
between 0 and 5 years. And the exact pathophysiology of the disease is still 
mysterious. Accumulating studies on LncRNA have shown its pivotal role in the 
development and progression of distinct human cancers. However, the role of 
LINC01023 in hepatoblastoma is unknown. The relative expression of LINC01023, 
miR-378a-5p, and Wnt3 on hepatoblastoma tissue and cell lines was determined by 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The effect of LINC01023 
downregulation and upregulation on cell proliferation, colony formation and 
apoptosis activities in HUH6 and HepG2 Cells was assessed by CKK8, clonogenic 
and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Dual luciferase, RNA 
immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down were performed to confirm the 
interaction between LINC01023 and miR-378a-5p. Similarly, Dual luciferase assay 
was performed to confirmed the interaction between Wnt3 and miR-378a-5p. The 
xenograft tumorgenicity test was performed to elucidate the tumorgenicity 
potential of LINC01023. LINC01023 was significantly upregulated in 
hepatoblastoma tissue and cell lines rather than in adjacent normal hepatic 
tissue and QSG7701 cell lines. LINC01023 silencing attenuated cell 
proliferation, colony formation and increased cell apoptosis. Conversely, 
LINC01023 upregulation results in significant increase in cell proliferation, 
and colony formation activities however, a significant reduction in apoptosis 
activity was reported. Interaction between the LINC01023 and WNT3 was confirmed 
by dual luciferase assay. Xenograft animal tumorgenicity test confirmed the 
in-vivo tumorigenesis potential of LINC01203. To the best of our knowledge, this 
study is the first study demonstrating the role of LINC01023 in hepatoblastoma 
tumorigenesis through the LINC01023/miR-378a-5p/Wnt3 axis. It could be a 
potential therapeutic target and a prognostic biomarker in hepatoblastoma."
279,"The crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is one of the most important 
processes involved in the cell program death, and several mechanisms including 
oligodendrocyte apoptosis and autophagy play significant roles in activating 
macrophages, microglial cells, and finally demyelination in neurodegenerative 
disease. The antidepressants and anti-apoptotic mechanisms of fluoxetine (FLX) 
and cannabidiol (CBD) commence an autophagic event that can effectively repair 
myelin. This study aimed to investigate the effect of those reagents on the rate 
of demyelination in the cerebellum, an important site for white matter in a 
mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE was induced 
in twenty four adult female C57Bl/6 mice were inducted the EAE model; FLX 
treatment which was performed (10 mg/kg/IP) and CBD; were treated (5 mg/kg/IP); 
and their cerebellum was used for Western blotting, real-time PCR to autophagic 
markers of LC3II, Beclin-1, and apoptotic markers Bax and Bcl2 evaluation and 
Luxol Fast Blue staining to the assessment of demyelination. The level of 
autophagic markers was expressively elevated (P < 0.01) but the pro-apoptotic 
markers and Bax/Bcl2 ratio were reduced (P < 0.05). Luxol Fast Blue staining 
confirmed the noteworthy diminution of demyelination in treatment groups 
(P < 0.001). This finding clarified that FLX and CBD ameliorate the severity of 
the EAE model. Combinatory treatments of these two agents are suggested for 
future investigations."
280,"Adriamycin is widely used as a chemotherapeutic strategy for advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the clinical response was disappointing 
because of the acquired drug resistance with long-term usage. Revealing the 
underlying mechanism could provide promising therapeutics for the drug-resistant 
patients. The recently identified linc-ROR (long intergenic non-protein-coding 
RNA, regulator of reprogramming) has been found to be an oncogene in various 
cancers, and it also demonstrated to mediate drug resistance and metastasis. We 
thereby wonder whether this lincRNA could mediate adriamycin chemoresistance in 
HCC. In this study, linc-ROR was found to be upregulated in adriamycin-resistant 
HCC cells. And its overexpression accelerated epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) program and adriamycin resistance. Conversely, its silence suppressed EMT 
and made HCC cells sensitize to adriamycin in vitro and in vivo. Further 
investigation revealed that linc-ROR physically interacted with AP-2α, mediated 
its stability by a post-translational modification manner, and sequentially 
activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Furthermore, linc-ROR expression was positively 
associated with β-catenin expression in human clinical specimens. Taken 
together, linc-ROR promoted tumorigenesis and adriamycin resistance in HCC via a 
linc-ROR/AP-2α/Wnt/β-catenin axis, which could be developed as a potential 
therapeutic target for the adriamycin-resistant patients."
281,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) performs strongly invasive and poor prognosis, and 
adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type in it. Statistically, the 
5-year survival rate of patients with advanced GBC is less than 5%. Such dismal 
outcome might be caused by chemotherapy resistance and native biology of tumor 
cells, regardless of emerging therapeutic strategies. Early diagnosis, depending 
on biomarkers, receptors and secretive proteins, is more important than clinical 
therapy, guiding the pathologic stage of cancer and the choice of medication. 
Therefore, it is in urgent need to understand the specific pathogenesis of GBC 
and strive to find promising novel biomarkers for early screening in GBC. 
Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), long non-coding 
RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), are confirmed to participate in 
and regulate the occurrence and development of GBC. Exceptionally, lncRNAs and 
circRNAs could act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) containing binding 
sites for miRNAs and crosstalk with miRNAs to target regulatory downstream 
protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thus affecting the expression levels of 
specific proteins to participate in and regulate the development and progression 
of GBC. It follows that ncRNAs may become promising biomarkers and potential 
therapeutic targets for GBC. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent 
research progress of miRNAs and lncRNAs in regulating the development and 
progression of GBC, chemoresistance, and predicting the prognosis of patients, 
and highlight the potential applications of the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA 
cross-regulatory networks in early diagnosis, chemoresistance, and prognostic 
evaluation, aiming to better understand the pathogenesis of GBC and develop new 
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
282,"Animals use sensory information and memory to build internal representations of 
space. It has been shown that such representations extend beyond the geometry of 
an environment and also encode rich sensory experiences usually referred to as 
context. In mammals, contextual inputs from sensory cortices appear to be 
converging on the hippocampus as a key area for spatial representations and 
memory. How metric and external sensory inputs (e.g., visual context) are 
combined into a coherent and stable place representation is not fully 
understood. Here, I review the evidence of attentional effects along the ventral 
visual pathway and in the medial temporal lobe and propose an attention-based 
model for the integration of visual context in spatial representations. I 
further suggest that attention-based retrieval of spatial memories supports a 
feedback mechanism that allows consolidation of old memories and new sensory 
experiences related to the same place, thereby contributing to the stability of 
spatial representations. The resulting model has the potential to generate new 
hypotheses to explain complex responses of spatial cells such as place cells in 
the hippocampus."
283,"PURPOSE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) orchestrate critical roles in human 
tumorigenesis. However, the regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs in tissue-specific 
expressions in breast cancer (BC) remains poorly understood. This study aims to 
investigate lncRNA role and mechanisms in BC.
METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to explore differentially expressed lncRNAs in 
BC and adjacent tissues. H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) chromatin 
immune-precipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of BC cells from the GEO dataset 
(GSE85158) was retrieved to identify the H3K27ac activated lncRNAs that were 
involved in tumorigenesis. RP11-162G10.5 was selected as the target lncRNA for 
further functional and mechanism study.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA RP11-162G10.5, whose 
overexpression was specifically driven by H3K27ac in luminal breast cancer. And 
increased RP11-162G10.5 in BC is correlated with poor patient outcomes. 
RP11-162G10.5 promotes tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. 
Mechanistically, RP11-162G10.5 recruits transcriptional factor YBX1 to the GLO1 
promoter, consequently activating GLO1 transcription to modulate the progression 
of BC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the histone modification-activated lncRNA 
contributes to the oncogenesis of BC. Also, our data reveal a role for 
RP11-162G10.5 in BC tumorigenesis and may supply a strategy for targeting the 
RP11-162G10.5 as a potential biomarker and a therapeutic target for breast 
cancer patients."
284,"Ceroid lipofuscinosis type 3 (CLN3) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative 
metabolic disease. Typical clinical symptoms include progressive visual loss, 
epilepsy of unknown etiology and dementia. Presence of lipofuscin deposits with 
typical pattern of 'fingerprints' and vacuolized lymphocytes suggest the 
diagnosis of CLN3. Cause of CLN3 are mutations in the CLN3 gene, among which the 
most frequently found is the large deletion 1.02 kb spreading on exons 7 and 8. 
We present 4 patients from 2 families, in whom the deterioration of visual 
quality and acuity was observed as first clinical sign, when they were a few 
years old and it was successively accompanied by symptoms of neurologic 
deterioration (like generalized convulsions with consciousness impairment). In 
all patients the 1.02 kb deletion in the CLN3 gene was detected in homo- or 
heterozygosity with other CLN3 pathogenic variant. Ultrastructural studies 
revealed abnormal structures corresponding to 'fingerprint' profiles (FPPs) in 
conjunctival endothelial cells. It should be emphasized that in patients with 
blindness of unknown cause the diagnosis of ceroid lipofuscinosis should be 
considered and in older children-especially CLN3. The facility of the analysis 
for the presence of 1.02 kb deletion and economic costs are a solid argument for 
intensive use of this test in the diagnostic procedure of CLN3."
285,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the 
pathological loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, which causes an 
insufficient release of dopamine (DA) and then induces motor and nonmotor 
symptoms. Hyperoside (HYP) is a lignan component with anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. In this study, 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its active neurotoxic 
metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) were used to induce 
dopaminergic neurodegeneration. The results showed that HYP (100 µg/mL) reduced 
MPTP-mediated cytotoxicity of SH-SY5Y cells in vitro, and HYP [25 mg/(kg d)] 
alleviated MPTP-induced motor symptoms in vivo. HYP treatment reduced the 
contents of nitric oxide (NO), H2O2, and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as the 
mitochondrial damage of dopaminergic neurons, both in vitro and in vivo. 
Meanwhile, HYP treatment elevated the levels of neurotrophic factors such as 
glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 
and recombinant cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor in vivo, but not in vitro. 
Finally, Akt signaling was activated after the administration of HYP in 
MPP+/MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, the blockage of the 
Akt pathway with Akt inhibitor did not abolish the neuroprotective effect of HYP 
on DA neurons. These results showed that HYP protected the dopaminergic neurons 
from the MPP+- and MPTP-induced injuries, which did not rely on the Akt pathway."
286,"BACKGROUND: Several studies of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
have reported a notable therapeutic effect of segmentectomy. However, the 
secondary benefits of lung volume preservation remain unclear. This study aimed 
to investigate the potential benefits of segmentectomy, in terms of its impact 
on postoperative bronchial change.
METHODS: Patients who underwent left-sided upper lobectomy and upper division 
segmentectomy for pStage 0-IA2 NSCLC, were retrospectively analyzed. Degree of 
the left main bronchial deviation was measured by the curvature index (CI), 
determined using computed tomography. Variables, including CI value and 
postoperative rate of change in CI were compared for postoperative cough 
management the lobectomy and segmentectomy groups.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were reviewed. Thirty-seven and 30 patients 
underwent lobectomy and segmentectomy, respectively, without any significant 
differences in baseline and surgical variables. The 5-year overall survival 
rates in the lobectomy and segmentectomy groups were 86.7 and 95.2%, 
respectively (p = 0.437). While there was no significant difference in 
postoperative complications, the rate of change in CI was significantly higher 
in the lobectomy group than in the segmentectomy group (113 vs. 106%, 
p = 0.005). In addition, the analysis based on postoperative cough reveals the 
rate of change in CI to be significantly higher in patients requiring medical 
treatment (p = 0.005). Conclusions Left upper division segmentectomy provides 
satisfactory treatment and relief of postoperative bronchial tortuosity. Our 
study suggests that there is a possibility the mitigation of environmental 
changes in the thoracic cavity may reduce symptoms, thus contributing to an 
improved quality of life."
287,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a devastating disease foisting a significantly high 
morbidity, prepotent in low- and middle-income developing countries. Evolution 
of drug resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent 
of tuberculosis, has made the TB treatment more complicated. The protracted 
nature of present TB treatment, persistent and tolerant Mtb populations, 
interaction with antiretroviral therapy and existing toxicity concerned with 
conventional anti-TB drugs are the four major challenges inflicted with 
emergence of drug-resistant mycobacterial strains, and the standard medications 
are unable to combat these strains. These factors emphasize an exigency to 
develop new drugs to overcome these barriers in current TB therapy. With this 
regard, antimycobacterial peptides derived from various sources such as human 
cells, bacterial sources, mycobacteriophages, fungal, plant and animal sources 
could be considered as antituberculosis leads as most of these peptides are 
associated with dual advantages of having both bactericidal activity towards Mtb 
as well as immuno-regulatory property. Some of the peptides possess the 
additional advantage of interacting synergistically with antituberculosis 
medications too, thereby increasing their efficiency, underscoring the vigour of 
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as best possible alternative therapeutic 
candidates or adjuvants in TB treatment. Albeit the beneficiary features of 
these peptides, few obstacles allied with them like cytotoxicity and proteolytic 
degradation are matter of concerns too. In this review, we have focused on 
structural hallmarks, targeting mechanisms and specific structural aspects 
contributing to antimycobacterial activity and discovered natural and synthetic 
antimycobacterial peptides along with their sources, anti-TB, immuno-regulatory 
properties, merits and demerits and possible delivery methods of AMPs."
288,"PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the expression of autophagic genes and 
proteins during blastocyst development and differentiation.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study. Between March 2018 and November 
2019, 30 females aged 30.13 ± 4.83 years underwent an intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection (ICSI) cycle at Madina Fertility Center. ICSI was used to develop and 
incubate 82 leftover embryos to day 5. Then, the embryos were divided into two 
groups based on their developmental structure: group D (n = 49) included embryos 
that developed into blastocysts, whereas group A (n = 33) included arrested 
embryos. These embryos were used to investigate the autophagic gene and protein 
expressions. The current study was approved by the Clinical Trial Ethical 
Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, following the 
ethical standards of scientific research (Registration no. 0303721).
RESULTS: Embryos that developed into blastocysts on day 5 (group D) had 
significantly higher relative expression of the LC3 gene (1.11 ± 0.52) and 
beclin-1 gene (1.43 ± 0.34) and beclin-1 protein expression (3.8 ± 0.028) than 
those that did not develop into blastocysts on day 5 (group A) [0.72 ± 0.18 
(P = 0.03), 0.35 ± 0.12 (P = 0.0001), and 3.14 ± 0.05, (P = 0.0001), 
respectively]. In contrast, mTOR and PIK3C3 protein expression was significantly 
higher in group A (arrested embryos) than those in group D (developed embryos) 
(P = 0.007 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, the expression of the 
eIF4E gene was significantly lower in group D embryos (0.32 ± 0.07) than that in 
group A embryos (4.38 ± 1.16) (P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies  autophagy as a well regulated process 
required to maintain cell allocation and differentiation during late 
preimplantation embryo developmental stages."
289,"BACKGROUND: Aging is a biological process from which there is no escape. Diverse 
factors contribute to aging, most notably cell energy metabolism. Ribosome 
biogenesis and translation are the two main energy-consuming processes that 
contribute to longevity. It has repeatedly been shown that translation disorders 
caused by deletion of ribosomal genes delay aging. However, the effect of 
increasing the amount of ribosomal proteins has remained elusive.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We determine the relative level of the uL6A and uL6B mRNA 
derived from the genome and the plasmid. The appearance of additional copies of 
plasmid-derived uL6 leads to an increase in uL6A and uL6B derived from the 
BY4741 genome (mainly form B). The relative amount of mRNA of plasmid form B is 
several times greater than the amount of mRNA in plasmid form A. The level of 
mRNA derived from the plasmid is increased many times compared to the mRNA of 
genomic origin. Additionally, the study indicates that excess of uL6A is a 
limiting or even harmful factor in the reaction to stressful conditions. 
Therefore, our hypothesis states that uL6A transcription or mRNA uL6A 
degradation in yeast cells are tightly regulated. our data clearly demonstrate 
that aging is accelerated when additional copies of uL6 paralogs appear.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of both uL6A or uL6B accelerates aging in the budding 
yeast. The level of uL6A mRNA is tightly controlled by yeast cell. The uL6a 
protein plays a pivotal role in the response to environmental stress, including 
oxidative and osmotic stress, and thus may fall into the class of moonlighting 
ribosomal proteins with extra-ribosomal function."
290,"Biofilms are communities of microbial cells surrounded by an extracellular 
polysaccharide matrix, recognized as a fungal source for local and systemic 
infections and less susceptible to antifungal drugs. Thus, treatment of 
biofilm-related Candida spp. infections with popular antifungals such as 
fluconazole is limited and species-dependent and alternatively demands the use 
of expensive and high toxic drugs. In this sense, molecules with antibiofilm 
activity have been studied but without care regarding the use of important 
criteria such as antibiofilm concentration lower than antifungal concentration 
when considering the process of inhibition of formation and concentrations equal 
to or lower than 300 µM. Therefore, this review tries to gather the most 
promising molecules regarding the activity against the C. albicans biofilm 
described in the last 10 years, considering the activity of inhibition and 
eradication. From January 2011 to July 2021, articles were searched on Scopus, 
PubMed, and Science Direct, combining the keywords ""antibiofilm,"" ""candida 
albicans,"" ""compound,"" and ""molecule"" with AND and OR operators. After 3 phases 
of selection, 21 articles describing 42 molecules were discussed in the review. 
Most of them were more promising for the inhibition of biofilm formation, with 
SM21 (24) being an interesting molecule for presenting inhibitory and 
eradication activity in biofilms with 24 and 48 h, as well as alizarin (26) and 
chrysazine (27), with concentrations well below the antifungal concentration. 
Despite the detection of these molecules and the attempts to determine the 
mechanisms of action by microscopic analysis and gene expression, no specific 
target has been determined. Thus, a gap is signaled, requiring further studies 
such as proteomic analyses to clarify it."
291,"Exosomes have come to the fore in drug delivery systems due to their 
biological-based and immune-suppressing properties. In this study, we 
investigated the effect of doxorubicin loading of exosomes isolated from human 
platelets on breast cancer.Exosomes released from ADP (1 µM)-activated platelets 
were isolated by the ultracentrifugation method, and their size and charge were 
measured with a TEM and zeta sizer. Then doxorubicin (Dox) loading into exosomes 
(PLT-Exo-Dox) was done by electroporation and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cells. 
In exosome characterization, CD62 positivity was higher in platelet pellets, 
while CD9 positivity was higher in released exosomes. The size of PLT-Exo and 
PLT-Exo-Dox was 82.02 ± 5.21 nm and 116 ± 3.73 nm, with a polydispersity index 
of 0.26 ± 0.04 and 0.39 ± 0.06, and the Zeta potential was - 16.45 mV and 
24.07 mV, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency of the preparation was 
86.02 ± 6.16%, with a drug loading capacity of 4.75 ± 0.16 µg/µg of the exosome. 
In MDA-MB-231 cells, PLT-Exo increased cell viability, while PLT-Exo-Dox 
decreased in 24 h. The Annexin-V binding level and Bax gene expression were 
increased in PLT-Exo-Dox and Bcl-2 gene expression was decreased. This study 
will shed light on the development of release systems that can be effective with 
chemotherapeutic agents by using exosomes released by cells in the development 
of personalized treatments."
292,"As a tumor suppressor in lung cancer, FAT atypical cadherin 4 (FAT4) has a 
critical role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the role of 
FAT4 in ceritinib-resistant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) EMT has not been reported. It is necessary to discuss 
the role of FAT4 in this process and its potential mechanism of interaction. We 
found that the expression level of FAT4 was downregulated markedly in 
ceritinib-resistant NCI-H2228 (H2228/Cer) cells. Jujuboside A, a FAT4 activator, 
diminished EMT and metastasis of H2228/Cer cells. Importantly, autophagy 
inhibition inverted the inhibitory effect of FAT4 activation on EMT. 
Furthermore, we found the regulatory action of FAT4 on autophagy was related to 
proteasome 26S subunit ubiquitin receptor and non-ATPase 4 (PSMD4) and 
proteasome 20S subunit beta 4 (PSMB4), and the inhibitory effect of autophagy on 
EMT might be related to ROS/NF-κB/IκB-α and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. In 
conclusion, FAT4 activation can inhibit the process of EMT in H2228/Cer cells by 
promoting autophagy, which provides a potential target for ceritinib-resistant 
ALK positive NSCLC therapy."
293,"After more than 60 years of intense research in allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT), this therapy has progressed from one that was fraught 
with seemingly insurmountable complications to a standard treatment of patients 
with aplastic anemia. During the 1970s and 1980s, HCT donors were almost 
exclusively HLA-identical siblings. Subsequent advances in the understanding of 
the complexity of the HLA region along with the development of molecular HLA 
typing and the establishment of unrelated volunteer donor registries have 
resulted in an ever-increasing use of such donors. Most recent breakthroughs 
have enabled HLA-haploidentical HCT and, thereby, finding donors for nearly 
every patient. The outstanding outcomes reported with any of the donor options 
have made allogeneic HCT the preferred treatment over immunosuppressive therapy."
294,"Tirabrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treating B-cell 
malignancies. We report the final results of a Phase I study of tirabrutinib in 
17 Japanese patients with B-cell malignancies. Patients were administered 
tirabrutinib at a dose of 160 mg, 320 mg, or 480 mg once daily, or 300 mg twice 
daily (N = 3, 3, 4, and 7, respectively). Three patients continued tirabrutinib 
until study completion (November 30, 2020). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in all 
17 patients, with Grade 3-4 AEs in 8 (47.1%), serious AEs in 7 (41.2%), 
drug-related AEs in 16 (94.1%), and Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs in 6 (35.3%). 
Drug-related AEs reported in 3 or more patients were rash, vomiting, 
neutropenia, arthralgia, and malaise. One additional serious AE (benign neoplasm 
of the lung, unrelated to tirabrutinib) occurred after the previous data cutoff 
(January 4, 2018). Tirabrutinib administration and response assessment were 
continued for over 4 years in 4 patients. The overall response rate was 76.5% 
(13/17 patients). The median (range) time to response and duration of response 
were 0.9 (0.9-5.9) months and 2.59 (0.08-5.45) years, respectively. These 
findings demonstrate the long-term safety and efficacy of tirabrutinib in 
Japanese patients with B-cell malignancies.Clinical trial registration:

295,"Heavy metal pollution caused due to various industrial and mining activities 
poses a serious threat to all forms of life in the environment because of the 
persistence and toxicity of metal ions. Microbial-mediated bioremediation 
including microbial biofilms has received significant attention as a sustainable 
tool for heavy metal removal as it is considered safe, effective, and feasible. 
The biofilm matrix is dynamic, having microbial cells as major components with 
constantly changing and evolving microenvironments. This review summarizes the 
bioremediation potential of bacterial biofilms for different metal ions. The 
composition and mechanism of biofilm formation along with interspecies 
communication among biofilm-forming bacteria have been discussed. The 
interaction of biofilm-associated microbes with heavy metals takes place through 
a variety of mechanisms. These include biosorption and bioaccumulation in which 
the microbes interact with the metal ions leading to their conversion from a 
highly toxic form to a less toxic form. Such interactions are facilitated via 
the negative charge of the extracellular polymeric substances on the surface of 
the biofilm with the positive charge of the metal ions and the high cell 
densities and high concentrations of cell-cell signaling molecules within the 
biofilm matrix. Furthermore, the impact of the anodic and cathodic redox 
potentials in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) for the reduction, removal, and 
recovery of numerous heavy metal species provides an interesting insight into 
the bacterial biofilm-mediated bioelectroremediation process. The review 
concludes that biofilm-linked bioremediation is a viable option for the 
mitigation of heavy metal pollution in water and ecosystem recovery."
296,"The predictive value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) in severely 
burned patients remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential 
association between admission RDW and outcomes in patients with severe burns. 
Data of severely burned patients in the burn center of Changhai Hospital were 
retrospectively evaluated. The relationship between admission RDW and mortality 
was analyzed and displayed using the receiver operating characteristic curve, 
Kaplan-Meier curve, Cox proportional hazards regression, and the nomogram 
method. A total of 342 patients were identified according to the filter 
criteria. The 30-day mortality was 12.9%, and the mortality rates in 7 days and 
90 days were 2.9% and 16.7%, respectively. Patients with high admission RDW 
value were more likely to die than those with low RDW value. Multivariate 
analysis revealed that higher admission RDW, age, full-thickness burned area, 
and inhalation injury were independent risk factors with 30-day mortality. The 
nomogram based on these risk factors was established to predict survival 
probability in severe burn patients. The C-index of different follow-up times 
was computed between 0.867 and 0.904, and the nomogram model list fits the data 
well. Admission RDW played a valuable role in predicting short-term mortality in 
patients with severe burns. The nomogram containing admission RDW was 
established to predict mortality, which helps burn care providers identify the 
patients at higher risk of short-term mortality after severe burns. More 
attention should be paid to the application of these easy and inexpensive 
biochemical indicators in the early prediction of disease progression."
297,"Linear gradient elution supercritical fluid chromatography with electrochemical 
detection was developed using hydroxyacetophenones as analytes. Separation was 
carried out with a diol column (4.6 mm id × 250 mm length, 5 μm) as a stationary 
phase and a mixture of supercritical carbon dioxide and methanol as a mobile 
phase, where the ratio of carbon dioxide and methanol was changed from 99:1 
(v/v) to 60:40 (v/v). For the electrochemical detection, methanol containing 
1.0 mol L-1 ammonium acetate was used as a supporting electrolyte solution 
and + 1.2 V was applied to the electrochemical cell. We compared the performance 
of the present method to isocratic elution supercritical fluid chromatography, 
and the repeatability, linearity, and detection capability all showed better 
analytical parameters in the gradient elution. As such, we found that gradient 
elution supercritical fluid chromatography can achieve the faster separation and 
save resources compared to isocratic elution. Thus, the present method may 
contribute to the development of green analytical methods."
298,"BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 and glutathione peroxidase 4 have 
been identified as key molecules in two independent pathways associated with 
ferroptosis inhibition. This study investigated the prognostic significance and 
clinical associations of FSP1 and GPX4 expression in esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (ESCC) and assessed the therapeutic potential of regulating these 
molecules in ESCC cells.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on surgical specimens of 97 
patients with ESCC for FSP1 and GPX4 expression. To identify the change in ESCC 
cell viability, FSP1 and GPX4 inhibitors were administered to three cell lines. 
In addition, ferroptosis as the cause of reduced cell viability by FSP1 and GPX4 
inhibition was confirmed.
RESULTS: Prognosis was significantly worse for patients in the group positive 
for both FSP1 and GPX4 compared with the other groups (p < 0.001). In 
multivariate analysis, positivity for both FSP1 and GPX4 was an independent poor 
prognostic factor (p = 0.002). The combination of FSP1 and GPX4 inhibitors 
induced cell death more potently than each inhibitor did alone. Furthermore, the 
ferroptosis inhibitor markedly canceled this cell death.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of FSP1 and GPX4 is a poor prognostic factor for 
patients with ESCC. Simultaneous suppression of both FSP1 and GPX4 caused potent 
cell death, which was markedly abrogated by ferroptosis inhibitors. These 
findings indicate that simultaneous regulation of FSP1 and GPX4 may be a new 
therapeutic target in ESCC."
299,"BACKGROUND: Evaluating patients' risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) is crucial 
for positive outcomes following cardiac surgery. Our aims were first to select 
candidate risk factors from pre- or intra-operative real-world parameters 
collected from routine medical care and then evaluate potential associations 
between those parameters and risk of onset of post-operative cardiac 
surgery-associated AKI (CSA-AKI).
METHOD: We conducted two cohort studies in Japan. The first was a single-center 
prospective cohort study (n = 145) to assess potential association between 115 
clinical parameters collected from routine medical care and CSA-AKI (≥ Stage1) 
risk in the population of patients undergoing cardiac surgery involving 
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). To select candidate risk factors, we employed 
random forest analysis and applied survival analyses to evaluate association 
strength. In a second retrospective cohort study, we targeted patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB (n = 619) and evaluated potential positive 
associations between CSA-AKI incidence and risk factors suggested by the first 
cohort study.
RESULTS: Variable selection analysis revealed that parameters in clinical 
categories such as circulating inflammatory cells, CPB-related parameters, 
ventilation, or aging were potential CSA-AKI risk factors. Survival analyses 
revealed that increased counts of pre-operative circulating monocytes and 
neutrophils were associated with CSA-AKI incidence. Finally, in the second 
cohort study, we found that increased pre-operative circulating monocyte counts 
were associated with increased CSA-AKI incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating monocyte counts in the pre-operative state are 
associated with increased risk of CSA-AKI development. This finding may be 
useful in stratifying patients for risk of developing CSA-AKI in routine 
clinical practice."
300,"In the present study, we investigated the effects of urolithin A (UA), a 
metabolite generated from ellagic acid via its metabolism by gut bacteria, as an 
autophagy activator with potential neuroprotective activity. WT and 3xTg-AD mice 
were administered long-term intermittent dietary supplementation with UA. UA was 
found to prevent deficits in spatial memory, cued fear response, and exploratory 
behavior in this model. It also decreased the Aβ plaque burden in areas of the 
hippocampus where these protein deposits are prominent in the model. 
Interestingly, correlation analyses demonstrate that Aβ plaque burden positively 
correlates with enhanced spatial memory in 3xTg-AD mice on a control diet but 
not in those supplemented with UA. In contrast, Aβ42 abundance in cortical and 
hippocampal homogenates negatively correlate with spatial memory in UA-fed mice. 
Our data suggest that plaque formation may be a protective mechanism against 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline and that targeting the generation of 
proteotoxic Aβ species might be a more successful approach in halting disease 
progression. UA was also found to extend lifespan in normal aging mice. 
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that UA is able to induce autophagy and to 
increase Aβ clearance in neuronal cell lines. In summary, our studies reveal UA, 
likely via its actions as a autophagy inducer, is capable of removing Aβ from 
neurons and its dietary administration prevents the onset of cognitive deficits 
associated with pathological Aβ deposition in the 3xTg-AD mouse model as well as 
extending lifespan in normal aging mice."
301,"Constructed wetland-microbial fuel cells are used to treat heavy metal and/or 
refractory organic wastewater. However, the electron transport mechanism of 
downflow Leersia hexandra constructed wetland-microbial fuel cells (DLCW-MFCs) 
is poorly understood when used to treat composite-polluted wastewater containing 
Cr(VI) and p-chlorophenol (4-CP) (C&P). In this study, metagenomics and in situ 
electrochemical techniques were used to investigate the electrochemical 
properties and the electricigens and their dominant gene functions. The DLCW-MFC 
was used to treat C&P and single-pollutant wastewater containing Cr(VI) (SC) and 
4-CP (SP). The results showed that C&P had a higher current response and charge 
transfer capability and lower solution resistance plus charge transfer 
resistance. The anode bacteria solution of C&P contained more electron carriers 
(RF, FMN, FAD, CoQ10, and Cyt c). Metagenomic sequencing indicated that the 
total relative abundance of the microorganisms associated with electricity 
production (Desulfovibrio, Pseudomonas, Azospirillum, Nocardia, Microbacterium, 
Delftia, Geobacter, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, and Clostridium) was the highest in 
C&P (4.24%). However, Microbacterium was abundant in SP (0.12%), which exerted 
antagonistic effects on other electricigens. Among the 10 electricigens based on 
gene annotation, C&P had a higher overall relative abundance of the Unigene gene 
annotated to the KO pathway and CAZy level B compared with SC and SP, which were 
1.31% and 0.582% respectively. Unigene153954 (ccmC), Unigene357497 (coxB), and 
Unigene1033667 (ubiG) were related to the electron carrier Cyt c, electron 
transfer, and CoQ biosynthesis, respectively. These were annotated to 
Desulfovibrio, Delftia, and Pseudomonas, respectively. Unigene161312 (AA1) used 
phenols and other substrates as electron donors and was annotated to 
Pseudomonas. Other functional carbohydrate enzyme genes (e.g., GT2, GT4, and 
GH31) used carbohydrates as donors and were annotated to other electricigens. 
This study provides a theoretical basis for electron transfer to promote the 
development of CW-MFCs."
302,"Previous studies have extensively explored impacts of trace elements on human 
beings and complex relationships with cancers. However, contradictory 
conclusions may be more challenging to explain due to biological specimen 
differences. To investigate the distribution of trace elements inside body, we 
collected serum, whole blood and tissues from 77 patients with esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), as well as serum and whole blood from 100 
healthy individuals, and determined the concentrations of 13 elements (Al, V, 
Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Cd, and Pb) with inductively coupled 
plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Al, Ni, Cu, Sr, and Cd variations between 
patients and controls were found to be inconsistent in serum and blood. 
Concentrations of Cu, As, Se, and Sr in serum were positively correlated with 
that in whole blood in both case and control group (rs >0.450, P <0.01). 
Elements in serum had a higher accuracy (87.0%) than whole blood (74.0%) in 
classifying ESCC patients and healthy individuals with discriminant analysis. 
As, Cd, and Pb concentrations in cancerous tissues were positively correlated 
with those in normal epithelium (rs =0.397, 0.571, and 0.542, respectively), 
while Mn, Cu, and Se accumulated in malignant tissues, with V, Cr, Co, Ni, Sr, 
and Cd partitioning in normal epithelium (all P <0.05). Thus, certain elements 
in blood, such as Cu, As, Se, and Sr, were useful in assessing element exposure 
burdens and accumulation tendency of some elements (Mn, Cu and Se, etc.) was 
uncovered in tumors. Our investigation demonstrated the variations in trace 
element distribution for frequently used specimens and further evidence of 
etiological mechanism is necessary."
303,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide; 
however, the potentially possible molecular biological mechanism of CRC is still 
not completely comprehended. This study aimed to confirm candidate key hub genes 
involved in the growth and development of CRC and their connection with immune 
infiltration as well as the related pathways. Gene expression data were selected 
from the GEO dataset. Hub genes for CRC were identified on the basis of 
differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA), and LASSO regression. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), 
Gene Ontology (GO), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were applied to 
reveal possible functions of the differential genes. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) 
was implemented to identify the relationship between immune cells infiltration 
and hub genes. Two hundred and sixty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were identified. Three modules were acquired based on WGCNA, and the blue module 
presented the highest relevance with CRC. Ten hub genes (AQP8, B3GALT5, CDH3, 
CEMIP, CPM, FOXQ1, PLAC8, SCNN1B, SPINK5, and SST) were acquired with LASSO 
analysis as underlying biomarkers for CRC. Compared with normal tissues, CRC 
tissues presented significantly higher numbers of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B 
cells, natural regulatory T (Treg) cells, and monocytes. The functional 
enrichment analyses demonstrated that hub genes were primarily enriched in 
metabolic process, inflammatory-related, and immune-related response. Ten hub 
genes were identified to be involved in the occurrence and development of CRC 
and may be deemed as novel biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and treatment."
304,"OBJECTIVE: RET (rearranged during transfection) kinase, as a transmembrane 
receptor tyrosine kinase, is a therapeutic target for several human cancer such 
as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thyroid cancer. Pralsetinib is a 
recently approved drug for the treatment of RET-driven NSCLC and thyroid 
cancers. A single point mutation G810C at the C-lobe of the RET kinase causes 
pralsetinib resistance to this non-gatekeeper variant. However, the detailed 
mechanism remains poorly understood.
METHODS: Here, multiple microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, 
molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy 
calculations, and community network analysis were performed to reveal the 
mechanism of pralsetinib resistance to the RET G810C mutant.
RESULTS: The simulations showed that the G810C mutation had a minor effect on 
the overall conformational dynamics of the RET kinase domain. Energetic analysis 
suggested that the G810C mutation reduced the binding affinity of pralsetinib to 
the mutant. Per-residue energy contribution and structural analyses revealed 
that the hydrogen bonding interactions between pralsetinib and the hinge 
residues Glu805 and Ala807 were disrupted in the G810C mutant, which were 
responsible for the decreased binding affinity of pralsetinib to the mutant.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results may provide understanding of the mechanism of 
pralsetinib resistance to the non-gatekeeper RET G810C mutant."
305,"Combination therapy as an important treatment option for lung cancer has been 
attracting attention due to the primary and acquired resistance of 
chemotherapeutic drugs in the clinical application. In the present study, as a 
new therapy strategy, concomitant treatment with time-restricted feeding (TRF) 
plus cisplatin (DDP) on lung cancer growth was investigated in DDP-resistant and 
DDP-sensitive lung cancer cells. We first found that TRF significantly enhanced 
the drug susceptibility of DDP in DDP-resistant A549 (A549/DDP) cell line, 
illustrated by reversing the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values of 
A549/DDP cells to normal level of parental A549 cells. We also found that TRF 
markedly enhanced DDP inhibition on cell proliferation, migration, as well as 
promoted apoptosis compared to the DDP alone group in A549, H460 and A549/DDP 
cells lines. We further revealed that the synergistic anti-tumor effect of 
combined DDP and TRF was greater than that of combined DDP and simulated fasting 
condition (STS), a known anti-tumor cellular medium. Moreover, mRNA sequence 
analysis from A549/DDP cell line demonstrated the synergistic anti-tumor effect 
involved in upregulated pathways in p53 signaling pathway and apoptosis. 
Notably, compared with the DDP alone group, combination of TRF and DDP robustly 
upregulated the P53 protein expression without mRNA level change by regulating 
its stability via promoting protein synthesis and inhibiting degradation, 
revealed by cycloheximide and MG132 experiments. Collectively, our results 
suggested that TRF in combination with cisplatin might be an additional novel 
therapeutic strategy for patients with lung cancer."
306,"The final disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) in dumpsites is still a 
reality worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries, leading to 
leachate-contaminated zones. Therefore, the aim of this study was to carry out 
soil and leachate physicochemical, microbiological, and toxicological 
characterizations from a non-operational dumpsite. The L-01 pond samples 
presented the highest physicochemical parameters, especially chloride (Cl; 
4101 ± 44.8 mg L-1), electrical conductivity (EC; 10,452 ± 0.1 mS cm-1), and 
chemical oxygen demand (COD; 760 ± 6.6 mg L-1) indicating the presence of 
leachate, explained by its close proximity to the landfill cell. Pond L-03 
presented higher parameters compared to pond L-02, except for N-ammoniacal and 
phosphorus levels, explained by the local geological configuration, configured 
as a slope from the landfill cell towards L-03. Seven filamentous and/or yeast 
fungi genera were identified, including the opportunistic pathogenic fungi 
Candida krusei (4 CFU) in an outcrop sample. Regarding soil samples, Br, Se, and 
I were present at high concentrations leading to high soil contamination 
(CF ≤ 6). Pond L-02 presented the highest CF for Br (18.14 ± 18.41 mg kg-1) and 
I (10.63 ± 3.66 mg kg-1), while pond L-03 presented the highest CF for Se 
(7.60 ± 1.33 mg kg-1). The most severe lethal effect for Artemia salina was 
observed for L-03 samples (LC50: 79.91%), while only samples from L-01 were 
toxic to Danio rerio (LC50: 32.99%). The highest lethality for Eisenia andrei 
was observed for L-02 samples (LC50: 50.30%). The applied risk characterization 
indicates high risk of all proposed scenarios for both aquatic (RQ 375-909) and 
terrestrial environments (RQ > 1.4 × 105). These findings indicate that the 
investigated dumpsite is contaminated by both leachate and metals, high risks to 
living organisms and adjacent water resources, also potentially affecting human 
health."
307,"Trending three-dimensional tissue engineering platforms developed via 
biofabrication and bioprinting of exocrine glands are on the rise due to a 
commitment to organogenesis principles. Nevertheless, a proper extracellular 
matrix (ECM) microarchitecture to harbor primary cells is yet to be established 
towards human salivary gland (SG) organogenesis. By using porcine submandibular 
gland (SMG) biopsies as a proof-of-concept to mimic the human SG, a new 
decellularized ECM bioassembly platform was developed herein with varying 
perfusions of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to limit denaturing events and ensure 
proper preservation of the native ECM biochemical niche. Porcine SMG biopsies 
were perfused with 0.01%, 0.1%, and 1% SDS and bio-assembled magnetically in 
porous polycarbonate track-etched (PCTE) membrane. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), 
cell removal efficiency, and ECM biochemical contents were analyzed. SDS at 0.1% 
and 1% efficiently removed dsDNA (< 50 ng/mg) and preserved key matrix 
components (sulfated glycosaminoglycans, collagens, elastin) and the 
microarchitecture of native SMG ECM. Bio-assembled SMG decellularized ECM (dECM) 
perfused with 0.1-1% SDS enhanced cell viability, proliferation, expansion 
confluency rates, and tethering of primary SMG cells during 7 culture days. 
Perfusion with 1% SDS promoted greater cell proliferation rates while 0.1% SDS 
supported higher acinar epithelial expression when compared to basement membrane 
extract and other substrates. Thus, this dECM magnetic bioassembly strategy was 
effective for decellularization while retaining the original ECM biochemical 
niche and promoting SMG cell proliferation, expansion, differentiation, and 
tethering. Altogether, these outcomes pave the way towards the recellularization 
of this novel SMG dECM in future in vitro and in vivo applications."
308,"PURPOSE: Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of 
genitourinary system in men. CACYCLIN binding protein (CACYBP) is involved in 
the progression of a variety of cancers. The aim of this study was to explore 
the expression and functional role of CACYBP in PC.
METHODS: The expression of CACYBP in PC was evaluated by immunohistochemical 
(IHC) staining and qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we established lentivirus-mediated 
CACYBP knockdown in PC cell lines. The biological roles of CACYBP on 
proliferation, apoptosis, cycle distribution, migration and tumor formation of 
PC were investigated by Celigo cell counting assay, flow cytometry, transwell 
assay, wound-healing assay and mice xenograft models, respectively.
RESULTS: CACYBP was highly expressed in PC and was positively correlated with 
the pathological grade of PC patients. Knockdown of CACYBP inhibited 
proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle in G2 and suppressed 
migration of PC cell lines in vitro. In addition, CACYBP knockdown weakened the 
tumor growth of PC in vivo. Moreover, addition of p53 inhibitor could 
effectively alleviate the inhibitory effect of CACYBP knockdown on cell 
activity.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that knockdown of CACYBP inhibited the 
proliferation, migration and tumorigenicity of PC, which may serve as a 
potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PC."
309,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small and noncoding RNA molecules (18-25 nt) 
that can regulate expression of their target genes post-transcriptionally. 
Previously, using high-throughput sequencing data obtained on a Solexa platform, 
we found that Bos taurus bta-miR-2904 (miR-2904) was significantly upregulated 
in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells infected with bovine viral diarrhea 
virus (BVDV) strain NADL at 2, 6, and 18 h postinfection (hpi) compared to 
uninfected MDBK cells. Moreover, miR-2904 overexpression significantly reduced 
BVDV replication. However, the mechanism by which miR-2904 inhibits viral 
replication remains unclear. In this study, we used electron microscopy, laser 
confocal microscopy, dual-luciferase reporter analysis, real-time PCR, and 
Western blot assays to investigate the effect of the miR-2904 expression on BVDV 
NADL replication and virus-infection-induced autophagy. The results indicate 
that miR-2904 inhibits autophagy of MDBK cells by targeting autophagy-related 
gene 13 (ATG13), and overexpression of miR-2904 inhibited the replication of 
BVDV NADL."
310,"Numerous mechanisms involved in promoting cancer cell survival under nutrient 
starvation have been described. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as 
critical players in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, but the role of lncRNAs 
in the progression of CRC under nutrient starvation has not been well clarified. 
Here, we identified a lncRNA, LINC01615, that was significantly upregulated in 
response to serum starvation. LINC01615 can contribute to the adaptation of CRC 
cells to serum-deprived conditions and enhance cell survival under similar 
conditions. LINC01615 activated the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) under serum 
starvation, manifested as decreased ROS production and enhanced nucleotide and 
lipid synthesis. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a key rate-limiting 
enzyme of the PPP, and LINC01615 promoted G6PD expression by competitively 
binding with hnRNPA1 and facilitating G6PD pre-mRNA splicing. Moreover, we also 
found that serum starvation led to METTL3 degradation by inducing autophagy, 
which further increased the stability and level of LINC01615 in a m6A-dependent 
manner. LINC01615 knockdown combined with oxaliplatin achieved remarkable 
antitumor effects in PDO and PDX models. Collectively, our results demonstrated 
a novel adaptive survival mechanism permitting tumor cells to survive under 
limiting nutrient supplies and provided a potential therapeutic target for CRC."
311,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of rituximab treatment on innate immune cell 
activation in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS).
METHODS: A 48-year-old woman with PPMS was started on rituximab shortly after 
diagnosis. [11C]PK11195 PET imaging was employed to assess innate immune cell 
activation with special interest in the white matter around chronic lesions. 
PET, MRI, and disability measurements were performed at baseline and after 
18 months of rituximab treatment. Specific binding of [11C]PK11195 was 
quantified using mean distribution volume ratios (DVRs), and at voxel-level 
based on proportions of active voxels.
RESULTS: The PPMS patient had higher PK11195 DVRs and higher proportions of 
active voxels in the thalamus and the normal appearing white matter compared to 
the healthy control group. The thalamic and perilesional white matter DVRs and 
the proportions of active voxels decreased after rituximab treatment. The 
patient remained clinically stable during the 5-years follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that while a degree of smoldering activity 
persists, high efficacy B-cell-targeting therapy may contribute to reduced 
innate immune cell activation in PPMS brain areas relevant for disease 
progression. This case supports the therapeutic concept that controlling 
smoldering brain inflammation is beneficial for slowing down progression 
independent of relapses."
312,"PURPOSE: This study was aimed at exploring the function of Exosomes isolated 
from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-Exos) in corneal wound 
healing and at revealing the underlying mechanisms involving the p44/42 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
METHODS: The isolated BMSC-Exos were identified by transmission electron 
microscopy, Western blot, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. After coculture 
with BMSC-Exos, the proliferation and migration of human corneal epithelial 
cells (HCEs) were evaluated. The protein expression of p-MEK/MEK and p44/42 MAPK 
was detected by Western blot. A mouse model of alkali-burned cornea was 
established via NaOH exposure. After injection with BMSC-Exos, the pathological 
changes and expression of α-SMA (a fibrosis marker) and CD31 (a vascularization 
marker) in corneal tissues were detected.
RESULTS: BMSC-Exos enhanced the proliferation and migration of HCEs in a 
dose-dependent manner. The p44/42 MAPK pathway was activated by the treatment of 
BMSC-Exos, and its blocking using U0126 partially abrogated the effects of 
BMSC-Exos on promoting the proliferation and migration of HCEs. In vivo, the 
injection of BMSC-Exos facilitated the remission of the pathological changes 
(inflammation) and weakened the upregulation of α-SMA (fibrosis) and CD31 
(vascularization) in corneal tissues of mice with alkali-burn injury.
CONCLUSION: BMSC-Exos promoted the proliferation and migration of HCEs via 
activating the p44/42 MAPK pathway in vitro and also inhibited alkali 
burn-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and vascularization in corneal tissues in 
vivo. BMSC-Exos may be promising resources for promoting corneal wound healing."
313,"BACKGROUND: Monitoring jar fermenter-cultured microorganisms in real time is 
important for controlling productivity of bioproducts in large-scale cultivation 
settings. Morphological data is used to understand the growth and fermentation 
states of these microorganisms during monitoring. Oleaginous yeasts are used for 
their high productivity of single-cell oils but the relationship between lipid 
productivity and morphology has not been elucidated in these organisms.
RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the relationship between the morphology 
of oleaginous yeasts (Lipomyces starkeyi and Rhodosporidium toruloides were 
used) and their cultivation state in a large-scale cultivation setting using a 
real-time monitoring system. We combined this with deep learning by feeding a 
large amount of high-definition cell images obtained from the monitoring system 
to a deep learning algorithm. Our results showed that the cell images could be 
grouped into 7 distinct groups and that a strong correlation existed between 
each group and its biochemical activity (growth and oil-productivity).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report describing the morphological variations of 
oleaginous yeasts in a large-scale cultivation, and describes a promising new 
avenue for improving productivity of microorganisms in large-scale cultivation 
through the use of a real-time monitoring system combined with deep learning.
KEY POINTS: • A real-time monitoring system followed the morphological change of 
oleaginous yeasts. • Deep learning grouped them into 7 distinct groups based on 
their morphology. • A correlation between the cultivation state and the shape of 
the yeast was observed."
314,"PURPOSE: Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is associated in nearly 100% with 
persistent high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. ICC is still one 
of the leading causes for cancer mortality in women worldwide. The 
immunosuppressive influence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the 
immunocompromised period of pregnancy due to tolerance induction against the 
hemiallogeneic fetus, are generally risk factors for acquisition and persistence 
of HR-HPV infections and their progression to precancerous lesions and 
HPV-associated carcinoma.
METHODS: Overall, 81 pregnant women living with HIV (WLWH) were included. A 
medical history questionnaire was used to record clinical and HIV data. 
Participants received cervicovaginal cytological smear, colposcopy and HPV 
testing. HPV test was performed using BSGP5+/6+ PCR with Luminex read-out. The 
HR-HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 were additionally grouped together 
as high-high-risk HPV (HHR-HPV) for the purpose of risk-adapted analysis.
RESULTS: HR-HPV prevalence was 45.7%. Multiple HPV infections were detected in 
27.2% of participants, of whom all had at least one HR-HPV genotype included. 
HR-HPV16 and HR-HPV52 were the most prevalent genotypes and found when high 
squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) was detected by cytology. HIV viral load 
of ≥ 50 copies/ml was associated with higher prevalence of HR-HPV infections. 
Whereas, CD4 T cells < 350/µl showed association with occurrence of multiple HPV 
infections. Time since HIV diagnosis seemed to impact HPV prevalence.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant WLWH require particularly attentive and extended HPV-, 
colposcopical- and cytological screening, whereby clinical and HIV-related risk 
factors should be taken into account."
315,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is frequent in people 
living with HIV (PLWH) and may be aggravated by metabolic comorbidities and 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-associated adverse effects.
METHODS: We retrospectively assessed epidemiological, clinical and laboratory 
parameters and ART regimens at HIV diagnosis (BL) and at last follow-up (FU) in 
1458 PLWH without viral hepatitis coinfection attending our HIV clinic in 
2014-2016. Fibrosis was non-invasively assessed by the NAFLD fibrosis score 
(NFS).
RESULTS: The median age of subjects was 37.8 years, 77.4% were male and 67.2% on 
ART, median CD4+ count was 356.0 cells/µL. At BL, 503 (34.5%) and 20 (1.4%) PLWH 
had dyslipidemia and diabetes, respectively. According to the NFS 16 (1.3%) 
showed advanced fibrosis (NFS ≥ 0.676), among which 1 (6.3%) had diabetes, 7 
(43.8%) had dyslipidemia, and 5 (31.3%) were on HIV-protease inhibitors (PI). In 
addition, 191(15.1%) had intermediate NFS results, while fibrosis was ruled out 
(NFS ≤ 1.455) in 1065 (83.7%) PLWH. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, 590 
(42.8%) had dyslipidemia and 61 (4.4%) had diabetes. Also, 21 (1.6%) showed 
advanced fibrosis, of which 10 (47.6%) had diabetes, 4 (19.0%) had dyslipidemia, 
and 9 (42.9%) were on PI-based ART, 223 (17.4%) had intermediate NFS results, 
while 1039 (81.0%) showed no fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: During FU, advanced NAFLD fibrosis occurred in 1.3-1.6% of PLWH. 
Dyslipidemia, diabetes, and PI-based ART were associated with advanced NAFLD 
fibrosis. Prospective investigations of NAFLD severity and risk factors in PLWH 
are warranted."
316,"Novel function and mechanism of a PNP molecule VaEG45 from adzuki bean involved 
in plant immunity. Plant natriuretic peptides (PNPs) can affect a broad spectrum 
of physiological responses in plants acting as peptidic signaling molecules. 
However, PNPs may play additional roles in plant immunity. Our previous 
transcriptome data of adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) in response to Uromyces 
vignae infection revealed association of PNP-encoding gene VaEG45 with U. vignae 
resistance. To determine the function of VaEG45 in disease resistance, we cloned 
the 589 bp nucleotide sequence of VaEG45 containing 2 introns, encoding a 
putative 13.68 kDa protein that is 131 amino acids in length. We analyzed 
expression in different resistant cultivars of V. angularis and found 
significant induction of VaEG45 expression after U. vignae infection. Transient 
expression of VaEG45 improved tobacco resistance against Botrytis cinerea. We 
next analyzed the mechanism by which VaEG45 protects plants from fungal 
infection by determination of the biological activity of the prokaryotic 
expressed VaEG45. The results showed that the fusion protein VaEG45 can 
significantly inhibit urediospores germination of U. vignae, mycelial growth, 
and the infection of tobacco by B. cinerea. Further analysis revealed that 
VaEG45 exhibits β-1, 3-glucanase activity. These findings uncover the function 
of a novel PNP molecule VaEG45 and provide new evidence about the mechanism of 
PNPs in plant immunity."
317,"OsPPR11 belongs to the P-type PPR protein family and can interact with OsCAF2 to 
regulate Group II intron splicing and affect chloroplast development in rice. 
Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins participate in chloroplasts or 
mitochondria group II introns splicing in plants. The PPR protein family 
contains 491 members in rice, but most of their functions are unknown. In this 
study, we identified a nuclear gene encoding the P-type PPR protein OsPPR11 in 
chloroplasts. The qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that OsPPR11 was expressed in 
all plant tissues, but leaves had the highest expression. The osppr11 mutants 
had yellowing leaves and a lethal phenotype that inhibited chloroplast 
development and photosynthesis-related gene expression and reduced 
photosynthesis-related protein accumulation in seedlings. Moreover, 
photosynthetic complex accumulation decreased significantly in osppr11 mutants. 
The OsPPR11 is required for ndhA, and ycf3-1 introns splicing and interact with 
CRM family protein OsCAF2, suggesting that these two proteins may form splicing 
complexes to regulate group II introns splicing. Further analysis revealed that 
OsCAF2 interacts with OsPPR11 through the N-terminus. These results indicate 
that OsPPR11 is essential for chloroplast development and function by affecting 
group II intron splicing in rice."
318,"Relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is common and is 
associated with a dismal prognosis. Treatment options are limited and the 
understanding of molecular response patterns is still challenging. We analyzed 
the clonal response patterns of 15 patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated 
with selinexor in a phase II trial (SAIL). DNA was analyzed at three time points 
and showed a decline of mutated alleles in FLT3, SF3B1, and TP53 under SAIL 
treatment. Overall survival (OS) was similar between patients with declining 
versus persisting clones. We show an interesting long-term course of a patient 
who relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) with SF3B1- 
and SRSF2-mutated AML and received selinexor as maintenance treatment for 
4 years. Measurable residual disease (MRD) remained detectable for 2 weeks after 
donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in this patient and then remained negative under 
selinexor maintenance treatment. Selinexor was tolerated well and was stopped 
after 4 years of SAIL treatment. We present an exploratory study and identify 
subclonal patterns of patients treated with selinexor."
319,"PURPOSE: The tumorigenesis of squamous cell cancer of unknown primary (SCCUP) in 
the head and neck area has not been decoded so far, while poor survival rates 
and limited therapeutic options pose a serious challenge. The aim of this 
project was to investigate immunological characteristics of SCCUPs and compare 
them to oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
METHODS: PD-L1 expression (TC) was examined by immunohistochemistry in 50 lymph 
node metastases of SCCUP and 47 primaries of OPSCC. CD3 + and CD8 + lymphocytic 
infiltration was measured in 5 high power fields. Expression of p16 and HPV ISH 
were assessed.
RESULTS: SCCUP demonstrated a significantly higher expression of PD-L1 than 
OPSCC. In p16-negative SCCUPs PD-L1 proved to be an independent prognostic 
factor to prioritize high-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunologic differences between SCCUP and OPSCC were detected. A 
higher PD-L1 expression in SCCUP could potentially facilitate further evaluation 
of checkpoint inhibitor therapy."
320,"Environmental or occupational exposure of humans to trichloroethylene (TCE) has 
been associated with different extrahepatic toxic effects, including 
nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Bioactivation of TCE via the glutathione (GSH) 
conjugation pathway has been proposed as underlying mechanism, although only few 
mechanistic studies have used cell models of human origin. In this study, six 
human derived cell models were evaluated as in vitro models representing 
potential target tissues of TCE-conjugates: RPTEC/TERT1 (kidney), HepaRG 
(liver), HUVEC/TERT2 (vascular endothelial), LUHMES (neuronal, dopaminergic), 
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) derived peripheral neurons (UKN5) 
and hiPSC-derived differentiated brain cortical cultures containing all subtypes 
of neurons and astrocytes (BCC42). A high throughput transcriptomic screening, 
utilizing mRNA templated oligo-sequencing (TempO-Seq), was used to study 
transcriptomic effects after exposure to TCE-conjugates. Cells were exposed to a 
wide range of concentrations of S-(1,2-trans-dichlorovinyl)glutathione 
(1,2-DCVG), S-(1,2-trans-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (1,2-DCVC), 
S-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione (2,2-DCVG), and 
S-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (2,2-DCVC). 1,2-DCVC caused stress responses 
belonging to the Nrf2 pathway and Unfolded protein response in all the tested 
models but to different extents. The renal model was the most sensitive model to 
both 1,2-DCVC and 1,2-DCVG, with an early Nrf2-response at 3 µM and hundreds of 
differentially expressed genes at higher concentrations. Exposure to 2,2-DCVG 
and 2,2-DCVC also resulted in the upregulation of Nrf2 pathway genes in 
RPTEC/TERT1 although at higher concentrations. Of the three neuronal models, 
both the LUHMES and BCC42 showed significant Nrf2-responses and at higher 
concentration UPR-responses, supporting recent hypotheses that 1,2-DCVC may be 
involved in neurotoxic effects of TCE. The cell models with the highest 
expression of γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) enzymes, showed cellular responses to 
both 1,2-DCVG and 1,2-DCVC. Little to no effects were found in the neuronal 
models from 1,2-DCVG exposure due to their low GGT-expression. This study 
expands our knowledge on tissue specificity of TCE S-conjugates and emphasizes 
the value of human cell models together with transcriptomics for such 
mechanistic studies."
321,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play crucial roles in physiological and 
pathophysiological processes. Although studies have described muscle-bone 
interactions via humoral factors, we reported that EVs from C2C12 muscle cells 
(Myo-EVs) suppress osteoclast formation. Current clinical evidence suggests that 
inflammation induces both sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Although tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α) is a critical proinflammatory factor, the influences of TNF-α 
on muscle-bone interactions and Myo-EVs are still unclear. In the present study, 
we investigated the effects of TNF-α stimulation of C2C12 cells on osteoclast 
formation and osteoblastic differentiation modulated by Myo-EVs in mouse cells. 
TNF-α significantly decreased the protein amount in Myo-EVs, but did not affect 
the Myo-EV size distribution. TNF-α treatment of C2C12 myoblasts significantly 
decreased the suppression of osteoclast formation induced by Myo-EVs from C2C12 
myoblasts in mouse bone marrow cells. Moreover, TNF-α treatment of C2C12 
myoblasts in mouse preosteoclastic Raw 264.7 cells significantly limited the 
Myo-EV-induced suppression of osteoclast formation and decreased the 
Myo-EV-induced increase in mRNA levels of osteoclast formation-related genes. On 
the other hand, TNF-α treatment of C2C12 muscle cells significantly decreased 
the degree of Myo-EV-promoted mRNA levels of Osterix and osteocalcin, as well as 
ALP activity in mouse mesenchymal ST-2 cells. TNF-α also significantly decreased 
miR196-5p level in Myo-EVs from C2C12 myoblasts in quantitative real-time PCR. 
In conclusion, TNF-α stimulation of C2C12 muscle cells blunts both the 
osteoclast formation suppression and the osteoblastic differentiation promotion 
that occurs due to Myo-EVs in mouse cells. Thus, TNF-α may disrupt the 
muscle-bone interactions by direct Myo-EV modulation."
322,"Together with an anti-tumor immune response, oncolysis using a recombinant viral 
vector promises to eliminate cancer cells by both gene transfer and 
host-mediated functions. In this study we explore oncolysis induced by 
nonreplicating adenoviral vectors used for p14ARF and interferon-β (hIFNβ) gene 
transfer in human melanoma cell lines, revealing an unexpected role for p14ARF 
in promoting cellular responses predictive of immune stimulation. Oncolysis was 
confirmed when UACC-62 (p53 wild-type) cells succumbed upon p14ARF gene transfer 
in vitro, whereas SK-Mel-29 (p53-mutant) benefitted from its combination with 
hIFNβ. In the case of UACC-62, in situ gene therapy in nude mice yielded reduced 
tumor progression in response to the p14ARF and hIFNβ combination. Potential for 
immune stimulation was revealed where p14ARF gene transfer in vitro was 
sufficient to induce emission of immunogenic cell death factors in UACC-62 and 
upregulate pro-immune genes, including IRF1, IRF7, IRF9, ISG15, TAP-1, and B2M. 
In SK-Mel-29, p14ARF gene transfer induced a subset of these factors. hIFNβ was, 
as expected, sufficient to induce these immune-stimulating genes in both cell 
lines. This work is a significant advancement for our melanoma gene therapy 
strategy because we revealed not only the induction of oncolysis, but also the 
potential contribution of p14ARF to immune stimulation."
323,"BACKGROUND: RERE is a highly conserved transcriptional co-regulator that is 
associated with a human neurodevelopmental disorder with or without anomalies of 
the brain, eye, or heart (NEDBEH, OMIM: 616975).
RESULTS: We show that the zebrafish rerea mutant (babyface) robustly 
recapitulates optic fissure closure defects resulting from loss of RERE 
function, as observed in humans. These defects result from expansion of proximal 
retinal optic stalk and reduced expression of some of the ventral retinal fate 
genes due to deregulated shh signaling. Using zebrafish and cell-based assays, 
we determined that NEDBEH-associated human RERE variants function as hypomorphs 
in their ability to repress shh signaling and some exhibit abnormal nuclear 
localization. Inhibiting shh signaling by the shh/gli inhibitor HPI-1 rescues 
coloboma, confirming our observation that coloboma in rerea mutants is indeed 
due to deregulation of shh signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Zebrafish rerea mutants exhibit optic stalk and optic fissure 
closure defects. The optic fissure closure defect was rescued by an shh 
signaling inhibitor, suggesting that this defect could arise due to deregulated 
shh signaling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

325,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of Cytoreductive Nephrectomy for synchronous 
metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma patients in the Systemic Therapy era and beyond 
regarding the Overall Survival, the optimal sequence between Systemic Therapy 
and Cytoreductive Nephrectomy and prognostic factors.
METHODS: The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 
guidelines. Bibliographic search was performed in Medline (PubMed), 
ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (CENTRAL). Studies included were those indexed from 2005 in an attempt to 
limit those conducted in the cytokine era. Risk of bias assessment was performed 
by two authors (K.S and T.L) using the Cochrane Collaborative Risk of Bias tool 
for randomized trials, the Cochrane Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of 
Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for nonrandomized studies.
RESULTS: Cytoreductive nephrectomy was associated with improved overall survival 
in all but one of the observational studies. While in all of these studies the 
unvariable analysis showed improved overall survival in favor of the 
cytoreductive nephrectomy group in some studies the subgroup analysis showed no 
benefit. Regarding the optimal sequence, deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy 
demonstrated better results in more studies than upfront cytoreductive 
nephrectomy but a advantage was not clearly certain. In the analysis of possible 
prognostic factors for overall survival with cytoreductive nephrectomy, most 
common prognostic factors found were age (in 8 studies), tumor histology (in 7 
studies), number of metastasis (in 6 studies), and T stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Cytoreductive nephrectomy can still play an important role in 
wisely selected patients, although the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy in the 
new immunotherapy era needs to be defined."
326,"OBJECTIVE: Surgeons observed that the outcomes after the same repair technique 
in the same type of hypospadias performed by the same surgeon may be different. 
There may be some indeterminate factors that influence the results such as 
subclinical inflammation. Our study evaluated the predictor values of 
inflammatory hematologic parameters on the complications after hypospadias 
repair.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who 
underwent hypospadias repair between January 2016 and January 2019 in our 
clinic. Age at surgery, hypospadias type, repair technique, complications were 
recorded. Patients who underwent Snodgrass repair by a single surgeon were 
included in the study while patients who underwent different techniques or 
procedures that were performed by other surgeons were excluded. The levels of 
white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet and monocyte, the mean 
platelet volumes were recorded from blood test that were performed one day 
before surgery. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), plateletlymphocyte ratio 
(PLR), and other parameters were analyzed to determine their relationship with 
complications after hypospadias surgery.
RESULTS: WBC and neutrophil levels were statistically higher in patients with 
complications (p = 0.006 and 0.017 respectively). Other hematological parameters 
were not different between patients with or without complications. To predict 
the complications, the WBC cutoff was 9500/mm3, the neutrophil cutoff was 
3000/mm3.
CONCLUSIONS: WBC and neutrophil values were statistically significant in 
predicting the complications after Snodgrass repair in patients with 
hypospadias. Our result determined no relation between complications and NLR, 
PLR."
327,"OBJECTIVES: Phosphate and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) acts as a regulator of 
PI3-KAkt molecular pathway. ETS Related gene (ERG), an oncogene located in 
chromosome 21q22.2, is involved in prostate cancer (PCa) by serine 2 (TMPRSS2), 
a protein encoded by TMPRSS2 gene. The aim of this study is to evaluate the 
clinical impact of PTEN loss and ERG rearrangement in terms of oncologic results 
in patients diagnosed with localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected from a total of 74 
patients who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy for localized PCa 
and immunohistochemical study was performed in tissue samples. The primary 
antibodies for anti-ERG antibody as well as anti-PTEN antibody were obtained 
from DAKO. ERG was considered positive if at least 20% of the evaluated cells 
were stained at least with medium intensity. PTEN protein loss was considered 
when the intensity of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was mild or entirely 
negative across > 10% of tumor cells.
RESULTS: Homogenous loss of PTEN was associated with higher clinical 
International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade (p = 0.018) while no 
statistical significant association was present regarding the presence of ERG 
rearrangement with either ISUPc or ISUPp. After a median follow up of 34 months, 
24 patients developed biochemical recurrence. No statistical significant 
correlation of ERG status with biochemical recurrence was noted while PTEN was 
associated with biochemical recurrence development in a statistical significant 
way. Lastly the combination of PTEN loss with ERG rearrangement presence was 
detected more often in higher ISUPc and ISUPp as well as biochemical recurrence 
development, although in a non statistical significant way.
CONCLUSIONS: Homogenous and heterogenous PTEN loss was associated with 
biochemical recurrence. No association of ERG and biochemical recurrence was 
noted. The combination of PTEN loss and ERG rearrangement presented a trend for 
higher ISUPc and ISUPp as well as biochemical recurrence but not in a 
statistical significant way."
328,"OBJECTIVE: Intradiverticular bladder tumors (IDBT) are uncommon clinical 
entities. We reviewed the literature for clinical presentation, diagnosis and 
therapeutic options to establish recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic 
management.
METHODS: Bibliographic research was performed using PubMed from database 
inception until October 15, 2022. A pooled analysis was performed of 498 
patients with IDBT presented in the literature. The evaluation included patient 
sex, age, diagnostic methods, symptoms, localization of the tumor, tumor 
staging, tumor histopathology, treatment, and the presence of recurrence. To 
express results, descriptive statistics were used appropriately.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 64.81 years (range 49 days to 84 years). 
The ratio between men and women was ≈ 24:1, suggesting a male predominance (85% 
male, 3.6% female). The most common presenting symptom was gross hematuria 
(60.88%). Most of the patients had cystoscopy (56.85%) and intravenous or 
computed tomography urography (52.01%). Regarding tumor staging, most of the 
patients were diagnosed with pT1 tumors. For the histopathology of IDBT, 87.95% 
of the specimens were transitional cell carcinomas and in 10.84% there were 
concomitant CIS. Regarding the treatment, radical cystectomy was chosen in 
34.34%, partial cystectomy in 26.66%, diverticulectomy in 15.95% and 
transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) in 16.36% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Most common diagnostic tool for IDBT seems to be cystoscopy 
followed by computerized tomography urogram. Due to the absence of muscle layer 
in the diverticulum and the highgrade histology of most of them at diagnosis, 
cystectomy is the first therapeutic choice. However, for patients that are not 
considered appropriate candidates or for those presenting with lowgrade and low 
volume tumors, TURBT is a good option."
329,"In neuroscience, the acquisition of neural signals from the brain cortex is 
crucial to analyze brain processes, detect neurological disorders, and offer 
therapeutic brain-computer interfaces. The design of neural interfaces 
conformable to the brain tissue is one of today's major challenges since the 
insufficient biocompatibility of those systems provokes a fibrotic encapsulation 
response, leading to an inaccurate signal recording and tissue damage precluding 
long-term/permanent implants. The design and production of a novel soft neural 
biointerface made of polyacrylamide hydrogels loaded with plasmonic silver 
nanocubes are reported herein. Hydrogels are surrounded by a silicon-based 
template as a supporting element for guaranteeing an intimate neural-hydrogel 
contact while making possible stable recordings from specific sites in the brain 
cortex. The nanostructured hydrogels show superior electroconductivity while 
mimicking the mechanical characteristics of the brain tissue. Furthermore, in 
vitro biological tests performed by culturing neural progenitor cells 
demonstrate the biocompatibility of hydrogels along with neuronal 
differentiation. In vivo chronic neuroinflammation tests on a mouse model show 
no adverse immune response toward the nanostructured hydrogel-based neural 
interface. Additionally, electrocorticography acquisitions indicate that the 
proposed platform permits long-term efficient recordings of neural signals, 
revealing the suitability of the system as a chronic neural biointerface."
330,"BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with a 2 per 100 000 
incidence rate in the world. Overall survival (OS) of patients in stage I-II 
disease is around 80%, whereas OS of patients in stage III-IVB disease drops to 
60%, implying the importance of diagnosis to reduce NPC mortality. However, more 
than 70% patients of NPC were diagnosed at advanced stages (stage III and IV) in 
clinics, and it definitely contributes to little substantial improvement in the 
5-year survival rates although NPC is sensitive to radio-and chemotherapy. 
Hence, development of novel biomarkers and targetable genes in NPC is eagerly 
awaited.
METHODS: We had analyzed the dataset GSE12452 and found hundreds of genes 
trans-activated in NPC. Among them, this study focused on PARP-1 binding protein 
(PARPBP) whose overexpression was also validated in GSE13597 and GSE53819 
datasets.
RESULTS: Knockdown of PARPBP significantly reduced cell viability in NPC and 
also identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes including 377 
downregulated and 518 upregulated genes in HONE-1 cells with stably knockdown 
PARPBP. Furthermore, PARPBP might promote cell migration and invasion in NPC 
through positive regulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2C (UBE2C).
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the aberrant expression of PARPBP in NPC, 
and imply its importance in nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis which further opens up 
the possibility of PARPBP as a novel diagnostic biomarker for NPC therapy."
331,"Cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) is an important reason that results in 
chemotherapy failure. As a main mechanism of MDR, overexpressed P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) utilizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to actively pump chemotherapy drugs 
out of cells. In addition, metabolic reprogramming of drug-resistant tumor cells 
(DRTCs) exacerbates the specific hypoxic microenvironment and promotes tumor 
metastasis and recurrence. Therefore, we propose a novel sonodynamic therapy 
(SDT) paradigm to induce energy metabolism disorder and drug resistance change 
of DRTCs. A US-controlled ""Nanoenabled Energy Metabolism Jammer"" (TL@HPN) is 
designed using perfluoropentane (PFP) adsorbing oxygen in the core, and a 
targeting peptide (CGNKRTR) is attached to the liposome as the delivery carrier 
shell to incorporate hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) and paclitaxel 
(PTX). The TL@HPN with ultrasonic/photoacoustic imaging (PAI/USI) precisely 
controlled the release of drugs and oxygen after being triggered by ultrasound 
(US), which attenuated the hypoxic microenvironment. SDT boosted the reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) content in tumor tissues, preferentially inducing 
mitochondrial apoptosis and maximizing immunogenic cell death (ICD). 
Persistently elevated oxidative stress levels inhibited ATP production and 
downregulated P-gp expression by disrupting the redox balance and electron 
transfer of the respiratory chain. We varied the effect of TL@HPN combined with 
PD-1/PD-L1 to activate autoimmunity and inhibit tumor metastasis, providing a 
practical strategy for expanding the use of SDT-mediated tumor energy 
metabolism."
332,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous and complex disease with limited 
treatment options. Targeting transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and programmed

first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain 
of TGF-β receptor II (a TGF-β ""trap"") fused to a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody 
blocking programmed cell death ligand 1. We report results from an expansion 
cohort of a phase I study (NCT02517398) in patients with heavily pretreated 
advanced CRC treated with bintrafusp alfa. As of May 15, 2020, 32 patients with 
advanced CRC had received bintrafusp alfa for a median duration of 7.1 weeks. 
The objective response rate was 3.1% and the disease control rate was 6.3% (1 
partial response, 1 stable disease); 2 patients were not evaluable. The safety 
profile was consistent with previously reported data."
333,"BACKGROUND: In phase III TIVO-3 trial, tivozanib improved progression-free 
survival (PFS) compared to sorafenib for patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC). However, the effectiveness of this drug after exposure to 
other selective VEGFR agents has not yet been defined. Herein, we characterize 
the clinical efficacy of tivozanib in patients with mRCC previously treated with 
axitinib.
METHODS: We identified patients from the intention to treat (ITT) population, in 
the TIVO-3 trial, who received treatment with axitinib before enrolment in the 
study and evaluated PFS, response rate (RR), and safety.
RESULTS: Out of 350 patients, 172 (83:89, tivozanib:sorafenib) had received 
prior treatment with axitinib in TIVO-3. In this subgroup, PFS was 5.5 months 
with tivozanib and 3.7 months with sorafenib (HR 0.68). RR was 13% and 8% 
favoring tivozanib.
CONCLUSIONS: Tivozanib is active in the treatment of patients with mRCC who have 
progressed on prior therapies, including axitinib."
334,"BACKGROUND: Pathogenic variants in human MAB21L2 result in microphthalmia, 
anophthalmia and coloboma. The exact molecular function of MAB21L2 is currently 
unknown. We conducted a series of yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) experiments to 
determine protein interactomes of normal human and zebrafish MAB21L2/mab21l2 as 
well as human disease-associated variant MAB21L2-p.(Arg51Gly) using human adult 
retina and zebrafish embryo libraries.
RESULTS: These screens identified klhl31, tnpo1, TNPO2/tnpo2, KLC2/klc2, and 
SPTBN1/sptbn1 as co-factors of MAB21L2/mab21l2. Several factors, including hspa8 
and hspa5, were found to interact with MAB21L2-p.Arg51Gly but not wild-type 
MAB21L2/mab21l2 in Y2H screens. Further analyses via 1-by-1 Y2H assays, 
co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry revealed that both normal and 
variant MAB21L2 interact with HSPA5 and HSPA8. In situ hybridization detected 
co-expression of hspa5 and hspa8 with mab21l2 during eye development in 
zebrafish. Examination of zebrafish mutant hspa8hi138Tg identified reduced hspa8 
expression associated with severe ocular developmental defects, including small 
eye, coloboma, and anterior segment dysgenesis. To investigate the effects of 
hspa8 deficiency on the mab21l2Arg51_Phe52del allele, corresponding zebrafish 
double mutants were generated and found to be more severely affected than single 
mutant lines.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies heat shock proteins as interacting partners of 
MAB21L2/mab21l2 and suggest a role for this interaction in vertebrate eye 
development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
335,"Skeletal muscle mass is closely related to strength and health. Multiple genes 
and signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle 
hypertrophy. miR-29 can participate in various processes of skeletal muscle 
development through different target genes. However, studies are needed on the 
function of miR-29 in skeletal muscle during mouse puberty. We used mice in 
which overexpression of miR-29ab1 cluster could be induced specifically within 
skeletal muscle, and investigated the effects of miR-29 overexpression on 
skeletal muscle at 1 month of age. We found that the overexpression of miR-29ab1 
cluster in juvenile mice caused skeletal muscle mass and myofiber 
cross-sectional area to increase. The study on the mechanism of miR-29 inducing 
skeletal muscle hypertrophy had found that miR-29 achieved its function by 
inhibiting the expression of Mstn. At the same time, injured myofibers were 
present within miR-29ab1 cluster overexpressing skeletal muscle. The damage of 
skeletal muscle may be due to the inhibition of the type IV collagen by miR-29. 
These results indicate that although the overexpression of miR-29ab1 cluster can 
induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy in mouse juvenile, it simultaneously causes 
skeletal muscle damage."

are determined. Methods: We conducted an online, population-based quantitative 
survey among Japanese residents aged between 20 and 69 years. Statistical 
analyses consisted of univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: 
Of the 1580 respondents, 60.9% preferred autonomy-based consent (specific or 
dynamic consent) and 23.9% preferred broad-type consent (opt-out or broad 
consent). Marital status, gender, and privacy concerns were significantly 
associated with the preference for a consent model. Conclusions: Our results 
demonstrated the public's current preference for autonomy-based consent, 
including dynamic consent. However, our findings also revealed that 
approximately half of the respondents considered broad consent as somewhat 
preferable."
337,"Systematic identification of signaling pathways required for the fitness of 
cancer cells will facilitate the development of new cancer therapies. We used 
gene essentiality measurements in 1,086 cancer cell lines to identify selective 
co-essentiality modules and found that a ubiquitin ligase complex composed of 
UBA6, BIRC6, KCMF1 and UBR4, which is required for the survival of a subset of 
epithelial tumors that exhibit a high degree of aneuploidy. Suppressing BIRC6 in 
cell lines that are dependent on this complex led to a substantial reduction in 
cell fitness in vitro and potent tumor regression in vivo. Mechanistically, 
BIRC6 suppression resulted in selective activation of the integrated stress 
response (ISR) by stabilization of the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), a direct 
ubiquitination target of the UBA6/BIRC6/KCMF1/UBR4 complex. These observations 
uncover a novel ubiquitination cascade that regulates ISR and highlight the 
potential of ISR activation as a new therapeutic strategy."
338,"High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is a biomolecule that acts as an 
alerting signal of late sepsis by accelerating the production of proinflammatory 
cytokines, and eventually leads to various inflammation-related symptoms. When 
released into plasma at high concentration, it disrupts precise diagnosis and 
prognosis and worsens the survival of patients with systemic inflammatory 
conditions. Jujuboside B (JB) is a natural compound pressed from the seed of 
Zizyphi Spinosi Semen, which is known for its medical efficacies in treating 
various conditions such as hyperlipidemia, hypoxia, and platelet aggregation. 
Nevertheless, the medicinal activity of JB on HMGB1-involved inflammatory 
response in vascular cells in the human body is still ambiguous. Therefore, we 
hypothesized that JB could regulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
dynamics of HMGB1 and its mediated cascade in inflammatory responses in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In this experiment, JB and HMGB1 were 
administered in that order. In vitro and in vivo permeability, and cell 
viability, adhesion, and excavation of leukocytes, development of cell adhesion 
molecules, and lastly production of proinflammatory substances were investigated 
on human endothelial cells and mouse disease models to investigate the efficacy 
of JB in inflammatory condition. JB substantially blocked the translocation of 
HMGB1 from HUVECs and controlled HMGB1-induced adhesion and extravasation of the 
neutrophils through LPS-treated HUVECs. Moreover, JB decreased the formation of 
HMGB1 receptors and continually prevented HMGB1-induced proinflammatory 
mechanisms by blocking transcription of nuclear factor-κB and synthesis of tumor 
necrosis factor-α. In conclusion, JB demonstrated preventive effects against 
inflammatory pathologies and showed the potential to be a candidate substance 
for various inflammatory diseases by regulating HMGB1-mediated cellular 
signaling."
339,"The plant pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a major threat to 
agriculture and the environment worldwide. Recent devastating outbreaks in 
Europe highlight the potential of this pathogen to cause emergent diseases. Xf 
subsp. multiplex ESVL and IVIA5901 strains that belong to sequence type (ST) 6 
were isolated from almond orchards within the outbreak area in Alicante province 
(Spain). Both strains share more than 99% of the chromosomal sequences), but the 
ESVL strain harbours two plasmids (pXF64-Hb_ESVL and pUCLA-ESVL). Here, 
virulence phenotypes and genome content were compared between both strains, 
using three strains from USA as a reference for the phenotypic analyses. 
Experiments in microfluidic chambers, used as simulation of xylem vessels, 
showed that twitching motility was absent in the IVIA5901 strain, while the ESVL 
strain had reduced twitching motility. Both Spanish strains had less biofilm 
formation, cell aggregation and lower virulence in tobacco compared with USA 
reference strains. Genome analysis of the two plasmids from ESVL revealed 51 
unique coding sequences (CDS) that were absent in the chromosome of IVIA5901. 
Comparison of the chromosomes of both strains showed some unique CDS and SNPs in 
each strain with potential deleterious mutations. Genomic differences found in 
genes previously associated with adhesion and motility might explain the 
differences in the phenotypic traits studied. Although additional studies are 
necessary to infer the potential role of Xf plasmids, our results indicate that 
the presence of plasmids should be considered in the study of the mechanisms of 
pathogenicity and adaptation in Xf to new environments."
340,"Phosphorothioate (PS)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drugs enter cells 
through endocytic pathways where a majority are entrapped within membrane-bound 
endosomes and lysosomes, representing a limiting step for antisense activity. 
While late endosomes have been identified as a major site for productive PS-ASO 
release, how lysosomes regulate PS-ASO activity beyond macromolecule degradation 
remains not fully understood. In this study, we reported that SID1 transmembrane 
family, member 2 (SIDT2), a lysosome transmembrane protein, can robustly 
regulate PS-ASO activity. We showed that SIDT2 is required for the proper 
colocalization between PS-ASO and lysosomes, suggesting an important role of 
SIDT2 in the entrapment of PS-ASOs in lysosomes. Mechanistically, we revealed 
that SIDT2 regulates lysosome cellular location. Lysosome location is largely 
determined by its movement along microtubules. Interestingly, we also observed 
an enrichment of proteins involved in microtubule function among SIDT2-binding 
proteins, suggesting that SIDT2 regulates lysosome location via its interaction 
with microtubule-related proteins. Overall, our data suggest that lysosome 
protein SIDT2 inhibits PS-ASO activity potentially through its interaction with 
microtubule-related proteins to place lysosomes at perinuclear regions, thus, 
facilitating PS-ASO's localization to lysosomes for degradation."
341,"BACKGROUND: It is known that the microenvironmental cytokine IFN-γ provides a 
survival advantage for CLL cells. However, the mechanisms involved in this 
effect have not been properly investigated.
METHODS: Herein, we conducted a comprehensive screening of the effects of IFN-γ 
on signaling pathways and gene expression profile in CLL cells by using western 
blotting, RT-qPCR and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).
RESULTS: We found that IFN-γ not only activated the pro-survival STAT3, but also 
activated the AKT and ERK signaling pathways. RNA-seq analysis showed that IFN-γ 
stimulation changed the expression profiles of more than 500 genes, with 391 
being up-regulated and 123 down-regulated. These genes are involved in numerous 
biological processes, including anti-apoptosis, cell migration and 
proliferation. IFN-γ significantly up-regulated the expression of CD38, BCL6, 
CXCL9, BCL2A1, SCOS3, IL-10, HGF, EGFR, THBS-1, FN1 and MUC1, which encode 
proteins potentially associated with disease progression, worse prognosis or 
poor response to treatment. Blocking JAK1/2 or STAT3 signal by specific 
inhibitors affected the expression of most genes, suggesting a pivotal role of 
the JAK1/2-STAT3 pathway in IFN-γ pro-survival effects in CLL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that IFN-γ regulates a complex pro-survival 
signal network in CLL through JAK1/2-STAT3, which provides a rational 
explanation for IFN-γ promoting CLL cells survival and drug resistance. This

342,"Three-dimensional nondestructive, nanoresolution, and in situ visualization of 
protein spatial localization in a large, thick single cell remains challenging. 
In this study, we designed a multifunctional iron oxide (Fe@BFK) nanoprobe that 
possesses fluorescence and hard X-ray imaging signals. This probe can 
specifically target the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein 
and help optimize the label condition and selection of suitable samples for 
X-ray imaging. Combining 30 nm resolution synchrotron radiation hard X-ray 
nanocomputed tomography and the X-ray-sensitive Fe@BFK nanoprobe, a 3D 
localization of HER2 on SK-BR-3 cells was obtained for the first time. HER2 was 
mainly localized and cluster-distributed on the cell membrane with a 
heterogeneous pattern. This study provides a novel method for the in situ and 
nondestructive synchrotron radiation imaging of the desired protein localization 
in large, thick cells and evaluation of the true cellular distribution of a 
nanoprobe with high resolution."
343,"PURPOSE: Uncertainty tolerance (UT) is increasingly valued as a medical graduate 
attribute, and broadly measured among medical student populations. However, the 
validity evidence underpinning UT scale implementation has not been summarised 
across studies. The present work evaluates UT scale validity evidence to better 
inform when, why, and how UT scales ought to be used, and to identify remaining 
validity evidence gaps.
METHODS: A literature search for psychometric studies of UT scales was completed 
in 2022. Records were included if they implemented one of the four most cited UT 
scales (i.e., Physicians' Reactions to Uncertainty scale 1990 (PRU1990) or 1995 
(PRU1995), Tolerance for Ambiguity scale (TFA), or Tolerance of Ambiguity in 
Medical Students and Doctors scale (TAMSAD)) in a population of physicians 
and/or medial students and presented validity evidence according to the 
Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing framework. Included studies 
were rated and analysed according to evidence for test content, response 
processes, internal structure, relations to other variables, and consequences of 
testing.
RESULTS: Among the investigated scales, 'relations to other variables' and 
'internal structure' were the most commonly reported forms of validity evidence. 
No evidence of 'response processes' or 'consequences of testing' was identified. 
Overall, the PRU1990 and PRU1995 demonstrated the strongest validity evidence, 
although evidence primarily related to physician populations.
CONCLUSIONS: None of the studied scales demonstrated evidence for all five 
sources of validity. Future research would benefit from assessing validity 
evidence for 'response processes' and 'consequences of testing' among physicians 
and medical students at different training/career stages to better understand UT 
construct conceptualisation in these populations. Until further and stronger 
validity evidence for UT scales is established, we caution against implementing 
UT scales outside of research settings (e.g., for higher stakes decision 
making)."

345,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening disorder that leads to the induction of 
inflammatory responses and organ failure. Phage therapy is a new approach to 
controlling infections resistant to common treatments, including sepsis. Several 
studies have shown the effect of lytic bacteriophages on infection control by 
reducing the bacterial load. The present study deals with lysogenic 
bacteriophage M13 on the inflammatory responses caused by cecal ligation and 
puncture (CLP) induced sepsis in a mouse model.
METHODS: Bacteriophage M13 harvested from ER2738, titrated, and confirmed by TEM 
analysis. In-vitro toxicity and immunomodulatory effect of bacteriophage M13 
were assessed on splenocytes by measurement of cell viability and the production 
level of cytokines, nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). For 
in-vivo experiments, eight weeks old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided 
into three groups: CLP + NS (treated with normal saline), CLP + M13 (treated 
with an intraperitoneal injection of 109 PFU/ml of bacteriophage M13), and sham+ 
NS (induced surgery but without ligation and puncture, treated with NS). The 
mice were sacrificed at different time points post-surgery (6,24,48, and 72, n = 
10 for each time point of each group). The kidney, liver, and lungs were 
harvested for histopathological analysis, and blood was obtained for cytokine 
and liver enzyme assay. The spleen was used to assess the bacterial load using 
colony forming unit (CFU) assay. The rectal temperature and survival were 
evaluated during the study.
RESULTS: According to the in-vitro results, 109 PFU/ml of bacteriophage M13 was 
not toxic and did not affect the level of cytokine, NO, and ROS production by 
splenocytes, but it reduced the inflammatory response of splenocytes in 
responses to LPS. In-vivo studies indicated that the amount of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, liver enzymes, bacterial load, and organ failure were decreased in 
the CLP + M13 group compared to CLP + NS, whereas the survival rate was 
increased.
CONCLUSION: These experiments demonstrated that bacteriophage M13 could lessen 
the consequences related to sepsis in CLP mice and can be considered a 
therapeutic approach in sepsis."
346,"The efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy is not as expected in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). YAP1 was overexpressed and activated in HCC. The mechanism of YAP1 in HCC 
immune escape is unclear. Anti-PD-1 treatment increased YAP1 expression in liver 
tumor cells, and exhausted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood and spleen of 
liver tumor mice. YAP1 knockdown suppressed PD-L1 expression, which was involved 
in JAK1/STAT1, 3 pathways. Moreover, Yap1 knockout elevated CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells in liver tumor niche. Consistently, verteporfin, YAP1 inhibitor, decreased 
TGF-β and IFN-γ in liver tumor niche and exhausted CD8+ T cell in the spleen. 
DHA suppressed YAP1 expression and break immune evasion in liver tumor niche, 
characterized by decreased PD-L1 in liver tumor cells and increased CD8+ T cell 
infiltration. Furthermore, DHA combined with anti-PD-1 treatment promoted CD4+ T 
cell infiltration in the spleen and CD8+ T cell in tumor tissues of mice. In 
summary, YAP1 knockdown in liver tumor cells suppressed PD-L1 expression and 
recruited cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), leading to break immune evasion in 
tumor niche. Mechanistically, YAP1 knockdown suppressed PD-L1 expression, which 
was involved in JAK1/STAT1, 3 pathways. Finally, DHA inhibited YAP1 expression, 
which not only inhibited liver tumor proliferation but also break the 
immunosuppressive niche in liver tumor tissues and improve the effect of 
anti-PD-1 therapy."
347,"BACKGROUND: Nuclear-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) molecules in blood plasma are 
nonrandomly fragmented, bearing a wealth of information related to tissues of 
origin. DNASE1L3 (deoxyribonuclease 1 like 3) is an important player in shaping 
the fragmentation of nuclear-derived cfDNA molecules, preferentially generating 
molecules with 5' ""CC"" dinucleotide termini (i.e., 5' CC-end motif). However, 
the fragment end properties of microbial cfDNA and its clinical implication 
remain to be explored.
METHODS: We performed end motif analysis on microbial cfDNA fragments in plasma 
samples from patients with sepsis. A sequence context-based normalization method 
was used to minimize the potential biases for end motif analysis.
RESULTS: The end motif profiles of microbial cfDNA appeared to resemble that of 
nuclear cfDNA (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.82, P value <0.001). The 
CC-end motif was the most preferred end motif in microbial cfDNA, suggesting 
that DNASE1L3 might also play a role in the fragmentation of microbe-derived 
cfDNA in plasma. Of note, differential end motifs were present between microbial 
cfDNA originating from infection-causing pathogens (enriched at the CC-end) and 
contaminating microbial DNA potentially derived from reagents or the environment 
(nearly random). The use of fragment end signatures allowed differentiation 
between confirmed pathogens and contaminating microbes, with an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99. The performance appeared to be 
superior to conventional analysis based on microbial cfDNA abundance alone.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of fragmentomic features could facilitate the 
differentiation of underlying contaminating microbes from true pathogens in 
sepsis. This work demonstrates the potential usefulness of microbial cfDNA 
fragmentomics in metagenomics analysis."
348,"Three-dimensional (3D) cultured tumor spheroid models, as one type of in vitro 
model, have been proven to have more physiological similarities to in vivo 
animal models than cells in 2D cultures. Tumor spheroids have been widely used 
in preclinical experiments of anticancer drug treatments, providing reliable 
data in pathogenetic research. Currently, different 3D cell culture conditions, 
even in the same cell line, generate heterogeneous spheroids in morphology and 
size, resulting in different growth rates or drug-killing responses. Therefore, 
the measurement and evaluation of the properties of tumor spheroids have become 
highly demanding tasks with huge challenges. For functional characterization of 
tumor spheroids, the microenvironment sensitivity and quantitative properties of 
the fluorescence lifetime microscopy imaging (FLIM) technique have great 
advantages for improving the reliability of cell physiological testing. In this 
paper, we have proposed a FLIM-based approach to observe the lipid components 
labeled with Nile red of cells in both 3D and 2D cultures. The imaging data and 
analysis provided basic information on the sizes, morphologies, and cell 
membrane fluorescence lifetime values of the tumor spheroids. FLIM data showed 
that the microenvironment of the cell membrane in the 3D model was largely 
altered compared to that in the 2D culture. Next, a series of parameters that 
may influence the lipid components of tumor cells and tumor spheroids were 
tested by FLIM, including pH, viscosity, and polarity. The results showed that 
pH and viscosity contributed little to the change in fluorescence lifetime 
values, while the change in cell membrane polarity was the main cause of the 
alterations in fluorescence lifetime data, suggesting that cell membrane 
polarity should be considered a marker in distinguishing tumor spheroids from 
cellular physiological status. In conclusion, this FLIM-based testing process 
has been proven to be a quantitative method for measuring the differences 
between the cells of the 3D model from the 2D cultured cells with satisfactory 
sensitivity and accuracy, providing a high potential standard assay in the 
quality evaluation and control of tumor spheroids for future anticancer drug 
development."
349,"The critical challenge for cancer vaccine-induced T-cell immunity is the 
sustained activation of antigen cross-presentation in antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, we first discover that the 
clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), 
markedly augment the type-I interferon (IFN-I) production profile of the STING 
agonist MSA-2, and achieve a 16-fold dosage-sparing effect in the human STING 
haplotype. We next co-assembled acid-ionizable copolymers with IONPs and MSA-2 
into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph 
nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model 
antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen 
cross-presentation to elicit a 55-fold greater frequency of antigen-specific 
CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine 
immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung 
metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is 
applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune 
checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and 
distant metastasis in B16-OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The 
acid-ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable 
strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross-presentation for 
personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy. This article is protected by

350,"INTRODUCTION: Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory 
condition characterized by sicca syndrome, musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue. 
Extra-glandular manifestations are common and there is a markedly increased risk 
of lymphoma development. SS is associated with high health-economic burden 
driven largely by the symptom burden on patients. Currently, there is no 
approved disease-modifying treatment and management is based on empirical 
evidence. Progress in the understanding of SS pathogenesis has led to an 
expanding portfolio of more targeted therapies under development.
AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the key development in targeted biological 
therapies in SS including emerging targets. It also highlights the challenges in 
therapeutic development in SS such as disease heterogeneity and defining 
appropriate disease assessment tools to evaluate therapeutic efficacy.
EXPERT OPINION: Early trials in SS failed to meet their primary outcomes which 
may in part due to the use of inappropriate or insensitive study endpoints. 
Recent trials targeting B-cells, B-T cell co-stimulation and IFN signaling have 
shown promising results. Development of composite endpoints including patient 
reported outcomes and objective disease measure may provide a more holistic 
approach to disease assessment. The impact of these new tools on therapeutic 
development that benefit patients remains to be fully evaluated."
351,"Aurein 1.2 (Aur), a highly efficient 13-residue antimicrobial peptide (AMP) with 
a broad-spectrum antibiotic activity originally derived from the Australian frog 
skin secretions, can nonspecifically disrupt bacterial membranes. To deeply 
understand the molecular-level detail of the antimicrobial mechanism, here, we 
artificially established comparative experimental models to investigate the 
interfacial interaction process between Aur and negatively charged model cell 
membranes via sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy. Sequencing the 
vibrational signals of phenyl, C-H, and amide groups from Aur has 
characteristically helped us differentiate between the initial adsorption and 
subsequent insertion steps upon mutual interaction between Aur and the charged 
lipids. The phenyl group at the terminal phenylalanine residue can act as an 
anchor in the adsorption process. The time-dependent signal intensity of 
α-helices showed a sharp rise once the Aur molecules came into contact with the 
negatively charged lipids, indicating that the adsorption process was ongoing. 
Insertion of Aur into the charged lipids then offered the detectable interfacial 
C-H signals from Aur. The achiral and chiral amide I signals suggest that Aur 
had formed β-folding-like aggregates after interacting with the charged lipids, 
along with the subsequent descending α-helical amide I signals. The 
above-mentioned experimental results provide the molecular-level detail on how 
the Aur molecules interact with the cell membranes, and such a mechanism study 
can offer the necessary support for the AMP design and later application."
352,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a 
cAMP-activated trans-membrane ATP gated anion channel present in most epithelia, 
which transports chloride and bicarbonate ions across the apical membrane. 
Mutations in the CFTR protein are known to result in defective expression or 
function, notably the inhibition of chloride and bicarbonate transport. This can 
result in cystic fibrosis (CF), a disorder characterised by thickness of the 
mucus lining of the epithelial cells of the alimentary and respiratory tracts, 
sweat ducts and reproductive organs. As a consequence, there is a reduction in 
fluid transport at the apical surface. While the most devastating effect of CF 
is mortality, about 98% of men with CF are infertile, consequent of early 
blockage of or failure to develop the mesonephrotic ducts as well as the vas 
deferens. The effect of CF of female fertility is less well-understood. This 
review highlights the genetics and pathophysiology as well as the mechanism of 
action of CF on female infertility."
353,"OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is rare heterogeneous disorder 
characterized by red blood cell (RBC) destruction via auto-antibodies, and after 
RBC is destroyed, proinflammatory danger-associated molecular patterns including 
extracellular hemoglobin, heme, and iron which causing cell injury. And 
oxidative stress represents one of the most significant effects of chronic 
hemolysis. Jianpishengxue keli can improve the symptoms of anemia patients with 
kidney disease and tumors and are beneficial in promoting recovery from chronic 
inflammation. Therefore, it is presumed that Jianpishengxue keli can improve the 
symptoms of AIHA. We aimed to investigate iron metabolism in AIHA and effects of 
Jianpishengxue keli on AIHA murine model.
METHODS: Nineteen hemolytic episode AIHA patients, 10 remission patients and 10 
healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Serum hepcidin, ferritin and 
other related indicators of iron metabolism were measured. Mouse models of AIHA 
were established and received high, medium, or low doses of Jianpishengxue keli 
by gavage daily for 14 and 28 days respectively. The level of RBCs, Hb, 
bilirubin, LDH, hepcidin, and the expression level of hepcidin mRNA, and hepatic 
ferroportin 1(FPN1) protein were evaluated.
RESULTS: Serum hepcidin in hemolytic episode AIHA patients and remission 
patients were significantly higher than that in HCs (p = 0.0083 and p = 0.0473, 
respectively). Serum ferritin in hemolytic AIHA patients was significantly 
higher than that in HCs (p = 0.008). Serum transferrin saturation levels are 
increased in patients with AIHA[ (57.21 ± 8.96) %]. EPO in hemolytic group was 
higher than that in healthy control (p＜0.05). In AIHA mouse models, IBIL 
decreased after 14 days of high dose drug intervention. After 28 days, TBIL and 
IBIL both significantly decreased in all dose groups and LDH significantly 
decreased in the medium-and high-dose groups. Body weight improved, and the 
level of RBCs, Hb and hepcidin in the high-dose group returned to normal. After 
14 and 28 days of intervention, hepatic hepcidin mRNA in all dose group 
significantly decreased. Hepatic FPN1 protein which were significantly lower in 
the AIHA mouse models, increased in all dose groups after drug intervention for 
28 days.
CONCLUSION: Iron metabolism abnormalities exists in AIHA patients and 
Jianpishengxue keli can ameliorate hemolysis and improve iron metabolism in AIHA 
mouse models.KEY MESSAGESIron metabolism abnormalities exists in hemolytic

354,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
cognitive impairment so widespread that it interferes with a person's ability to 
complete daily activities. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming increasingly 
common and it is estimated that the number of patients will reach 152 million by 
2050. Current treatment options for AD are symptomatic and have modest benefits. 
Therefore, considering the human, social and economic burden of the disease, the 
development of drugs with the potential to alter disease progression has become 
a global priority. In this review, the molecular mechanisms involved in the 
pathology of AD were evaluated as therapeutic targets. The main aim of the 
review is to focus on new knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative 
stress, and neuronal transmission in AD, as well as a range of cellular 
signaling mechanisms and associated treatments. Important molecular interactions 
leading to AD were described in amyloid cascade and in tau protein function, 
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholinergic and glutamatergic 
neurotransmission, cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein (CREB), the silent 
mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT-1), neuroinflammation 
(glial cells), and synaptic alterations. This review summarizes recent 
experimental and clinical research in AD pathology and analyzes the potential of 
therapeutic applications based on molecular disease mechanisms."
355,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).
METHODS: This retrospective study assessed adherence to prescribed enoxaparin 
for VTE prophylaxis in adults with SCD while hospitalized. A total of 172 
encounters of 72 unique patients were evaluated between 1 January and 31 
December 2019. Patients were grouped based on adherence to prescribed 
enoxaparin. Group 1 received 100% of doses ordered. Group 2 received between 99% 
and 1% of doses ordered. Group 3 received 0% of doses ordered.
RESULTS: Only 45 encounters (32.3%) received 100% of ordered doses and 81 
encounters (47%) did not receive any of the ordered enoxaparin doses. In total, 
only 37% of all prescribed enoxaparin doses were administered to patients.
CONCLUSION: This low level of administered enoxaparin is concerning in a patient 
population at an increased risk for VTE. VTE prophylaxis adherence needs to be 
addressed with each admission and, if appropriate, alterative options to 
enoxaparin should be considered."
356,"Enteric bacterial infections contribute substantially to global disease burden 
and mortality, particularly in the developing world. In vitro 2D monolayer 
cultures have provided critical insights into the fundamental virulence 
mechanisms of a multitude of pathogens, including Salmonella enterica serovars 
Typhimurium and Typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella spp., Escherichia coli and 
Campylobacter jejuni, which have led to the identification of novel targets for 
antimicrobial therapy and vaccines. In recent years, the arsenal of experimental 
systems to study intestinal infections has been expanded by a multitude of more 
complex models, which have allowed to evaluate the effects of additional 
physiological and biological parameters on infectivity. Organoids recapitulate 
the cellular complexity of the human intestinal epithelium while 3D 
bioengineered scaffolds and microphysiological devices allow to emulate oxygen 
gradients, flow and peristalsis, as well as the formation and maintenance of 
stable and physiologically relevant microbial diversity. Additionally, 
advancements in ex vivo cultures and intravital imaging have opened new 
possibilities to study the effects of enteric pathogens on fluid secretion, 
barrier integrity and immune cell surveillance in the intact intestine. This 
review aims to present a balanced and updated overview of current intestinal in 
vitro and ex vivo methods for modeling of enteric bacterial infections. We 
conclude that the different paradigms are complements rather than replacements 
and their combined use promises to further our understanding of host-microbe 
interactions and their impacts on intestinal health."
357,"Carbon dots (CDs), because of their characteristic size (<10 nm) and highly 
fluorescent nature, can be internalized in biological cells or can be tagged to 
the key components of a living system. While these attributes can be potentially 
exploited for biomedical applications, the toxicity of CDs remains an important 
issue to be addressed. Both the synthesis approach and morphological attributes 
critically determine the dose-dependent toxicity and cytocompatibility of CDs. 
Against this perspective, we report herein a one-step colloidal synthesis of CDs 
using different reaction solvents that lead to the formation of three types of 
CDs (type I, type II, and type III CDs). The cytocompatibility and cellular 
uptake of CDs in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are dependent on the 
nature of functionalization and concomitantly on the type of precursors. In 
particular, type I CDs are synthesized using citric acid, hexadecylamine, and 
octadecene that are immiscible in culture media. The type II CDs synthesized 
using citric acid and octadecene emit green fluorescence at a 488 nm excitation 
and were found to be agglomerated when internalized in hMSCs, whereas the type 
III CDs, synthesized using citric acid and deionized water, exhibit an 
agglomeration-free behavior. Further, type III CDs show a wide particle 
distribution, wide emission bandwidth range of 280-700 nm, threshold toxicity of 
1 mg/mL, and good cytocompatibility with hMSCs, much better than those in the 
published reports. When benchmarked against commercial graphene quantum dots, 
the as-synthesized type III CDs have better electrical conductivity and 
cytocompatibility at a given dosage. Thus, the electroactive nature of 
synthesized type III CDs along with their inherent fluorescent property and less 
cytotoxicity would enable their potential applications in bio-imaging, 
directional lineage commitment, and cell-based therapy."
358,"Electrolysis of water is a sustainable route to produce clean hydrogen. Full 
water-splitting requires a high applied potential, in part because of the 
pH-dependency of the H2 and O2 evolution reactions. The HER and OER are 
proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions; therefore, the minimum 
required potential will not change at different pHs. TEMPO, a stable 
free-radical that undergoes fast electro-oxidation by a single-electron transfer 
(ET) process, is pH-independent. Here, we show that the combination of PCET and 
ET processes enables hydrogen production from water at low cell potentials below 
the theoretical value for full water-splitting by simple pH adjustment. As a 
case study, we combined the HER with the oxidation of benzylamine by anodically 
oxidized TEMPO. The pH-independent electrocatalytic oxidation of TEMPO permits 
the operation of a hybrid water-splitting cell that shows promise to perform a 
low cell potential (~1 V) and neutral pH conditions."
359,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vitamin A is vital for the growth and health of 
children. This study aimed to estimate the current vitamin A status and the 
prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) among preschool children and explore 
the correlation between serum vitamin A concentration and changes in 
hematological parameters.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: The study included 697 children aged 1-6 years, 
presenting for routine checkups at the Department of Pediatrics, Peking 
University Shougang Hospital, Beijing, from April 2017 to December 2020. We 
obtained the complete laboratory test data of 630 children.
RESULTS: The mean serum vitamin A concentration among preschool children was 
0.29±0.08 mg/L, with a median of 0.29 mg/L. The proportion of children with VAD 
and marginal VAD (MVAD) was 9.84% and 43.49%, respectively. The highest 
prevalence of VAD and MVAD was in the 3- to 4-year age group. Compared with the 
normal vitamin A serum concentration group, other groups had lower mean 
corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration, and higher red blood cell distribution width. The mean serum 
vitamin A concentration among anemic children was significantly lower (0.27±0.07 
mg/L) than among those children who were not anemic (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: VAD constitutes a public health problem in northern China. The 
prevalence of VAD is highest, and the serum vitamin A concentration was the 
lowest among preschool children aged 3-4 years. Vitamin A serum concentration 
was associated with red blood cell indices. We should attach more importance to 
those children aged 3-4 years."
360,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate independent risk 
factors for intra-abdominal infection and to construct a nomogram to identify 
colorectal patients at a high risk of intra-abdominal infection.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Clinical data of patients undergoing radical resection 
of colorectal cancer from January 2019 to December 2021 were retrospectively 
included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to 
postoperative intra-abdominal infection. Clinicopathological indicators, 
intraoperative conditions, and postoperative complications were compared between 
the two groups, logistic regression was used to look for independent risk 
factors for intra-abdominal infection, and a nomogram was constructed based on 
independent risk factors.
RESULTS: 402 colorectal cancer patients were enrolled in this study, and 46 
patients (11.4%) developed intra- abdominal infections after surgery. The 
independent risk factors for intra-abdominal infection were preoperative 
albumin, lymphocyte-white cell ratio (LWR) <0.17, low subcutaneous fat mass, and 
low skeletal muscle mass. The nomogram model for intra-abdominal infection was 
able to reliably quantify the risk of intraabdominal infection with strong 
optimism-adjusted discrimination (concordance index=0.931). Furthermore, 
decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram was clinically useful and had a 
better discriminative ability to recognize patients at high risk than the risk 
factors alone.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found that preoperative albumin, LWR <0.17, low 
subcutaneous fat mass, and low skeletal muscle mass were significantly 
correlated with intra-abdominal infection. Our nomogram was a simple and 
practical instrument to quantify the individual risk of intra-abdominal 
infection."

362,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder causing demyelination and 
neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. MS is characterized by 
disturbed motor performance and cognitive impairment. Current MS treatments 
delay disease progression and reduce relapse rates with general 
immunomodulation, yet curative therapies are still lacking. Regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) are able to suppress autoreactive immune cells, which drive MS 
pathology. However, Tregs are functionally impaired in people with MS. 
Interestingly, Tregs were recently reported to also have regenerative capacity. 
Therefore, experts agree that Treg cell therapy has the potential to ameliorate 
the disease. However, to perform their local anti-inflammatory and regenerative 
functions in the brain, they must first migrate across the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB). This review summarizes the reported results concerning the migration of 
Tregs across the BBB and the influence of Tregs on migration of other immune 
subsets. Finally, their therapeutic potential is discussed in the context of MS."
363,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic endocrine disease that occurs mostly in the state 
of hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose level). In the recent times, diabetes 
is listed under world's utmost critical health issues. Wound treatment 
procedures are complicated in diabetic individuals all over the world. Diabetic 
wound care not only involves high-cost, but also the primary cause of 
hospitalization, which can lead to amputation thereby reducing diabetic patient 
life expectancy. To lower the risk of amputation, wound healing requires the 
development of effective treatments. Traditional management systems for Diabetes 
are frequently chastised due to their high costs, difficulties in maintaining a 
sustainable supply chain and limited disposal alternatives. The worrisome rise 
in diabetes prevalence has sparked a surge of interest in the discovery of 
viable remedies to supplement existing treatments. Nanomaterials wound healing 
has a lot of potential for treating and preventing wound infections and it has 
recently gained popularity owing to its ability to transport drugs to the wound 
area in a regulated fashion, potentially overpowering the limits of traditional 
approaches. This research assessed several nanosystems, such as nanocarriers and 
nanotherapeutics, to explore how they can benefit in diabetic wound healing, 
with a focus on current obstacles and future prospects."
364,"Disruption of the intestinal mucus barrier and intestinal epithelial endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress contribute to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Previously, 
we observed intestinal goblet cell loss and increased intestinal epithelial ER 
stress following chorioamnionitis. Here, we investigated how chorioamnionitis 
affects goblet cells by assessing their cellular characteristics. Importantly, 
goblet cell features are compared with those in clinical NEC biopsies. Mucus 
thickness was assessed as read-out of goblet cell function. Fetal lambs were 
intra-amniotically (IA) infected for 7d at 122 gestational age with Ureaplasma 
parvum serovar-3, the main microorganism clinically associated with 
chorioamnionitis. After preterm delivery, mucus thickness, goblet cell numbers, 
gut inflammation, epithelial proliferation and apoptosis and intestinal 
epithelial ER stress were investigated in the terminal ileum. Next, goblet cell 
morphological alterations (TEM) were studied and compared to human NEC samples. 
Ileal mucus thickness and goblet cell numbers were elevated following IA UP 
exposure. Increased pro-apoptotic ER stress, detected by elevated CHOP-positive 
cell counts and disrupted organelle morphology of secretory cells in the 
intestinal epithelium, was observed in IA UP exposed animals. Importantly, 
comparable cellular morphological alterations were observed in the ileum from 
NEC patients. In conclusion, UP-driven chorioamnionitis leads to a thickened 
ileal mucus layer and mucus hypersecretion from goblet cells. Since this was 
associated with pro-apoptotic ER stress and organelle disruption, mucus barrier 
alterations seem to occur at the expense of goblet cell resilience and may 
therefore predispose to detrimental intestinal outcomes. The remarkable overlap 
of these in utero findings with observations in NEC patients underscores their 
clinical relevance."
365,"CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) enables programmable, reversible, and titratable 
repression of gene expression (knockdown) in mammalian cells. Initial 
CRISPRi-mediated genetic screens have showcased the potential to address basic 
questions in cell biology, genetics, and biotechnology, but wider deployment of 
CRISPRi screening has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA 
(sgRNA) libraries and challenges in generating cell models with consistent 
CRISPRi-mediated knockdown. Here, we present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA 
libraries and effector expression constructs that enable strong and consistent 
knockdown across mammalian cell models. First, we combine empirical sgRNA 
selection with a dual-sgRNA library design to generate an ultra-compact (1-3 
elements per gene), highly active CRISPRi sgRNA library. Next, we compare 
CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides an 
excellent balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal nonspecific 
effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally, we engineer a suite of 
cell lines with stable expression of Zim3-dCas9 and robust on-target knockdown. 
Our results and publicly available reagents establish best practices for CRISPRi

366,"Cancer evolution is explained by accumulation of driver mutations and subsequent 
positive selection by acquired growth advantages like Darwin evolution. However, 
it has not yet been fully investigated whether negative selection of cells that 
have lost malignant properties contributes to cancer progression. Using 
intestinal metastatic tumor-derived organoids carrying Apc, Kras, Tgfbr2, and 
Trp53 quadruple mutations, we show here that approximately 30% of subclones of 
the organoids show loss of metastatic ability to the liver, while keeping the 
driver mutations and oncogenic pathways. Notably, highly metastatic subclones 
also showed gradual loss of metastatic ability during further passages. Such 
non-metastatic subclones showed significantly decreased survival and 
proliferation ability in Matrigel and collagen gel culture conditions, which may 
cause elimination from the tumor tissues in vivo. RNA sequencing indicated that 
stemness-related genes including Lgr5 and Myb were significantly downregulated 
in non-metastatic subclones as well as subclones that lost metastatic ability 
during additional passages. Furthermore, a CGH analysis showed that 
non-metastatic subclones were derived from minor population of parental organoid 
cells. These results indicate that metastatic ability is continuously lost with 
decreased stem cell property in certain subpopulations of malignant tumors, and 
such subpopulations are eliminated by negative selection. Therefore, it is 
possible that cancer evolution is regulated not only by positive selection but 
by negative selection. The mechanism underlying the loss of metastatic ability 
will be an important for future development of therapeutic strategies against 
metastasis."
367,"Objectives: The high-salt diet (HSD) has been associated with cognitive 
dysfunction by attacking the cerebral microvasculature, through an adaptive 
response, initiated in the intestine and mediated by Th17 cells. In the animal 
model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 
(EAE), it has been described that NaCl causes an increase in T cell infiltration 
in the central nervous system. NaCl also promotes macrophage response and Th17 
cell differentiation, worsening the course of the disease. HSD may trigger an 
activation of the immune system and enhance inflammation. However, certain 
studies not only do not support this possibility, but support the opposite, as 
the effect of salt on immune cells may not necessarily be pathogenic. Therefore, 
this study aimed to evaluate the effect of an over intake of salt in rats with 
EAE, based on the clinical course, oxidative stress, markers of inflammation and 
the gut dysbiosis.Methods: 15 Dark Agouti rats were used, which were divided 
into control group, EAE group and EAE + NaCl group. Daily 0.027 g of NaCl 
dissolved in 300 μl of H2O was administered through a nasogastric tube for 51 
days.Results: NaCl administration produced an improvement in clinical status and 
a decrease in biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
dysbiosis.Conclusion: The underlying mechanism by which NaCl causes these 
effects could involve the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is 
blocked by high doses of salt."
368,"The association between cholesterol metabolism and cancer development and 
progression has been recently highlighted. However, the role and function of 
many cholesterol transporters remain largely unknown. Herein, we focused on 
ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 9 (ABCA9) transporter given that its 
expression is significantly downregulated in both canine mammary tumors and 
human breast cancers, which in breast cancer patients correlates with poor 
prognosis. We found that ABCA9 is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) and is responsible for promoting cholesterol accumulation in this 
structure. Accordingly, ABCA9 inhibited sterol-regulatory element binding 
protein-2 (SREBP-2) translocation from the ER to the nucleus, a crucial step for 
cholesterol synthesis, resulting in the downregulation of cholesterol synthesis 
gene expression. ABCA9 expression in breast cancer cells attenuated cell 
proliferation and reduced their colony-forming abilities. We identified ABCA9 
expression to be regulated by Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). Inhibition of PI3K 
induced enhanced ABCA9 expression through the activation of PI3K-Akt-FOXO1 
pathway in breast cancer cells. Altogether, our study suggests that ABCA9 
functions as an ER cholesterol transporter that suppresses cholesterol synthesis 
via the inhibition of SREBP-2 signaling and that its restoration halts breast 
cancer cell proliferation. Our findings provide novel insight into a vital role 
of ABCA9 in breast cancer progression."
369,"Onosma hookeri Clarke. var. longiforum Duthie (OHC-LD), one of the traditional 
Tibetan medicine, has been found many functions, including removing heat to cool

polysaccharides in OHC-LD water extract, the optimal extraction progress of 
polysaccharides of the roots of OHC-LD by response surface method designed with 
three-factor three-level Box-Behnken method and the antioxidant capacity and 
immune activity of the crude polysaccharide were studied in this investigation. 
Under the best conditions, the extraction yield of polysaccharide was 3.19±0.09% 
(n = 3). After purification, the crude polysaccharide was obtained with 
polysaccharide contents of 42.57%, which demonstrated stronger DPPH scavenging 
activity than BHT at low concentrations (<625 µg/mL), and comparable ABTS 
radical scavenging activity as BHT at high concentrations (≥1250 µg/mL). 
Additionally, it also exhibited a certain cell proliferation activity and an 
enhancement of the phagocytic ability of RAW264.7 cells. This study revealed 
that the crude polysaccharide from the roots of OHC-LD might be exploited as a 
natural antioxidant and immune enhance agent in the future in both medical and 
food industry."
370,"Macroautophagy/autophagy, a cellular process that sequesters and breaks down 
cellular components in the lysosome/vacuole, is important in various events 
where cell composition undergoes changes. Broadly, autophagy is involved in T 
cell regulation including maintaining cell homeostasis. One process where a cell 
alters its composition is in the activation of helper T cells in the immune 
system. When helper (CD4+) T cells are activated by antigens, they both grow and 
alter their cellular components to become effector T cells. Autophagy is the 
process that facilitates the breakdown of these cellular components and is 
therefore hypothesized to have a role in CD4+ T cell activation. Previous 
research has concluded that CD4+ T cell activation induces autophagy, providing 
an avenue for further research towards examining the ways in which this induced 
autophagy affects CD4+ T cell proliferation and function. Towards this end, Zhou 
et al. researched the autophagosomal cargo present within CD4+ T cells and the 
impact this cargo has on CD4+ T cell proliferation."
371,"Resistance to anti-cancer therapy is a major challenge for cancer treatment. 
Many studies revealed that macroautophagy/autophagy inhibition can overcome 
autophagy-mediated therapy resistance, but these efforts have not yet led to the 
success of clinical applications. In a recent paper, we established a 37-gene 
autophagy signature to estimate the autophagy status of approximately 10,000 
tumor samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and 
muti-omics characterization reveals that autophagy induction may also sensitize 
cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. These findings provide a comprehensive 
resource of molecular alterations associated with autophagy and highlight the 
potential to utilize drug sensitivity induced by autophagy to overcome the 
resistance of cancer therapy."
372,"BACKGROUND: Progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients who 
received avelumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib as first-line treatment for 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) in a randomized phase III trial. We report 
long-term safety and efficacy of avelumab plus axitinib as first-line treatment 
for patients with aRCC from the JAVELIN Renal 100 phase Ib trial (NCT02493751).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, phase Ib study, patients 
with untreated aRCC received avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus axitinib 5 mg 
twice daily or with axitinib for 7 days followed by avelumab plus axitinib. 
Safety and efficacy were assessed in all patients receiving at least one dose of 
avelumab or axitinib.
RESULTS: Overall, 55 patients were enrolled and treated. Median follow-up was 
55.7 months (95% CI, 54.5-58.7). Treatment-related adverse events of any grade 
or grade ≥3 occurred in 54 (98.2%) and 34 (61.8%) patients, respectively. The 
confirmed objective response rate was 60.0% (95% CI, 45.9-73.0), including 
complete response in 10.9% of patients. Median duration of response was 35.9 
months (95% CI, 12.7-52.9); the probability of response was 65.8% (95% CI, 
46.7-79.4) at 2 years. Median progression-free survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 
5.3-32.0). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI, 40.8-not estimable); 
the 5-year overall survival rate was 57.3% (95% CI, 41.2-70.5).
CONCLUSION: Five-year follow-up for combination treatment with avelumab plus 
axitinib in previously untreated patients with aRCC showed long-term clinical 
activity with no new safety signals, supporting use of this regimen within its 
approved indication in clinical practice (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02493751)."
373,"The family protein of cyclins, as well as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 
cooperating with them, are broadly researched, as a matter of their dysfunction 
may lead to tumor transformation. Cyclins are defined as key regulators that 
have a controlling function of the mammalian nuclear cell divides. Cyclin Y 
(CCNY) is a recently characterized member of the cyclin family and was first 
identified from the human testis cDNA library. It is an actin-binding protein 
acting through decreased actin dynamics at a steady state and during 
glycine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and involves the inhibition of 
cofilin activation. What is more, CCNY is a positive regulatory subunit of the 
CDK14/PFTK1 complexes affected by the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in 
the G2/M phase by recruiting CDK14/PFTK1 to the plasma membrane and promoting 
phosphorylation of LRP6. The expression of CCNY has been significantly mentioned 
within the cell migration and invasion activity both in vivo and in vitro. The 
aim of this review is evaluation of the expression of CCNY in the physiology 
processes and compare the expression of this protein in cancer cells, taking 
into account the impact of the level of expression on tumor progression."
374,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effect of neonatal treatment with 
kaempferol on neuromotor development, proliferation of neural precursor cells, 
the microglia profile, and antioxidant enzyme gene expression in the 
hippocampus.
METHODS: A rat model of cerebral palsy was established using perinatal anoxia 
and sensorimotor restriction of hindlimbs during infancy. Kaempferol (1 mg/ kg) 
was intraperitoneally administered during the neonatal period.
RESULTS: Neonatal treatment with kaempferol reduces the impact of the cerebral 
palsy model on reflex ontogeny and on the maturation of physical features. 
Impairment of locomotor activity development and motor coordination was found to 
be attenuated by kaempferol treatment during the neonatal period in rats exposed 
to cerebral palsy. Neonatal treatment of kaempferol in cerebral palsy rats 
prevents a substantial reduction in the number of neural precursor cells in the 
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, an activated microglia profile, and increased 
proliferation of microglia in the sub-granular zone and in the granular cell 
layer. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol increases gene expression of 
superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the 
cerebral palsy model.
DISCUSSION: Kaempferol attenuates the impact of cerebral palsy on neuromotor 
behavior development, preventing altered hippocampal microglia activation and 
mitigating impaired cell proliferation in a neurogenic niche in these rats. 
Neonatal treatment with kaempferol also increases antioxidant defense gene 
expression in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model."
375,"L. monocytogenes is a widely used infection model for the research on 
pathogenesis and host defense against gram-positive intracellular bacteria. 
Emerging evidence indicates that posttranslational modifications play a critical 
role in the regulation of macroautophagy/autophagy. However, little is known 
about the posttranslational modifications of ATG7, the essential protein in the 
autophagy process. In this study, we demonstrated that the RING-type E3 ligase 
TRIM7/RNF90 positively regulated autophagosome accumulation by promoting the 
ubiquitination of ATG7 at K413, thereby affecting L. monocytogenes infection. 
TRIM7 expression was induced by a variety range of conditions, including 
starvation, rapamycin stimulation, and L. monocytogenes infection. TRIM7 
deficiency in mice or cells resulted in elevated innate immune responses and 
increased L. monocytogenes infection. ATG7 was associated with TRIM7 and the 
positive regulatory role of TRIM7 in L. monocytogenes infection-, starvation- or 
rapamycin-induced autophagosome accumulation was suggested by TRIM7 deficiency, 
TRIM7 overexpression, and TRIM7 knockdown. Further mechanistic investigation 
indicated that TRIM7 promoted the K63-linked ubiquitination of ATG7 at K413 and 
ubiquitination at this site was required for the function of ATG7 in autophagy 
and L. monocytogenes infection. Thus, our findings suggested a new regulator in 
intracellular bacterial infection and autophagy, with a novel posttranslational 
modification targeting ATG7. This research may expand our understanding of host 
anti-bacterial defense and the role of autophagy in intracellular bacterial 
infection."
376,"Cell size control is one of the prerequisites for plant growth and development. 
Recently, a GRAS family transcription factor, SCARECROW-LIKE28 (SCL28), was 
identified as a critical regulator for both mitotic and postmitotic cell-size 
control. Here, we show that SCL28 is specifically expressed in proliferating 
cells and exerts its function to delay G2 progression during mitotic cell cycle 
in Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpression of SCL28 provokes a significant 
enlargement of cells in various organs and tissues, such as leaves, flowers and 
seeds, to different extents depending on the type of cells. The increased cell 
size is most likely due to a delayed G2 progression and accelerated onset of 
endoreplication, an atypical cell cycle repeating DNA replication without 
cytokinesis or mitosis. Unlike DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING, a rice ortholog of 
SCL28, SCL28 may not have a role in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling because 
sensitivity against brassinazole, a BR biosynthesis inhibitor, was not 
dramatically altered in scl28 mutant and SCL28-overexpressing plants. 
Collectively, our findings strengthen a recently proposed model of cell size 
control by SCL28 and suggest the presence of diversified evolutionary mechanisms 
for the regulation and action of SCL28."

378,"BACKGROUND: Renal tubular injury is the main feature of diabetic nephropathy 
(DN). We intend to investigate the function and related mechanisms of lncRNA 
SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT) in high glucose (HG)-induced oxidative 
stress and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs).
METHODS: To construct diabetes models, the human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells were 
treated with HG (30 mM), and mice were injected with streptozotocin. The levels 
of intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed 
by dihydroethidium staining and MitoSox staining. The cell apoptosis was 
assessed by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Levels of serum creatinine, blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), Urinary ACR, and oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2' 
-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were detected by relevant kits. In addition, 
fluorescence in situ hybridization staining, RNA-pull down, RNA 
immunoprecipitation (RIP), co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), dual-luciferase 
reporter gene assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) were also 
executed.
RESULTS: Levels of SOX2OT and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) were 
down-regulated in HG-cultured HK-2 cells. Overexpressing SOX2OT reduced 
intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels and cell apoptosis in vitro. 
Moreover, SOX2OT overexpression also reduced serum creatinine, BUN, urinary ACR, 
8-OHdG, renal tubular injury markers KIM1 and NGAL, ROS levels, and cell 
apoptosis in vivo. In addition, SOX2OT promoted SIRT1 expression by suppressing 
its ubiquitination. Besides, interference with SIRT1 reversed the inhibitory 
effect of SOX2OT overexpression on HG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. 
Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) levels were up-regulated in HG-cultured HK-2 cells. 
Foxa2 could bind to the SOX2OT promoter and suppress its expression. 
Furthermore, interfering with SOX2OT reversed the inhibitory effect of Foxa2 
interference on HG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Foxa2-mediated SOX2OT up-regulation reduced oxidative stress and 
apoptosis of RTECs by promoting SIRT1 expression, thus alleviating the 
progression of DN. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
379,"The tiger, a poster child for conservation, remains an endangered apex predator. 
Continued survival and recovery will require a comprehensive understanding of 
genetic diversity and the use of such information for population management. A 
high-quality tiger genome assembly will be an important tool for conservation 
genetics, especially for the Indian tiger, the most abundant subspecies in the 
wild. Here, we present high-quality near-chromosomal genome assemblies of a 
female and a male wild Indian tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). Our assemblies had 
a scaffold N50 of >140 Mb, with 19  scaffolds corresponding to the 19 numbered 
chromosomes, containing 95% of the genome. Our assemblies also enabled detection 
of longer stretches of runs of homozygosity compared to previous assemblies, 
which will help improve estimates of genomic inbreeding. Comprehensive genome 
annotation identified 26,068 protein-coding genes, including several gene 
families involved in key morphological features such as the teeth, claws, 
vision, olfaction, taste, and body stripes. We also identified 301 microRNAs, 
365 small nucleolar RNAs, 632 transfer RNAs, and other noncoding RNA elements, 
several of which are predicted to regulate key biological pathways that likely 
contribute to the tiger's apex predatory traits. We identify signatures of 
positive selection in the tiger genome that are consistent with the Panthera 
lineage. Our high-quality genome will enable use of noninvasive samples for 
comprehensive assessment of genetic diversity, thus supporting effective 
conservation and management of wild tiger populations."
380,"Human lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is an anaerobic glycolytic enzyme involved 
in the inter-conversion of pyruvate to lactate. The level of LDHA in various 
types of cancer cells is found to be elevated and the dependence of cancer cells 
on anaerobic glycolysis is viewed as the reason for this elevation. Moreover, 
inhibition of LDHA activity has been shown to be effective in impairing the 
growth of tumors, making the LDHA as a potential target for cancer therapy. In 
this computational study, we have performed a pharmacophore based screening of 
approved drugs followed by a molecular docking based screening to find a few 
potential LDHA inhibitors. Molecular dynamics simulations have also been 
performed to examine the stability of the LDHA-drug complexes as obtained from 
the docking study. The result of the study showed that darunavir, moxalactam and 
eprosartan can bind to the active site of LDHA with high affinity in comparison 
to two known synthetic inhibitors of LDHA. The results of the molecular dynamics 
simulation showed that these drugs can bind stably with the enzyme through 
hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. Hence, it is concluded that 
darunavir, moxalactam and eprosartan may be considered as potential inhibitors 
of LDHA and can be used for cancer therapy after proper validation of their 
effectiveness through in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials.Communicated by

spliced giving rise to one long and three short isoforms. Two different 
homozygous, truncating variants in EEF1D had been associated with severe 
intellectual disability and microcephaly in two families. The published variants 
only affect the long isoform of EEF1D that acts as a transcription factor of 
heat shock element proteins. By exome sequencing, we identified two different 
homozygous variants in EEF1D in two families with severe developmental delay, 
severe microcephaly, spasticity, and failure to thrive with optic atrophy, poor 
feeding, and recurrent aspiration pneumonias. The EEF1D variants of this study 
are localized in the C-terminal GEF domain suggesting that a disturbed protein 
translation machinery might contribute to the neurodevelopmental phenotype. 
Pathogenic variants localized in both the alternatively spliced domain or in the 
GEF domain of EEF1D cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly 
and spasticity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
382,"Cancer immunotherapy agents fight cancer via immune system stimulation and have 
made significant advances in minimizing side effects and prolonging the survival 
of patients with solid tumors. However, major limitations still exist in cancer 
immunotherapy, including the inefficiency of immune response stimulation in 
specific cancer types, therapy resistance caused by the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), toxicities by the immune imbalance, and short lifetime of stimulator of 
interferon genes (STING) agonist. Recent advances in nanomedicine have shown 
significant potential in overcoming the obstacles of cancer immunotherapy. 
Several nanoscale agents have been reported for cancer immunotherapy, including 
nanoscale cancer vaccines impacting the STING pathway, nanomaterials 
reprogramming TME, nano-agents triggering immune response with immune checkpoint 
inhibitor synergy, ferroptosis-mediated and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 
immunosuppression-mediated cancer immunotherapy, and nanomedicine-meditated 
chimeric antigen receptor-T-cell therapy. Herein, we summarize the major 
advances and innovations in nanomedicine-based cancer immunotherapy, and outline 
the opportunities and challenges to integrate more advanced nanomaterials into 
cancer immunotherapy. This article is categorized under: Nanotechnology

383,"OBJECTIVE: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although it is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous 
disease, it is usually treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Here, we aimed to 
investigate gene expression frequency with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and 
the relation of gene mutations with remission and relapse status in patients 
with DLBCLs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated gene mutation profiles by NGS in patients 
with DLBCL-NOS and analyzed the correlation between gene mutations and response 
and relapse rates and other clinical indices.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight of forty patients were evaluated. The most commonly 
mutated genes were ANKRD, BRCA1, BRCA2, EZH2, KMTC2, MYC, MYD88, NF1, NOTCH1, 
PMS2, PTEN, and WRN. The relapse rate was found higher in DLBCL patients with 
ANKRD26, BRCA2, MYD88, and NOTCH1 mutations. Also, remission duration was found 
shorter in patients with ANKRD26, BRCA2, and MYD88 mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the presence of some genetic mutations 
is effective on prognosis in patients with DLBCL. NGS-based evaluation of DLBCL 
treatment can be used in the future."
384,"INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Hypernatremia myopathy is a rare disease often unrecognized 
by clinicians. This study aimed to present a case series of hypernatremic 
myopathy with an emphasis on profiling its clinical characteristics and 
exploring its pathogenesis.
METHODS: We reviewed seven patients with hypernatremic myopathy and reported 
their demographic data, etiology, clinical manifestations, laboratory and 
electrophysiological characteristics. A muscle biopsy was performed on one 
patient.
RESULTS: All patients had hypothalamic lesions as the cause of the hypernatremia 
including craniopharyngioma, germinoma, pituitary adenoma, Langerhans cell 
histiocytosis, and glioma. The clinical manifestations varied from mild weakness 
to complete paralysis. Myalgia and muscle cramps were also observed. Four of the 
patients had rhabdomyolysis on admission and developed acute kidney injury. All 
patients had markedly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) and sodium levels. 
There was a significant positive correlation between serum sodium and CK levels. 
A high prevalence of hypopituitarism in different axes was observed in our 
study. Central hypogonadism (5/7), central hypothyroidism (3/7), and central 
diabetes insipidus (3/7) were the most common manifestations of hypothalamic 
dysfunction. Myopathic changes were observed on needle electromyography. The 
muscle biopsy of one patient showed diffuse necrotic fibers and scattered 
hypercontracted fibers with increased ragged red fibers.
DISCUSSION: Hypernatremia myopathy should be considered in hypernatremic 
patients with muscle weakness, and myalgia. Rhabdomyolysis frequently occurs and 
may lead to acute kidney injury in hypernatremia myopathy. Testing of 
hormone-levels and performance of brain magnetic resonance imaging for possible 
hypothalamic lesions are strongly recommended. This article is protected by

385,"PURPOSE: Clinically, the management of cystic renal masses is tricky. The study 
aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic microwave 
ablation-assisted partial nephrectomy (LMAPN) for cystic renal tumors.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 2017 and January 2022, LMAPN was 
performed on 43 patients (29 men and 14 women; age range: 22-80 years; median 
age 54 years) with Bosniak category III (n = 15) or IV (n = 28) cystic renal 
tumors (size range: 1.2-5.0 cm; mean size 2.8 cm). The median follow-up period 
was 26 months (range: 7-56 months). Baseline and perioperative data, 
pathological features, renal function, postoperative complications and oncologic 
outcomes were collected and evaluated.
RESULTS: Forty-three cystic renal tumors were successfully managed by LMAPN. The 
mean operating time was 79 min (range: 40-130 min). The mean time of renal 
pedicle clamping was 19 min (range: 12-25 min). Mean intraoperative blood loss 
was 28.4 mL (range: 10-80 mL). The mean postoperative hospitalization duration 
was 4 days (range: 2-6 days). Negative surgical margins were diagnosed in all 
cases. During the follow-up, no patient appeared with distant metastasis, wound 
or peritoneal cavity implantation. No major but minor complications of 
Clavien-Dindo grade I were encountered after the operation. The 1-, 3- and 
4-year overall survival rate was 100%, 96.6% and 88.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study focusing on LMAPN for cystic renal tumors, 
demonstrating its favorable feasibility, safety and disease control. Long-term 
follow-up is necessary to draw conclusions on the preference and advantages of 
the new therapeutic approach."
386,"Fish basal epidermal cells, known as keratocytes, are well-suited for cell 
migration studies. In vitro, isolated keratocytes adopt a stereotyped shape with 
a large fan-shaped lamellipodium and a nearly spherical cell body. However, in 
their native in vivo environment, these cells adopt a significantly different 
shape during their rapid migration towards wounds. Within the epidermis, 
keratocytes experience 2D confinement between the outer epidermal cell layer and 
the basement membrane; these two deformable surfaces constrain keratocyte cell 
bodies to be flatter in vivo than in isolation. In vivo keratocytes also exhibit 
a relative elongation of the front-to-back axis and substantially more 
lamellipodial ruffling, as compared to isolated cells. We have explored the 
effects of 2D confinement, separated from other in vivo environmental cues, by 
overlaying isolated cells with an agarose hydrogel with occasional spacers, or 
with a ceiling made of PDMS elastomer. Under these conditions, isolated 
keratocytes more closely resemble the in vivo migratory shape phenotype, 
displaying a flatter apical-basal axis and a longer front-to-back axis than 
unconfined keratocytes. We propose that 2D confinement contributes to multiple 
dimensions of in vivo keratocyte shape determination. Further analysis 
demonstrates that confinement causes a synchronous 20% decrease in both cell 
speed and volume. Interestingly, we were able to replicate the 20% decrease in 
speed using a sorbitol hypertonic shock to shrink the cell volume, which did not 
affect other aspects of cell shape. Collectively, our results suggest that 
environmentally imposed changes in cell volume may influence cell migration 
speed, potentially by perturbing physical properties of the cytoplasm. This

387,"During the fabrication of metal halide perovskite films, polycrystal growth and 
maturation are largely influenced by high-temperature annealing. However, this 
process would cause crystals to expand or contract at various depths in the 
film, leading to microscopic structural deformation and further altering the 
optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film. Herein, we propose an 
additional rinsing intermediate phase (RIP) strategy that involves precovering 
the perovskite film surface with a mixed organic layer prior to high-temperature 
annealing. The lattice distortion of the microscopic structure brought on by the 
driving force of the heat field is greatly reduced as a result of the modulation 
for the upper surface of the intermediate phase film by the rinse layer. This 
strategy can prepare films with high crystallinity, minor residual stresses, 
fewer defects, and overall film uniformity. As a result, the modified inverted 
perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves a certified power conversion (PCE) of 
22.76%. Meanwhile, since the rinse layer is involved in the entire crystal 
formation process, ion migration and buildup in the device are prevented between 
the interface. Consequently, the devices still retain 90% of their initial PCE, 
demonstrating enhanced operational stability after 500 h of operation. This 
method of modulating the intermediate perovskite state offers an investigation 
into improving the traditional method of making thin films, which is anticipated 
to hasten the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics."
388,"As the main inorganic component of human bones and teeth, hydroxyapatite (HA), 
with excellent bioactivity and biocompatibility, shows great potential in the 
bone tissue engineering field. Marine mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) 
possesses unique functional groups and thus can absorb the calcium ions from 
extracellular fluid, thereby triggering the precipitation of HA. This study is 
based on a two-step strategy. Using the chemical activity of PDA, polyvinyl 
alcohol/polylactic acid (PVA/PLA) braids were coated with a PDA layer that 
served as a template for the electrochemical deposition of a HA layer. The test 
results indicate that the resulting HA crystals were assembled on the polymer 
fibers in an urchin-like mannerwith a stratified structure. Subsequently, the 
HA/PDA-PVA/PLA braided bone scaffolds were immersed in simulated body fluid for 
ten days, after which the bone scaffolds were found to be completely coated with 
HA, indicating a good biomineralization capability. Cell activity of 
HA/PDA-PVA/PLA scaffolded by dopamine-assisted electrodeposition was 178.8% than 
that of PVA/PLA braids. This HA coating layer inspired by biochemical strategies 
may be useful in the field of bone tissue engineering."
389,"Nanoplastics (<1000 nm) have been evidenced to be universal in a variety of 
environmental media. They pose a potential cytotoxicity and health risk due to 
their tiny size, which allows them to easily penetrate biological barriers and 
enter cells. Here, we briefly review the various prevalent analytical techniques 
or tools for identifying nanoplastics, and further move to focus on their 
advantages and disadvantages. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has 
been implemented for the identification of individual nanoparticles because of 
its high sensitivity to molecules and ease of rapid characterization. Therefore, 
we introduce the SERS technique in the following aspects, (1) principles of 
SERS; (2) strategies and advances in SERS detection of nanoplastics; and (3) 
applying SERS to real environmental samples. We put our effort into the 
summarization of efficient SERS substrates that essentially enable the better 
detection of nanoplastics, and extend to discuss how the reported nanoplastics 
pretreatment methodologies can bring SERS analysis to practical applications. A 
further step moving forward is to investigate the problems and challenges of 
currently applied SERS detection methods and to look at future research needs in 
nanoplastics detection employing SERS analysis."
390,"In this study, twenty-four organic extracts from six marine sponge species, 
collected at shallows of Yucatan, Mexico, were evaluated against Giardia lamblia 
trophozoites and Vero cells. The dichloromethane and hexane extracts of 
Haliclona tubifera exhibited the highest antigiardiasic activity (IC50 = 1.00 
and 2.11 µg/mL, respectively), as well as high selectivity (SI = 41.8 and > 
47.4, respectively), while ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Cinachyrella 
alloclada, and methanol extract of Suberites aurantiaca showed moderate 
activity. Contrastingly, the extracts of Halichondria magniculosa and Oceanapia 
nodosa were considered non actives. Consequently, the dichloromethane extract of 
H. tubifera were subject to an exploratory chemical study, isolating 
cholesterol, two benzaldehyde derivatives, three benzoic acid derivatives, 
cytosine, and thymine."
391,"SID1-like (SIL1) is considered as a core component in dsRNA uptake in some 
selected insect species. Investigation related to the potential function of SIL1 
in dsRNA uptake can contribute to a further understanding of RNAi mechanism in 
insects and agricultural pest control. However, the role of SIL1 in dsRNA uptake 
in insects such as aphids remains controversial. Thus, we have thoroughly 
analyzed the role of SIL1 from the model aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (ApSIL1) in 
cellular dsRNA to clarify its function. First, the induced expression of ApSIL1 
upon dsRNA oral exposure provided a vital clue for the possible involvement of 
ApSIL1 in cellular dsRNA uptake. Subsequent in vivo experiments using the 
RNAi-of-RNAi approach for ApSIL1 supported our hypothesis that the silencing 
efficiencies of reporter genes were reduced after inhibition of ApSIL1 
expression. The impaired biological phenotypes of aphids, including cumulative 
average offspring, deformities of the nymph, and mortality upon the pathogen 
infection were then observed in the treatment group. Thereafter, in vitro 
dual-luciferase reporter assay showed compelling evidence that the luciferin 
signal was significantly attenuated when dsluciferase or dsGFP was transferred 
into ApSIL1-transfected Drosophila S2 cells. These observations further 
confirmed that the signal of Cy3-labeled dsRNA was rapidly attenuated with time 
in ApSIL1-transfected Drosophila S2 cells. Overall, these findings conclusively 
establish that ApSIL1 is involved in dsRNA uptake in A. pisum. This article is

392,"In the current study supplementations of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) powder 
(CNP) and turmeric (Curcuma longa L) powder (TP) as an antibiotic growth 
promoter substitutions on growth performance, intestinal microbiota and 
hematological profile of broiler chickens have been investigated. A total of 
240, one day old as-hatched broiler chickens (ROSS 308) were randomly assigned 
into five treatments with four replicates per treatment and 10 chickens per 
replicate. Treatment groups were C: control (fed basal diet); CNP1: 0.5% CNP; 
CNP2: 1.0% CNP; TP1: 0.5% TP; TP2: 1.0% TP and 500 mg oxytetracycline (OTC)/kg 
of diet. Body weight gain (BWG), feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) 
were improved (p < 0.05) by CNP and TP while OTC improved BWG and FCR. Ileal and 
cecal Lactobacillus and total aerobes were significantly improved while 
coliforms and Escherichia coli were decreased by CNP, TP, and OTC. The 
percentage of packed cell volume (%PCV), hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC) 
count, and white blood cell (WBC) count was increased by CNP and TP while OTC 
decreased %PCV, Hb, RBC, and increased WBC count. In conclusion, the results 
showed that OTC can be safely replaced by CNP and TP at 1.0% dose rate in 
broiler chicken's diets."
393,"OBJECTIVE: To assess a novel intraoperative core biopsy technique to provide 
enhanced guidance in partial glossectomies.
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue 
were eligible for study participation. Following anesthesia, the planned 
resection and three points midway between the gross tumor and the intended 
ablation were marked. A core biopsy was performed with a needle spring on each 
point and sent for frozen sections. The initially planned resection was executed 
if the cores returned free of tumor. In case of a positive core biopsy, a new 
1-1.5 cm margin was marked around that point. The main outcome measure was the 
closest final margin diameter, especially the deep ones. Other outcome measures 
were the core biopsies' sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value. 
Complications were recorded.
RESULTS: The final margins of 10 patients undergoing intraoperative core 
biopsies and 20 matched controls were analyzed. One patient had two positive 
cores and final negative margins after modifying the resection accordingly. 
Another patient had a positive biopsy diagnosed only on final pathology, and one 
close final margin. Patients that were operated with the new technique had 
larger margins compared to the controls: median (interquartile range) closest 
margin 5.95 (3.97; 9.63) mm versus 4 (2.25; 5) mm (p = 0.074) and median deep 
margin 8.6 (6.16; 10) mm versus 5 (3;10) mm (p = 0.411), respectively. There 
were no complications.
CONCLUSION: A novel pre-resection intraoperative biopsy technique is presented. 
Core biopsies taken during glossectomies have the potential to prevent 
inadequate margins.

394,"Ras homologue family member C (RhoC) is an oncogene in diverse types of human 
cancers, whereas its regulatory mechanisms involving macrophage polarization is 
rarely investigated. This study is designed to explore the regulatory role of 
RhoC in colon cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms involving 
macrophage polarization. We detected RhoC expression by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot, and analysed the 
biological function of RhoC knockdown in CC cells by the MTT, wound healing and 
transwell assay. Macrophage polarization-associated markers, genes associated 
with migration, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and forkhead box O 
(FOXO) were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. The xenograft tumour mouse 
model was used to assess the role of RhoC in vivo. RhoC is highly expressed in 
CC cells. The cell viability, invasion and migration abilities of CC cells were 
reduced by knockdown of RhoC. RhoC knockdown promoted M1 polarization, inhibited 
M2 polarization and decreased levels of genes associated with migration (matrix 
metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9). Silencing of RhoC inhibited 
tumour growth and expression of genes associated with migration in the 
xenografted model. In addition, silencing of RhoC promoted PTEN/FOXO1 
expression, and PTEN inhibitor (SF1670) reversed the inhibitory effects of RhoC 
silencing. We demonstrated that silencing of RhoC reduced CC cells invasion and 
migration, and tumour growth by suppressing M2 macrophage polarization via 
regulating the PTEN/FOXO1 pathway."
395,"OBJECTIVE: Viral acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is the leading cause of work and 
school absence and antibiotic over-prescription. There are limited treatment 
options available to ameliorate the symptoms caused by viral ARS. We have 
previously demonstrated that topical adenosine treatment enhances mucociliary 
clearance in the sino-nasal tract. Here, we assessed the therapeutic potential 
of topical adenosine in a mouse model of viral ARS.
METHODS: The effect of topical adenosine on inflammatory response and mucin gene 
expression was examined in a mouse model of viral ARS induced by respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) nasal-only infection. We also investigated the 
inflammatory effect of both endogenous and exogenous adenosine in the sino-nasal 
tract.
RESULTS: Topical adenosine significantly inhibited the expression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, goblet hyperplasia, mucin expression, and cell 
damage in the nose of mice with viral ARS. This treatment did not prolong virus 
clearance. This inhibitory effect was primarily mediated by the A2A adenosine 
receptor (AR). Although previous studies have shown that adenosine induces a 
robust inflammatory response in the lungs, neither endogenous nor exogenous 
adenosine produced inflammation in the sino-nasal tract. Instead, exogenous 
adenosine inhibited the baseline expression of TNF and IL-1β in the nose. 
Additionally, baseline expression of ARs was lower in the nose than that in the 
trachea and lungs.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that intranasal adenosine administration effectively 
decreased inflammation and mucus production in a mouse model of viral ARS.

396,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a neoplasm of B-cells in the blood and 
monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a precursor state to CLL. This 
narrative review provides an overview of the genetic studies that identified 43 
common variants associated with risk of CLL among individuals of European 
ancestry. Emerging studies found that ∼50% of these variants are associated with 
MBL risk. Moreover, the polygenic risk score (PRS) calculated from these CLL 
variants has been shown to be a robust predictor for both CLL and MBL risk among 
European ancestry individuals but a weak predictor among African ancestry 
individuals. By summarizing these genetic studies, we conclude that additional 
studies are needed in other race/ethnic populations to identify race-specific 
susceptibility variants, that functional studies are needed to validate the 
biological mechanisms of the variants, and that the clinical utility of the PRS 
is limited until preventive strategies for CLL are developed."
397,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to generate biomechanical response 
corridors of the small female thorax during a frontal hub impact and evaluate 
scaled corridors that have been used to assess biofidelity of small female 
anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) and human body models (HBMs).
METHODS: Three small female postmortem human subjects (PMHS) were tested under 
identical conditions, in which the thorax was impacted using a 14.0 kg pneumatic 
impactor at an impact velocity of 4.3 m/s. Impact forces to PMHS thoraces were 
measured using a load cell installed behind a circular impactor face with a 
15.2 cm diameter. Thoracic deflections were quantified using a chestband 
positioned at mid-sternum. Strain gages installed on the ribs and sternum 
identified fracture timing. Biomechanical response corridors (force-deflection) 
were generated and compared to scaled small female thoracic corridors using a 
traditional scaling method (TSM) and rib response-based scaling method (RRSM). A 
BioRank System Score (BRSS) was used to quantify differences between the small 
female PMHS data and both scaled corridors.
RESULTS: Coefficients of variation from the three small female PMHS responses 
were less than 2% for peak force and 7% for peak deflection. Overall, the scaled 
corridor means determined from the TSM and RRSM were less than two standard 
deviations away from the mean small female PMHS corridors (BRSS < 2.0). The RRSM 
resulted in smaller deviation (BRSS = 1.1) from the PMHS corridors than the TSM 
(BRSS = 1.7), suggesting the RRSM is an appropriate scaling method.
CONCLUSIONS: New small female PMHS force-deflection data are provided in this 
study. Scaled corridors from the TSM, which have been used to optimize current 
safety tools, were comparable to the small female PMHS corridors. The RRSM, 
which has the great benefit of using rib structural properties instead of 
requiring whole PMHS data, resulted in better agreement with the small female 
PMHS data than the TSM and deserves further investigation to identify scaling 
factors for other population demographics."
398,"Flow cytometry is a sophisticated technology used widely in both basic research 
and as a routine tool in clinical diagnosis. The technology has progressed from 
single parameter detection in the 1970s and 1980s to high end multicolor 
analysis, with currently 30 parameters detected simultaneously, allowing the 
identification and purification of rare subpopulations of cells of interest. 
Flow cytometry continues to evolve and expand to facilitate the investigation of 
new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. The present review gives an overview of 
basic theory and instrumentation, presents and compares the advantages and 
disadvantages of conventional, spectral and imaging flow cytometry as well as 
mass cytometry. Current methodologies and applications in both research, pre- 
and clinical settings are discussed, as well as potential limitations and future 
evolution. This finding encourages the reader to promote such relationship 
between basic science, diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach since the 
standard methods have limitations (e.g., in differentiating the cells after 
staining). Moreover, such path inspires future cytometry specialists develop 
new/alternative frontiers between pre- and clinical diagnosis and be more 
flexible in designing the study for both human as well as veterinary medicine."
399,"BACKGROUND: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) has a relapsing-remitting course and is 
associated with high burden of comorbidities, leading to repeated 
hospitalizations. We investigated the burden, risk factors, causes and outcomes 
of hospitalization and readmission in patients with GCA in a US national cohort.
METHODS: Using the 2017 US National Readmission Database, we identified adults 
≥50-year- old hospitalized with GCA between January-June 2017, with at least a 
6-month of follow-up. We estimated the burden of hospitalization including 
6-month risk of readmission, total days spent in hospital and costs, annually. 
We examined patient-, hospital-, and index hospitalization-related factors for 
6-month readmission and total days of hospitalization, through binomial logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: We included 1,206 patients hospitalized with GCA (70% women, median 
age, 77y), with 13% patients experiencing GCA-related ophthalmological 
complications at index admission. On follow-up, 3% died, and 34% patients were 
readmitted within 6 months, primarily for infections (23%) and cardiovascular 
diseases (15%). Charlson's comorbidity index ≥1, smoking, and obesity were 
associated with readmission. Patients with GCA spent 5 [3-11] days in median in 
hospital per year, with those in top quartile spending 19 [14-26] days/year in 
hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GCA frequently experience unplanned healthcare 
utilization, with 1 in 3 experiencing readmission within 6 months, and 3% dying 
within the follow-up. Infection and cardiovascular diseases are common causes of 
readmission, and may be related to corticosteroid exposure. Population health 
management strategies are required for these vulnerable patients with GCA. This

400,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate which MRI-based articular pathologies are predictive 
of subsequent medial femorotibial compartment quantitative cartilage thickness 
loss and therefore suitable for enrichment of clinical trials with participants 
showing a high likelihood for structural progression.
METHODS: Semi-quantitative ""MRI OsteoArthritis Knee Score"" (MOAKS) assessments 
at baseline and quantitative cartilage thickness measurements at baseline and 
year-2 follow-up were performed in 599 OAI FNIH participants (age: 62y, BMI: 
31kg/m2 , 59% female). Knees were classified as medial compartment (MFTC) 
progressors or non-progressors based on MFTC cartilage thickness change 
(smallest detectable change threshold: -111μm). Logistic regression was used to 
investigate the association between baseline presence and severity of MFTC MOAKS 
pathologies with subsequent MFTC progression. The standardized response mean 
(SRM) was computed to estimate the sensitivity to change that can be achieved 
when selecting knees based on MOAKS pathologies.
RESULTS: Presence of MFTC MOAKS cartilage damage (OR: 2.77, 95% CI: [1.76, 
4.36]), MFTC BMLs (OR: 2.69, 95% CI: [1.89, 3.83]), medial meniscus extrusion or 
damage (OR: 2.21, 95%CI: [1.37, 3.55]), as well as MOAKS severity subscales for 
cartilage and meniscus damage were associated with subsequent progression. The 
SRM was greater in knees with than in knees without the presence of these 
pathologies, and was associated with the severity of those pathologies.
CONCLUSION: MRI-based grading of articular pathologies allows to specifically 
select progressor knees suitable for inclusion to clinical trials but also to 
identify knees, in which treatment is not indicated (e.g., knees without 
cartilage damage despite presence of radiographic OA). This article is protected

401,"Sodium (Na) metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low-cost is promising 
to construct high-energy-density metal battery. However, the unsatisfactory 
interface between Na and liquid electrolyte induces tardily ion transfer 
kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultra-low temperature (-40 °C). 
Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide 
(Na2 Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2 Se/V) 
via an in-situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses 
high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity and high Young's modulus, 
which can promote Na ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na 
deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2 Se/V cell exhibits 
outstanding cycling lifespan of over 1790 h (0.5 mA cm-2 /1 mAh cm-2 ) in 
carbonate-based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics 
simulations reveal that the artificial Na2 Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate 
the desolvation of solvated Na+ at -40 °C. The Na@Na2 Se/V electrode thus 
exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500 h 
at 0.5 mA cm-2 /0.5 mAh cm-2 ) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at -40 
°C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase 
layer for superior high-energy-density metal batteries at ambient and ultra-low

402,"BACKGROUND: Castration-resistance is common in advanced prostatic 
adenocarcinomas (PACs) treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and 
usually occurs after 2 years following treatment. A minority of PACs confer 
innate ADT resistance without prior hormonal treatment. The expression of HMWCK 
in PAC cells has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the 
clinicopathologic and genomic features of HMWCK-expressing PACs and the 
relationship to ADT resistance.
METHODS: A total of 469 PACs were studied for HMWCK expression (39 
postradiotherapy, 57 post-ADT, 373 treatment-naïve PACs). Clinicopathologic 
correlations of the HMWCK expression with tumor grade groups, specific tumor 
morphologies, tumor stages and disease recurrence/persistence/progression were 
performed. Five HMWCK+ PACs were also sequenced for genetic alterations.
RESULTS: Thirty one of the 469 cases (6.6%) showed variable HMWCK+ PAC. The 
HMWCK+ PAC often focally presented in the tumor and vast majority were 
associated with high Gleason scores and unfavorable growth patterns (cribriform, 
comedo-necrosis, and intraductal carcinoma) as well as high tumor stages. A 
small percentage of the HMWCK+ PCA (2/31, 6.5%) presented with frank squamous 
histomorphology. Vast majority (22/31, 87%) had no history of prior ADT. The 
HMWCK+ PAC all displayed diminished to lost expression of AR/NKX3.1. Most of the 
cases progressed within 12 months of ADT or disease persisted despite ADT. Of 
the 5 HMWCK+ PACs subjected to gene sequencing, 4 presented with PTEN/PI3K/MAPK 
pathway alterations.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated HMWCK+ PAC to be a novel type of innate 
ADT-resistant PAC. Overexpression of HMWCK in PAC can be potentially used as a 
surrogate biomarker for aggressive and innate hormone-refractory PACs. The 
genetic alterations imply potential therapeutic implications of PI3K/MAPK 
inhibitors in the treatment of these deadly diseases."
403,"Lipomas are slow growing benign fat tumors that develop in soft tissues of the 
mesoderm. Thus, the specific (dys-)function of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has 
been suggested in the development of lipomas, but details of the tumor 
pathogenesis remain unclear. Existing studies comparing stem cells from native 
adipose (adipose stem cells [ASCs]) and lipomatous tissues (LSCs) have reported 
contradicting findings. However, harvesting ASCs and LSCs from different 
individuals might have influenced proper comparison. Therefore, we aimed to 
characterize donor-matched ASCs and LSCs to investigate metabolic activity, 
proliferation, capability for tri-linear differentiation (chondrogenesis, 
adipogenesis, osteogenesis), and the secretome of mature adipocytes and 
lipomacytes. Both stem cell types did not differ in metabolic activity, but ASCs 
demonstrated stronger proliferation than LSCs. While there was no difference in 
proteoglycan accumulation during chondrogenic differentiation, adipogenesis was 
higher in ASCs, with more lipid vacuole formation. Conversely, LSCs showed 
increased osteogenesis by higher calcium deposition. Lipomacytes showed stronger 
secretory activity and released higher levels of certain adipokines. Our 
findings indicated that LSCs possessed important characteristics of MSCs, 
including ASCs. However, LSCs' low proliferation and adipogenic differentiation 
behavior did not appear to account for enhanced tissue proliferation, but the 
secretome of lipomacytes could contribute to lipomatous neoplasm."
404,"In native articular cartilage, chondrocytes are completely capsulated by a 
pericellular matrix (PCM), together called the chondron. Due to its unique 
properties (w.r.t. territorial matrix) and importance in mechanotransduction, 
the PCM and chondron may be important in regenerative strategies. The current 
gold standard for the isolation of chondrons from cartilage dates from 1997. 
Although previous research already showed the low cell yield and the 
heterogeneity of the isolated populations, their compositions and properties 
have never been thoroughly characterized. This study aimed to compare enzymatic 
isolation methods for chondrocytes and chondrons and characterize the isolation 
efficiency and quality of the PCM. Bovine articular cartilage was digested 
according to the 5-hour gold standard chondron isolation method (0.3% dispase + 
0.2% collagenase II), an overnight chondron isolation (0.15% dispase + 0.1% 
collagenase II), and an overnight chondrocyte isolation (0.15% collagenase II + 
0.01% hyaluronidase). Type VI collagen staining, fluorescence-activated cell 
sorting (FACS) analysis, specific cell sorting and immunohistochemistry were 
performed using a type VI collagen staining, to study their isolation efficiency 
and quality of the PCM. These analyses showed a heterogeneous mixture of 
chondrocytes and chondrons for all three methods. Although the 5-hour chondron 
isolation resulted in the highest percentage of chondrons, the cell yield was 
significantly lower compared to the other isolation methods. FACS, based on the 
type VI collagen staining, successfully sorted the three identified cell 
populations. To maximize chondron yield and homogeneity, the overnight chondron 
enzymatic digestion method should be combined with type VI collagen staining and 
specific cell sorting."
405,"BACKGROUND: Like DNA methylation, histone modifications are considered important 
processes for epigenetic alterations in gene function, and abnormally high 
expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a key role in many human 
diseases. In addition to regulating the acetylation levels of histone and 
non-histone proteins and gene transcription, HDAC inhibitors as antitumor drugs 
can also affect the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway in tumor cells. Prostate 
cancer (PCa) is one of the most heritable malignancies in which DDR pathway 
defects can be detected in a considerable proportion of cases. Such defects are 
more prevalent in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and are highly 
enriched in metastatic lesions. There is currently evidence that DDR 
pathway-deficient PCa is associated with high-risk biological behaviors and 
response sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. Platinum-based drugs have 
been used in multiple clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination with 
other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of CRPC.
METHODS: This study evaluated the combined anticancer effect of (cisplatin) CDDP 
and the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat (SAHA) on three androgen-dependent cell lines 
PC-3, DU-145, and C4-2B in vitro. The efficacy and safety of SAHA combined with 
CDDP in the treatment of CRPC were further verified through animal experiments.
RESULTS: The combination of the two drugs increases cytotoxic effects by 
increasing DNA damage. Our results showed that the SAHA could not only reduce 
the expression of homologous recombinant repair proteins BRCA2, BRCA1, PARP1, 
and RAD51, but also decrease enzymes that Reduce the key enzymes of GSH 
biosynthesis, GSS and GCLC, and GSTP1 which can catalyze the binding of GSH to 
cisplatin. The intracellular GSH level also decreased with the increase of SAHA 
concentration, at the same time, the content of intracellular Pt element.
CONCLUSION: The combination of CDDP and SAHA can produce synergistic anticancer 
effects in androgen-independent PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results open 
up a new avenue for the effective treatment of CRPC. To optimize the 
chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced PCa, it is necessary to further 
study the molecular mechanism of platinum drugs, HDAC inhibitors, and their 
combined action."
406,"Gliomas account for about 80% of malignant brain tumors. The incidence of a new 
brain tumor is 6.4 per 100,000 persons per year with an overall 5-year survival 
rate of 33.4%. Regardless of the great advances that have been made in recent 
years, the causes and pathogenesis of glioma remain unclear. Here we study how 
phosphoglycerate mutase 4 (PGAM4) contributes to glioma. Using a variety of 
methods to examine glioma cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, glycolysis, 
as well as ChIP coanalysis with modified histone H3, we showed that PGAM4 was 
significantly upregulated in patients with glioma and associated with poor 
survival. Silencing PGAM4 attenuated cell viability, proliferation, and 
glycolysis in T98G cells and suppressed tumor growth in vivo, while 
overexpressing PGAM4 promoted cell viability, proliferation, and glycolysis in 
U251 cells via regulating glycolysis pathway. Study also revealed that PGAM4 was 
regulated by EP300-mediated modifications of H3K27ac. PGAM4 silencing inhibited 
cell viability and proliferation, suppressed tumor growth, and decreased 
chemoresistance to temozolomide in glioma cells through suppressing glycolysis."
407,"MOTIVATION: In this work, we present an analytical method for quantifying both 
single-cell morphologies and cell network topologies of tumor cell populations 
and use it to predict 3D cell behavior.
RESULTS: We utilized a supervised deep learning approach to perform instance 
segmentation on label-free live cell images across a wide range of cell 
densities. We measured cell shape properties and characterized network 
topologies for 136 single-cell clones (SCCs) derived from the YUMM1.7 and 
YUMMER1.7 mouse melanoma cell lines. Using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, 
we identified six distinct morphological subclasses. We further observed 
differences in tumor growth and invasion dynamics across subclasses in an in 
vitro 3D spheroid model. Compared to existing methods for quantifying 2D or 3D 
phenotype, our analytical method requires less time, needs no specialized 
equipment, and is capable of much higher throughput, making it ideal for 
applications such as high-throughput drug screening and clinical diagnosis.

408,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory cutaneous disorder. Obesity is 
associated with increased prevalence and severity of AD for reasons that remain 
poorly understood. Myricetin, a dietary flavonoid found in fruits and 
vegetables, is known to have anti-inflammatory effects, but its role in AD is 
unclear. Thus, we investigated the effects of obesity on exacerbation AD 
lesions, and evaluated the effects of myricetin on obese AD. Mice were fed 
normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD), and then 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene 
(DNFB) was used to induce AD-like lesions. We found that obesity exacerbated AD 
lesions, and myricetin topical administration ameliorated symptoms and skin 
lesions of obsess AD mice such as dermatitis scores, scratching behavior, 
epidermal thickness and mast cell infiltration. In addition, myricetin reduced 
the levels of IgE and histamine, inhibited the infiltration of CD4+T cells and 
modulated the expression of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th22 cytokines and 
pro-inflammatory factors (CCL17, CCL22, IL-1β, TGF-β). Moreover, myricetin 
restored impaired barrier function by reducing trans-epidermal water loss 
(TEWL), increasing lamellar body secretion, as well as up-regulating the mRNA 
and protein expression of filaggrin. Western blot results showed that 
significantly increased levels of phosphorylated IκB and NF-κB p65 was observed 
in the obese AD mice compared to the AD mice fed ND, while the myricetin could 
downregulated the phosphorylation of them, and inhibited mRNA expression of iNOS 
and COX2. Taken together, these results suggest that myricetin treatment 
exhibits potentially protective effects against the obese AD by inhibiting 
inflammatory response and restoring skin barrier function."
409,"BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is a critical endogenous signaling molecule that 
exerts protective effects in the setting of heart failure. Cystathionine γ-lyase 
(CSE), 1 of 3 hydrogen-sulfide-producing enzyme, is predominantly localized in 
the vascular endothelium. The interaction between the endothelial CSE-hydrogen 
sulfide axis and endothelial-mesenchymal transition, an important pathological 
process contributing to the formation of fibrosis, has yet to be investigated.
METHODS: Endothelial-cell-specific CSE knockout and Endothelial cell-CSE 
overexpressing mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction to induce 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Cardiac function, vascular 
reactivity, and treadmill exercise capacity after transverse aortic constriction 
were measured to determine the severity of heart failure. Histological and gene 
expression analyses were performed to investigate changes in cardiac fibrosis 
and endothelial-mesenchymal transition activation.
RESULTS: Endothelial-cell-specific CSE knockout mice exhibited increased 
endothelial-mesenchymal transition and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability in 
the myocardium, which was associated with increased cardiac fibrosis, impaired 
cardiac and vascular function, and worsened exercise performance. In contrast, 
genetic overexpression of CSE in endothelial cells led to increased myocardial 
nitric oxide, decreased endothelial-mesenchymal transition and cardiac fibrosis, 
preserved cardiac and endothelial function, and improved exercise capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that endothelial CSE modulates 
endothelial-mesenchymal transition and ameliorate the severity of 
pressure-overload-induced heart failure, in part, through nitric oxide-related 
mechanisms. These data further suggest that endothelium-derived hydrogen sulfide 
is a potential therapeutic for the treatment of heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction."
410,"OBJECTIVES: The multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score is an objective 
tool for monitoring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we 
report a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical value of the MBDA 
score in RA.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in five medical databases: 
MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Embase, Scopus, and Web of 
Science, from inception to 13 October 2021. Original articles reporting on the 
performance of the MBDA score's correlation with conventional disease activity 
measures, or the predictive and the discriminative value of the MBDA score for 
radiographic progression, therapy response, remission, and relapse were 
included.
RESULTS: Our systematic search provided a total of 1190 records. After selection 
and citation searches, we identified 32 eligible studies. We recorded moderate 
correlations between MBDA score and conventional DAMs at baseline (COR = 0.45, 
CI: 0.28-0.59; I2 = 71.0% for DAS28 CRP and COR = 0.55, CI: 0.19-0.78; I2 = 0.0% 
for DAS28-ESR) and at follow-up (COR = 0.44, CI: 0.28-0.57; I2 = 70.0% for DAS28 
CRP), and found that the odds of radiographic progression were significantly 
higher for patients with a high baseline MBDA score (>44) than for patients with 
a low baseline MBDA score (<30) (OR = 1.03, CI: 1.02-1.05; I2 = 10.0%).
CONCLUSION: MBDA score might be used as an objective disease activity marker. In 
addition, it is also a reliable prognostic marker of radiographic progression."
411,"The genus Cyclamen is native to Turkey, where it is represented by 12 perennial 
tuberous geophytic taxa. In this study, a detailed anatomical description of all 
Cyclamen taxa found in Turkey is provided for the first time. Tuber, root, 
petiole, and leaf cross-sections were stained with Astra blue and safranin, and 
tuber slides were also stained with sartur. Tubers of these taxa used by local 
people as a treatment for infertility were separately investigated. Stomatal 
index values and epidermis cell features of the studied taxa were measured. 
Indumentum features of the leaves were described for the first time. Petiole and 
leaf anatomy and particularly stomatal density, size, and index, provided 
valuable evidence for species identification. Although the anatomical features 
of these taxa are not sufficient as diagnostic characters, they can be used 
together with morphological features."
412,"The impact of the 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) of 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) needs study. We analysed data from 989 MDS 
subjects classified using the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to 
determine the impact of the new proposal. Our analyses suggested the ICC 
criteria of MDS-SF3B1 identifies a more homogenous disease entity than the WHO 
2016 criteria of myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS). MDS, 
not otherwise specified with single lineage dysplasia (MDS, NOS-SLD) patients 
had a better prognosis than MDS, NOS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS, NOS-MLD) 
patients. MDS with mutated TP53 and MDS/acute myeloid leukaemia with mutated 
TP53 patients had the briefest survivals. These data support the ICC of MDS, 
which allows more accurate diagnoses and risk stratification."
413,"The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) controls locomotion in vertebrates. In 
humans with Parkinson disease, locomotor deficits are increasingly associated 
with decreased activity in the MLR. This brainstem region, commonly considered 
to include the cuneiform and pedunculopontine nuclei, has been explored as a 
target for deep brain stimulation to improve locomotor function, but the results 
are variable, from modest to promising. However, the MLR is a heterogeneous 
structure, and identification of the best cell type to target is only beginning. 
Here, I review the studies that uncovered the role of genetically defined MLR 
cell types, and I highlight the cells whose activation improves locomotor 
function in animal models of Parkinson disease. The promising cell types to 
activate comprise some glutamatergic neurons in the cuneiform and caudal 
pedunculopontine nuclei, as well as some cholinergic neurons of the 
pedunculopontine nucleus. Activation of MLR GABAergic neurons should be avoided, 
since they stop locomotion or evoke bouts flanked with numerous stops. MLR is 
also considered a potential target in spinal cord injury, supranuclear palsy, 
primary progressive freezing of gait, or stroke. Better targeting of the MLR 
cell types should be achieved through optimized deep brain stimulation 
protocols, pharmacotherapy, or the development of optogenetics for human use."
414,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents 90% of liver tumors. Statins may 
reduce HCC incidence. Its antitumor activities may be mediated by disrupting 
several hepatocarcinogenic pathways. To evaluate in vivo and in vitro the 
antiproliferative and antiangiogenic action of atorvastatin (AT) in the 
development of HCC as well as its mechanisms of action. In vivo model: 
hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was used to promote the development of HCC in Balb/C 
nude mice. Number of hepatic tumor, liver cell proliferation parameters 
(proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA), angiogenesis, and VEGF levels were 
analyzed. In vitro model: Hep-G2 and Ea-hy926 cells were used to evaluate the 
effect of different doses of AT on HCB induced cell proliferation, migration, 
and vasculogenesis and to analyze proliferative parameters. In vivo: AT 
prevented liver growth and tumor development and inhibited PCNA, TGF-β1, and 
pERK levels increase. AT prevented skin blood vessel formation. In vitro, AT 
prevented cell proliferation and migration as well as tubular formation in the 
endothelial cell line by inhibiting the MAPK ERK pathway. We were able to 
demonstrate the potential AT antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects in an 
HCC model and the involvement of TGF-β1 and pERK pathways."
415,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which is associated with 
the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been described as an 
inflammatory complication of exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It carries a risk of serious and lethal 
complications, including cardiogenic shock. Here, we report the pathological 
findings of the pericardium in a 10-year-old child with MIS-C, who developed 
pericarditis-induced cardiac tamponade. In the patient's pericardium, the 
numbers of infiltrating CD68+ macrophages; CD3+ , CD4+ , and CD8+ T cells; and 
myeloperoxidase+ granulocytes were increased, although the number of CD20+ B 
cells was not. These findings provide a clue to understanding the 
pathophysiology of MIS-C."
416,"AIMS: Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is one the most frequent muscular 
dystrophies in adults. Although DM1 has long been considered mainly a muscle 
disorder, growing evidence suggests the involvement of peripheral nerves in the 
pathogenicity of DM1 raising the question of whether motoneurons (MNs) actively 
contribute to neuromuscular defects in DM1.
METHODS: By using micropatterned 96-well plates as a co-culture platform, we 
generated a functional neuromuscular model combining DM1 and MBNL-knock-out 
human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived MNs and human healthy skeletal 
muscle cells.
RESULTS: This approach led to the identification of pre-synaptic defects which 
affect the formation or stability of the neuromuscular junction at an early 
developmental stage. These neuropathological defects could be reproduced by the 
loss of RNA-binding MBNL proteins, whose loss of function in vivo is associated 
with muscular defects associated with DM1. These experiments indicate that the 
functional defects associated with MNs can be directly attributed to MBNL family 
proteins. Comparative transcriptomic analyses also revealed specific 
neuronal-related processes regulated by these proteins that are commonly 
misregulated in DM1.
CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the application to DM1, our approach to generating a robust 
and reliable human neuromuscular system should facilitate disease modelling 
studies and drug screening assays."
417,"It has been reported that stressful events in early life influence behavior in 
adulthood and are associated with different psychiatric disorders, such as major 
depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety 
disorder. Maternal separation (MS) is a representative animal model for 
reproducing childhood stress. It is used as an animal model for depression, and 
has well-known effects, such as increasing anxiety behavior and causing 
abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This study 
investigated the effect of MS on anxiety or aggression-like behavior and the 
number of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus. Mice were separated from their 
dams for four hours per day for 19 d from postnatal day two. Elevated plus maze 
(EPM) test, resident-intruder (RI) test, and counted glutamic acid decarboxylase 
67 (GAD67) or parvalbumin (PV) positive cells in the hippocampus were executed 
using immunohistochemistry. The maternal segregation group exhibited increased 
anxiety and aggression in the EPM test and the RI test. GAD67-positive neurons 
were increased in the hippocampal regions we observed: dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, 
CA1, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. PV-positive neurons were 
increased in the DG, CA3, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. Consistent with 
behavioral changes, corticosterone was increased in the MS group, suggesting 
that the behavioral changes induced by MS were expressed through the effect on 
the HPA axis. Altogether, MS alters anxiety and aggression levels, possibly 
through alteration of cytoarchitecture and output of the ventral hippocampus 
that induces the dysfunction of the HPA axis."
418,"Oxidative stress in skin cells can induce the formation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), which are critical for pathogenic processes such as 
immunosuppression, inflammation, and skin aging. In this study, we confirmed 
improvements from gamma-irradiated silk sericin (I-sericin) and gamma-irradiated 
silk fibroin (I-fibroin) to skin cells damaged by oxidative stress. We found 
that I-sericin and I-fibroin effectively attenuated oxidative stress-induced ROS 
generation and decreased oxidative stress-induced inflammatory factors COX-2, 
iNOS, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β compared to the use of 
non-irradiated sericin or fibroin. I-sericin and I-fibroin effects were balanced 
by competition with skin regenerative protein factors reacting to oxidative 
stress. Taken together, our results indicated that, compared to non-irradiated 
sericin or fibroin, I-sericin, and I-fibroin had anti-oxidation and 
anti-inflammation activity and protective effects against skin cell damage from 
oxidative stress. Therefore, gamma-irradiation may be useful in the development 
of cosmetics to maintain skin health."
419,"Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione-class antidiabetic drug that reduces blood 
glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. We here investigated the interaction of 
rosiglitazone with Kv3.1 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using the 
whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Rosiglitazone rapidly and reversibly inhibited 
Kv3.1 currents in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 29.8 μM) and 
accelerated the decay of Kv3.1 currents without modifying the activation 
kinetics. The rosiglitazone-mediated inhibition of Kv3.1 channels increased 
steeply in a sigmoidal pattern over the voltage range of -20 to +30 mV, whereas 
it was voltage-independent in the voltage range above +30 mV, where the channels 
were fully activated. The deactivation of Kv3.1 current, measured along with 
tail currents, was also slowed by the drug. In addition, the steady-state 
inactivation curve of Kv3.1 by rosiglitazone shifts to a negative potential 
without significant change in the slope value. All the results with the use 
dependence of the rosiglitazone-mediated blockade suggest that rosiglitazone 
acts on Kv3.1 channels as an open channel blocker."
420,"Ion channels regulate a large number of cellular functions and their functional 
role in many diseases makes them potential therapeutic targets. Given their 
diverse distribution across multiple organs, the roles of ion channels, 
particularly in age-associated transcriptomic changes in specific organs, are 
yet to be fully revealed. Using RNA-seq data, we investigated the rat 
transcriptomic profiles of ion channel genes across 11 organs/tissues and 4 
developmental stages in both sexes of Fischer 344 rats and identify 
tissue-specific and age-dependent changes in ion channel gene expression. 
Organ-enriched ion channel genes were identified. In particular, the brain 
showed higher tissue-specificity of ion channel genes, including Gabrd, Gabra6, 
Gabrg2, Grin2a, and Grin2b. Notably, age-dependent changes in ion channel gene 
expression were prominently observed in the thymus, including in Aqp1, Clcn4, 
Hvcn1, Itpr1, Kcng2, Kcnj11, Kcnn3, and Trpm2. Our comprehensive study of ion 
channel gene expression will serve as a primary resource for biological studies 
of aging-related diseases caused by abnormal ion channel functions."
421,"This study aimed to observe the protective effect of momordicine I, a 
triterpenoid compound extracted from momordica charantia L., on isoproterenol 
(ISO)-induced hypertrophy in rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes and investigate its 
potential mechanism. Treatment with 10 μM ISO induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy 
as evidenced by increased cell surface area and protein content as well as 
pronounced upregulation of fetal genes including atrial natriuretic peptide, 
β-myosin heavy chain, and α-skeletal actin; however, those responses were 
markedly attenuated by treatment with 12.5 μg/ml momordicine I. Transcriptome 
experiment results showed that there were 381 and 447 differentially expressed 
genes expressed in comparisons of model/control and momordicine I 
intervention/model, respectively. GO enrichment analysis suggested that the 
anti-cardiomyocyte hypertrophic effect of momordicine I may be mainly associated 
with the regulation of metabolic processes. Based on our transcriptome 
experiment results as well as literature reports, we selected 
glycerophospholipid metabolizing enzymes group VI phospholipase A2 (PLA2G6) and 
diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGK-ζ) as targets to further explore the potential 
mechanism through which momordicine I inhibited ISO-induced cardiomyocyte 
hypertrophy. Our results demonstrated that momordicine I inhibited ISO-induced 
upregulations of mRNA levels and protein expressions of PLA2G6 and DGK-ζ. 
Collectively, momordicine I alleviated ISO-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, 
which may be related to its inhibition of the expression of glycerophospholipid 
metabolizing enzymes PLA2G6 and DGK-ζ."
422,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a kind of malignant tumor with high 
incidence and mortality in the digestive system. The aim of this study is to 
explore the function of lnc-ABCA12-3 in the development of ESCC and its unique 
mechanisms. RT-PCR was applied to detect gene transcription levels in tissues or 
cell lines like TE-1, EC9706, and HEEC cells. Western blot was conducted to 
identify protein expression levels of mitochondrial apoptosis and toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. CCK-8 and 
EdU assays were carried out to measure cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis 
was examined by flow cytometry. ELISA was used for checking the changes in 
glycolysis-related indicators. Lnc-ABCA12-3 was highly expressed in ESCC tissues 
and cells, which preferred it to be a candidate target. The TE-1 and EC9706 
cells proliferation and glycolysis were obviously inhibited with the 
downregulation of lnc-ABCA12-3, while apoptosis was promoted. TLR4 activator 
could largely reverse the apoptosis acceleration and relieved the proliferation 
and glycolysis suppression caused by lnc-ABCA12-3 downregulation. Moreover, the 
effect of lnc-ABCA12-3 on ESCC cells was actualized by activating the TLR4/NF-κB 
signaling pathway under the mediation of exosome. Taken together, the 
lnc-ABCA12-3 could promote the proliferation and glycolysis of ESCC, while 
repressing its apoptosis probably by regulating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway 
under the mediation of exosome."
423,"Spinal nerve injury causes mechanical allodynia and structural imbalance of 
neurotransmission, which were typically associated with calcium overload. 
Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is considered crucial elements-mediating 
intracellular calcium homeostasis, ion channel activity, and synaptic 
plasticity. However, the underlying mechanism of SOCE in mediating neuronal 
transmitter release and synaptic transmission remains ambiguous in neuropathic 
pain. Neuropathic rats were operated by spinal nerve ligations. 
Neurotransmissions were assessed by whole-cell recording in substantia 
gelatinosa. Immunofluorescence staining of STIM1 with neuronal and glial 
biomarkers in the spinal dorsal horn. The endoplasmic reticulum stress level was 
estimated from qRT-PCR. Intrathecal injection of SOCE antagonist SKF96365 
dose-dependently alleviated mechanical allodynia in ipsilateral hind paws of 
neuropathic rats with ED50 of 18 μg. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated 
that STIM1 was specifically and significantly expressed in neurons but not 
astrocytes and microglia in the spinal dorsal horn. Bath application of SKF96365 
inhibited enhanced miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in a 
dosage-dependent manner without affecting miniature inhibitory postsynaptic 
currents. Mal-adaption of SOCE was commonly related to endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress in the central nervous system. SKF96365 markedly suppressed ER 
stress levels by alleviating mRNA expression of C/EBP homologous protein and 
heat shock protein 70 in neuropathic rats. Our findings suggested that nerve 
injury might promote SOCE-mediated calcium levels, resulting in long-term 
imbalance of spinal synaptic transmission and behavioral sensitization, SKF96365 
produces antinociception by alleviating glutamatergic transmission and ER 
stress. This work demonstrated the involvement of SOCE in neuropathic pain, 
implying that SOCE might be a potential target for pain management."
424,"Carboplatin, an advanced anticancer drug with excellent efficacy against ovarian 
cancer, was developed to alleviate the side effects that often occur with 
cisplatin and other platinum-based compounds. Our study reports the in vitro 
characteristics, viability, and activity of cells expressing the inducible 
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene after carboplatin was conjugated with 
polysuccinimide (PSI) and administered in combination with other widely used 
anticancer drugs. PSI, which has promising properties as a drug delivery 
material, could provide a platform for prolonging carboplatin release, 
regulating its dosage, and improving its side effects. The iNOS gene has been 
shown to play an important role in both cancer cell survival and inhibition. 
Herein, we synthesized a PSI-carboplatin conjugate to create a modified 
anticancer agent and confirmed its successful conjugation. To ensure its 
solubility in water, we further modified the structure of the PSI-carboplatin 
conjugate with 2-aminoethanol groups. To validate its biological 
characteristics, the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 and normal ovarian Chinese 
hamster ovary cells were treated with the PSI-carboplatin conjugate alone and in 
combination with paclitaxel and topotecan, both of which are used in 
conventional chemotherapy. Notably, PSI-carboplatin conjugation can be used to 
predict changes in the genes involved in cancer growth and inhibition. In 
conclusion, combination treatment with the newly synthesized polymer-carboplatin 
conjugate and paclitaxel displayed anticancer activity against ovarian cancer 
cells but was not toxic to normal ovarian cancer cells, resulting in the 
development of an effective candidate anticancer drug without severe side

425,"The poor outcome of advanced ovarian cancer under conventional therapy 
necessitates new strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy. β-glucosidase 
(encoded by GBA) is a lysosomal enzyme and is involved in sphingolipids 
metabolism. Recent studies revealed that β-glucosidase plays a role in cancer 
development and chemoresistance. In this work, we systematically evaluated the 
expression and role of GBA in ovarian cancer. Our work demonstrates that 
inhibition of β-glucosidase has therapeutic potential for ovarian cancer. Gene 
Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database, western blot and 
immunohistochemistry analyses of patient samples demonstrated that GBA mRNA and 
protein expression levels were significantly increased in ovarian cancer 
compared to normal tissues. Functional studies using gain-of- function and 
loss-of-function approaches demonstrated that GBA overexpression did not affect 
growth and migration but alleviated cisplatin's efficacy in ovarian cancer 
cells. In addition, GBA depletion resulted in growth inhibition, apoptosis 
induction, and enhancement of cisplatin's efficacy. Of note, we found that GBA 
inhibition specifically decreased receptor tyrosine kinase AXL level, leading to 
the suppression of AXL-mediated signaling pathways. Our data suggest that GBA 
represents a promising target to inhibit AXL signaling and overcome cisplatin 
resistance in ovarian cancer."
426,"Singlet fission (SF) is a promising strategy to overcome thermalization losses 
and enhance the efficiency of single junction photovoltaics (PVs). The 
development of this field has been strongly material-limited, with a paucity of 
materials able to undergo SF. Rarer still are examples that can produce excitons 
of sufficient energy to be coupled to silicon PVs (>1.1 eV). Herein, we examine 
a series of a short-chain polyene, dithienohexatriene (DTH), with tailored 
material properties and triplet (T1) energy levels greater than 1.1 eV. We find 
that these highly soluble materials can be easily spin-cast to create thin films 
of high crystallinity that exhibit ultrafast singlet fission with near perfect 
triplet yields of up to 192%. We believe that these materials are the first 
solution-processable singlet fission materials with quantitative triplet 
formation and energy levels appropriate for use in conjunction with silicon PVs."
427,"Although significant intraspecific variation in photosynthetic phosphorus 
(P)-use efficiency (PPUE) has been shown in numerous species, we still know 
little about the biochemical basis for differences in PPUE among genotypes 
within a species. Here, we grew two high-PPUE and two low-PPUE chickpea (Cicer 
arietinum) genotypes with low P supply in a glasshouse to compare their 
photosynthesis-related traits, total foliar P concentration ([P]) and chemical P 
fractions (i.e. inorganic P (Pi), metabolite P, lipid P, nucleic acid P and 
residual P). Foliar cell-specific nutrient concentrations including P were 
characterized using elemental X-ray microanalysis. Genotypes with high PPUE 
showed lower total foliar [P] without slower photosynthetic rates. No consistent 
differences in cellular [P] between the epidermis and mesophyll cells occurred 
across the four genotypes. In contrast, high PPUE was associated with lower 
allocation to Pi and metabolite P, with PPUE being negatively correlated with 
the percentage of these two fractions. Furthermore, a lower allocation to Pi and 
metabolite P was correlated with a greater allocation to nucleic acid P, but not 
to lipid P. Collectively, our results suggest that a different allocation to 
foliar P fractions, rather than preferential P allocation to specific leaf 
tissues underlies the contrasting PPUE among chickpea genotypes."
428,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the level of ADMA (asymmetric 
dimethylarginine), SDMA (symmetric dimethylarginine), and IL-1β (Interleukin-1β) 
in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from periodontitis patients and control 
subjects.
BACKGROUND: ADMA and SDMA are potentially hazardous non-proteinogenic amino 
acids that limit nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and have many functions in various 
human disorders. ADMA causes a structural change in nitric oxide synthase, while 
SDMA blocks arginine cell uptake. Increased plasma ADMA has been widely 
recognized as a ""trigger"" initiating impaired NO bioavailability and vascular 
dysfunction, which ultimately leads to oxidative stress.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients with periodontitis (P) (Stage III, Grade C, 
n = 25) and 20 control (C) subjects were included in the study. The IL-1β level 
of GCF was measured by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and ADMA and SDMA by liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: Periodontitis patients had higher clinical parameters than controls 
(p < .001). Levels of IL-1β, ADMA and SDMA GCF were statistically significantly 
higher in group P than in group C (respectively; p = .003, p < .0001, 
p < .0001). There was no difference in the ADMA/SDMA ratio (p = .312) between 
the groups. There were significant positive correlations between clinical 
periodontal parameters and IL-1β, ADMA, and SDMA levels (p < .05). ADMA and SDMA 
levels were significantly correlated with IL-1β (p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ADMA and SDMA may be involved in the 
pathogenesis of the periodontal disease."
429,"Stem cell engraftment is currently a promising approach for type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM) treatment. In our previous study, engraftment of a combination 
of human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) and hyaluronic acid (HA) showed 
potent anti-diabetic effect in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mice via tail 
vein injection. Here, we adopted a different route of stem cell delivery, i.e., 
via pancreatic subcapsular transplantation. This combined local engraftment of 
hAECs and HA in STZ-induced T1DM rats showed potent anti-diabetic activity, 
leading to stronger hypoglycemia, more intact islet structure, and increased 
number of insulin-positive cells compared with those with hAECs or insulin 
treatments. Engraftment of hAECs alone increased the proportion of Th1 and T-reg 
cells and decreased the proportion of Th2 and Th17 cells to protect islet β 
cells in STZ-induced T1DM rats, whereas the combined engraftment of hAECs and HA 
showed more potent regulatory capacity, considerably decreased the level of 
TNF-α and IL-17 and increased the level of TGF-β1 compared with those by other 
treatments. The potent synergistic effect of HA contributed to the recovery of 
immune balance in the diabetic rat model, thereby suggesting a new strategy for 
effective treatment of T1DM."
430,"Gamma-decalactone (GDL) is an essential flavor additive with peach-aroma which 
can be prepared via microbial biotransformation from ricinoleic acid (RA). 
Whereas, the difficulty of RA dispersion in medium limited its utilization which 
made the yield of GDL low. In this study, four adsorbent materials (AM) were 
investigated to increase RA distribution, including halloysite, clay, 
SUNSIL-130NP silica (130NP) and SUNSIL-130H silica (130H). They were compared 
with respect to their effects on the biotransformation process, and the 
mechanism of AM on productivity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was revealed. 
Scanning electron microscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 
thermogravimetric analysis were utilized to reveal the mechanism of AM effect on 
GDL production. The results showed that AM functioned as an adsorption and 
slow-releasing carrier of RA and cell immobilization. RA was crosslinked onto 
the surface of four AM via hydrogen bonds and the contact area between RA and 
yeast increased without negative viability effect. The best adsorption-embedding 
rate of RA to AM was 70.94% with 130H and the GDL yield improved to 2.79 g·L-1 . 
The highest conversion rate was 88.99% with halloysite at 36 h. This study 
provides a potential strategy to improve GDL yield efficiently via 
biotransformation on an industrial scale. This article is protected by

431,"BACKGROUND: Age-related changes to the face pertinent anatomy and important 
aspects of autologous fat grafting have been widely applied in facial 
rejuvenation. Various types of autologous fat products (Macrofat, Microfat, 
SEFF, nanofat, and SVF-gel) with different properties and applicabilities have 
been introduced and available for surgeons.
METHODS: Key differences between common techniques for fat processing and 
infiltration. Develop a plan for patients based on site-specific facial 
anatomical zones, we suggested a pyramidal multiple-theory (multi-type, 
multi-method and multi-layer) for facial fat grafting. Based on the complicated 
mechanism of the face decrepitude in different layers of facial soft tissue, 
autologous fat products with various particle sizes and components into 
different layers.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients underwent this facial fat grafting strategy from 
June 2020 to Jan 2022. All achieved cosmetic improvements, with higher patients' 
satisfaction, and minor complications. Our facial fat grafting strategy takes 
advantage of different fat products and is able to address the physiological 
tissue changes during aging, more properly and targetedly, than the traditional 
facial fat grafting.
CONCLUSIONS: Fat grafting to the face aids in volume restoration and 
rejuvenation, thereby addressing soft-tissue atrophy associated with the aging 
face, acquired conditions, or congenital malformations. The technique described 
as ""lipo-tumescence"" has been successfully used in the breast and other regions 
of the body that have radiation damage and is discussed in this article 
specifically for the face and neck."
432,"BACKGROUND: Sensitive skin (SS) is a clinical syndrome defined by the occurrence 
of unpleasant sensations (such as stinging, burning, pain, pruritus, and 
tingling) in response to stimuli that normally should not provoke them. 
According to growing evidence, transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 
(TRPV1) has elevated expression in individuals with SS and is linked with the 
severity of SS symptoms. However, its pathogenesis is still unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Herein, Citrus reticulata (Tangerine) fruit extract (CR) was obtained 
and examined for its effect on SS with a focus on TRPV1 stimulation and 
expression.
METHODS: A recombinant hTRPV1 over-expression cell line (HaCaT-TRPV1-OE cell) 
was constructed to screen substances and extracts from several plants. 
Intracellular calcium mobilization was monitored by Flexstation 3 and a 
fluorescence microscope using Fluo 8 AM fluorophore. Next, immunofluorescence 
was used to detect the TRPV1 expression under different stimulants treated for 
24 h. To investigate the relief and increased tolerance of CR to lactic 
acid-induced skin discomfort, clinical tests were carried out on the nasolabial 
folds or cheek areas.
RESULTS: According to the obtained results, compared to HaCaT cells, 
HaCaT-TRPV1-OE cells showed a higher expression of TRPV1. Neuronal 
hyperresponsiveness in SS triggered by capsaicin (CAP), lactic acid, 
phenoxyethanol or nicotinamide may be through activation of TRPV1 and increased 
TRPV1 expression. CAP activates TRPV1 in HaCaT-TRPV1-OE cells, and more than 100 
plants or chemicals were tested for their inhibitory effects before being 
screened for CR. CR (1%-4%) inhibited TRPV1 activation induced by CAP or 
phenoxyethanol or nicotinamide. Meanwhile, CR (0.25%) suppressed TRPV1 protein 
expression induced by phenoxyethanol or lactic acid. In vivo results showed that 
CR not only instantly relieved lactic acid-induced skin discomfort under 5 min 
but also enhanced skin tolerance to lactic acid after 7 days of continuous use.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of CR showed an instant and long-lasting 
improvement in SS by modulating the activation and expression of TRPV1. 
Moreover, it has been suggested that CR might act as a TRPV1 inhibitor to reduce 
skin irritation or sensitivity."
433,"BACKGROUND: Calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA; Radiesse, Merz North America) 
restores volume and stimulates collagen production. The aim of this research was 
to explore the role of dilution and diffusion in microsphere distribution and 
the effect of CaHA concentration on activation of fibroblasts to produce 
collagen.
METHODS: Ex vivo: Tissue dispersion of CaHA was assessed in abdominal tissue 
segments obtained from patients which were subsequently injected with CaHA 
diluted to 1:1 and hyperdiluted to 1:2. In vitro: Collagen type III (COLIII) and 
type I (COLI) expression of fibroblasts was evaluated after 24 and 72 h of 
incubation with CaHA concentrations of 1.5 (high dilution), 3.0, and 4.5 mg/ml 
(low dilution).
RESULTS: Ex vivo: The 1:2 CaHA hyperdilution increased dispersion and decreased 
concentration of CaHA microspheres compared with the 1:1 dilution. In vitro: 
CaHA incubation resulted in an increased mean COLIII expression of 123% at 24 h. 
COLI synthesis did not change after 24 h but increased up to 124% at 72 h. Only 
fibroblasts in direct contact with CaHA increased COLIII expression. COLIII 
high-expressing cells were fully activated by CaHA and resulted in the same 
level of COLIII expression per cell independent of the CaHA dilution.
CONCLUSIONS: A 1:2 hyperdilution of CaHA increased tissue dispersion of CaHA 
microspheres. Direct contact of CaHA with fibroblasts was a key factor for 
inducing neocollagenesis. COLIII high-expressing cells were fully activated by 
CaHA and resulted in the same expression level of COLIII per cell independent of 
the CaHA amount in each dilution. This indicates that increased collagen 
expression was due to the activation of more fibroblasts."
434,"Dragon's Blood is a member of the Chinese medicinal herb, having anti-oxygen and 
anti-inflammatory activity for the photoprotective effect. However, the poor 
water solubility of raw Dragon's Blood powder has limited its intradermal 
delivery process. In this study, we evaluated nanosuspensions to enhance 
intradermal delivery of Dragon's Blood exerting a photoprotective effect. The 
prepared nanosuspension was added to a composite hydrogel patch matrix for 
better skin application. In the present research, we used biocompatible 
materials hyaluronic acid and amino acid surfactants as nanosuspension 
stabilizers and agar/gelatin/sodium polyacrylate as hydrogel patch matrix. The 
prepared Dragon's Blood nanosuspension had a particle size of 447.0 ± 48.6 nm. 
The micro-structures morphology and viscoelasticity characteristics by SEM and 
rheological testing confirmed a sufficient crosslinked hydrogel network. The 
skin retention amount of Dragon's Blood nanosuspension was 1.48 times of raw 
Dragon's Blood powder water suspension, and the skin penetration amount of 
Dragon's Blood nanosuspension was only about 1/3 of Dragon's Blood DMSO 
solution. In the UVB-irradiated HaCaT cell phototoxicity model, Dragon's Blood 
nanosuspension also significantly increased cell viability by about 1 time of 
the model group and decreased the production of reactive oxygen species about 
1/2 times of model group. In vivo safety and efficiency evaluation experiment 
illustrated that DB-NS hydrogel patch processes have favorable safety and 
photoprotective effect with no skin irritancy and phototoxicity. Furthermore, 
DB-NS and DB-NS hydrogel patches could protect skin from UVA and UVB irritating 
skin reactions. Overall, our study of the combined use of biocompatible and 
biodegradable materials as excipients of nanosuspension and hydrogel patch could 
be used as an effective additive of Intradermal delivery and skin 
photoprotection."
435,"The hippocampus is composed of various subregions: CA1, CA2, CA3, and the 
dentate gyrus (DG). Despite the abundant hippocampal research literature, until 
recently, CA2 received little attention. The development of new genetic and 
physiological tools allowed recent studies characterizing the unique properties 
and functional roles of this hippocampal subregion. Despite its small size, the 
cellular content of CA2 is heterogeneous at the molecular and physiological 
levels. CA2 has been heavily implicated in social behaviors, including social 
memory. More generally, the mechanisms by which the hippocampus is involved in 
memory include the reactivation of neuronal ensembles following experience. This 
process is coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples 
(SWRs). Recent evidence suggests that CA2 plays an important role in the 
generation of SWRs. The unique connectivity and physiological properties of CA2 
pyramidal cells make this region a computational hub at the core of hippocampal 
information processing. Here, we review recent findings that support the role of 
CA2 in coordinating hippocampal network dynamics from a systems neuroscience 
perspective."
436,"BACKGROUND: Although the role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in ultraviolet light 
B (UVB)-induced photoaging has been confirmed in many studies, the specific 
mechanism is still not clear. Therefore, we attempted to investigate the effect 
and mechanism of PRP on UVB-induced human keratinocyte (HaCaT cells) apoptosis.
METHODS: HaCaT cells were collected to construct UVB-induced photoaging models. 
Then, the cells were divided into Sham group, 5% PRP group, UVB group, and 
UVB + 5% PRP group. Next, MTT assay was used to detect the level of cell 
proliferation; flow cytometry to check the level of apoptosis; ELISA to 
determine the TNF-α, IL-18, IL-6, and IL-1β levels in the supernatant; and 
Western blot to test Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome c (Cyt.c), GRP78, CHOP, and ATF4 
protein expression levels.
RESULTS: Briefly, 5% PRP intervention could relieve the inhibition of UVB on 
HaCaT cell proliferation, inhibit the promotion of UVB to cell apoptosis, 
up-regulate UVB-induced Bcl-2 protein expression, and decrease Bax and Cyt.c 
protein level. In addition, 5% PRP significantly down-regulated the inflammatory 
factor levels of TNF-α, IL-18, IL-6, and IL-1βin UVB-induced cells and reduced 
the inflammatory response. Moreover, 5% PRP also greatly reduced the protein 
expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, and ATF4 in UVB-induced cells and alleviated 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
CONCLUSION: PRP may protect HaCaT cells from UVB-induced apoptosis by 
alleviating inflammatory response and ER stress."
437,"BACKGROUND: The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by UV 
radiation can lead to lipid, protein, nucleic acid, and organelle damage, one of 
the core mechanisms mediating skin aging. In the photoaging process, how ROS 
drives the imbalance of the body's complex repair system to induce 
senescence-like features is not fully understood.
METHODS: We irradiated human epidermal keratinocytes with 12 J/cm2 of UVA to 
establish an in vitro photoaging model. Then we employed whole-transcriptome 
sequencing and O2K mitochondrial function assay to reveal the photoprotective 
mechanisms of liquiritigenin (LQ).
DISCUSSION: We found that skin reduces endogenous ROS by promoting mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling in response to UVA-induced damage. However, 
this also causes excessive consumption and idling of nutrients, leading to the 
inhibition of cell proliferation, and ultimately accelerating the skin aging 
process. Here, we demonstrated that LQ can reduce stress in keratinocytes, 
increase oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production efficiency, and block the 
massive loss of skin nutrients and net energy stress. Furthermore, LQ can 
promote collagen synthesis and keratinocyte proliferation through the PI3K-AKT 
pathway, thereby reversing photoaging.
CONCLUSION: This work provides a new skin aging mechanism and solution strategy 
with high clinical translation value."
438,"A cryptic plasmid (pTH32) was characterized from Tetragenococcus halophilus 32, 
an isolate from jeotgal, Korean traditional fermented seafood. pTH32 is 3,198 bp 
in size with G+C content of 35.84%, and contains 4 open reading frames (ORFs). 
orf1 and orf2 are 456 bp and 273 bp in size, respectively, and their translation 
products showed 65.16% and 69.35% similarities with RepB family plasmid 
replication initiators, respectively, suggesting the rolling-circle replication 
(RCR) mode of pTH32. orf3 and orf4 encodes putative hypothetical protein of 186 
and 76 amino acids, respectively. A novel Tetragenococcus-Escherichia coli 
shuttle vector, pMJ32E (7.3 kb, Emr), was constructed by ligation of pTH32 with 
pBluescript II KS(+) and an erythromycin resistance gene (ErmC). pMJ32E 
successfully replicated in Enterococcus faecalis 29212 and T. halophilus 31 but 
not in other LAB species. A pepA gene, encoding aminopeptidase A (PepA) from T. 
halophilus CY54, was successfully expressed in T. halophilus 31 using pMJ32E. 
The transformant (TF) showed higher PepA activity (49.8 U/mg protein) than T. 
halophilus 31 cell (control). When T. halophilus 31 TF was subculturd in MRS 
broth without antibiotic at 48 h intervals, 53.8% of cells retained pMJ32E after 
96 h, and only 2.4% of cells retained pMJ32E after 14 days, supporting the RCR 
mode of pTH32. pMJ32E could be useful for the genetic engineering of 
Tetragenococcus and Enterococcus species."
439,"Although human hepatocyte-transplanted immunodeficient mice support infection 
with hepatitis viruses, these mice fail to develop viral hepatitis due to the 
lack of an adaptive immune system. In this study, we generated new 
immunodeficiency cDNA-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/SCID/Rag2-/- 
/Jak3-/- mice and established a mouse model with both a humanized liver and 
immune system. Transplantation of human hepatocytes with human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-A24 resulted in establishment of a highly replaced liver in 
cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mice. These mice were successfully infected with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) for a prolonged period and 
facilitate analysis of the effect of anti-HCV drugs. Administration of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from an HLA-A24 donor 
resulted in establishment of 22.6-81.3% human CD45-positive mononuclear cell 
chimerism in liver-infiltrating cells without causing graft-versus-host disease 
in cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mice without human hepatocyte transplantation. 
When mice were transplanted with human hepatocytes and then administered 
HLA-A24-positive human PBMCs, an alloimmune response between transplanted human 
hepatocytes and PBMCs occurred, with production of transplanted 
hepatocyte-specific anti-HLA antibody. In conclusion, we succeeded in 
establishing a humanized liver/immune system characterized by an allo-reaction 
between transplanted human immune cells and human liver using a novel 
cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mouse. This mouse model can be used to generate a 
chronic hepatitis mouse model with a human immune system with application not 
only to hepatitis virus virology but also to investigation of the pathology of 
post-transplantation liver rejection."
440,"Oxidized bacterial nanocellulose (OBC) has been reported to prevent microbial 
growth, but its antibacterial characteristics and mechanism are still unclear. 
In this study, the antibacterial mechanism of OBC was explored by detecting and 
assessing the interaction of OBC with different carboxyl content on 
Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The results showed that OBC had 
strong antibacterial activity and anti-biofilm activity against S. aureus and E. 
coli, which was positively correlated with the carboxyl content of OBC. After 
OBC treatment, the bacteria adhesion was inhibited, and the cell membrane was 
destroyed leading to increased permeability. Further investigation revealed that 
the concentration of c-di-GMP that induced biofilm formation was significantly 
decreased to 1.81 pmol/mg after OBC treatment. In addition, OBC inactivated 
mature biofilms, with inactivation rates up to 79.3%. This study suggested that 
OBC has excellent antibacterial and anti-adhesion properties, which can increase 
the cell membrane permeability and inhibit c-di-GMP formation. In addition, OBC 
also has a strong inactivation effect on mature biofilm, which can be used as an 
effective anti-biofilm agent. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

441,"The skin is a dynamic ecosystem on which diverse microbes reside. The 
interkingdom interaction between microbial species in the skin microbiota is 
thought to influence the health and disease of the skin although the roles of 
the intra- and interkingdom interactions remain to be elucidated. In this 
context, the interactions between Malassezia and Staphylococcus, the most 
dominant microorganisms in the skin microbiota, have gained attention. This 
study investigated how the interaction between Malassezia and Staphylococcus 
affected the antifungal susceptibility of the fungus to the azole antifungal 
drug ketoconazole. The susceptibility was significantly decreased when 
Malassezia was co-cultured with Staphylococcus. We found that acidification of 
the environment by organic acids produced by Staphylococcus influenced the 
decrease of the ketoconazole susceptibility of M. restricta in the co-culturing 
condition. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that the significant increased 
ergosterol content and cell membrane and wall thickness of the M. restricta 
cells grown in the acidic environment may be the main cause of the altered azole 
susceptibility of the fungus. Overall, our study suggests that the interaction 
between Malassezia and Staphylococcus influences the antifungal susceptibility 
of the fungus and that pH has a critical role in the polymicrobial interaction 
in the skin environment."
442,"Protection of skin cells from chronic infrared-A (IRA) irradiation is crucial 
for anti-photoaging of the skin. In this study, we investigated the protective 
activity of Rg3(S) and Rg3(S)-incorporated anionic soybean lecithin liposomes 
(Rg3/Lipo) with a size of approximately 150 nm against IRA-induced photodamage 
in human fibroblasts. The formulated Rg3/Lipo showed increased solubility in 
aqueous solution up to a concentration of 200 μg/ml, compared to free Rg3(S). In 
addition, Rg3/Lipo exhibited superior colloidal stability in aqueous solutions 
and biocompatibility for normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). After repeated 
IRA irradiation on NHDFs, elevated levels of cellular and mitochondrial reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) were greatly reduced by Rg3(S) and Rg3/Lipo. In addition, 
cells treated with Rg3/Lipo exhibited noticeably reduced apoptotic signals 
following IRA irradiation compared to untreated cells. Thus, considering aqueous 
solubility and cellular responses, Rg3/Lipo could serve as a promising infrared 
protector for healthy aging of skin cells."
443,"Drug response prediction is an important problem in personalized cancer therapy. 
Among various newly developed models, significant improvement in prediction 
performance has been reported using deep learning methods. However, systematic 
comparisons of deep learning methods, especially of the transferability from 
preclinical models to clinical cohorts, are currently lacking. To provide a more 
rigorous assessment, the performance of six representative deep learning methods 
for drug response prediction using nine evaluation metrics, including the 
overall prediction accuracy, predictability of each drug, potential associated 
factors and transferability to clinical cohorts, in multiple application 
scenarios was benchmarked. Most methods show promising prediction within cell 
line datasets, and TGSA, with its lower time cost and better performance, is 
recommended. Although the performance metrics decrease when applying models 
trained on cell lines to patients, a certain amount of power to distinguish 
clinical response on some drugs can be maintained using CRDNN and TGSA. With 
these assessments, we provide a guidance for researchers to choose appropriate 
methods, as well as insights into future directions for the development of more 
effective methods in clinical scenarios."
444,"In planta, H2O2 is produced as a by-product of enzymatic reactions and during 
defense responses. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) is a key enzyme involved in 
scavenging cytotoxic H2O2. Here, we report the crystal structure of cytosolic 
APX from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) (Sobic.001G410200). While the overall 
structure of SbAPX was similar to that of other APXs, SbAPX uniquely displayed 
four bound ascorbates rather than one. In addition to the ɣ-heme pocket 
identified in other APXs, ascorbates were bound at the δ-meso and two 
solvent-exposed pockets. Consistent with the presence of multiple binding sites, 
our results indicated that the H2O2-dependent oxidation of ascorbate displayed 
positive cooperativity. Bound ascorbate at two surface sites established an 
intricate proton network with ascorbate at the ɣ-heme edge and δ-meso sites. 
Based on crystal structures, steady-state kinetics and site-directed mutagenesis 
results, both ascorbate molecules at the ɣ-heme edge and the one at the surface 
are expected to participate in the oxidation reaction. We provide evidence that 
the H2O2-dependent oxidation of ascorbate by APX produces a C2-hydrated bicyclic 
hemiketal form of dehydroascorbic acid at the ɣ-heme edge, indicating two 
successive electron transfers from a single bound ascorbate. In addition, the 
δ-meso site was shared with several organic compounds, including p-coumaric acid 
and other phenylpropanoids, for the potential radicalization reaction. 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the critical residue at the ɣ-heme edge (R172A) 
only partially reduced polymerization activity. Thus, APX removes 
stress-generated H2O2 with ascorbates, and also uses this same H2O2 to 
potentially fortify cell walls via oxidative polymerization of phenylpropanoids 
in response to stress."
445,"Therapeutic application of vaccines to endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains 
uncertain. In this study, we aimed to identify potential tumor antigens for use 
in the development of an anti-tumor mRNA vaccine and clarify immune subtypes and 
their characteristics for immunotherapeutic application in heterogeneous EC by 
integrating multi-omics data. Importantly, four potential tumor antigen 
candidates-PGR, RBPJ, PARVG, and MSX1-were identified and significantly 
correlated with better overall survival, disease-free survival, and distinct 
antigen-presenting cell infiltration in EC. In addition, two different immune 
subtypes by consensus clustering analysis of the immune-related genes were 
identified. Patients with C2 immunophenotypes exhibited superior survival 
outcomes and ""hot"" immunoreactivity and harbored higher microsatellite 
instability scores and tumoral mutation burden but lower copy-number variation 
burden. Furthermore, the distinct expression of immunogenic cell death 
modulators and differential microenvironmental characteristics of immune-cell 
infiltration were also revealed between C1 and C2 immune-subtype tumors. 
Enrichment analysis of the co-expression of immune-related genes showed 
enrichment in immune response, immune cell-mediated immunity, and antigen 
processing pathways. These results indicated that these identified tumor 
antigens can be used for developing antitumor mRNA vaccines, and tumors with C2 
immunophenotypic characteristics demonstrated sensitivity and susceptibility to 
immunotherapy in EC."
446,"BACKGROUND: We analyzed our experience with descending necrotizing mediastinitis 
(DNM) treatment and investigated the efficacy of video-assisted thoracoscopic 
surgery (VATS) for mediastinal drainage.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis included patients who underwent surgical 
drainage for DNM at our hospital from 2005 to 2020. We analyzed patients' 
baseline characteristics, surgical data, and perioperative outcomes and compared 
them according to the mediastinal drainage approach among patients with type II 
DNM.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (male-to-female ratio, 18:7) with a mean age of 
54.0±12.9 years were enrolled in this study. The most common infection sources 
were pharyngeal infections (60%). Most patients had significantly increased 
white blood cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein levels, and decreased 
albumin levels on admission. The most common DNM type was type IIB (n=16, 64%), 
while 5 and 4 patients had types I and IIA, respectively. For mediastinal 
drainage, the transcervical approach was used in 15 patients and the 
transthoracic approach (VATS) in 10 patients. The mean length of hospital stay 
was 26.5±23.8 days, and the postoperative morbidity and in-hospital mortality 
rates were 24% and 12%, respectively. No statistically significant differences 
were found among patients with type II DNM between the transcervical and VATS 
groups. However, the VATS group showed shorter mean antibiotic therapy duration, 
drainage duration, and hospital stay length than the transcervical group.
CONCLUSION: DNM manifested as severe infection requiring long-term inpatient 
treatment, with a mortality rate of 12%. Thus, active treatment with a 
multidisciplinary approach is crucial, and mediastinal drainage using VATS is 
considered relatively safe and effective."
447,"OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidences indicate that a distinct CD11c+ T-bet+ B cell 
subset termed age/autoimmune-associated B cells (ABCs) is the major pathogenic 
autoantibody producer in lupus. Human lupus is associated with significant 
metabolic alterations, but how ABCs orchestrate their typical transcription 
factors (TFs) and metabolic programs to meet specific functional requirements is 
unclear. Our goal is to characterize the metabolism of ABCs and identify the 
regulators of metabolic pathways for developing new therapies for ABC-mediated 
autoimmunity.
METHODS: We developed a T-bet-tdTomato reporter mouse strain to trace live 
T-bet+ B cells and adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells from Bm12 mice to induce 
lupus. Then CD11c+ tdTomato+ B cells were sorted and conducted RNA sequencing 
and extracellular flux assay. Metabolic restriction to constrain ABC formation 
was tested on human and mouse B cells. The metabolic intervention was conducted 
in the Bm12-induced lupus model.
RESULTS: ABCs exhibited a hypermetabolic state with enhanced glycolytic 
capacity. The increased glycolytic rate in ABCs was promoted by IFN-γ signaling. 
T-bet, a downstream TF of IFN-γ, regulated the gene program of the glycolysis 
pathway in ABCs by repressing the expression of Bcl6. Functionally, glycolysis 
restriction could impair ABC formation. The engagement of glycolysis promoted 
survival and terminal differentiation of antibody-secreting cells. 
Administration of glycolysis inhibitor ameliorated ABCs accumulation and 
autoantibody production in Bm12-induced lupus model.
CONCLUSION: T-bet can couple immune signals and metabolic programming to 
establish pathogenic ABC formation and functional capacities. Modulating ABC 
favored metabolic program could be a novel therapeutic approach for lupus. This

448,"OBJECTIVE: Variants in STAT4 are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. How disease-associated variants affect 
STAT4 expression, in particular in CD4 T cells where STAT4 plays an essential 
role, is unknown.
METHODS: We compared Th1 differentiation between naïve CD4 T cells from healthy 
donors (HD) homozygous for the risk (R/R) or non-risk (NR/NR) alleles. We 
analyzed epigenetic marks in STAT4 and evaluated the relevance of its third 
intron. We assessed the consequences of Stat4 overexpression in vivo. We 
analyzed the effects of the STAT4 genotype in patients with lupus nephritis.
RESULTS: Naïve CD4 T cells from NR/NR HD, downregulated STAT4 in response to 
IL-12. In contrast, cells from R/R HD maintained high levels. R/R cells 
exhibited higher abundance of transcriptionally active STAT4 and increased IFN-γ 
production. Accordingly, R/R HD exhibited a stronger induction of local active 
enhancer marks. Genetic editing confirmed the presence of a negative regulatory 
region in the STAT4 third intron, where most of the SLE-associated STAT4 SNPs 
are located. In vivo forced expression demonstrated that increases in Stat4 
levels in T cells enhanced glomerulonephritis. Accordingly, the R/R genotype was 
associated with suboptimal response to treatment and with worse clinical 
outcomes in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.
CONCLUSIONS: The SLE-associated STAT4 haplotype is associated with abnormal 
IL-12-mediated STAT4 transcriptional regulation. Carriers of the risk variant 
exhibit exaggerated CD4 pro-inflammatory capacities that, in the context of SLE, 
contribute to a more severe disease. R/R patients may benefit from blockade of 
the IL-12-STAT4 pathway. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

449,"Isoprenoids are a very large and diverse family of metabolites required by all 
living organisms. All isoprenoids derive from the double-bond isomers 
isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are 
produced by the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in bacteria and plant 
plastids. It has been reported that IPP and DMAPP feedback regulate the activity 
of deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), a dimeric enzyme catalyzing the 
main flux-controlling step of the MEP pathway. Here we provide experimental 
insights on the underlying mechanism. Isothermal titration calorimetry and 
dynamic light scattering approaches showed that IPP and DMAPP can allosterically 
bind to DXS in vitro, causing a size shift. In silico ligand binding site 
analysis and docking calculations identified a potential allosteric site in the 
contact region between the two monomers of the active DXS dimer. Modulation of 
IPP and DMAPP contents in vivo followed by immunoblot analyses confirmed that 
high IPP/DMAPP levels resulted in monomerization and eventual aggregation of the 
enzyme in bacterial and plant cells. While loss of the enzymatically-active 
dimeric conformation allows a fast and reversible reduction of DXS activity in 
response to a sudden increase or decrease in IPP/DMAPP supply, aggregation and 
hence removal of monomers that would otherwise be available for dimerization 
appears as a more drastic response in case of persistent IPP/DMAPP overabundance 
(e.g., by a blockage in their conversion to downstream isoprenoids). Our results 
represent an important step towards understanding the regulation of the MEP 
pathway and for the rational design of biotechnological endeavors aimed at 
increasing isoprenoid contents in microbial and plant systems."
450,"Plastids communicate their developmental and physiological status to the nucleus 
via retrograde signaling, thus allowing nuclear gene expression to be adjusted 
appropriately. Signaling during plastid biogenesis and responses of mature 
chloroplasts to environmental changes are designated as biogenic' and 
'operational' controls, respectively. A prominent example of the investigation 
of biogenic signaling is the screen for gun (genomes uncoupled) mutants. 
Although the first five gun mutants were identified 30 years ago, the functions 
of GUN proteins in retrograde signaling remain controversial and that of GUN1 is 
hotly disputed. Here, we provide background information and critically discuss 
recently proposed concepts that address GUN-related signaling and some novel gun 
mutants. Moreover, considering heme as a candidate in retrograde signaling, we 
revisit the spatial organization of heme biosynthesis and export from plastids. 
Although this review focuses on GUN pathways, we also highlight recent progress 
in the identification and elucidation of chloroplast-derived signals that 
regulate the acclimation response in green algae and plants. Here, 
stress-induced accumulation of unfolded/misassembled chloroplast proteins evokes 
a chloroplast-specific unfolded protein response (cpUPR), which leads to changes 
in the expression levels of nucleus-encoded chaperones and proteases to restore 
plastid protein homeostasis. We also address the importance of 
chloroplast-derived signals for activation of flavonoid biosynthesis leading to 
the production of anthocyanins during stress acclimation through sucrose 
non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1 (SnRK1). Finally, a framework for the 
identification and quantification of intercompartmental signaling cascades at 
the proteomic and metabolomic levels is provided, and we discuss future 
directions in the dissection of organelle-nucleus communication."
451,"Gene regulation is central to all aspects of organism growth, and understanding 
it from large-scale functional datasets can provide a whole view of biological 
processes controlling complex phenotypic traits in crops. However, the 
connection between massive functional datasets and trait-associated gene 
discovery for crop improvement still lacks. Here, we constructed a wheat 
integrative gene regulatory network (wGRN) by using an updated genome annotation 
and combining diverse complementary functional datasets, including gene 
expression, sequence motif, transcription factor (TF) binding, chromatin 
accessibility, and evolutionarily conserved regulation. wGRN contains 7.2 
million genome-wide interactions covering 5,947 TFs and 127,439 target genes and 
was further verified using known regulatory relationships, condition-specific 
expression, gene functional information, and experiments. We used wGRN to assign 
genome-wide genes to 3,891 specific biological pathways and accurately 
prioritize candidate genes associated with complex phenotypic traits in 
genome-wide association studies. In addition, wGRN was used to enhance the 
interpretation of a spike temporal transcriptome dataset to construct 
high-resolution networks. We further unveiled novel regulators that enhance the 
predictive power of spike phenotypic traits using the machine learning method 
and contribute to the spike phenotypic differences among modern wheat 
accessions. An interactive webserver, wGRN (http://wheat.cau.edu.cn/wGRN), was 
finally developed for the community to explore gene regulations and discover 
trait-associated genes. Overall, this community resource establishes the 
foundation for using large-scale functional datasets to guide trait-associated 
gene discovery for crop improvement."
452,"The fusion peptide domain is necessary for the fusogenic activity of spike 
proteins in a variety of enveloped viruses, allowing the virus to infect the 
host cell, and is the only part of the protein that interacts directly with the 
target membrane lipid tails during fusion. There are consistent findings of 
poration by this domain in experimental model membrane systems, and in certain 
conditions, the isolated fusion peptides (FPs) can generate pores. Here, we use 
molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the specifics of how these 
FP-induced pores form in membranes with different compositions of lysolipid and 
POPC. The simulations show that pores form spontaneously at high lysolipid 
concentrations via hybrid intermediates, where FP aggregates in the cis leaflet 
tilt to form a funnel-like structure that spans the leaflet and locally reduces 
the hydrophobic thickness that must be traversed by water to form a pore. By 
restraining a single FP within an FP aggregate to this tilted conformation, 
pores can be formed in lower lysolipid-content membranes, including pure POPC, 
on the 100-ns timescale, much much more rapidly than in unbiased simulations in 
bilayers with the same composition. The pore formation pathway is similar to the 
spontaneous formation in high lysolipid. Depending on the membrane composition, 
the pores can be metastable (as seen in POPC) or lead to membrane rupture."
453,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the need for additional safe, effective and affordable 
vaccines gave new impetus into development of vaccine genetic platforms. Here we 
report the findings from the phase 1, first-in-human, dose-escalation study of 
COVID-eVax, a DNA vaccine encoding the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the 
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Sixty-eight healthy adults received two doses of 0.5, 
1 or 2mg 28 days apart, or a single 2mg dose, via intramuscular injection 
followed by electroporation, and were monitored for 6 months. All participants 
completed the primary safety and immunogenicity assessments after 8 weeks. 
COVID-eVax was well tolerated, with mainly mild to moderate solicited adverse 
events (tenderness, pain, bruising, headache and malaise/fatigue) less frequent 
after the second dose, and induced an immune response (binding antibodies and/or 
T cells) at all prime-boost doses tested in up to 90% of the volunteers at the 
highest dose. However, the vaccine did not induce neutralizing antibodies, while 
particularly relevant was the T cell-mediated immunity, with a robust Th1 
response. This T cell-skewed immunological response adds significant information 
to the DNA vaccine platform and should be assessed in further studies for its 
protective capacity and potential usefulness also in other therapeutic areas, 
such as oncology."
454,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-6 
superfamily. LIF was initially discovered as a factor to induce the 
differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells and thus inhibit their proliferation. 
Subsequent studies have highlighted the multi-functions of LIF under a wide 
variety of physiological and pathological conditions in a highly cell-, tissue-, 
and context-dependent manner. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that LIF plays 
essential roles in the stem cell niche, where it maintains the homeostasis and 
regeneration of multiple somatic tissues, including intestine, neuron, and 
muscle. Further, LIF exerts a crucial regulatory role in immunity, and functions 
as a protective factor against many immunopathological diseases, such as 
infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and graft-verse-host disease 
(GVHD). It is worth noting that while LIF displays a tumor-suppressive function 
in leukemia, recent studies have highlighted the oncogenic role of LIF in many 
types of solid tumors, further demonstrating the complexities and 
context-dependent effects of LIF. In this review, we summarize the recent 
insights into the roles and mechanisms of LIF in stem cell homeostasis and 
regeneration, immunity, and cancer, and discuss the potential therapeutic 
options for human diseases by modulating LIF levels and functions."
455,"Ssd1p is an RNA binding protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that plays an 
important role in cell division, cell fate decisions, stress response and 
virulence. Lab strain W303 encodes the terminal truncation ssd1-2, which is 
typically interpreted to be a loss of function allele. We have shown that ssd1-2 
is toxic to mpt5-Δ mutants and to diploids entering stationary phase and 
quiescence. The ssd1-Δ null shows no toxicity, indicating that ssd1-2 is 
disrupting an essential function that does not solely require Ssd1p. ssd1-2 
cells are also more sensitive to stress than ssd1-Δ . These phenotypes are 
recessive to SSD1-1 . In contrast, ssd1-2 plays a dominant role in promoting 
sporulation."
456,"FOXO transcription factors regulate development, longevity, and 
stress-resistance across species. The C. elegans FOXO ortholog, daf-16, has 
three major isoforms with distinct promoters and N-termini. Different 
combinations of isoforms regulate different processes. Adverse environments can 
induce dauer diapause after the second larval molt. During dauer, daf-16 blocks 
specification of vulval precursor cells, including EGFR/Ras-mediated 1˚ fate 
specification and LIN-12/Notch-mediated 2˚ fate specification. Using 
isoform-specific mutants, we find that daf-16a and daf-16f are functionally 
redundant for the block to the expression of 1˚ fate markers. In contrast, all 
three isoforms contribute to blocking the expression of 2˚ fate markers."
457,"BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported on platelet activity ex vivo 
and responsiveness in vitro among COVID-19 patients with or without 
thromboembolic complications.
OBJECTIVES: To assess platelet reactivity in moderate disease at early stages of 
COVID-19.
PATIENTS/METHODS: We performed a prospective, descriptive analysis on 100 
consecutive patients presenting with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the 
University Medical Center Freiburg during the first or second pandemic wave. 
Following PCR testing and compliance with study inclusion criteria, 20 
SARS-CoV-2 positive and 55 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (serving as patient 
controls) were enrolled. In addition, 15 healthy subjects were included. 
Platelet reactivity was assessed using whole blood impedance aggregometry and 
flow cytometry in response to various agonists.
RESULTS: Platelet aggregation was significantly impaired in COVID-19 patients as 
compared to patient controls or healthy subjects. The reduced platelet 
responsiveness in COVID-19 patients was associated with impaired activation of 
GPIIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3). By contrast, low P-selectin expression at baseline and 
intact secretion upon stimulation in vitro suggest that no pre-activation in 
vivo leading to ""exhausted"" platelets had occurred. The proportion of 
circulating platelet-neutrophil complexes was significantly higher in COVID-19 
patients (mean±SD, 41±13%) than in patient controls (18±7%; 95% CI:11.1-34.1; 
P=0.0002) or healthy subjects (17±4%; 95% CI:13.8-33.8; P<0.0001). Analysis of 
neutrophil adhesion receptors revealed up-regulation of CD11b (α-subunit of 
αMβ2) and CD66b (CEACAM8) but not of CD162 (PSGL-1) in COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite reduced platelet responsiveness, platelet-neutrophil 
complexes are increased at early stages of moderate disease. Thus, this cellular 
interaction may occur in COVID-19 without preceding platelet activation."
458,"OBJECTIVES: Gout flares accompanied by urate lowering therapy (ULT) are prone to 
be related to the shrinkage of tophi from aggregated neutrophil extracellular 
traps (NETs) that had captured monosodium urate crystals in the tissues. In this 
study, we analysed the blocking effect of α1-antitrypsin on neutrophil elastase, 
which induced rapid inflammation in the presence of instable tophi.
METHODS: Serum cell-free DNA levels were compared between patients with various 
numbers of gout flares. We investigated whether serum cell-free DNA and 
α1-antitrypsin could be altered after ULT. A mimic of tophi formed in the murine 
peritoneal cavity by injection of MSU crystals was tested by 
immuno-fluorescence. Finally, we investigated the relapse of inflammation by 
α1-antitrypsin in two kinds of artificial tophi and in tophus-bearing mice.
RESULTS: Serum cell-free DNA correlated to the numbers of flares in patients 
with tophaceous gout. ULT induced serum cell-free DNA increase in patients with 
tophi. An increase of α1-antitrypsin was seen in patients with tophi who 
received ULT. Chalk-like tophi from the peritoneal cavity of mice after MSU 
crystals induced inflammation showed abundant co-expression of IL-1β and IL-6 
associated NETs. α1-antitrypsin induced the relapse of inflammation during the 
spontaneous resolution of MSU crystal-induced peritonitis. We observed that 
α1-antitrypsin blocks the cytokine degradation by neutrophil elastase during the 
resolution phase of tophi. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

CONCLUSION: ULT causes shrinkage of the tophi reflected by an increase of the 
level of serum cell-free DNA. In the resolution phase of murine tophi, the 
NET-associated neutrophil elastase degrades proinflammatory cytokines and, thus, 
ameliorates inflammation."
459,"Knowledge concerning the integration of genetic pathways mediating the responses 
to environmental cues controlling flowering initiation in crops is scarce. Here 
we reveal the diversity in oilseed rape (OSR) flowering response to high ambient 
temperature. Using a set of different spring OSR varieties, we found a 
consistent flowering delay at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, one of the 
varieties assayed exhibited the opposite behavior. Several FT-like paralogs are 
plausible candidates to be part of the florigen in OSR. We revealed that BnaFTA2 
plays a major role in temperature-dependent flowering initiation. Analysis of 
the H2A.Z histone variant occupancy at this locus in different B. napus 
varieties produced contrasting results, suggesting the involvement of additional 
molecular mechanisms in BnaFTA2 repression at high ambient temperature. 
Moreover, BnARP6 RNAi plants showed little accumulation of H2A.Z at high 
temperature while maintaining temperature sensitivity and delayed flowering. 
Furthermore, we found that H3K4me3 present in BnaFTA2 under inductive flowering 
conditions is reduced at high temperature, suggesting a role for this hallmark 
of transcriptionally active chromatin in the OSR flowering response to warming. 
Our work emphasizes the plasticity of flowering responses in B. napus and offers 
venues to optimize this process in crop species grown under suboptimal 
environmental conditions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

460,"The major predisposing factors of developing oral cancer include smoking, 
alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing. Betel quid chewing could cause the 
abrasion and damage of oral mucosa by crude fibers, chemical insults by additive 
slaked lime, and arecoline from areca nut. These would lead to the local 
consequence of oral submucosal fibrosis, which is regarded clinically as a 
precancer lesion and a major cause of trismus. In addition, the components and 
additives in betel quid contain chemical toxins and carcinogens, which would 
further affect the oral mucosa and gradually develop a malignancy. Following 
literature review, aside from having a greater total tumor burden and more local 
diseases in the oral cavity and digestive tract, patients with betel 
quid-related oral cancer also have more systemic diseases from metabolic 
syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and 
obesity than those without this habit. In conclusion, those patients who have 
the history of smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing would present 
much more unique clinical characteristics than those who only have a history of 
smoking and alcohol drinking. More attention should therefore be paid to 
pretreatment evaluation, treatment strategy, and posttreatment follow-up among 
betel quid chewers."
461,"This study aimed to evaluate the involvement of miR-125b and its 
interrelationship with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the control of 
basic ovarian granulosa cell functions. The effect of miR-125b mimics on basic 
functions of porcine ovarian granulosa cells cultured with and without FSH, and 
the effect of FSH on the expression of endogenous miR-125b was examined. 
Expression levels of miR-125b, viability, proliferation (accumulation of PCNA 
and cyclin B1), apoptosis (accumulation of bax and caspase 3), the accumulation 
of FSH receptors (FSHR), steroid hormones, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), 
oxytocin, and prostaglandin E2 release were analysed by reverse 
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Trypan blue exclusion 
test, quantitative immunocytochemistry, and ELISA. Transfection of cells with 
miR-125b mimics inhibited cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, the 
occurrence of FSHR, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and oxytocin release 
but stimulated prostaglandin E2 output. FSH promoted cell viability, 
proliferation, steroid hormones, IGF-I, oxytocin, and prostaglandin E2 output 
and reduced the expression of miR-125b and apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-125b 
mimics supported the effect of FSH on the release of estradiol, IGF-I, and 
prostaglandin E2, and inverted FSH influence on cell viability, proliferation, 
apoptosis, progesterone, and testosterone output. FSH supported both inhibitory 
and stimulatory action of miR-125b on ovarian cell functions. Present 
observations indicate that: miR-125b can be involved in the control of basic 
ovarian functions and that miR-125b and FSH are antagonists in their actions on 
ovarian cell functions. The ability of FSH to reduce miR-125b expression and the 
ability of miR-125b mimics to decrease the occurrence of FSHR and to modify FSH 
effects indicate the existence of the self-inhibiting FSH-miR-125b axis and that 
miR-125b can mediate the actions of FSH on ovarian cells."
462,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence supporting transmural remission (TR) as a long-term 
treatment target in Crohn's disease (CD) is still unavailable. Less stringent 
but more reachable targets such as isolated endoscopic (IER) or radiologic 
remission (IRR) may also be acceptable options in the long-term.
METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study including 404 CD patients evaluated by 
magnetic resonance enterography and colonoscopy. Five-year rates of 
hospitalization, surgery, use of steroids, and treatment escalation were 
compared between patients with TR, IER, IRR, and no remission (NR).
RESULTS: 20.8% of CD patients presented TR, 23.3% IER, 13.6% IRR and 42.3% NR. 
TR was associated with lower risk of hospitalization (odds-ratio [OR] 0.244 
[0.111-0.538], p < 0.001), surgery (OR 0.132 [0.030-0.585], p = 0.008), steroid 
use (OR 0.283 [0.159-0.505], p < 0.001), and treatment escalation (OR 0.088 
[0.044-0.176], p < 0.001) compared to no NR. IRR resulted in lower risk of 
hospitalization (OR 0.333 [0.143-0.777], p = 0.011) and treatment escalation (OR 
0.260 [0.125-0.540], p < 0.001), while IER reduced the risk of steroid use (OR 
0.442 [0.262-0.745], p = 0.002) and treatment escalation (OR 0.490 
[0.259-0.925], p = 0.028) compared to NR.
CONCLUSIONS: TR improved clinical outcomes over 5 years of follow-up in CD 
patients. Distinct but significant benefits were seen with IER and IRR. This 
suggests that both endoscopic and radiologic remission should be part of the 
treatment targets of CD."
463,"Mouth-related neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions are commonly found in dogs 
and cats, and their diagnosis and classification are important for treatment 
planning and prognosis. This retrospective study analyzed mouth-related lesions 
in dogs and cats between 2000-2019 from the animal pathology laboratory of the 
Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia. A total of 640 mouth-related 
lesions affecting 572 dogs (89.4%) and 68 cats (10.6%) were reviewed. Lesions 
were classified as neoplastic or non-neoplastic. The average age for neoplastic 
lesions was 8.6 years in dogs and 6.4 years in cats, while for non-neoplastic 
lesions the average age was 7.7 years for dogs and 5 years for cats. Data was 
analyzed using descriptive statistical methods according to year and source of 
report, demographic information for the animal, location of the lesion, and 
diagnosis. Tissue origin and behavior were variables considered for neoplastic 
lesions. Melanoma was the most common neoplasia in dogs and squamous cell 
carcinoma was most common in cats. The most frequent non-neoplastic lesion in 
dogs was gingival hyperplasia, while in cats the inflammatory lesions showed a 
wide range of morphological diagnoses. This study described many pathological 
lesions affecting the oral cavity for both dogs and cats and provides useful 
epidemiological data for both pathologists and clinicians."

465,"PURPOSE: In bovine retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, increased secretion 
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a positive linear association 
with proliferation of RPE. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) 
based improvement in grades of topographic retinal pigment epithelium 
alterations (RPE-A), were evaluated after intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, in 
diabetic macular edema (DME), for the first time.
METHODS: A tertiary care center-based, prospective study. Forty-four consecutive 
patients, 40-65 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with DME, were 
administered three doses of anti-VEGF therapy at monthly intervals. Pre- and 
post-intervention SD-OCT was done and central sub field thickness (CST), cube 
average thickness (CAT) and topographic grades of RPE-A were assessed using 
single layer RPE map (SL-RPE) as; Grade 0: No alterations, Grade 1: Alteration 
in two quadrants, Grade 2: Alteration in more than two quadrants.
RESULTS: CST decreased from 354.2 ± 16.0 µm pre-intervention to 233.2 ± 7.9 µm 
post-intervention. CAT reduced from 340.6 ± 6.5 µm pre-intervention to 
274.1 ± 5.1 µm post-intervention. Significant improvement in grades of RPE-A 
pre- v/s post-intervention were observed. (Grade 0: 0 v/s 39; Grade 1: 17 v/s 3; 
Grade 2: 27 v/s 2) (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Anti-VEGF therapy is associated with an improvement in grades of 
RPE-A in DME.The study was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India 
(CTRI/2019/03/018135)."
466,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is irreversible and fatal within 
3-5 years, with limited options for treatment. It is imperative to develop a 
symptom-based treatment that may increase the survival of ALS patients and 
improve their quality of life. Inflammation status, especially elevated 
interleukin 1β (IL1β), has been reported to play a critical role in ALS 
progression. Our study determined that neutralizing circulating IL1β slows down 
the progression of ALS in an ALS mouse model.
METHODS: The ALS mouse model was developed by microinjection of 
lentivirus-carrying OPTNE478G (optineurin, a mutation from ALS patients) into 
the intra-motor cortex of mice. Peripheral circulating IL1β was neutralized by 
injecting anti-IL1β antibody into the tail vein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were carried out 
to determine the protein and gene expression levels of IL1β. TUNEL assay was 
used to assess the neural cell death. Immunofluorescent staining of MAP2 and 
CASP3 was accomplished to evaluate neuronal cell apoptosis. Glial fibrillary 
acidic protein staining was performed to analyze the number of astrocytes. 
Rotarod test, grip strength test, balance beam test, and footprint test were 
conducted to assess the locomotive function after anti-IL1β treatment.
RESULTS: The model revealed that neuroinflammation contributes to ALS 
progression. ALS mice exhibited elevated neuroinflammation and IL1β secretion. 
After anti-IL1β treatment, ALS mice revealed decreased neural cell death and 
astrogliosis and gained improved muscle strength and motor ability.
CONCLUSIONS: Blocking IL1β is a promising strategy to slow down the progression 
of ALS."
467,"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within the cell can form biological 
condensates, which are increasingly recognized to play important roles in 
various biological processes. Most proteins involved in LLPS are known to be 
intrinsically disordered proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions 
(IDRs) with low complexity regions (LCRs). The proteins driving LLPS were 
selected from databases of LLPS-related proteins and then classified into three 
classes according to the components in the condensates. Through in silico 
analyses, we found that proteins in the homo class, those that induce LLPS 
without partner molecules, have different IDRs and LCRs compared with the 
reference proteome. In contrast, proteins in the other classes, those that 
induce LLPS with partner proteins (the hetero class) or nucleic acids (the mixed 
class), did not show a clear difference to the reference proteome in IDRs and 
LCRs. The hetero-class proteins contained structural domains to serve 
protein-protein interactions, and the mixed-class ones had the structural 
domains associated with nucleic acids. These results suggest that IDRs in the 
homo-class proteins have unique IDRs, which provide multivalent interaction 
sites required for LLPS, whereas the hetero- and mixed-class proteins can induce 
LLPS through the combination of the interaction among LCRs, structural domains, 
and nucleic acids."

genome has hampered the implementation of molecular techniques in its breeding, 
pharmacology, and domestication. We generated the chromosome-level genome 
assembly in Apocynaceae using combined SMRT sequencing and Hi-C. The genome 
length was 381.76 Mb, with 98.9% of it found on 11 chromosomes. The genome 
contained 222.63 Mb of repetitive sequences and 21,899 predicted gene models, 
with a contig N50 of 6.57 Mb. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that M. tenacissima 
diverged from Calotropis gigantea at least 13.43 million years ago. Comparative 
genomics showed that M. tenacissima underwent ancient shared whole-genome 
duplication. This event, together with tandem duplication, contributed to 70.71% 
of gene-family expansion. Both pseudogene analysis and selective pressure 
calculations suggested calcium-related adaptive evolution in the M. tenacissima 
genome. Calcium-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly 
enriched in cell-wall-related processes. Domains (e.g., Fasciclin and Amb_all), 
and cis-elements (e.g., MYB and MYC) frequently occurred in the coding and 
promoter regions of cell-wall DEGs, respectively, and the expression levels of 
these genes correlated significantly with those of calcium-signal-related 
transcription factors. Moreover, calcium addition increased tenacissoside I, G, 
and H contents. The availability of this high-quality genome provides valuable 
genomic information for genetic breeding and molecular design and lends insights 
into the calcium adaptation of M. tenacissima in karst areas."
469,"Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been a powerful 
technology for transcriptome analysis. However, the systematic validation of 
diverse computational tools used in scRNA-seq analysis remains challenging. 
Here, we propose a novel simulation tool, termed as Simulation of Cellular 
Heterogeneity (SimCH), for the flexible and comprehensive assessment of 
scRNA-seq computational methods. The Gaussian Copula framework is recruited to 
retain gene coexpression of experimental data shown to be associated with 
cellular heterogeneity. The synthetic count matrices generated by suitable SimCH 
modes closely match experimental data originating from either homogeneous or 
heterogeneous cell populations and either unique molecular identifier 
(UMI)-based or non-UMI-based techniques. We demonstrate how SimCH can benchmark 
several types of computational methods, including cell clustering, discovery of 
differentially expressed genes, trajectory inference, batch correction and 
imputation. Moreover, we show how SimCH can be used to conduct power evaluation 
of cell clustering methods. Given these merits, we believe that SimCH can 
accelerate single-cell research."
470,"Long noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs; LncRNAs) endowed with both 
protein-coding and noncoding functions are referred to as 'dual functional 
lncRNAs'. Recently, dual functional lncRNAs have been intensively studied and 
identified as involved in various fundamental cellular processes. However, apart 
from time-consuming and cell-type-specific experiments, there is virtually no in 
silico method for predicting the identity of dual functional lncRNAs. Here, we 
developed a deep-learning model with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, 
LncReader, to identify dual functional lncRNAs. Our data demonstrated that 
LncReader showed multiple advantages compared to various classical machine 
learning methods using benchmark datasets from our previously reported cncRNAdb 
project. Moreover, to obtain independent in-house datasets for robust testing, 
mass spectrometry proteomics combined with RNA-seq and Ribo-seq were applied in 
four leukaemia cell lines, which further confirmed that LncReader achieved the 
best performance compared to other tools. Therefore, LncReader provides an 
accurate and practical tool that enables fast dual functional lncRNA 
identification."
471,"Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of 
multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg 
cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic 
strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, we report a ""Trojan 
horse""-like hybrid system, nanocapsule-coupled Th17 cells, for MS treatment. 
Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently 
transmigrated across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and homed to the inflamed MS 
niche. Aminooxy-acetic acid (AOA), a transdifferentiation inducer, was locally 
released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. We 
demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enabled in situ phenotypic 
transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti-inflammatory Treg cells. This 
phenotypic conversion led to a domino-like immune response that was conducive to 
MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation 
of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory 
to anti-inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients 
suffering from other autoimmune diseases. This article is protected by

472,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of fusidic acid (FA) on human cervical, 
thyroid, and breast carcinoma cell lines to determine the potential usefulness 
of FA in cancer treatment.
METHODS: Six cancer cell lines (cervical cancer: Caski, HeLa; thyroid cancer: 
8505C, TPC1; and breast cancer: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) were treated with FA. 
Furthermore the changes in cell growth, cell cycle duration, and extent of 
apoptosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: After FA treatment, the cancer cells showed a decrease in growth rate. 
In the cell death assay, the cell populations were similar in each cell type 
after treatment with FA, indicating that growth inhibition by FA was not related 
to the induction of apoptosis. FA induced cell cycle arrest at a dose that 
inhibited growth rate, which varied in different cell types. G0/G1 phase arrest 
occurs in breast cancer, S phase arrest in 8505C thyroid cancer, and G2/M phase 
arrest in cervical cancer. These results indicate that FA reduces growth rates 
by inducing cell cycle arrest.
CONCLUSION: FA treatment can interfere with cell proliferation by inducing cell 
cycle arrest in human cervical, thyroid, and breast carcinoma cell lines. Thus, 
FA can be useful in treating human cervical, thyroid, and breast carcinomas."
473,"BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT), mainly caused by mutations in methyl-CpG 
binding protein 2 (MECP2), is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental 
disorders in girls. However, the underlying mechanism of MECP2 remains largely 
unknown and currently there is no effective treatment available for RTT.
METHODS: We generated MECP2-KO human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and 
differentiated them into neurons and cerebral organoids to investigate 
phenotypes of MECP2 loss-of-function, potential therapeutic agents, and the 
underlying mechanism by transcriptome sequencing.
RESULTS: We found that MECP2 deletion caused reduced number of hESCs-derived 
neurons and simplified dendritic morphology. Moreover, MECP2-KO cortical 
organoids exhibited fewer neural progenitor cells and neurons at day 60. 
Electrophysiological recordings showed that MECP2 deletion altered synaptic 
activity in organoids. Transcriptome analysis of organoids identified many genes 
in the PI3K-AKT pathway downregulated following MECP2 deletion. Treatment with 
either KW-2449 or VPA, small molecules for the activation of PI3K-AKT signaling 
pathway, alleviated neuronal deficits and transcriptome changes in MECP2-KO 
human neuronal models.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that KW-2449 and VPA might be promising 
drugs for RTT treatment."
474,"BACKGROUND: BMP9-stimulated DPSCs, SCAPs and PDLSCs are effective candidates for 
repairing maxillofacial bone defects in tissue engineering, while the most 
suitable seed cell source among these three hDMSCs and the optimal combination 
of most suitable type of hDMSCs and BMP9 have rarely been explored. Moreover, 
the orthotopic maxillofacial bone defect model should be valuable but laborious 
and time-consuming to evaluate various candidates for bone regeneration. Thus, 
inspired from the maxillofacial bone defects and the traditional in vivo ectopic 
systems, we developed an intrabony defect repair model to recapitulate the 
healing events of orthotopic maxillofacial bone defect repair and further 
explore the optimized combinations of most suitable hDMSCs and BMP9 for bone 
defect repair based on this modified ectopic system.
METHODS: Intrabony defect repair model was developed by using decellularized 
bone matrix (DBM) constructs prepared from the cancellous part of porcine lumbar 
vertebral body. We implanted DBM constructs subcutaneously on the flank of each 
male NU/NU athymic nude mouse, followed by directly injecting the cell 
suspension of different combinations of hDMSCs and BMP9 into the central hollow 
area of the constructs 7 days later. Then, the quality of the bony mass, 
including bone volume fraction (BV/TV), radiographic density (in Hounsfield 
units (HU)) and the height of newly formed bone, was measured by micro-CT. 
Furthermore, the H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed to 
exam new bone and new blood vessel formation in DBM constructs.
RESULTS: BMP9-stimulated periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) exhibited the 
most effective bone regeneration among the three types of hDMSCs in DBM 
constructs. Furthermore, an optimal dose of PDLSCs with a specific extent of 
BMP9 stimulation was confirmed for efficacious new bone and new blood vessel 
formation in DBM constructs.
CONCLUSIONS: The reported intrabony defect repair model can be used to identify 
optimized combinations of suitable seed cells and biological factors for bone 
defect repair and subsequent development of efficacious bone tissue engineering 
therapies."
475,"The treatment landscape of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) has undergone 
significant changes over the past 20 years. Gradual improvements have been made 
in the management of cHL patients, particularly in prolonging the survival rate 
for those in the relapsed setting. Most of these improvements came with the 
addition of brentuximab vedotin and PD1 blockade (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) 
into the current cHL treatment algorithms. On the other hand, the treatment 
approach to cHL has become more complex than ever before, with multiple ways to 
add and sequence therapies to achieve long-term remission. In this review, we 
will discuss the most up-to-date evidence on the management of cHL patients with 
the inclusion of ongoing clinical trials in cHL. We will provide a general 
overview of the current therapeutic landscape of cHL in light of these most 
recent data. We conclude with our perspective on how the approach to cHL 
treatment may evolve in the future."
476,"BACKGROUND: Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are promising for 
therapeutic use in cartilage repair, because of their capacity to differentiate 
into chondrocytes. Often, in vitro differentiation protocols employ the use of 
high amount of glucose, which does not reflect cartilage physiology. For this 
reason, we investigated how different concentrations of glucose can affect the 
chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs in cell culture pellets. Additionally, we 
investigated how fructose could influence the chondrogenic differentiation in 
vitro.
METHODS: BMSC were isolated from six donors and cultured in DMEM containing 
glucose at either 25 mM (HG), 5.5 mM (LG) or 1 mM (LLG), and 1% non-essential 
amino acids, 1% ITS+, in the presence of 100 nM dexamethasone, 50 µg/ml ascorbic 
acid-2 phosphate and 10 ng/ml TGF-β1. To investigate the effect of different 
metabolic substrates, other groups were exposed to additional 25 mM fructose. 
The media were replaced every second day until day 21 when all the pellets were 
harvested for further analyses. Biochemical analysis for glycosaminoglycans into 
pellets and released in medium was performed using the DMMB method. Expression 
of GLUT3 and GLUT5 was assayed by qPCR and validated using FACS analysis and 
immunofluorescence in monolayer cultures. Chondrogenic differentiation was 
further confirmed by qPCR analysis of COL2A1, COL1A1, COL10A1, ACAN, RUNX2, 
SOX9, SP7, MMP13, and PPARG, normalized on RPLP0. Type 2 collagen expression was 
subsequently validated by immunofluorescence analysis.
RESULTS: We show for the first time the presence of fructose transporter GLUT5 
in BMSC and its regulation during chondrogenic commitment. Additionally, 
decreasing glucose concentration during chondrogenesis dramatically decreased 
the yield of differentiation. However, the use of fructose alone or together 
with low glucose concentrations does not limit cell differentiation, but on the 
contrary it might help in maintaining a stable chondrogenic phenotype comparable 
with the standard culture conditions (high glucose).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that BMSC express GLUT5 and 
differentially regulate GLUT3 in the presence of glucose variation. This study 
gives a better comprehension of BMSCs sugar use during chondrogenesis."
477,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease characterized by upper and 
lower motor neuron (MN) loss with a signature feature of cytoplasmic aggregates 
containing TDP-43, which are detected in nearly all patients. Mutations in the 
gene that encodes TDP-43 (TARBDP) are known to result in both familial and 
sporadic ALS. In ALS, disruption of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) constitutes a 
critical event in disease pathogenesis, leading to denervation atrophy, motor 
impairments and disability. Morphological defects and impaired synaptic 
transmission at NMJs have been reported in several TDP-43 animal models and in 
vitro, linking TDP-43 dysregulation to the loss of NMJ integrity in ALS. Through 
the lens of the dying-back and dying-forward hypotheses of ALS, this review 
discusses the roles of TDP-43 related to synaptic function, with a focus on the 
potential molecular mechanisms occurring within MNs, skeletal muscles and glial 
cells that may contribute to NMJ disruption in ALS."
478,"BACKGROUND: In vivo-mimicking conditions are critical in in vitro cell analysis 
to obtain clinically relevant results. The required conditions, comparable to 
those prevalent in nature, can be provided by microfluidic dynamic cell 
cultures. Microfluidics can be used to fabricate and test the functionality and 
biocompatibility of newly developed nanosystems or to apply micro- and 
nanoelectromechanical systems embedded in a microfluidic system. However, the 
use of microfluidic systems is often hampered by their accessibility, 
acquisition cost, or customization, especially for scientists whose primary 
research focus is not microfluidics.
RESULTS: Here we present a method for 3D printing that can be applied without 
special prior knowledge and sophisticated equipment to produce various 
ready-to-use microfluidic components with a size of 100 µm. Compared to other 
available methods, 3D printing using fused deposition modeling (FDM) offers 
several advantages, such as time-reduction and avoidance of sophisticated 
equipment (e.g., photolithography), as well as excellent biocompatibility and 
avoidance of toxic, leaching chemicals or post-processing (e.g., 
stereolithography). We further demonstrate the ease of use of the method for two 
relevant applications: a cytotoxicity screening system and an osteoblastic 
differentiation assay. To our knowledge, this is the first time an application 
including treatment, long-term cell culture and analysis on one chip has been 
demonstrated in a directly 3D-printed microfluidic chip.
CONCLUSION: The direct 3D printing method is tested and validated for various 
microfluidic components that can be combined on a chip depending on the specific 
requirements of the experiment. The ease of use and production opens up the 
potential of microfluidics to a wide range of users, especially in biomedical 
research. Our demonstration of its use as a cytotoxicity screening system and as 
an assay for osteoblastic differentiation shows the methods potential in the 
development of novel biomedical applications. With the presented method, we aim 
to disseminate microfluidics as a standard method in biomedical research, thus 
improving the reproducibility and transferability of results to clinical 
applications."
479,"BACKGROUND: Risk of contralateral nodal metastases in oropharyngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is relatively low, however, many OPSCC patients receive 
bilateral neck treatment. This study evaluates the oncological outcomes with 
management of the contralateral cN0 neck based on lymphatic mapping with single 
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT).
METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of patients with lateralized cT1-2 and 
contralateral cN0 OPSCC treated with primary surgery between December 2017 and 
October 2019. All patients underwent pre-operative lymphatic mapping using 
SPECT-CT. Clinical parameters including demographics, tumor characteristics and 
oncological outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent primary site resection with transoral 
robotic surgery (TORS) and ipsilateral neck dissection with or without adjuvant 
therapy. Twelve patients (92.3%) had ipsilateral drainage on SPECT-CT, whereas 1 
(7.7%) patient had bilateral neck lymphatic drainage. Four patients (30.8%) 
underwent post-operative radiation therapy (PORT). Three patients with 
unilateral drainage on SPECT-CT underwent PORT with unilateral neck irradiation, 
and 1 patient with bilateral drainage underwent PORT with bilateral neck 
irradiation. Seven (53.8%) patients were staged as pT1, 6 (46.2%) patients as 
pT2, 6 (46.2%) patients were pN0, 3 (23.1%) patients were pN1, 1 (7.7%) patient 
was pN2a for and 3 (23.1%) patients were N2b. The median distance of the tumor 
from midline was 1.05 cm (0.0-1.58). Primary sites included tonsil (n = 10, 
76.9%) and tongue base (n = 3, 23.1%). The median follow-up time was 
15.4 months. All patients were disease free at the latest follow-up with no 
contralateral neck failures.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative mapping of lymphatic drainage in early stage OPSCC 
with SPECT-CT is a promising tool which can reduce treatment to the 
contralateral neck potentially without compromising oncological outcomes."
480,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive 
disorder that causes airway obstruction and lung inflammation. The first-line 
treatment of COPD is the bronchodilators of β2-agonists and antimuscarinic 
drugs, which can help control the airway obstruction, but the long-term use 
might render the drug tolerance. Bisphosphonates are widely used in 
osteoclast-mediated bone diseases treatment for decades. For drug repurposing, 
can delivery of a third generation of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, 
risedronate (RIS) ameliorate the progression of COPD?
METHODS: COPD rats or mice models have been established through 
cigarette-smoking and elastase injection, and then the animals are received RIS 
treatment via nebulization. Lung deposition of RIS was primarily assessed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The respiratory parameters of 
airway obstruction in COPD rats and mice were documented using plethysmography 
method and resistance-compliance system.
RESULTS: High lung deposition and bioavailability of RIS was monitored with 
88.8% of RIS input dose. We found that RIS could rescue the lung function 
decline of airspace enlargement and mean linear intercept in the COPD lung. RIS 
could curb the airway obstruction by suppressing 60% of the respiratory 
resistance and elevating the airway's dynamic compliance, tidal volume and 
mid-expiratory flow. As an inhibitor of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), 
RIS suppresses FDPS-mediated RAS and RhoA prenylation to obstruct its membrane 
localization in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), leading to the inhibition of 
downstream ERK-MLCK and ROCK1-MLCP pathway to cause ASMCs relaxation. 
Additionally, RIS nebulization impeded pro-inflammatory cell accumulation, 
particularly macrophages infiltration in alveolar parenchyma. The NF-κB, tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-6 declined in microphages following 
RIS nebulization. Surprisingly, nebulization of RIS could overcome the tolerance 
of β2-agonists in COPD-rats by increasing the expression of β2 receptors.
CONCLUSIONS: Nebulization of RIS could alleviate airway obstruction and lung 
inflammation in COPD, providing a novel strategy for treating COPD patients, 
even those with β2-agonists tolerance."
481,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has 
rapidly become a promising strategy for biomarker identification and 
development. The cell-type-specific nature of DNA methylation patterns and the 
direct relationship between cfDNA and apoptosis can potentially be used 
non-invasively to predict local alterations. In addition, direct detection of 
altered DNA methylation patterns performs well as a biomarker. In a previous 
study, we demonstrated marked DNA methylation alterations in brain tissue from 
patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis 
(MTLE-HS).
RESULTS: We performed DNA methylation profiling in cfDNA isolated from the serum 
of MTLE patients and healthy controls using BeadChip arrays followed by 
systematic bioinformatic analysis including deconvolution analysis and 
integration with DNase accessibility data sets. Differential cfDNA methylation 
analysis showed an overrepresentation of gene ontology terms and transcription 
factors related to central nervous system function and regulation. Deconvolution 
analysis of the DNA methylation data sets ruled out the possibility that the 
observed differences were due to changes in the proportional contribution of 
cortical neurons in cfDNA. Moreover, we found no overrepresentation of neuron- 
or glia-specific patterns in the described cfDNA methylation patterns. However, 
the MTLE-HS cfDNA methylation patterns featured a significant overrepresentation 
of the epileptic DNA methylation alterations previously observed in the 
hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of cfDNA methylation profiling as a 
rational approach to seeking non-invasive and reproducible epilepsy biomarkers."
482,"The eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model host utilized for whole 
cell biocatalytic conversions, protein evolution, and scientific inquiries into 
the pathogenesis of human disease. Over the past decade, the scale and pace of 
such studies has drastically increased alongside the advent of novel tools for 
both genome-wide studies and targeted genetic mutagenesis. In this review, we 
will detail past and present (e.g., CRISPR/Cas) genome-scale screening 
platforms, typically employed in the context of growth-based selections for 
improved whole cell phenotype or for mechanistic interrogations. We will further 
highlight recent advances that enable the rapid and often continuous evolution 
of biomolecules with improved function. Additionally, we will detail the 
corresponding advances in high throughput selection and screening strategies 
that are essential for assessing or isolating cellular and protein improvements. 
Finally, we will describe how future developments can continue to advance yeast 
high throughput engineering."
483,"BACKGROUND: Quality control (QC) of cells, a critical first step in single-cell 
RNA sequencing data analysis, has largely relied on arbitrarily fixed 
data-agnostic thresholds applied to QC metrics such as gene complexity and 
fraction of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes. The few existing data-driven 
approaches perform QC at the level of samples or studies without accounting for 
biological variation.
RESULTS: We first demonstrate that QC metrics vary with both tissue and cell 
types across technologies, study conditions, and species. We then propose 
data-driven QC (ddqc), an unsupervised adaptive QC framework to perform flexible 
and data-driven QC at the level of cell types while retaining critical 
biological insights and improved power for downstream analysis. ddqc applies an 
adaptive threshold based on the median absolute deviation on four QC metrics 
(gene and UMI complexity, fraction of reads mapping to mitochondrial and 
ribosomal genes). ddqc retains over a third more cells when compared to 
conventional data-agnostic QC filters. Finally, we show that ddqc recovers 
biologically meaningful trends in gradation of gene complexity among cell types 
that can help answer questions of biological interest such as which cell types 
express the least and most number of transcripts overall, and ribosomal 
transcripts specifically.
CONCLUSIONS: ddqc retains cell types such as metabolically active parenchymal 
cells and specialized cells such as neutrophils which are often lost by 
conventional QC. Taken together, our work proposes a revised paradigm to quality 
filtering best practices-iterative QC, providing a data-driven QC framework 
compatible with observed biological diversity."
484,"Most single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses begin with cell clustering; 
thus, the clustering accuracy considerably impacts the validity of downstream 
analyses. In contrast with the abundance of clustering methods, the tools to 
assess the clustering accuracy are limited. We propose a new Clustering 
Deviation Index (CDI) that measures the deviation of any clustering label set 
from the observed single-cell data. We conduct in silico and experimental 
scRNA-seq studies to show that CDI can select the optimal clustering label set. 
As a result, CDI also informs the optimal tuning parameters for any given 
clustering method and the correct number of cluster components."
485,"BACKGROUND: Antibody affinity maturation in vertebrates requires the enzyme 
activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) which initiates secondary antibody 
diversification by mutating the immunoglobulin loci. AID-driven antibody 
diversification is conserved across jawed vertebrates since bony and 
cartilaginous fish. Two exceptions have recently been reported, the Pipefish and 
Anglerfish, in which the AID-encoding aicda gene has been lost. Both cases are 
associated with unusual reproductive behavior, including male pregnancy and 
sexual parasitism. Several cold water fish in the Atlantic cod (Gadinae) family 
carry an aicda gene that encodes for a full-length enzyme but lack 
affinity-matured antibodies and rely on antibodies of broad antigenic 
specificity. Hence, we examined the functionality of their AID.
RESULTS: By combining genomics, transcriptomics, immune responsiveness, and 
functional enzymology of AID from 36 extant species, we demonstrate that AID of 
that Atlantic cod and related fish have extremely lethargic or no catalytic 
activity. Through ancestral reconstruction and functional enzymology of 71 AID 
enzymes, we show that this enzymatic inactivation likely took place relatively 
recently at the emergence of the true cod family (Gadidae) from their ancestral 
Gadiformes order. We show that this AID inactivation is not only concordant with 
the previously shown loss of key adaptive immune genes and expansion of innate 
and cell-based immune genes in the Gadiformes but is further reflected in the 
genomes of these fish in the form of loss of AID-favored sequence motifs in 
their immunoglobulin variable region genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent demonstrations of the loss of the aicda gene in two fish 
species challenge the paradigm that AID-driven secondary antibody 
diversification is absolutely conserved in jawed vertebrates. These species have 
unusual reproductive behaviors forming an evolutionary pressure for a certain 
loss of immunity to avoid tissue rejection. We report here an instance of 
catalytic inactivation and functional loss of AID rather than gene loss in a 
conventionally reproducing vertebrate. Our data suggest that an expanded innate 
immunity, in addition to lower pathogenic pressures in a cold environment 
relieved the pressure to maintain robust secondary antibody diversification. We 
suggest that in this unique scenario, the AID-mediated collateral genome-wide 
damage would form an evolutionary pressure to lose AID function."
486,"BACKGROUND: Pyrotinib (an irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor) plus capecitabine has 
survival benefits and acceptable tolerability in patients with HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer. We further assessed addition of pyrotinib to 
trastuzumab and docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.
METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 study (PHEDRA), 
treatment-naive women with HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer 
were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of oral 
pyrotinib or placebo (400 mg) once daily, plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg 
loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg) and docetaxel (100 mg/m2) every 3 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was the total pathological complete response (tpCR; ypT0/is and 
ypN0) rate per independent central review.
RESULTS: Between Jul 23, 2018, and Jan 8, 2021, 355 patients were randomly 
assigned, 178 to the pyrotinib group and 177 to the placebo group. The majority 
of patients completed four cycles of neoadjuvant treatment as planned (92.7% and 
97.7% in the pyrotinib and placebo groups, respectively). The tpCR rate was 
41.0% (95% CI 34.0 to 48.4) in the pyrotinib group compared with 22.0% (95% CI 
16.6 to 28.7) in the placebo group (difference, 19.0% [95% CI 9.5 to 28.4]; 
one-sided P < 0.0001). The objective response rate per investigator was 91.6% 
(95% CI 86.6 to 94.8) in the pyrotinib group and 81.9% (95% CI 75.6 to 86.9) in 
the placebo group after the neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in an increase of 
9.7% (95% CI 2.7 to 16.6). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were 
diarrhea (79 [44.4%] in the pyrotinib group and nine [5.1%] in the placebo 
group), neutropenia (33 [18.5%] and 36 [20.3%]), and decreased white blood cell 
count (29 [16.3%] and 24 [13.6%]). No deaths were reported during neoadjuvant 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint of the study was met. Neoadjuvant pyrotinib, 
trastuzumab, and docetaxel significantly improved the tpCR rate compared with 
placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel, with manageable toxicity, providing a new 
option for HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer.

487,"Epiphyseal plate injury, a common problem in pediatric orthopedics, may result 
in poor bone repair or growth defects. Epiphyseal plate, also known as growth 
plate is a layer of hyaline cartilage tissue between the epiphysis and 
metaphyseal and has the ability to grow longitudinally. Under normal 
physiological conditions, the epiphyseal plate has a certain axial resistance to 
stress, but it is fragile in growth phase and can be damaged by excessive 
stress, leading to detachment or avulsion of the epiphysis, resulting in 
life-long devastating consequences for patients. There is an obvious 
inflammatory response in the phase of growth plate injury, the limited 
physiological inflammatory response locally favors tissue repair and the 
organism, but uncontrolled chronic inflammation always leads to tissue 
destruction and disease progression. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), as representative 
inflammatory factors, not only affect the inflammatory phase response to bone 
and soft tissue injury, but have a potentially important role in the later 
repair phase, though the exact mechanism is not fully understood. At present, 
epiphyseal plate injuries are mainly treated by corrective and reconstructive 
surgery, which is highly invasive with limited effectiveness, thus new 
therapeutic approaches are urgently needed, so a deeper understanding and 
exploration of the pathological mechanisms of epiphyseal plate injuries at the 
cellular molecular level is an entry point. In this review, we fully introduced 
the key role of IL-1 in the progression of epiphyseal plate injury and repair, 
deeply explored the mechanism of IL-1 on the molecular transcript level and 
endocrine metabolism of chondrocytes from multiple aspects, and summarized other 
possible mechanisms to provide theoretical basis for the clinical treatment and 
in-depth study of epiphyseal plate injury in children."
488,"BACKGROUND: Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-exos) 
have been shown triggering osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of 
MSCs, but exosomes administered via bolus injections are rapidly sequestered and 
cleared. Therefore, we considered the implant as a new organ of patient's body 
and expected to find a method to treat implant with BMSC-exos in vivo directly.
METHODS: A fusion peptide (PEP), as a drug delivery system (DDS) which contained 
a titanium-binding peptide (TBP) possessing the ability to selectively bind to 
the titanium surface and another peptide CP05 being able to capture exosomes 
expertly, is constructed to modify the titanium surface.
RESULTS: Both in vitro and in vivo experiments prove PEP retains the ability to 
bind titanium and exosome simultaneously, and the DDS gain the ability to target 
exosomes to titanium implants surface following enhancing osseointegration 
post-implantation. Moreover, the DDS constructed by exosomes of diverse origins 
shows the similar combination rate and efficiency of therapy.
CONCLUSION: This drug delivery system demonstrates the concept that EXO-PEP 
system can offer an accurate and efficient therapy for treating implants with 
long-term effect."
489,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a crucial factor in the pathogenesis and development 
of acute kidney injury (AKI). Macrophages, as an important innate immune cell, 
regulate immune response and play a pathophysiological role in AKI. This study 
aimed to evaluate the predictive capacity of peripheral blood monocytes for the 
incidence of pulmonary infection-related AKI.
METHODS: We recruited 1038 hospitalized patients with pulmonary infections from 
January 1 to December 31, 2019, in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. 
Patients were divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Data on 
demographic characteristics, disease history, and biochemical indexes were 
retrieved from the electronic medical system. The composite inflammatory indexes 
were calculated as monocyte/(lymphocyte × platelet ratio) (MLPR). We applied 
dose-response relationship analyses to delineate the nonlinear odds ratio (OR) 
in different MLPR levels and integrated it into a logistic model to predict the 
risk of AKI.
RESULTS: The incidence of hospital-acquired AKI was 18.8% in the derivation 
cohort. Compared to non-AKI, the MLPR levels were significantly higher in AKI 
patients. Dose-response curve revealed that the increase of AKI risk was faster 
in the first half of MLPR and then tended to flatten. After classifying the MLPR 
levels into six groups, the AKI incidence increased from 4.5% to 55.3% with a 
peaking OR of 24.38. The AUC values of the AKI model only including MLPR were 
0.740, and after gradually integrating other covariates, the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (AUC) value reached 0.866, which was 
significantly higher than the AUC of full models without MLPR (0.822). Moreover, 
the better prediction ability of AKI was observed in the external validation, 
with an AUC of 0.899.
CONCLUSION: MLPR has good predictive efficiency in AKI, which can be used as a 
simple and easy clinical composite index to effectively predict early pulmonary 
infection-related AKI."
490,"BACKGROUND: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a rare neuromuscular 
disease including a growing and heterogeneous number of subtypes with variable 
phenotype. Their clinical and histopathological characteristics frequently 
overlap with other neuromuscular dystrophies. Our goal was to identify, by a 
non-invasive method, a molecular signature including biochemical and epigenetic 
parameters with potential value for patient prognosis and stratification.
RESULTS: Circulating miRNome was obtained by smallRNA-seq in plasma from LGMD 
patients (n = 6) and matched-controls (n = 6). Data, validated by qPCR in LGMD 
samples, were also examined in other common muscular dystrophies: Duchenne (DMD) 
(n = 5) and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) (n = 4). Additionally, 
biochemical and clinical parameters were analyzed. miRNome analysis showed that 
thirteen differentially expressed miRs could separate LGMD vs control group by 
hierarchical clustering. Most of differentially expressed miRs in LGMD patients 
were up-regulated (miR-122-5p, miR-122b-3p, miR-6511a-3p, miR-192-5p, 
miR-574-3p, mir-885-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-4646-3p, miR-203a-3p and miR-203b-5p) 
whilst only three of sequenced miRs were significantly down-regulated 
(miR-19b-3p, miR-7706, miR-323b-3p) when compared to matched controls. 
Bioinformatic analysis of target genes revealed cell cycle, muscle tissue 
development, regeneration and senescence as the most affected pathways. Four of 
these circulating miRs (miR-122-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-19b-3p and miR-323b-3p), 
together with the myomiR miR-206, were further analysed by qPCR in LGMD, DMD and 
FSHD. The receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) revealed high area 
under the curve (AUC) values for selected miRs in all groups, indicating that 
these miRs have good sensitivity and specificity to distinguish LGMD, DMD and 
FSHD patients from healthy controls. miR-122-5p, miR-192-5p and miR-323-3p were 
differentially expressed compared to matched-controls in all groups but 
apparently, each type of muscular dystrophy showed a specific pattern of miR 
expression. Finally, a strong correlation between miRs and biochemical data was 
only found in LGMD patients: while miR-192-5p and miR-122-5p negatively 
correlated with CK, miR-192-5p positively correlated with vitamin D3 and ALP.
CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by the small number of patients included in this 
study, we propose here a specific combination of circulating 
miR-122-5p/miR-192-5p/miR-323-3 and biochemical parameters as a potential 
molecular signature whose clinical value for LGMD patient prognosis and 
stratification should be further confirmed in a larger cohort of patients."
491,"BACKGROUND: Coleoid cephalopods have distinctive neural and morphological 
characteristics compared to other invertebrates. Early studies reported massive 
genomic rearrangements occurred before the split of octopus and squid lineages 
(Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 116:3030-5, 2019), which might be related to the 
neural innovations of their brain, yet the details remain elusive. Here we 
combine genomic and single-nucleus transcriptome analyses to investigate the 
octopod chromosome evolution and cerebral characteristics.
RESULTS: We present a chromosome-level genome assembly of a gold-ringed octopus, 
Amphioctopus fangsiao, and a single-nucleus transcriptome of its 
supra-esophageal brain. Chromosome-level synteny analyses estimate that the 
chromosomes of the ancestral octopods experienced multiple chromosome 
fission/fusion and loss/gain events by comparing with the nautilus genome as 
outgroup, and that a conserved genome organization was detected during the 
evolutionary process from the last common octopod ancestor to their descendants. 
Besides, protocadherin, GPCR, and C2H2 ZNF genes are thought to be highly 
related to the neural innovations in cephalopods (Nature 524:220-4, 2015), and 
the chromosome analyses pinpointed several collinear modes of these genes on the 
octopod chromosomes, such as the collinearity between PCDH and C2H2 ZNF, as well 
as between GPCR and C2H2 ZNF. Phylogenetic analyses show that the expansion of 
the octopod protocadherin genes is driven by a tandem-duplication mechanism on 
one single chromosome, including two separate expansions at 65 million years ago 
(Ma) and 8-14 Ma, respectively. Furthermore, we identify eight cell types (i.e., 
cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons) in the supra-esophageal brain of A. 
fangsiao, and the single-cell expression analyses reveal the co-expression of 
protocadherin and GPCR in specific neural cells, which may contribute to the 
neural development and signal transductions in the octopod brain.
CONCLUSIONS: The octopod genome analyses reveal the dynamic evolutionary history 
of octopod chromosomes and neural-related gene families. The single-nucleus 
transcriptomes of the supra-esophageal brain indicate their cellular 
heterogeneities and functional interactions with other tissues (i.e., gill), 
which provides a foundation for further octopod cerebral studies."
492,"BACKGROUND: Peer victimization is a crucial risk predictor for adolescent 
non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, adolescent NSSI reactions to peer 
victimization exhibit large individual differences. This study explored whether 
depression mediated the association between peer victimization and adolescent 
NSSI, and whether this mediating path was moderated by the 5-HTR2A gene rs6313 
polymorphism.
METHODS: A total of 667 adolescents (Meanage = 12.81, SD = 0.48) completed 
questionnaires regarding peer victimization, depression, and NSSI. Genomic DNA 
was extracted from saliva and buccal cells from each participant.
RESULTS: The results showed that the positive relation between peer 
victimization and adolescent NSSI was mediated by depression. Moreover, the 
triple interaction between peer victimization, rs6313 polymorphism, and gender 
on adolescent depression was significant. And the triple interaction between 
depression, rs6313 polymorphism, and gender on adolescent NSSI was also 
significant. Specifically, the risk effect of peer victimization on 
adolescent NSSI through increased depression was stronger for female adolescents 
with CC genotype than for female adolescents with CT or TT genotype, and male 
adolescents with CT or TT genotype. However, the indirect effect was 
nonsignificant for male adolescents with CC genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings promote the etiological understanding of adolescent 
NSSI, highlighting the mediating and moderating effect between peer 
victimization and NSSI, and adding evidence supporting the relationship between 
the 5-HTR2A gene rs6313 polymorphism, depression and adolescent NSSI."
493,"PURPOSE: To construct machine learning models for predicting progression free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
(ESCC) patients.
METHODS: 204 ESCC patients were randomly divided into training cohort (n = 143) 
and test cohort (n = 61) according to the ratio of 7:3. Two radiomics models 
were constructed by radiomics features, which were selected by LASSO Cox model 
to predict PFS and OS, respectively. Clinical features were selected by 
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model (p < 0.05). Combined 
radiomics and clinical model was developed by selected clinical and radiomics 
features. The receiver operating characteristic curve, Kaplan Meier curve and 
nomogram were used to display the capability of constructed models.
RESULTS: There were 944 radiomics features extracted based on volume of interest 
in CT images. There were six radiomics features and seven clinical features for 
PFS prediction and three radiomics features and three clinical features for OS 
prediction; The radiomics models showed general performance in training cohort 
and test cohort for prediction for prediction PFS (AUC, 0.664, 0.676. C-index, 
0.65, 0.64) and OS (AUC, 0.634, 0.646.C-index, 0.64, 0.65). The combined models 
displayed high performance in training cohort and test cohort for prediction PFS 
(AUC, 0.856, 0.833. C-index, 0.81, 0.79) and OS (AUC, 0.742, 0.768. C-index, 
0.72, 0.71).
CONCLUSION: We developed combined radiomics and clinical machine learning models 
with better performance than radiomics or clinical alone, which were used to 
accurate predict 3 years PFS and OS of non-surgical ESCC patients. The 
prediction results could provide a reference for clinical decision."
494,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is facing the 
dilemma of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance and disease recurrence. 
The dysfunctional DNA damage repair mechanism plays an essential role not only 
in the initiation and progression of hematological malignancies but also links 
to the development of TKI resistance. Deciphering the abnormally regulated DNA 
damage repair and proteins involved brings new insights into the therapy of 
leukemias. As a G2/M phase checkpoint kinase and a DNA damage repair checkpoint 
kinase engaged in the DNA damage response (DDR), along with an oncogenic driver 
present in various cancers, the particular involvement of Wee1 in DNA damage is 
far from clear. Deciphering its function and targeting it via modulating DNA 
repair pathways is important for improving our understanding of cancer 
treatment.
METHODS: Wee1 expression was assessed in cell lines using RT-qPCR and western 
blot, and Wee1 knockdown efficacy was validated using RT-qPCR, western blot, and 
immunofluorescence. Wee1 function was investigated by CCK-8, colony formation, 
and flow cytometry assay in vitro. Wee1 role in DNA repair and its interactions 
with other proteins were then studied using western blot, immunofluorescence, 
and double plasmid-repair studies. Finally, the CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay 
was utilized to investigate Wee1 and imatinib's synergistic effect, and a CML 
mouse model was constructed to study Wee1's role in carcinogenesis in vivo.
RESULTS: Wee1 was reported to respond quickly to DDR in an 
ATM-γH2AX-MDC1-dependent way upon DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occurrence, 
and it regulated homologous recombination by stimulating the recruitment of 
critical proteins RAD51/BRCA1 upon DSB sites. Wee1 was also revealed to be 
abnormally upregulated in CML cells. Further suppression of Wee1 not only causes 
cell cycle arrest and inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells but also 
enhances CML cell sensitivity to Imatinib in vitro and in vivo, possibly through 
an excessive accumulation of overall DSBs.
CONCLUSION: Wee1 is extensively involved in the DRR signaling and DSB repair 
pathway. Inhibiting abnormally elevated Wee1 benefits CML therapy in both 
IM-resistant and IM-sensitive cells. Our data demonstrated that Wee1 
participated in promoting cell proliferation and imatinib resistance in chronic 
myeloid leukemia via regulating DNA damage repair dependent on ATM-γH2AX-MDC1. 
In the fight against CML, Wee1's dysregulation in the DNA damage repair 
mechanism of CML pathogenesis makes it a viable therapeutic target in clinical 
applications."
495,"BACKGROUND: To find semi-quantitative and quantitative Positron Emission 
Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) imaging metrics of both tumor and 
non-malignant lymphoid tissue (bone marrow and spleen) for Progression Free 
Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) prediction in patients with 
relapsed/refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) undergoing Chimeric 
Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.
METHODS: A single-center prospective study of 16 r/r LBCL patients undergoing 
CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy. Whole body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/MR 
imaging pre-therapy and 3 weeks post-therapy were followed by manual 
segmentation of tumors and lymphoid tissues. Semi-quantitative and quantitative 
metrics were extracted, and the metric-wise rate of change (Δ) between 
post-therapy and pre-therapy calculated. Tumor metrics included maximum 
Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax), mean SUV (SUVmean), Metabolic Tumor Volume 
(MTV), Tumor Lesion Glycolysis (TLG), structural volume (V), total structural 
tumor burden (Vtotal) and mean Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADCmean). For 
lymphoid tissues, metrics extracted were SUVmean, mean Fat Fraction (FFmean) and 
ADCmean for bone marrow, and SUVmean, V and ADCmean for spleen. Univariate Cox 
regression analysis tested the relationship between extracted metrics and PFS 
and OS. Survival curves were produced using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared 
using the log-rank test, with the median used for dichotomization. Uncorrected 
p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Correction for 
multiple comparisons was performed, with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Pre-therapy (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) and Δ (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05) total 
tumor burden structural and metabolic metrics were associated with PFS and/or 
OS. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, a longer PFS was reached for patients 
with pre-therapy MTV ≤ 39.5 ml, ΔMTV≤1.35 and ΔTLG≤1.35. ΔSUVmax was associated 
with PFS (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05), while ΔADCmean was associated with both PFS and 
OS (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05). ΔADCmean > 0.92 gave longer PFS and OS in the 
Kaplan-Meier analysis. Pre-therapy bone marrow SUVmean was associated with PFS 
(p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) and OS (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05). For bone marrow FDG 
uptake, patient stratification was possible pre-therapy (SUVmean ≤ 1.8).
CONCLUSIONS: MTV, tumor ADCmean and FDG uptake in bone marrow unaffected by 
tumor infiltration are possible PET/MR parameters for prediction of PFS and OS 
in r/r LBCL treated with CAR T-cells.

496,"BACKGROUND: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes 
(iPSC-CMs) do not display all hallmarks of mature primary cardiomyocytes, 
especially the ability to use fatty acids (FA) as an energy source, containing 
high mitochondrial mass, presenting binucleation and increased DNA content per 
nuclei (polyploidism), and synchronized electrical conduction. This immaturity 
represents a bottleneck to their application in (1) disease modelling-as most 
cardiac (genetic) diseases have a middle-age onset-and (2) clinically relevant 
models, where integration and functional coupling are key. So far, several 
methods have been reported to enhance iPSC-CM maturation; however, these 
protocols are laborious, costly, and not easily scalable. Therefore, we 
developed a simple, low-cost, and rapid protocol to promote cardiomyocyte 
maturation using two small molecule activators of the peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor β/δ and gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPAR/PGC-1α) 
pathway: asiatic acid (AA) and GW501516 (GW). METHODS AND RESULTS: Monolayers of 
iPSC-CMs were incubated with AA or GW every other day for ten days resulting in 
increased expression of FA metabolism-related genes and markers for 
mitochondrial activity. AA-treated iPSC-CMs responsiveness to the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain inhibitors increased and exhibited higher flexibility in 
substrate utilization. Additionally, structural maturity improved after 
treatment as demonstrated by an increase in mRNA expression of 
sarcomeric-related genes and higher nuclear polyploidy in AA-treated samples. 
Furthermore, treatment led to increased ion channel gene expression and protein 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we developed a fast, easy, and economical method to 
induce iPSC-CMs maturation via PPAR/PGC-1α activation. Treatment with AA or GW 
led to increased metabolic, structural, functional, and electrophysiological 
maturation, evaluated using a multiparametric quality assessment."
497,"Obesity usually is accompanied by inflammation of fat tissue, with a prominent 
role of visceral fat. Chronic inflammation in obese fat tissue is of a lower 
grade than acute immune activation for clearing the tissue from an infectious 
agent. It is the loss of adipocyte metabolic homeostasis that causes activation 
of resident immune cells for supporting tissue functions and regaining 
homeostasis. Initially, the excess influx of lipids and glucose in the context 
of overnutrition is met by adipocyte growth and proliferation. Eventual lipid 
overload of hypertrophic adipocytes leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and 
the secretion of a variety of signals causing increased sympathetic tone, 
lipolysis by adipocytes, lipid uptake by macrophages, matrix remodeling, 
angiogenesis, and immune cell activation. Pro-inflammatory signaling of 
adipocytes causes the resident immune system to release increased amounts of 
pro-inflammatory and other mediators resulting in enhanced tissue-protective 
responses. With chronic overnutrition, these protective actions are 
insufficient, and death of adipocytes as well as senescence of several tissue 
cell types is seen. This structural damage causes the expression or release of 
immunostimulatory cell components resulting in influx and activation of 
monocytes and many other immune cell types, with a contribution of stromal 
cells. Matrix remodeling and angiogenesis is further intensified as well as 
possibly detrimental fibrosis. The accumulation of senescent cells also may be 
detrimental via eventual spread of senescence state from affected to neighboring 
cells by the release of microRNA-containing vesicles. Obese visceral fat 
inflammation can be viewed as an initially protective response in order to cope 
with excess ambient nutrients and restore tissue homeostasis but may contribute 
to tissue damage at a later stage."
498,"BACKGROUND: Periodontitis often causes irrevocable destruction of 
tooth-supporting tissues and eventually leads to tooth loss. Currently, stem 
cell-based tissue engineering has achieved a favorable result in regenerating 
periodontal tissues. Moreover, cell-free therapies that aim to facilitate the 
recruitment of resident repair cell populations to injured sites by promoting 
cell mobilization and homing have become alternative options to cell therapy.
MAIN TEXT: Cell aggregates (e.g., cell sheets) retain a large amount of 
extracellular matrix which can improve cell viability and survival rates after 
implantation in vivo. Electrostatic spinning and 3D bioprinting through 
fabricating specific alignments and interactions scaffold structures have made 
promising outcomes in the construction of a microenvironment conducive to 
periodontal regeneration. Cell-free therapies with adding biological agents 
(growth factors, exosomes and conditioned media) to promote endogenous 
regeneration have somewhat addressed the limitations of cell therapy.
CONCLUSION: Hence, this article reviews the progress of stem cell-based tissue 
engineering and advanced strategies for endogenous regeneration based on stem 
cell derivatives in periodontal regeneration."
499,"BACKGROUND: Sprouting angiogenesis is an important mechanism for morphogenetic 
phenomena, including organ development, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. 
In regenerative medicine, therapeutic angiogenesis is a clinical solution for 
recovery from ischemic diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been 
clinically used given their pro-angiogenic effects. MSCs are reported to promote 
angiogenesis by differentiating into pericytes or other vascular cells or 
through cell-cell communication using multiple protein-protein interactions. 
However, how MSCs physically contact and move around ECs to keep the sprouting 
angiogenesis active remains unknown.
METHODS: We proposed a novel framework of EC-MSC crosstalk analysis using human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and MSCs obtained from mice 
subcutaneous adipose tissue on a 3D in vitro model, microvessel-on-a-chip, which 
allows cell-to-tissue level study. The microvessels were fabricated and cultured 
for 10 days in a collagen matrix where MSCs were embedded.
RESULTS: Immunofluorescence imaging using a confocal laser microscope showed 
that MSCs smoothed the surface of the microvessel and elongated the angiogenic 
sprouts by binding to the microvessel's specific microstructures. Additionally, 
three-dimensional modeling of HUVEC-MSC intersections revealed that MSCs were 
selectively located around protrusions or roots of angiogenic sprouts, whose 
surface curvature was excessively low or high, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of our microvessel-on-a-chip system for 3D 
co-culture and image-based crosstalk analysis demonstrated that MSCs are 
selectively localized to concave-convex surfaces on scaffold structures and that 
they are responsible for the activation and stabilization of capillary vessels."
500,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment, patients with refractory colorectal 
cancer (CRC) still have poor long-term survival, so there is a need for more 
effective therapeutic options.
METHODS: To evaluate the HDAC8 inhibition efficacy as a CRC treatment, we 
examined the effects of various HDAC8 inhibitors (HDAC8i), including BMX 
(NBM-T-L-BMX-OS01) in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) or other standard CRC 
drugs on p53 mutated HT29 cells, as well as wild-type p53 HCT116 and RKO cells.
RESULTS: We showed that HDAC8i with TMZ cotreatment resulted in HT29 arrest in 
the S and G2/M phase, whereas HCT116 and RKO arrest in the G0/G1 phase was 
accompanied by high sub-G1. Subsequently, this combination approach upregulated 
p53-mediated MGMT inhibition, leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed the 
cotreatment also enabled triggering of cell senescence and decreased expression 
of stem cell biomarkers. Mechanistically, we found down-expression levels of 
β-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc via GSK3β/β-catenin signaling. Intriguingly, 
autophagy also contributes to cell death under the opposite status of 
β-catenin/p62 axis, suggesting that there exists a negative feedback regulation 
between Wnt/β-catenin and autophagy. Consistently, the Gene Set Enrichment 
Analysis (GSEA) indicated both apoptotic and autophagy biomarkers in HT29 and 
RKO were upregulated after treating with BMX.
CONCLUSIONS: BMX may act as a HDAC8 eraser and in combination with reframed-TMZ 
generates a remarkable synergic effect, providing a novel therapeutic target for 
various CRCs. Video Abstract."
501,"BACKGROUND: Whole-cell biotransformation is a promising emerging technology for 
the production of chemicals. When using heterotrophic organisms such as E. coli 
and yeast as biocatalysts, the dependence on organic carbon source impairs the 
sustainability and economic viability of the process. As a promising 
alternative, photosynthetic cyanobacteria with low nutrient requirements and 
versatile metabolism, could offer a sustainable platform for the heterologous 
production of organic compounds directly from sunlight and CO2. This strategy 
has been applied for the photoautotrophic production of sucrose by a genetically 
engineered cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain S02. As the key 
concept in the current work, this can be further used to generate organic carbon 
compounds for different heterotrophic applications, including for the whole-cell 
biotransformation by yeast and bacteria.
RESULTS: Entrapment of Synechocystis S02 cells in Ca2+-cross-linked alginate 
hydrogel beads improves the specific sucrose productivity by 86% compared to 
suspension cultures during 7 days of cultivation under salt stress. The process 
was further prolonged by periodically changing the medium in the vials for up to 
17 days of efficient production, giving the final sucrose yield slightly above 
3000 mg l-1. We successfully demonstrated that the medium enriched with 
photosynthetically produced sucrose by immobilized Synechocystis S02 cells 
supports the biotransformation of cyclohexanone to ε-caprolactone by the E. coli 
WΔcscR Inv:Parvi strain engineered to (i) utilize low concentrations of sucrose 
and (ii) perform biotransformation of cyclohexanone to ε-caprolactone.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that cell entrapment in Ca2+-alginate beads is an 
effective method to prolong sucrose production by the engineered cyanobacteria, 
while allowing efficient separation of the cells from the medium. This advantage 
opens up novel possibilities to create advanced autotroph-heterotroph coupled 
cultivation systems for solar-driven production of chemicals via 
biotransformation, as demonstrated in this work by utilizing the 
photosynthetically produced sucrose to drive the conversion of cyclohexanone to 
ε-caprolactone by engineered E. coli."
502,"BACKGROUND: Despite a global prevalence of photosynthetic organisms in the 
ocean's mesophotic zone (30-200+ m depth), the mechanisms that enable 
photosynthesis to proceed in this low light environment are poorly defined. Red 
coralline algae are the deepest known marine benthic macroalgae - here we 
investigated the light harvesting mechanism and mesophotic acclimatory response 
of the red coralline alga Lithothamnion glaciale.
RESULTS: Following initial absorption by phycourobilin and phycoerythrobilin in 
phycoerythrin, energy was transferred from the phycobilisome to photosystems I 
and II within 120 ps. This enabled delivery of 94% of excitations to reaction 
centres. Low light intensity, and to a lesser extent a mesophotic spectrum, 
caused significant acclimatory change in chromophores and biliproteins, 
including a 10% increase in phycoerythrin light harvesting capacity and a 20% 
reduction in chlorophyll-a concentration and photon requirements for 
photosystems I and II. The rate of energy transfer remained consistent across 
experimental treatments, indicating an acclimatory response that maintains 
energy transfer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that responsive light harvesting by 
phycobilisomes and photosystem functional acclimation are key to red algal 
success in the mesophotic zone."
503,"Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell-cycle arrest with secretory 
features in response to cellular stress. Historically, it has been considered as 
an endogenous evolutionary homeostatic mechanism to eliminate damaged cells, 
including damaged cells which are at risk of malignant transformation, thereby 
protecting against cancer. However, accumulation of senescent cells can cause 
long-term detrimental effects, mainly through the senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype, and paradoxically contribute to age-related diseases 
including cancer. Besides its role as tumor suppressor, cellular senescence is 
increasingly being recognized as an in vivo response in cancer patients to 
various anticancer therapies. Its role in cancer is ambiguous and even 
controversial, and senescence has recently been promoted as an emerging hallmark 
of cancer because of its hallmark-promoting capabilities. In addition, the 
prognostic implications of cellular senescence have been underappreciated due to 
the challenging detection and sparse in and ex vivo evidence of cellular 
senescence in cancer patients, which is only now catching up. In this review, we 
highlight the approaches and current challenges of in and ex vivo detection of 
cellular senescence in cancer patients, and we discuss the prognostic 
implications of cellular senescence based on in and ex vivo evidence in cancer 
patients."
504,"BACKGROUND: Genetic variants within nearly 1000 loci are known to contribute to 
modulation of blood lipid levels. However, the biological pathways underlying 
these associations are frequently unknown, limiting understanding of these 
findings and hindering downstream translational efforts such as drug target 
discovery.
RESULTS: To expand our understanding of the underlying biological pathways and 
mechanisms controlling blood lipid levels, we leverage a large multi-ancestry 
meta-analysis (N = 1,654,960) of blood lipids to prioritize putative causal 
genes for 2286 lipid associations using six gene prediction approaches. Using 
phenome-wide association (PheWAS) scans, we identify relationships of 
genetically predicted lipid levels to other diseases and conditions. We confirm 
known pleiotropic associations with cardiovascular phenotypes and determine 
novel associations, notably with cholelithiasis risk. We perform sex-stratified 
GWAS meta-analysis of lipid levels and show that 3-5% of autosomal 
lipid-associated loci demonstrate sex-biased effects. Finally, we report 21 
novel lipid loci identified on the X chromosome. Many of the sex-biased 
autosomal and X chromosome lipid loci show pleiotropic associations with sex 
hormones, emphasizing the role of hormone regulation in lipid metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings provide insights into the biological 
mechanisms through which associated variants lead to altered lipid levels and 
potentially cardiovascular disease risk."
505,"BACKGROUND: The role of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and macrophage 
polarization in periodontal tissue regeneration and bone remodeling during 
orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) has been well documented. Nevertheless, the 
interactions between macrophages and PDLSCs in OTM remain to be investigated. 
Consequently, the present study was proposed to explore the effect of different 
polarization states of macrophages on the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs.
METHODS: After M0, M1 and M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M0-exo, M1-exo and 
M2-exo) treatment of primary cultured human PDLSCs, respectively, mineralized 
nodules were observed by Alizarin red S staining, and the expression of ALP and 
OCN mRNA and protein were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, 
correspondingly. Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs (DE-miRNA) 
in M0-exo and M2-exo by miRNA microarray, and GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of 
DE-miRNA targets, and construction of protein-protein interaction networks.
RESULTS: M2-exo augmented mineralized nodule formation and upregulated ALP and 
OCN expression in PDLSCs, while M0-exo had no significant effect. Compared to 
M0-exo, a total of 52 DE-miRNAs were identified in M2-exo. The expression of 
hsa-miR-6507-3p, hsa-miR-4731-3p, hsa-miR-4728-3p, hsa-miR-3614-5p and 
hsa-miR-6785-3p was significantly down-regulated, and the expression of 
hsa-miR-6085, hsa-miR-4800-5p, hsa-miR-4778-5p, hsa-miR-6780b-5p and 
hsa-miR-1227-5p was significantly up-regulated in M2-exo compared to M0-exo. GO 
and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the downstream targets of DE-miRNAs 
were mainly involved in the differentiation and migration of multiple cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have indicated for the first time that M2-exo can 
promote osteogenic differentiation of human PDLSCs, and have revealed the 
functions and pathways involved in the DE-miRNAs of M0-exo and M2-exo and their 
downstream targets."
506,"BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer 
worldwide and it has a poor prognosis for patients with distant metastasis. 
Nomograms are frequently used in clinical research, but no research has 
evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic factors of distant metastasis in 
urothelial bladder cancer (UBC).
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to 
analyze all patients diagnosed with UBC between 2000 and 2017. Lasso regression 
was used to identify the potential risk predictive factors for distant 
metastasis in UBC. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression analyses were performed to determine independent prognostic factors 
for distant metastasis urothelial bladder cancer (DMUBC). Subsequently, two 
nomograms were constructed based on the above models. The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC), and calibration curves were performed to evaluate the two 
nomograms.
RESULTS: The study included 73,264 patients with UBC, with 2,129 (2.9%) having 
distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. In the diagnostic model, tumor 
size, histologic type, and stage N and T were all important risk predictive 
factors for distant metastasis of UBC. In the prognostic model, age, tumor size, 
surgery, and chemotherapy were independent factors affecting the prognosis of 
DMUBC. DCA, ROC, calibration, and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves reveal that 
the two nomograms can effectively predict the diagnosis and prognosis of DMUBC.
CONCLUSION: The developed nomograms are practical methods for predicting the 
occurrence risk and prognosis of distant metastasis urothelial bladder cancer 
patients, which may benefit the clinical decision-making process."
507,"BACKGROUND: Molecule interacting with CasL 1 (MICAL1), a multidomain 
flavoprotein monooxygenase, is strongly involved in the biological processes 
related to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. However, there were few 
reports on the clinical significance of MICAL1 in renal clear cell carcinoma.
METHODS: The expression and prognostic value of MICAL1 in renal clear cell 
carcinoma were explored using immunohistochemical assays, public TCGA-KIRC 
databases and multiple analysis methods, including survival analysis, univariate 
and multivariate analyses, KEGG and GSEA. Wound healing and Transwell assays 
were performed to check the 786-O cell and Caki-1 cell migration abilities after 
knockdown of MICAL1. Western blotting was used to assess the regulatory effect 
of MICAL1 on the Rac1 activation. Additionally, the function of MICAL1 and the 
correlations between MICAL1 and immune infiltration levels in KIRC were 
investigated using TIMER and TISIDB.
RESULTS: MICAL1 expression was significantly higher in carcinoma tissue compared 
with non-cancerous tissue. A survival analysis revealed that patients with high 
MICAL1 expression had shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-specific 
survival (DSS) compared with patients with low MICAL1 expression. ROC analysis 
also confirmed that MICAL1 has a high diagnostic value in KIRC. Importantly, the 
univariate and multivariate Cox analysis further confirmed that high MICAL1 
expression was an independent risk factor for OS in patients with KIRC. In 
accordance with this, knockdown of MICAL1 expression decreased Rac1 activation 
and cell migration. KEGG and GSEA analysis revealed that the immune infiltration 
and Ras signaling pathways were significantly upregulated in the high MICAL1 
expression group. In terms of immune infiltrating levels, MICAL1 expression was 
positively associated with CD8+/Treg cell infiltration levels. Specifically, 
bioinformatic analysis showed that MICAL1 expression had strong relationships 
with various T cell exhaustion markers.
CONCLUSIONS: MICAL1 expression may act as a prognostic biomarker for determining 
the prognosis in renal clear cell carcinoma and plays an important role in 
regulating tumor immune microenvironment and cell migratory capacity."
508,"BACKGROUND: SMYD3, a member of the SET and MYND domain-containing (SMYD) family, 
is a histone methyltransferase (HMT) and transcription factor that plays an 
important role in transcriptional regulation in human carcinogenesis.
RESULTS: Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry assays to identify 
SMYD3-associated proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, we found 
several previously undiscovered SMYD3-interacting proteins, including the NuRD 
(MTA1/2) complex, the METTL family, and the CRL4B complex. Transcriptomic 
analysis of the consequences of knocking down SMYD3, MTA1, or MTA2 in HCC cells 
showed that SMYD3/NuRD complex targets a cohort of genes, some of which are 
critically involved in cell growth and migration. qChIP analyses showed that 
SMYD3 knockdown led to a significant reduction in the binding of MTA1 or MTA2 to 
the promoters of IGFBP4 and led to a significant decrease in H4K20me3 and a 
marked increase in H4Ac at the IGFBP4 promoter. In addition, we demonstrated 
that SMYD3 promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in vivo and 
in vitro and found that its expression is markedly upregulated in human liver 
cancer. Knockdown of MTA1 or MTA2 had the same effect as knockdown of SMYD3 on 
proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Catalytic mutant 
SMYD3 could not rescue the phenotypic effects caused by knockdown of SMYD3. 
Inhibitors of SMYD3 effectively inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of 
HCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed that SMYD3 could transcriptionally repress 
a cohort of target genes expression by associating with the NuRD (MTA1/2) 
complex, thereby promoting the proliferation and invasiveness of HCC cells. Our 
results support the case for pursuing SMYD3 as a practical prognostic marker or 
therapeutic target against HCC."
509,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes coronavirus 
disease 19 (COVID-19). The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is also rapidly 
increasing worldwide, posing a significant challenge to human safety. Asthma is 
a risk factor for COVID-19, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of the 
asthma-COVID-19 interaction remain unclear.
METHODS: We used transcriptome analysis to discover molecular biomarkers common 
to asthma and COVID-19. Gene Expression Omnibus database RNA-seq datasets 
(GSE195599 and GSE196822) were used to identify differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) in asthma and COVID-19 patients. After intersecting the differentially 
expressed mRNAs, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to identify the common pathogenic 
molecular mechanism. Bioinformatic methods were used to construct 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identify key genes from the 
networks. An online database was used to predict interactions between 
transcription factors and key genes. The differentially expressed long noncoding 
RNAs (lncRNAs) in the GSE195599 and GSE196822 datasets were intersected to 
construct a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network. Interaction 
networks were constructed for key genes with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and 
oxidative stress-related proteins. The diagnostic efficacy of key genes in 
COVID-19 was verified with the GSE171110 dataset. The differential expression of 
key genes in asthma was verified with the GSE69683 dataset. An asthma cell model 
was established with interleukins (IL-4, IL-13 and IL-17A) and transfected with 
siRNA-CXCR1. The role of CXCR1 in asthma development was preliminarily 
confirmed.
RESULTS: By intersecting the differentially expressed genes for COVID-19 and 
asthma, 393 common DEGs were obtained. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the 
DEGs showed that they mainly affected inflammation-, cytokine- and 
immune-related functions and inflammation-related signaling pathways. By 
analyzing the PPI network, we obtained 10 key genes: TLR4, TLR2, MMP9, EGF, HCK, 
FCGR2A, SELP, NFKBIA, CXCR1, and SELL. By intersecting the differentially 
expressed lncRNAs for COVID-19 and asthma, 13 common differentially expressed 
lncRNAs were obtained. LncRNAs that regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) were mainly 
concentrated in intercellular signal transduction, apoptosis, immunity and other 
related functional pathways. The ceRNA network suggested that there were a 
variety of regulatory miRNAs and lncRNAs upstream of the key genes. The key 
genes could also bind a variety of RBPs and oxidative stress-related genes. The 
key genes also had good diagnostic value in the verification set. In the 
validation set, the expression of key genes was statistically significant in 
both the COVID-19 group and the asthma group compared with the healthy control 
group. CXCR1 expression was upregulated in asthma cell models, and interference 
with CXCR1 expression significantly reduced cell viability.
CONCLUSIONS: Key genes may become diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of 
outcomes in COVID-19 and asthma. Video Abstract."
510,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing adaptation of plants to their environment is the basis 
for their survival. In this adaptation, mechanoperception of gravity and local 
curvature plays a role of prime importance in finely regulating growth and 
ensuring a dynamic balance preventing buckling. However, the abiotic environment 
is not the exclusive cause of mechanical stimuli. Biotic interactions between 
plants and microorganisms also involve physical forces and potentially 
mechanoperception. Whether pathogens trigger mechanoperception in plants and the 
impact of mechanotransduction on the regulation of plant defense remains however 
elusive.
RESULTS: Here, we found that the perception of pathogen-derived mechanical cues 
by microtubules potentiates the spatio-temporal implementation of plant immunity 
to fungus. By combining biomechanics modeling and image analysis of the 
post-invasion stage, we reveal that fungal colonization releases plant cell 
wall-born tension locally, causing fluctuations of tensile stress in walls of 
healthy cells distant from the infection site. In healthy cells, the 
pathogen-derived mechanical cues guide the reorganization of mechanosensing 
cortical microtubules (CMT). The anisotropic patterning of CMTs is required for 
the regulation of immunity-related genes in distal cells. The CMT-mediated 
mechanotransduction of pathogen-derived cues increases Arabidopsis disease 
resistance by 40% when challenged with the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
CONCLUSIONS: CMT anisotropic patterning triggered by pathogen-derived mechanical 
cues activates the implementation of early plant defense in cells distant from 
the infection site. We propose that the mechano-signaling triggered immunity 
(MTI) complements the molecular signals involved in pattern and 
effector-triggered immunity."
511,"BACKGROUND: Regenerative medicine has the potential to treat genetic disorders 
and replace damaged or missing tissue. The use of donor or animal tissue raises 
many well-known issues, including limited tissue availability, the possibility 
of rejection and patient infection. Stem cell therapy raised hope of overcoming 
these issues, but created new risks including tumour formation and limited 
benefit if the desired target tissue does not form. The recent development of 
3-dimensional tissues, including organoids, allows the creation of more complex 
tissues for personalised regenerative medicine.
METHODS: This article details the potential health risks of 3-dimensional 
organoid and tissue therapy versus dissociated stem cell therapy. The current 
ethical and regulatory issues surrounding 3-dimensional organoid and tissue 
therapy are presented with a focus on the highly influential FDA and 
International Society of Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential use of 3-dimensional organoid and tissue therapy may 
deliver greater patient benefits than other regenerative medicine approaches, 
but raises new health and ethical risks. Preclinical testing of these therapies 
will not mitigate some of their risks; they may only be understood after 
first-in-human trials. The potential irreversibility and high risk of these 
therapies affects how clinical trials should be structured, including post-trial 
care for participants."
512,"BACKGROUND: Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN) accounts for a 
main cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic renal failure and uremia. 
This paper aimed to examine the effect of Ntrk1 on MsPGN development, so as to 
identify a novel therapeutic target for MsPGN.
METHODS: The MsPGN rat model was constructed by single injection of Thy1.1 
monoclonal antibody via the tail vein. Additionally, the Ntrk1 knockdown rat 
model was established by injection of Ntrk1-RNAi lentivirus via the tail vein. 
Periodic acid-schiff staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on 
kidney tissues. Moreover, the rat urinary protein was detected. Mesangial cells 
were transfected and treated with p38 inhibitor (SB202190) and ERK inhibitor 
(PD98059). Meanwhile, the viability and proliferation of mesangial cells were 
analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays. 
Gene expression was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) and Western-blot (WB) assays.
RESULTS: The proliferation of mesangial cells was enhanced in glomerulus and 
Ki67 expression was up-regulated in renal tubule of MsPGN rats. The urine 
protein level increased in MsPGN rats. Pro-inflammatory factors and Ntrk1 
expression were up-regulated in glomerulus of MsPGN rats. Ntrk1 up-regulation 
promoted the viability, proliferation, expression of pro-inflammatory factors 
and activation of the STAT3, p38 and ERK signaling pathways in mesangial cells. 
Ntrk1 knockdown reduced mesangial cell proliferation, urine protein, 
pro-inflammatory factors, activation of STAT3, p38 and ERK signaling pathways in 
glomerulus, and decreased Ki67 expression in renal tubule of MsPGN rats. 
Treatment with SB202190 and PD98059 reversed the effect of Ntrk1 on promoting 
the viability, proliferation and inflammatory response of mesangial cells.
CONCLUSION: Ntrk1 promoted mesangial cell proliferation and inflammation in 
MsPGN rats by activating the STAT3 and p38/ERK MAPK signaling pathways."
513,"BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common malignant tumor that 
seriously affects human health. Previous studies have indicated that abnormal 
levels of glycosylation promote progression and poor prognosis of lung cancer. 
Thus, the present study aimed to explore the prognostic signature related to 
glycosyltransferases (GTs) for LUAD.
METHODS: The gene expression profiles were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) database, and GTs were obtained from the GlycomeDB database. 
Differentially expressed GTs-related genes (DGTs) were identified using edge 
package and Venn diagram. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG), and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) methods were used to 
investigate the biological processes of DGTs. Subsequently, Cox and Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analyses were 
performed to construct a prognostic model for LUAD. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis 
was adopted to explore the overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients. The accuracy 
and specificity of the prognostic model were evaluated by receiver operating 
characteristic analysis (ROC). In addition, single-sample gene set enrichment 
analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was used to analyze the infiltrating immune cells in 
the tumor environment.
RESULTS: A total of 48 DGTs were mainly enriched in the processes of 
glycosylation, glycoprotein biosynthetic process, glycosphingolipid 
biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series, and cell-mediated immune response. 
Furthermore, B3GNT3, MFNG, GYLTL1B, ALG3, and GALNT13 were screened as 
prognostic genes to construct a risk model for LUAD, and the LUAD patients were 
divided into high- and low-risk groups. K-M curve suggested that patients with a 
high-risk score had shorter OS than those with a low-risk score. The ROC 
analysis demonstrated that the risk model efficiently diagnoses LUAD. 
Additionally, the proportion of infiltrating aDCs (p < 0.05) and Tgds (p < 0.01) 
was higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. Spearman's 
correlation analysis manifested that the prognostic genes (MFNG and ALG3) were 
significantly correlated with infiltrating immune cells.
CONCLUSION: In summary, this study established a novel GTs-related risk model 
for the prognosis of LUAD patients, providing new therapeutic targets for LUAD. 
However, the biological role of glycosylation-related genes in LUAD needs to be 
explored further."
514,"BACKGROUND: Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by 
the destruction of exocrine glands, resulting in dry mouth and eyes. Currently, 
there is no effective treatment for SS, and the mechanisms associated with 
inadequate salivary secretion are poorly understood.
METHODS: In this study, we used NOD mice model to monitor changes in mice's 
salivary secretion and water consumption. Tissue morphology of the submandibular 
glands was examined by H&E staining, and Immunohistochemical detected the 
expression of AQP5 (an essential protein in salivary secretion). Global gene 
expression profiling was performed on submandibular gland tissue of extracted 
NOD mice model using RNA-seq. Subsequently, a series of bioinformatics analyses 
of transcriptome sequencing was performed, including differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) identification, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, PPI network construction, hub gene 
identification, and the validity of diagnostic indicators using the dataset 
GSE40611. Finally, IFN-γ was used to treat the cells, the submandibular gland 
tissue of NOD mice model was extracted, and RT-qPCR was applied to verify the 
expression of hub genes.
RESULTS: We found that NOD mice model had reduced salivary secretion and 
increased water consumption. H&E staining suggests acinar destruction and 
basement membrane changes in glandular tissue. Immunohistochemistry detects a 
decrease in AQP5 immunostaining within acinar. In transcriptome sequencing, 42 
overlapping DEGs were identified, and hub genes (REN, A2M, SNCA, KLK3, TTR, and 
AZGP1) were identified as initiating targets for insulin signaling. In addition, 
insulin signaling and cAMP signaling are potential pathways for regulating 
salivary secretion and constructing a regulatory relationship between 
target-cAMP signaling-salivary secretion.
CONCLUSION: The new potential targets and signal axes for regulating salivary 
secretion provide a strategy for SS therapy in a clinical setting."
515,"Phenotypic evolution is often caused by variation in gene expression resulting 
from altered gene regulatory mechanisms. Genetic variation affecting chromatin 
remodeling has been identified as a potential source of variable gene 
expression; however, the roles of specific chromatin remodeling factors remain 
unclear. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining the relationship 
between variation in gene expression, variation in chromatin structure, and 
variation in binding of the pioneer factor Grainy head between imaginal wing 
discs of two divergent strains of Drosophila melanogaster and their F1 hybrid. 
We find that (1) variation in Grainy head binding is mostly due to sequence 
changes that act in cis but are located outside of the canonical Grainy head 
binding motif, (2) variation in Grainy head binding correlates with changes in 
chromatin accessibility, and (3) this variation in chromatin accessibility, 
coupled with variation in Grainy head binding, correlates with variation in gene 
expression in some cases but not others. Interactions among these three 
molecular layers is complex, but these results suggest that genetic variation 
affecting the binding of pioneer factors contributes to variation in chromatin 
remodeling and the evolution of gene expression."
516,"Phototheranostics has received sustained attention due to its great potential in 
revolutionizing conventional strategies of cancer treatment. However, trapped by 
the complexity, poor reproducibility, insufficient phototheranostic outputs, and 
inevitable damage to normal tissue of most multicomponent phototheranostic 
systems, its clinical translation has been severely hindered. Therefore, the 
exploration of ""one for all"" smart phototheranostic agents with versatile 
functionalities remains an appealing yet enormously challenging task. Herein, a 
reversibly pH-switchable and near-infrared second photosensitizer featuring 
aggregation-induced emission was tactfully designed by molecular engineering for 
precise tumor-targeting fluorescence imaging-guided phototherapy. Thanks to the 
strong intramolecular charge transfer, enhanced highly efficient intersystem 
crossing, and sufficient intramolecular motion, the developed agent DTTVBI was 
endowed with boosted type-I superoxide anion radical generation and excellent 
photothermal performance under 808 nm laser irradiation. More importantly, 
DTTVBI nanoparticles with high biocompatibility exhibit remarkably enhanced 
type-I photodynamic/photothermal therapy in the tumor region, thus offering 
significant antitumor effects both in vitro and in the patient-derived tumor 
xenograft model of colon cancer. This work sheds new light on the development of 
superior versatile phototheranostics for cancer therapy."
517,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of 
inflammatory gene expression, but their roles in neuroinflammation are poorly 
understood. Here, we identified the inflammation-related lncRNAs and correlated 
mRNAs of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human microglial cell line HMC3. 
We explored their potential roles and interactions using bioinformatics tools 
such as gene ontology (GO), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), and 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).
RESULTS: We identified 5 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, 4 of which 
(AC083837.1, IRF1-AS1, LINC02605, and MIR3142HG) are novel for microglia. The 
DElncRNAs with their correlated DEmRNAs (99 total) fell into two network modules 
that both were enriched with inflammation-related RNAs. However, treatment with 
the anti-inflammatory agent JQ1, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and 
extra-terminal (BET) protein BRD4, neutralized the LPS effect in only one 
module, showing little or even enhancing effect on the other.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide insight into, and a resource for studying, 
the regulation of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and its potential therapy 
by small-molecule BET inhibitors."

519,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a leading cause of cancer 
death in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). Relapsed or refractory (R/R) 
PTLD portends a high risk of death and effective management is not well 
established. CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapy has been utilized, but the risks 
and benefits are unknown. We report the first case of diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) PTLD treated with lisocabtagene maraleucel and present a 
systematic literature review of SOTRs with PTLD treated with CD19 CAR-T therapy. 
Our patient achieved a complete response (CR) with limited toxicity but 
experienced a CD19+ relapse 8 months after infusion despite CAR-T persistence. 
Literature review revealed 14 DLBCL and 2 Burkitt lymphoma PTLD cases treated 
with CD19 CAR-T cells. Kidney (n = 12), liver (n = 2), heart (n = 2), and 
pancreas after kidney (n = 1) transplant recipients were analyzed. The objective 
response rate (ORR) was 82.4% (14/17), with 58.5% (10/17) CRs and a 6.5-month 
median duration of response. Among kidney transplant recipients, the ORR was 
91.7% (11/12). Allograft rejection occurred in 23.5% (4/17). No graft failure 
occurred. Our analysis suggests that CD19 CAR-T therapy offers short-term 
effectiveness and manageable toxicity in SOTRs with R/R PTLD. Further 
investigation through larger datasets and prospective study is needed."
520,"Reprogramming Müller glia (MG) into functional cells is considered a promising 
therapeutic strategy to treat ocular diseases and vision loss. However, current 
AAV-based system for MG-tracing was reported to have high leakage in recent 
studies. Here, we focused on reducing the leakage of AAV-based labeling systems 
and found that different AAV serotypes showed a range of efficiency and 
specificity in labeling MG, leading us to optimize a human GFAP-Cre reporter 
system packaged in the AAV9 serotype with the woodchuck hepatitis virus 
post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) removed. The leakage ratio of the 
AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-ΔWPRE decreased by an approximate 40-fold compared with the 
AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-WPRE labeling system. In addition, we validated the specificity 
of the AAV-ΔWPRE system for tracing MG reprogramming under Ptbp1-suppression and 
observed strict non-MG-conversion, similar to previous studies using genetic 
lineage tracking mouse models. Thus, the AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-ΔWPRE system showed high 
efficiency and specificity for MG labeling, providing a promising tool for 
tracing cell fate in vivo."
521,"Adults with obesity may develop asthma that is ineffectively controlled by 
inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Mechanistic 
and translational studies suggest that metabolic dysregulation that occurs with 
obesity, particularly hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, contributes to 
altered immune cell function and low-grade systemic inflammation. Importantly, 
in these cases, the same proinflammatory cytokines believed to contribute to 
insulin resistance may also be responsible for airway remodeling and 
hyperresponsiveness. In the past decade, new research has emerged assessing 
whether hypoglycemic therapies impact comorbid asthma as reflected by the 
incidence of asthma, asthma-related emergency department visits, asthma-related 
hospitalizations, and asthma-related exacerbations. The purpose of this review 
article is to discuss the mechanism of action, preclinical data, and existing 
clinical studies regarding the efficacy and safety of hypoglycemic therapies for 
adults with obesity and comorbid asthma."
522,"PURPOSE: Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) 
which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD 
on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study 
the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.
METHODS: RNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts 
and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were 
identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall 
survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were 
identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association 
between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic 
mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.
RESULTS: Consensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters 
(ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME 
cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three 
ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best 
prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above 
analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of 
cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 
3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. 
Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk 
signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high 
infiltration of immune-active cells.
CONCLUSION: This study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, 
excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding 
immunotherapy and chemotherapy."
523,"AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver 
cancer. Expression defects and turnover of basement membrane (BM) proteins are 
key pathogenic factors in cancer. It is still uncertain how the expression of 
BM-related genes (BMGs) in HCC relates to prognosis.
METHODS: All of the HCC cohort's RNA-seq and clinical information came from TCGA 
datasets. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
algorithm was utilized to filter down the candidate genes and construct the 
prognostic model. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were run to examine 
if the risk score may serve as a standalone prognostic indicator. The 
single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was utilized to analyze 
examine immune cell infiltration and pathway activity.
RESULTS: Five genes and their risk coefficients were eventually identified and 
patients with HCC were classified as either high or low risk based on the median 
of risk scores. Multivariate Cox regression analysis found a significant 
correlation between risk score and OS (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that 
BMGs signature had good prediction ability for HCC patients in age, gender, T 
stage, and AJCC stage (all p < 0.05). According to the ssGSEA, the high-risk 
subgroup showed higher levels of immune cell infiltration and immune-related 
pathways were more engaged in the high-risk group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research systematically built a prognostic model using risk 
score based on BMGs signature in HCC patients. The immune feature analysis of 
the BMGs signature indicated a potential regulation between tumor immunity and 
BM in HCC."
524,"PURPOSE: To elucidate the underlying mechanism of HIF-1α in migration and 
invasion of choriocarcinoma.
METHODS: Cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 assay when cell invasion was 
detected by transwell assay. The protein expression was detected by western 
blotting, immunohistochemistry, and qPCR assay.
RESULT: HIF-1α was shown to be strongly expressed in both clinical tumour 
tissues and cell lines in choriocarcinoma. When HIF-1α was efficiently knocked 
down in JEG3 cells, the proliferation rate was reduced by approximately 50% and 
the number of cells that migrated through the transwell insert was greatly 
decreased. The cell invasion rate was also significantly reduced. Moreover, 
typical markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition such as E-cadherin, were 
increased, while vimentin and α-SMA were decreased after HIF-1α knockdown. In 
contrast, overexpression of DEC1 reversed the effects of HIF-1α knockdown. Cell 
proliferation, migration, and invasion were partially recovered. The level of 
E-cadherin was decreased, while the level of vimentin and α-SMA was increased. 
In addition, the level of β-catenin and LEF1 was downregulated after HIF-1α 
knockdown. The expression of MMP2 and MMP9 also declined. However, 
overexpression of DEC1 after HIF-1α knockdown partially reversed the expression 
pattern of these molecules.
CONCLUSION: HIF-1α contributed to EMT and metastasis through activation of 
canonical β-catenin signalling in choriocarcinoma and this process was dependent 
on DEC1. This study provides a new mechanism of HIF-1α in choriocarcinoma and 
suggests that intervention with DEC1 might be a promising therapeutic choice for 
choriocarcinoma."
525,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis) 
is a chronic inflammation-induced cholestatic process in the liver. 
Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) are observed in around 90% of patients, 
which suggests that PBC is an autoimmune disease. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), 
ADH isoenzymes and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are localized in the liver, and 
they are useful markers of liver dysfunction. In this study, the activity of 
total ADH, ADH isoenzymes and ALDH was evaluated in the blood serum of patients 
with PBC. The experimental group comprised 50 PBC patients, both male and 
female, aged 28-67. The control group consisted of 50 healthy subjects, both 
male and female, aged 25-65. The serum activity of class I ADH, class II ADH and 
ALDH was measured by spectrofluorophotometry, whereas total ADH and class III 
ADH activity was determined by photometry methods. The activity of class I ADH 
and total ADH was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the 
control group (p < 0.001). An increase in class I ADH and total ADH activity 
indicates that the isoenzyme class I ADH is released by compromised liver cells 
and can be useful diagnostic markers of PBC."
526,"PURPOSE: Intraoperative identification of lung tumors can be challenging. 
Tumor-targeted fluorescence-guided surgery can provide surgeons with a tool for 
real-time intraoperative tumor detection. This study evaluated cell surface 
biomarkers, partially selected via data-driven selection software, as potential 
targets for fluorescence-guided surgery in non-small cell lung cancers: 
adenocarcinomas (ADC), adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS), and squamous cell 
carcinomas (SCC).
PROCEDURES: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides of resection 
specimens from 15 patients with ADC and 15 patients with SCC were used and 
compared to healthy tissue. Molecular targets were selected based on two 
strategies: (1) a data-driven selection using > 275 multi-omics databases, 
literature, and experimental evidence; and (2) the availability of a fluorescent 
targeting ligand in advanced stages of clinical development. The selected 
targets were carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX), collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain 
(collagen XVII), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), G protein-coupled receptor 87 
(GPR87), transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4), carcinoembryonic antigen 
(CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), folate receptor alpha (FRα), 
integrin αvβ6 (αvβ6), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). 
Tumor expression of these targets was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. 
A total immunostaining score (TIS, range 0-12), combining the percentage and 
intensity of stained cells, was calculated. The most promising targets in ADC 
were explored in six AIS tissue slides to explore its potential in non-palpable 
lesions.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in TIS between healthy lung and 
tumor tissue for ADC samples were found for CEA, EpCAM, FRα, αvβ6, CAIX, 
collagen XVII, GLUT-1, and TMPRSS4, and of these, CEA, CAIX, and collagen XVII 
were also found in AIS. For SCC, EpCAM, uPAR, CAIX, collagen XVII, and GLUT-1 
were found to be overexpressed.
CONCLUSIONS: EpCAM, CAIX, and Collagen XVII were identified using concomitant 
use of data-driven selection software and clinical evidence as promising targets 
for intraoperative fluorescence imaging for both major subtypes of non-small 
cell lung carcinomas."
527,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) are 
volumetric parameters derived from 18F-FDG PET/CT, suggested to have a 
prognostic value in cancer patients. Our study aimed to test whether these 
volumetric parameters of the primary tumor and whole-body tumor burden (WBTB) 
can predict overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty biopsy-proven NSCLC patients who had not begun 
anti-tumor therapy were included in this prospective study. A baseline 18F-FDG 
PET/CT study was acquired. Scans were interpreted visually and 
semi-quantitatively by drawing a 3D volume of interest (VOI) over the primary 
tumor and all positive lesions to calculate metabolic, volumetric parameters, 
and WBTB. The PET parameters were used to stratify patients into high- and 
low-risk categories. The overall survival was estimated from the date of 
scanning until the date of death or last follow-up.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 22.73 months, the mean OS was shorter among 
patients with higher tu MTV and tu TLG and high WBTB. High WB TLG was 
independently associated with the risk of death (p < 0.025). Other parameters, 
e.g., SUVmax, SUVpeak, and SUVmean, were not predictive of outcomes in these 
patients.
CONCLUSION: In patients with NSCLC, tu MTV, tu TLG, and WBTB determined on 
initial staging 18F-FDG PET/CT seems to be a strong, independent imaging 
biomarker to predict OS, superior to the clinical assessment of the primary 
tumor. The WB TLG was found to be the best predictor of OS."
528,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) function by inhibiting 
base excision repair and inducing synthetic lethality in homologous 
recombination repair-deficient cells, such as BRCA1/2-mutated cancer cells. The 
BCR/ABL1 fusion protein causes dysregulated cell proliferation and is 
responsible for chronic myelogenous leukemia and Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL). BCR/ABL1 also induces 
genomic instability by downregulating BRCA1. We investigated the effect of the 
PARPi, olaparib, against Ph+ALL cell lines and found that they show variable 
sensitivity, presumably due to cancer-associated genetic alterations other than 
BCR/ABL1. To investigate the reasons for the variable responses of Ph+ALL cells 
to PARPi treatment, we analyzed the transcriptomes of olaparib-sensitive and 
-resistant Ph+ALL cell lines, which revealed that activation of the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway was a hallmark of PARPi resistance. 
Based on these findings, we examined the effects of adding a PI3K inhibitor 
(PI3Ki) to PARPi treatment to overcome PARPi insensitivity in Ph+ALL cell lines. 
Combination with PI3Ki increased PARPi cytotoxicity in PARPi-resistant Ph+ALL 
cell lines. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is the gold standard for 
Ph+ALL, and, based on our findings, we propose that PARPi combined with TKI and 
PI3K inhibition could be a novel therapeutic strategy for Ph+ALL."
529,"Renal cell carcinoma accounts for 2-3% of all cancers. It is difficult to 
diagnose early. Recently, genome-wide studies have identified that histone 
methylation was one of the functional classes that is most frequently 
dysregulated in renal cell cancer. Mutation or mis-regulation of histone 
methylation, methyltransferases, demethylases are associated with gene 
expression and tumor progression in renal cell cancer. Herein, we summarize 
histone methylations, demethylases and their alterations and mechanisms in renal 
cell cancer."
530,"INTRODUCTION: In the present study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that 
hypercapnia, independently and/or in combination with hypoxia, can activate 
signaling pathways related to the inhibition of proapoptotic (caspase-dependent 
and caspase-independent) factors and the induction of antiapoptotic factors in 
facilitating adaptation to hypoxia/ischemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following exposure to permissive hypercapnia and/or 
normobaric hypoxia, the degree of apoptosis was evaluated in experimental 
ischemia models in vivo and in vitro. The percentages of caspase-3, 
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), Bax, and Bcl-2 in astrocytes and neurons 
derived from male Wistar rats were also calculated. In vitro, cells were 
subjected to various types of respiratory exposure (hypoxia and/or hypercapnia 
for 24 or 12 h) as well as further sublethal chemical hypoxia. The percentages 
of these molecules in nerve cells in the ischemic penumbra of the brain after 
photothrombotic injury were also calculated.
RESULTS: The degree of apoptosis was found to decrease in ischemic penumbra, 
mostly due to the hypercapnic component. It was also discovered that the levels 
of caspase-3, AIF, and Bax decreased in this region, whereas the Bcl-2 levels 
increased following exposure to hypercapnia and hypercapnic hypoxia.
CONCLUSIONS: This integrative assessment of the rate of apoptosis/necrosis in 
astrocyte and neuron cultures shows that the combination of hypercapnia and 
hypoxia resulted in the maximum neuroprotective effect. The levels of apoptosis 
mediators in astrocyte and neuron cultures were calculated after modeling 
chemical hypoxia in vitro. These results show that the exposure models where 
permissive hypercapnia and normobaric hypoxia were combined also had the most 
pronounced inhibitory effects on apoptotic signaling pathways."
531,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are utilized as a carrier of 
anti-tumor agents in targeted anti-cancer therapy. Despite the improvements in 
this area, there are still some unsolved issues in determining the appropriate 
dose, method of administration and biodistribution of MSCs. The current study 
aimed to determine the influence of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation on 
the potential of MSCs migration to the neoplasm environment in the mouse 
melanoma model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) were isolated from the GFP+ 
transgenic C57BL/6 mouse and treated with different doses (1 µg/ml and 10 µg/ml) 
of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, the related TLR3 agonist, at various time 
points (1 and 4 h). Following the treatment, the expression of targeted genes 
such as α4, α5, and β1 integrins and TGF-β and IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokines 
was determined using real-time PCR. In vivo live imaging evaluated the migration 
index of the intraperitoneally (IP) injected treated ADMSCs in a lung 
tumor-bearing mouse (C57BL/6) melanoma model (n = 5). The presented findings 
demonstrated that TLR3 stimulation enhanced both migration of ADMSCs to the 
tumor area compared with control group (n = 5) and expression of α4, α5, and β1 
integrins. It was also detected that the engagement of TLR3 resulted in the 
anti-inflammatory behavior of the cells, which might influence the directed 
movement of ADMSCs.
CONCLUSION: This research identified that TLR3 activation might improve the 
migration via the stimulation of stress response in the cells and depending on 
the agonist concentration and time exposure, this activated pathway drives the 
migratory behavior of MSCs."
532,"BACKGROUND: Lacrimal adenoid cystic carcinoma (LACC) is the most common orbital 
malignant epithelial neoplasm. LACC with high-grade transformation (LACC-HGT) 
has higher rates of recurrence, metastasis, and mortality than LACC without HGT. 
This study investigated the effects of microRNA-29a-3p (miR-29a-3p) in the 
pathogenesis of LACC-HGT.
METHODS: An Agilent human miRNA microarray was used to screen the differentially 
expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in LACC and LACC-HGT tumor tissues. Then, the primary 
cells obtained in previous studies were used to determine the effect of 
miR-29a-3p.
RESULTS: The expression of miR-29a-3p was abnormally lower in LACC-HGT than in 
LACC. miR-29a-3p can specifically target the 3' UTR of Quaking mRNA and 
down-regulate Quaking expression, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, 
migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of LACC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated that miR-29a-3p functions as a tumor 
suppressor by down-regulating the expression of Quaking to inhibit the 
tumorigenesis of LACC cells. This study may also reveal the pathogenesis of HGT 
in LACC cells and provide a reference for LACC-HGT targeted diagnosis."
533,"BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excessive 
hepatic lipid accumulation, imposes serious challenges on public health 
worldwide. Breastfeeding has been reported to reduce the risk of NAFLD. 
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayer membrane vesicles released from various 
cells into the extracellular space, participating in multiple life processes. 
Whether EVs from human milk exert metabolic benefits against NAFLD is worth 
investigating.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, the EVs were isolated from human milk 
collected from healthy mothers and quantified. Functional analyses were 
performed using the NAFLD mouse model and free fatty acid (FFA)-stimulated mouse 
primary hepatocytes. The results showed that human milk-derived EVs could 
effectively alleviate high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin 
resistance in mice with NAFLD via inhibiting lipogenesis and increasing 
lipolysis. The FFA-induced lipid accumulation was also inhibited in hepatocytes 
after treatment with human milk-derived EVs. Mechanistically, the human milk 
derived-EVs cargo (proteins and miRNAs), which linked to lipid metabolism, may 
be responsible for these beneficial effects.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study highlighted the therapeutic benefits of 
human milk-derived EVs and provided a new strategy for NAFLD treatment."
534,"Glioma is a primary brain tumor with limited treatment approaches and 
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are manifested with the self-renewal capability 
and high tumorigenic capacity. This study was performed to investigate the 
regulatory effect of the SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1)/methyltransferase-like 
3 (METTL3)/MYC axis on the self-renewal of GSCs mediated by transcription factor 
Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Following bioinformatics analysis and clinical and cellular 
experiments, we found that YY1 was highly expressed in GBM tissues and cells, 
while silencing its expression reduced the self-renewal ability of GSCs. 
Functionally, YY1 promoted the transcriptional expression of SENP1 by binding to 
the promoter region of SENP1, while the deSUMOase SENP1 facilitated the 
methylase activity of m6A through deSUMOylation of the methylase METTL3, thereby 
promoting the m6A modification of MYC mRNA via METL3 and promoting the 
expression of MYC. A nude mouse xenograft model of GBM was also constructed to 
examine the tumorigenicity of GSCs. The obtained findings demonstrated that YY1 
promoted tumorigenicity of GSCs by promoting the expression of MYC in vivo. 
Conclusively, YY1 can transcriptionally upregulate the SUMOylase SENP1 and 
enhance the methylase activity of METTL3, resulting in the increased m6A 
modification level of MYC mRNA, thereby promoting the self-renewal of GSCs."
535,"Integration of high-dimensional tumor gene expression data with 
clinicopathological data can increase our understanding of disease diversity, 
enable retrospective patient stratification, and identify new potential 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Using a systems biology approach, we provide 
a holistic overview of gene co-expression networks in head and neck squamous 
cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis of HNSCC 
RNA sequencing data from 519 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was 
used to determine correlates of 5-year survival, using regression tree-based 
optimal threshold calculations. Survival-associated gene sets were transformed 
to gene set scores that were assessed for correlation with clinicopathological 
data. We identified 8 gene co-expression modules for HNSCC tumors, each of which 
contained co-expressed genes associated significantly with 5-year survival. 
Survival-associated co-expression gene signatures correlated dominantly with 
tumor HPV and p16 status. Network analysis identified that survival was 
associated with signaling networks of infection, immunity, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, glycolysis, focal adhesion, 
extracellular matrix, MYC signaling, autophagy and transcriptional regulation. 
EMT-associated gene signatures were expressed dominantly in fibroblasts, and 
cancer-associated fibroblasts were inversely correlated with immune activity. 
Interestingly, a high Immune Suppression Score based on expression of 21 genes 
associated with immune inhibition and including immune checkpoints, cytokines 
and regulatory T cell factors, was also associated with increased survival 
probability, and was significantly higher in HPV+ HNSCC. Networks associated 
with HNSCC survival were further associated with survival in cervical cancer, 
melanoma and lung cancer. This study defines 5129 genes associated with HNSCC 
survival, organized into co-expressed networks, their correlation with 
clinicopathological data, and with gene expression data from other malignant 
diseases, and provides a source for the discovery of biomarkers and novel 
therapies for HNSCC."
536,"Two new alkylresorcinols named herein 5'-methoxy-integracins A-B (1-2), two new 
monomeric alkyl aromatic derivatives 3-(7-hydroxyheptyl)-5-methoxyphenol (5) and 
7-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl) heptyl acetate (6), along with four known compounds 
including integracins A-B (3-4), 2,4-dihydroxy-6-(8-hydroxyoctyl) benzene (7), 
and cytosporone B (8) were isolated from the endophytic fungus Cytospora 
rhizophorae A761. The structures of the four new compounds were elucidated by 
NMR, HRESIMS data, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, whereas 
the compounds 1 and 2 were disclosed as a class of the natural rare-occurring 
dimeric alkylresorcinol derivatives. Moreover, the bioassays of the new 
compounds clarified that compound 1 was a potent inhibitor for the 
α-glucosidase, and compound 2 showed relatively good activity against the tumor 
cell lines. It is worth mentioning that the known compound integracin B (4) was 
first reported to display significant antibacterial activity against 
Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
with MIC values of 6.25 μg ml-1."
537,"Synaptotagmin-1 is a vesicular protein and Ca2+ sensor for Ca2+-dependent 
exocytosis. Ca2+ induces synaptotagmin-1 binding to its own vesicle membrane, 
called the cis-interaction, thus preventing the trans-interaction of 
synaptotagmin-1 to the plasma membrane. However, the electrostatic regulation of 
the cis- and trans-membrane interaction of synaptotagmin-1 was poorly understood 
in different Ca2+-buffering conditions. Here we provide an assay to monitor the 
cis- and trans-membrane interactions of synaptotagmin-1 by using native purified 
vesicles and the plasma membrane-mimicking liposomes (PM-liposomes). Both ATP 
and EGTA similarly reverse the cis-membrane interaction of synaptotagmin-1 in 
free [Ca2+] of 10-100 μM. High PIP2 concentrations in the PM-liposomes reduce 
the Hill coefficient of vesicle fusion and synaptotagmin-1 membrane binding; 
this observation suggests that local PIP2 concentrations control the 
Ca2+-cooperativity of synaptotagmin-1. Our data provide evidence that Ca2+ 
chelators, including EGTA and polyphosphate anions such as ATP, ADP, and AMP, 
electrostatically reverse the cis-interaction of synaptotagmin-1."
538,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to clarify the frequency of thoracic 
recurrence and identify associated pathological features in postoperative 
patients with borderline or malignant ovarian epithelial tumors (BMOT) in stage 
I versus higher stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 368 consecutive patients with a single primary 
BMOT were treated at our hospital. This study included the 217 patients with no 
residual disease on the first CT after standard treatment. The timing and 
pattern of recurrence on follow-up CT images with a scan range from chest to 
pelvis were evaluated retrospectively. Patient characteristics, tumor histology, 
and stage were recorded from electronic medical records.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 48 months, recurrence was detected 
by CT in 9 patients in stage I (n = 159) and 15 in stage II/III (n = 58) 
(p = 0.0001). Thoracic recurrence was detected in four patients in stage I and 
four in stage II/III (p = 0.15). Abdominal recurrence was identified as a factor 
associated with thoracic recurrence (P < 0.001). Clear cell carcinomas accounted 
for three out of four thoracic recurrences in stage I and two out of four in 
stage II/III, and had the highest rates of thoracic recurrence (7.7% in stage I 
and 22.2% in stage II/III) among all histological types associated with thoracic 
recurrence. Among patients with recurrence, thoracic recurrence-free probability 
(p = 0.38), median abdominal recurrence-free interval (18 vs 16 months; 
p = 0.55) and thoracic recurrence-free interval (16.5 vs 23 months; p = 0.89) 
did not differ significantly between stage I and stage II/III.
CONCLUSION: The frequency and timing of thoracic recurrence did not differ 
significantly in postoperative patients with BMOT in stage I versus stage 
II/III. Abdominal recurrence and a histological type of clear cell carcinoma 
were most often associated with thoracic recurrence in stage I."
539,"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous preterm birth is challenging to prevent. Only few 
predictors of spontaneous preterm birth risk have been reported, and further 
studies on spontaneous preterm birth should be conducted to reduce the number of 
cases.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to explore if anti-β2-glycoprotein I 
antibody can be used to predict the risk of spontaneous preterm birth, and its 
clinical value in assessing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth.
METHODS: A total of 302 pregnant women who had delivered between January 2019 
and December 2021 were enrolled into the study. The subjects were assigned to 
the case group (28-33+6 weeks, n = 41; 34-36+6 weeks, n = 96) and control group 
(37-42 weeks, n = 165) according to the gestational period. The age, body mass 
index, and gestational days of the two groups were recorded. Blood samples were 
collected and the levels of anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody, white blood cell, 
red blood cell, hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine 
aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, creatinine, glucose, triglyceride, 
and total cholesterol were evaluated. Pregnant women diagnosed with sPTB that 
met the standards after evaluation by the clinician were included in the study.
RESULTS: The level of anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody was higher in case group 
than in the control group [(23.93 ± 8.11)Ru/mL vs (11.50 ± 5.33)Ru/mL]. The 
results showed that anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody was an independent risk 
factor for spontaneous preterm birth. The area under ROC curve of 
anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody to predict spontaneous preterm birth was 0.8875 
(95%CI 0.8443-0.9307). The highest predicted value of anti-β2-glycoprotein I 
antibody was 16.49Ru/ml.
CONCLUSION: Anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody has a high clinical significance and 
can be used by clinicians to evaluate the probability of spontaneous preterm 
birth."
540,"Ferroptosis is a unique form of programmed cell death driven by iron-dependent 
phospholipid peroxidation that was proposed in recent years. It plays an 
important role in processes of various trace element-related diseases and is 
regulated by redox homeostasis and various cellular metabolic pathways (iron, 
amino acids, lipids, sugars), as well as disease-related signaling pathways. 
Some limited pioneering studies have demonstrated ferroptosis as a mechanism for 
the health effects of essential trace elements and potentially toxic trace 
elements, with crosstalk among them. The aim of this review is to bring together 
research articles and identify key direct and indirect evidence regarding 
essential trace elements (iron, selenium, zinc, copper, chromium, manganese) and 
potentially toxic trace elements (arsenic, aluminum, mercury) and their possible 
roles in ferroptosis. Our review may help determine future research priorities 
and opportunities."
541,"Beyond the characteristics of a brain lesion, such as its etiology, size or 
location, lesion network mapping (LNM) has shown that similar symptoms after a 
lesion reflects similar dis-connectivity patterns, thereby linking symptoms to 
brain networks. Here, we extend LNM by using a multimodal strategy, combining 
functional and structural networks from 1000 healthy participants in the Human 
Connectome Project. We apply multimodal LNM to a cohort of 54 stroke patients 
with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a 
combination of motor and sensory tests. Results are two-fold. First, multimodal 
LNM reveals that the functional modality contributes more than the structural 
one in the prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, when looking at each 
modality individually, the performance of the structural networks strongly 
depended on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, 
thereby eliminating the effect that larger lesions generally produce more severe 
sensorimotor impairment. In contrast, functional networks provided similar 
performance regardless of whether or not the effect of lesion size was removed. 
Overall, these results support the extension of LNM to its multimodal form, 
highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of network 
modalities, and their corresponding influence on behavioral performance after 
brain injury."
542,"Sertoli cells (SCs) preferentially use glucose to convert to lactate. As an 
energy source, lactate is essential for survival of developed germ cells (GCs) 
due to its anti-apoptotic effect. Failure to maintain lactate metabolism 
homeostasis leads to infertility or germ cell apoptosis. Several Sertoli 
cell-expressed genes, such as Foxq1 and Gata4, have been identified as critical 
regulators for lactate synthesis, but the pathways that potentially modulate 
their expression remain ill defined. Although recent work from our collaborators 
pointed to an involvement of STIP1 homology and U-box-containing protein 1 
(STUB1) in the modulation of Sertoli cell response to GCs-derived IL-1α, a true 
physiological function of STUB1 signaling in SCs has not been demonstrated. We 
therefore conditionally ablated Stub1 in SCs using Amh-Cre. Stub1 knockout males 
exhibited impaired fertility due to oligozoospermia and asthenospermia, possibly 
caused by lactate deficiency. Furthermore, by means of chromatin 
immunoprecipitation, in vivo ubiquitination, and luciferase reporter assays, we 
showed that STUB1 directed forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1)-mediated transactivation of 
the lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha) gene via K63-linked non-proteolytic 
polyubiquitination, thus facilitating lactate production in follicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH)-stimulated SCs. In agreement, overexpression of LDHA by lentivirus 
infection effectively rescued the lactate production in TM4Stub1-/- cells. Our 
results collectively identify STUB1-mediated transactivation of FOXQ1 signaling 
as a post-translationally modified transcriptional regulatory network underlying 
nursery function in SCs, which may nutritionally contribute to Sertoli cell 
dysfunction of male infertility."
543,"The boot-shaped respiratory complex I (CI) consists of a mitochondrial matrix 
and membrane domain organized into N-, Q- and P-modules. The N-module is the 
most distal part of the matrix domain, whereas the Q-module is situated between 
the N-module and the membrane domain. The proton-pumping P-module is situated in 
the membrane domain. We explored the effect of aging on the disintegration of CI 
and its constituent subcomplexes and modules in Drosophila flight muscles. We 
find that the fully-assembled complex remains largely intact in aged flies. And 
while the effect of aging on the stability of many Q- and N-module subunits in 
subcomplexes was stochastic, NDUFS3 was consistently down-regulated in 
subcomplexes with age. This was associated with an accumulation of many P-module 
subunits in subcomplexes. The potential significance of these studies is that 
genetic manipulations aimed at boosting, perhaps, a few CI subunits may suffice 
to restore the whole CI biosynthesis pathway during muscle aging."
544,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an effective target for those 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancers that retain the wild-type RAS gene. 
However, its efficacy in many cancers, including bladder cancer, is unclear. 
Here, we studied the in vitro effects of cetuximab monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
targeting EGFR on the bladder cancer cells and role of CD46. Cetuximab was found 
to inhibit the growth of both colon and bladder cancer cell lines. Furthermore, 
cetuximab treatment inhibited AKT and ERK phosphorylation in the bladder cancer 
cells and reduced the expression of CD46 membrane-bound proteins. Restoration of 
CD46 expression protected the bladder cancer cells from cetuximab-mediated 
inhibition of AKT and ERK phosphorylation. We hypothesized that CD46 provides 
protection to the bladder cancer cells against mAb therapies. Bladder cancer 
cells were also susceptible to cetuximab-mediated immunologic anti-tumor 
effects. Further, cetuximab enhanced the cell killing by activating both 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) in bladder cancer cells. Restoration of CD46 expression 
protected the cells from both CDC and ADCC induced by cetuximab. Together, CD46 
exhibited a cancer-protective effect against both direct (by involvement of PBMC 
or complement) and indirect cytotoxic activity by cetuximab in bladder cancer 
cells. Considering its clinical importance, CD46 could be an important link in 
the action mechanism of ADCC and CDC intercommunication and may be used for the 
development of novel therapeutic strategies."
545,"Cladosporium spp. have been reported for their great diversity of secondary 
metabolites which represent as a prominent base material for verifying the 
biological activities. Several bioactive compounds which have antimicrobial, 
cytotoxic, quorum sensing inhibitory and phytotoxic activities have been 
isolated from Cladosporium species. Most of them are still needed to be explored 
for their anticancer properties. Therefore, the present study is focused on 
screening and identifying the bioactive compounds of Cladosporium spp. for their 
anticancer activity via the integrated approaches of Molecular Docking (MD), 
Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies. 
A total of 123 bioactive compounds of Cladosporium spp. were explored for their 
binding affinity with the selected breast cancer drug target receptor such as 
estrogen receptor alpha (PDB:6CBZ). The Molecular Docking studies revealed that 
amongst the bioactive compounds screened, Altertoxin X and Cladosporol H showed 
a good binding affinity of - 10.5 kcal/mol and - 10.3 kcal/mol, respectively, 
with the estrogen receptor alpha when compared to the reference compound 
(17[Formula: see text]-Estradiol: - 10.2 kcal/mol). The MDS study indicated the 
stable binding patterns and conformation of the estrogen receptor 
alpha-Altertoxin X complex in a stimulating environment. In addition, in silico 
absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) study 
suggested that Altertoxin X has a good oral bioavailability with a high 
LD[Formula: see text] value of 2.375 mol/kg and did not cause any hepatotoxicity 
and skin sensitization. In summary, the integrated approaches revealed that 
Altertoxin X possesses a promising anticancer activity and could serve as a new 
therapeutic drug for breast cancer treatment."
546,"Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), including 
osimertinib, an irreversible EGFR-TKI, are important treatments for non-small 
cell lung cancer with EGFR-TKI sensitizing or EGFR T790M resistance mutations. 
While patients treated with osimertinib show clinical benefit, disease 
progression and drug resistance are common. Emergence of de novo acquired 
resistance from a drug tolerant persister (DTP) cell population is one mechanism 
proposed to explain progression on osimertinib and other targeted cancer 
therapies. Here we profiled osimertinib DTPs using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to 
characterize the features of these cells and performed drug screens to identify 
therapeutic vulnerabilities. We identified several vulnerabilities in 
osimertinib DTPs that were common across models, including sensitivity to MEK, 
AURKB, BRD4, and TEAD inhibition. We linked several of these vulnerabilities to 
gene regulatory changes, for example, TEAD vulnerability was consistent with 
evidence of Hippo pathway turning off in osimertinib DTPs. Last, we used genetic 
approaches using siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout to validate AURKB, BRD4, and 
TEAD as the direct targets responsible for the vulnerabilities observed in the 
drug screen."
547,"We previously reported that pentagamavunone-1 (PGV-1) effectively inhibited cell 
proliferation in many types of human tumors, including pancreatic cancer, by 
inducing M phase (prometaphase) arrest, senescence, and apoptosis with few side 
effects. However, a detailed evaluation of the effects of PGV-1 on pancreatic 
cancer cells in an in vivo setting has not yet been conducted. The present study 
investigated the potential efficacy of PGV-1 as both monotherapy and combination 
therapy for pancreatic cancer using multiple xenograft mouse assays. A cell-line 
derived xenograft model (CDX-M) with pancreatic cancer cell line and a 
patient-derived xenograft mouse model (PDX-M) using resected pancreatic cancer 
samples without neoadjuvant chemotherapy were established in both heterotopic 
and orthotopic manners. PGV-1 effectively suppressed tumor formation at the 
heterotopic and orthotopic sites in CDX-M than in untreated mice. Combination 
therapy with PGV-1 and gemcitabine more effectively suppressed tumor formation 
than monotherapy with PGV-1 or gemcitabine when administered after tumor 
formation. Monotherapy with PGV-1 or gemcitabine less effectively suppressed 
tumor formation in PDX-M than in CDX-M, whereas combination therapy with PGV-1 
and gemcitabine more effectively suppressed tumor formation. PGV-1 as 
monotherapy and combination therapy with gemcitabine effectively inhibited tumor 
formation and has potential as an anticancer candidate for pancreatic cancer."
548,"The chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein CHD8 is the most frequently 
mutated gene in autism spectrum disorder. Despite its prominent disease 
involvement, little is known about its molecular function in the human brain. 
CHD8 is a chromatin regulator which binds to the promoters of actively 
transcribed genes through genomic targeting mechanisms which have yet to be 
fully defined. By generating a conditional loss-of-function and an endogenously 
tagged allele in human pluripotent stem cells, we investigated the molecular 
function and the interaction of CHD8 with chromatin in human neurons. Chromatin 
accessibility analysis and transcriptional profiling revealed that CHD8 
functions as a transcriptional activator at its target genes in human neurons. 
Furthermore, we found that CHD8 chromatin targeting is cell context-dependent. 
In human neurons, CHD8 preferentially binds at ETS motif-enriched promoters. 
This enrichment is particularly prominent on the promoters of genes whose 
expression significantly changes upon the loss of CHD8. Indeed, among the ETS 
transcription factors, we identified ELK1 as being most highly correlated with 
CHD8 expression in primary human fetal and adult cortical neurons and most 
highly expressed in our stem cell-derived neurons. Remarkably, ELK1 was 
necessary to recruit CHD8 specifically to ETS motif-containing sites. These 
findings imply that ELK1 and CHD8 functionally cooperate to regulate gene 
expression and chromatin states at MAPK/ERK target genes in human neurons. Our 
results suggest that the MAPK/ERK/ELK1 axis potentially contributes to the 
pathogenesis caused by CHD8 mutations in human neurodevelopmental disorders."
549,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) arises along the peripheral bile ducts 
and is often accompanied by a tumor microenvironment (TME) high in extracellular 
matrices (ECMs). In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether an ECM-rich TME 
favors iCCA progression. We identified ITGA2, which encodes collagen-binding 
integrin α2, to be differentially-expressed in iCCA tumors compared with 
adjacent normal tissues. Elevated ITGA2 is also positively-correlated with its 
ligand, collagen type I. Increased ITGA2 expression and its role in collagen 
type I binding was validated in vitro using four iCCA cell lines, compared with 
a non-cancerous, cholangiocyte cell line. Robust interaction of iCCA cells with 
collagen type I was abolished by either ITGA2 depletion or integrin 
α2β1-selective inhibitor treatment. In a phenotypic study, collagen type I 
significantly enhances clonogenic growth of HuCCA-1 and HuCCT-1 cells by three 
and sixfold, respectively. Inhibition of integrin α2 expression or its activity 
significantly blocks collagen type I-induced colony growth in both cell lines. 
Taken together, our data provide mechanistic evidence that collagen type I 
promotes growth of iCCA colonies through integrin α2 suggesting that the 
collagen type I-integrin α2 axis could be a promising target for cancer 
prevention and a therapeutic opportunity for this cancer."
550,"The Early Bronze Age in Europe is characterized by social and genetic 
transformations, starting in the early 3rd millennium BCE. New settlement and 
funerary structures, artifacts and techniques indicate times of change with 
increasing economic asymmetries and political hierarchization. Technological 
advances in metallurgy also played an important role, facilitating trade and 
exchange networks, which became tangible in higher levels of mobility and 
connectedness. Archeogenetic studies have revealed a substantial transformation 
of the genetic ancestry around this time, ultimately linked to the expansion of 
steppe- and forest steppe pastoralists from Eastern Europe. Evidence for 
emerging infectious diseases such as Yersinia pestis adds further complexity to 
these tumultuous and transformative times. The El Argar complex in southern 
Iberia marks the genetic turnover in southwestern Europe ~ 2200 BCE that 
accompanies profound changes in the socio-economic structure of the region. To 
answer the question of who was buried in the emblematic double burials of the El 
Argar site La Almoloya, we integrated results from biological relatedness 
analyses and archaeological funerary contexts and refined radiocarbon-based 
chronologies from 68 individuals. We find that the El Argar society was 
virilocally and patrilineally organized and practiced reciprocal female exogamy, 
supported by pedigrees that extend up to five generations along the paternal 
line. Synchronously dated adult males and females from double tombs were found 
to be unrelated mating partners, whereby the incoming females reflect 
socio-political alliances among El Argar groups. In three cases these unions had 
common offspring, while paternal half-siblings also indicate serial monogamy or 
polygyny."
551,"Men in couples that have experienced pregnancy loss have a higher risk of sexual 
dysfunction. Semen quality impairment is common in men of couples with pregnancy 
loss. The objective of this article is to evaluate the differences in the 
incidence of male sexual dysfunction in a cohort of pregnancy loss couples with 
different types of semen quality impairment. A cross-sectional analysis of 426 
men who attended our outpatient clinic for couples' pregnancy loss, those 
without genetic abnormalities were included in the final analysis covering June 
2021 to October 2021. The patients were divided into 5 groups according to type 
of semen quality impairment: normozoospermia group (group normal; N = 161), high 
sperm DNA fragmentation group (group high-SDF; N = 87), isolated 
asthenozoospermia group (group iAstheno; N = 45), isolated teratozoopermia group 
(group iTerato; N = 44), and ≥ 2 abnormal sperm parameters group (group 
multiple; N = 89). All subjects underwent a complete physical inspection, 
including palpation of the male genitalia and semen analysis. Validated 
assessment tools for erectile dysfunction (the International Index of Erectile 
Function -IIEF-5) and anxiety (the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
Scale- GAD-7) were also used. Men with high sperm DNA fragmentation and isolated 
teratozoopermia were associated with increased erectile dysfunction risk when 
compared with normozoospermic men, with an OR of 2.75 [1.49-5.09; p = 0.001] and 
2.44 [1.22-5.31; p = 0.024], respectively. It is interesting to note that there 
was no difference in prevalence of erectile dysfunction between Group iAstheno 
and Group normal (20.0% vs. 18.0%; OR = 1.24 [0.52-2.97]; P = 0.625). More than 
half (50.6%) of the participants in Group high-SDF reported sexual intercourse 
less than once per week, much more than those in the normozoospermia group 
(23.2%, p < 0.05), followed by Group iTerato (44.4%) and Group multiple (46.1%). 
GAD-7 scores increased slightly but significantly among groups when compared 
with Group normal. Not surprisingly, GAD-7 scores remained higher in Group 
high-SDF. In males of pregnancy loss couples, men with high sperm DNA 
fragmentation and teratozoopermia suffer from a higher incidence of erectile 
dysfunction. This phenomenon is not significant in men with isolated 
asthenozoospermia. Proper counseling and treatment of impaired semen quality are 
warranted."
552,"The function and underlying mechanisms of p50 in the regulation of protein 
expression is much less studied because of its lacking of transactivation 
domain. In this study, we discovered a novel function of p50 in its 
stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein under the 
condition of cells exposed to arsenic exposure. In p50-deficient (p50-/-) cells, 
the HIF-1α protein expression was impaired upon arsenic exposure, and such 
defect could be rescued by reconstitutional expression of p50. Mechanistic study 
revealed that the inhibition of autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7)-dependent 
autophagy was in charge of p50-mediated HIF-1α protein stabilization following 
arsenic exposure. Moreover, p50 deletion promoted nucleolin (NCL) protein 
translation to enhance ATG7 mRNA transcription via directly binding 
transcription factor Sp1 mRNA and increase its stability. We further discovered 
that p50-mediated miR-494 upregulation gave rise to the inhibition of 
p50-mediated NCL translation by interacting with its 3'-UTR. These novel 
findings provide a great insight into the understanding of biomedical 
significance of p50 protein in arsenite-associated disease development and 
therapy."
553,"Selective elimination of tumors has always been the mainstay of oncology 
research. The on-going research underlying the cellular apoptotic mechanisms 
reveal caspases activation, especially the key effector caspase-3, as a 
personalized tumor-selective therapeutic strategy. Our continued research 
protocol has exploited new optimized Passerini α-acyloxy carboxamides as 
efficient apoptotic inducers via caspase-3/7 dependent mechanism with highly 
selective anticancer profiles. The adopted design rationale relied on excluding 
structural alerts of previous leads, while merging various pharmacophoric motifs 
of natural and synthetic caspase activators via optimized one-pot Passerini 
reaction conditions. The prepared compounds resulting from Passerini reaction 
were screened for their cytotoxic activities against colorectal Caco-2 and liver 
HepG-2 cancer cells compared to normal fibroblasts utilizing MTT assay. Notably, 
all compounds exhibited promising low-range submicromolar IC50 against the 
studied cancer cell lines, with outstanding tumor selectivity (SI values up to 
266). Hence, they were superior to 5-fluorouracil. Notably, 7a, 7g, and 7j 
conferred the highest potencies against Caco-2 and HepG-2 cells and were 
selected for further mechanistic studies. Caspas-3/7 activation assay of the hit 
compounds and flow cytometric analysis of the treated apoptotic cancer cells 
demonstrated their significant caspase activation potential (up to 4.2 folds) 
and apoptotic induction capacities (up to 58.7%). Further assessment of Bcl2 
expression was performed being a physiological caspase-3 substrate. Herein, the 
three studied Passerini adducts were able to downregulate Bcl2 in the treated 
Caco-2 cells. Importantly, the mechanistic studies results of the three hits 
echoed their preliminary MTT antiproliferative potencies data highlighting their 
caspase-3 dependent apoptotic induction. Finally, the in silico predicted 
physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profiles, as well as ligand efficiency 
metrics were drug-like."
554,"Folate (vitamin B9) is the coenzyme involved in one-carbon transfer biochemical 
reactions essential for cell survival and proliferation, with its inadequacy 
causing developmental defects or severe diseases. Notably, mammalian cells lack 
the ability to de novo synthesize folate but instead rely on its intake from 
extracellular sources via specific transporters or receptors, among which 
SLC19A1 is the ubiquitously expressed one in tissues. However, the mechanism of 
substrate recognition by SLC19A1 remains unclear. Here we report the cryo-EM 
structures of human SLC19A1 and its complex with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate at 
3.5-3.6 Å resolution and elucidate the critical residues for substrate 
recognition. In particular, we reveal that two variant residues among SLC19 
subfamily members designate the specificity for folate. Moreover, we identify 
intracellular thiamine pyrophosphate as the favorite coupled substrate for 
folate transport by SLC19A1. Together, this work establishes the molecular basis 
of substrate recognition by this central folate transporter."
555,"The ratio of saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids, thought to play a 
critical role in many cellular functions, is regulated by stearoyl-CoA 
desaturase (SCD), a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated 
fatty acids. Previously, we observed a decrease in both SCD protein and 
enzymatic activity in apoptosis induced by fenretinide, a synthetic analog of 
retinoic acid, in the human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line ARPE-19. 
Here, we investigated the effect of pretreating ARPE-19 with sterculic acid, a 
cyclopropenoic fatty acid inhibitor of SCD, on preventing fenretinide-induced 
apoptosis, given the role of SCD in cell proliferation and apoptosis. We show 
that sterculic acid pretreatment prevents the effects of fenretinide-induced 
apoptosis shown by changes in cell morphology, viability, and caspase-3 
activation. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated proteins shows 
that sterculic acid pretreatment reduced the fenretinide-induced upregulation of 
heme oxygenase-1, ATF3 and GADD153 expression that are in response to reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) generation. Sterculic acid is as effective as allopurinol 
in inhibition of xanthine oxidase (XDH), and this may play a role in reducing 
the potential role of XDH in fenretinide-induced ROS generation. Sterculic acid 
pretreatment also results in a reduction in SOD2 mRNA expression. 
Dihydroceramide accumulation, compared to ceramide, and ROS generation indicate 
that a ceramide-independent pathway mediates fenretinide-induced apoptosis, and 
ROS mediation is borne out by activation of the NF-κBp50 and NF-κBp65 downstream 
signaling cascade. Its prevention by sterculic acid pretreatment further 
indicates the latter's antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effect. Taken together, our 
results suggest that sterculic acid pretreatment can mitigate ROS-mediated 
fenretinide-induced apoptosis. Thus, sterculic acid may serve as a potential 
antioxidant and therapeutic agent. These effects may be independent of its 
effects on SCD activity."
556,"Autophagy results in the degradation of cytosolic components via two major 
membrane deformations. First, the isolation membrane sequesters components from 
the cytosol and forms autophagosomes, by which open structures become closed 
compartments. Second, the outer membrane of the autophagosomes fuses with 
lysosomes to degrade the inner membrane and its contents. The efficiency of the 
latter degradation process, namely autophagic flux, can be easily evaluated 
using lysosomal inhibitors, whereas the dynamics of the former process is 
difficult to analyze because of the challenges in identifying closed 
compartments of autophagy (autophagosomes and autolysosomes). To resolve this 
problem, we here developed a method to detect closed autophagic compartments by 
applying the FLIP technique, and named it FLIP-based Autophagy Detection (FLAD). 
This technique visualizes closed autophagic compartments and enables 
differentiation of open autophagic structures and closed autophagic compartments 
in live cells. In addition, FLAD analysis detects not only starvation-induced 
canonical autophagy but also genotoxic stress-induced alternative autophagy. By 
the combinational use of FLAD and LC3, we were able to distinguish the 
structures of canonical autophagy from those of alternative autophagy in a 
single cell."
557,"N6-deoxyadenosine methylation (6mA) is the most widespread type of DNA 
modification in prokaryotes and is also abundantly distributed in some 
unicellular eukaryotes. However, 6mA levels are remarkably low in mammals. The 
lack of a precise and comprehensive mapping method has hindered more advanced 
investigations of 6mA. Here, we report a new method MM-seq (modification-induced 
mismatch sequencing) for genome-wide 6mA mapping based on a novel detection 
principle. We found that modified DNA bases are prone to form a local open 
region that allows capture by antibody, for example, via a DNA breathing or 
base-flipping mechanism. Specified endonuclease or exonuclease can recognize the 
antibody-stabilized mismatch-like structure and mark the exact modified sites 
for sequencing readout. Using this method, we examined the genomic positions of 
6mA in bacteria (E. coli), green algae (C. reinhardtii), and mammalian cells 
(HEK239T, Huh7, and HeLa cells). In contrast to bacteria and green algae, human 
cells possess a very limited number of 6mA sites which are sporadically 
distributed across the genome of different cell types. After knocking out the 
RNA m6A methyltransferase METTL3 in mouse ES cells, 6mA becomes mostly 
diminished. Our results imply that rare 6mA in the mammalian genome is 
introduced by RNA m6A machinery via a non-targeted mechanism."
558,"Bacillus subtilis is a well-characterized microorganism and a model for the 
study of Gram-positive bacteria. The bacterium can produce proteins at high 
densities and yields, which has made it valuable for industrial bioproduction. 
Like other cell factories, metabolic modeling of B. subtilis has discovered ways 
to optimize its metabolism toward various applications. The first genome-scale 
metabolic model (M-model) of B. subtilis was published more than a decade ago 
and has been applied extensively to understand metabolism, to predict growth 
phenotypes, and served as a template to reconstruct models for other 
Gram-positive bacteria. However, M-models are ill-suited to simulate the 
production and secretion of proteins as well as their proteomic response to 
stress. Thus, a new generation of metabolic models, known as metabolism and gene 
expression models (ME-models), has been initiated. Here, we describe the 
reconstruction and validation of a ME model of B. subtilis, iJT964-ME. This 
model achieved higher performance scores on the prediction of gene essentiality 
as compared to the M-model. We successfully validated the model by integrating 
physiological and omics data associated with gene expression responses to 
ethanol and salt stress. The model further identified the mechanism by which 
tryptophan synthesis is upregulated under ethanol stress. Further, we employed 
iJT964-ME to predict amylase production rates under two different growth 
conditions. We analyzed these flux distributions and identified key metabolic 
pathways that permitted the increase in amylase production. Models like 
iJT964-ME enable the study of proteomic response to stress and the illustrate 
the potential for optimizing protein production in bacteria."
559,"Nutrient-limiting conditions are common during cancer development. The 
coordination of cellular glucose levels and cell survival is a fundamental 
question in cell biology and has not been completely understood. 4EBP1 is known 
as a translational repressor to regulate cell proliferation and survival by 
controlling translation initiation, however, whether 4EBP1 could participate in 
tumor survival by other mechanism except for translational repression function, 
especially under glucose starvation conditions remains unknown. Here, we found 
that protein levels of 4EBP1 was up-regulated in the central region of the tumor 
which always suffered nutrient deprivation compared with the peripheral region. 
We further discovered that 4EBP1 was dephosphorylated by PTPMT1 under glucose 
starvation conditions, which prevented 4EBP1 from being targeted for 
ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation by HERC5. After that, 4EBP1 
translocated to cytoplasm and interacted with STAT3 by competing with JAK and 
ERK, leading to the inactivation of STAT3 in the cytoplasm, resulting in 
apoptosis under glucose withdrawal conditions. Moreover, 4EBP1 knockdown 
increased the tumor volume and weight in xenograft models by inhibiting 
apoptosis in the central region of tumor. These findings highlight a novel 
mechanism for 4EBP1 as a new cellular glucose sensor in regulating cancer cell 
death under glucose deprivation conditions, which was different from its 
classical function as a translational repressor."
560,"The progression of cancer from localized to metastatic disease is the primary 
cause of morbidity and mortality. The interplay between the tumor and its 
microenvironment is the key driver in this process of tumor progression. In 
order for tumors to progress and metastasize they must reprogram the cells that 
make up the microenvironment to promote tumor growth and suppress endogenous 
defense systems, such as the immune and inflammatory response. We have 
previously demonstrated that stimulation of Tsp-1 in the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) potently inhibits tumor growth and progression. Here, we identify a novel 
tumor-mediated mechanism that represses the expression of Tsp-1 in the TME via 
secretion of the serine protease PRSS2. We demonstrate that PRSS2 represses 
Tsp-1, not via its enzymatic activity, but by binding to low-density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). These findings describe a hitherto 
undescribed activity for PRSS2 through binding to LRP1 and represent a potential 
therapeutic strategy to treat cancer by blocking the PRSS2-mediated repression 
of Tsp-1. Based on the ability of PRSS2 to reprogram the tumor microenvironment, 
this discovery could lead to the development of therapeutic agents that are 
indication agnostic."
561,"The D,D-transpeptidase activity of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) is the 
well-known primary target of β-lactam antibiotics that block peptidoglycan 
polymerization. β-lactam-induced bacterial killing involves complex downstream 
responses whose causes and consequences are difficult to resolve. Here, we use 
the functional replacement of PBPs by a β-lactam-insensitive L,D-transpeptidase 
to identify genes essential to mitigate the effects of PBP inactivation by 
β-lactams in actively dividing bacteria. The functions of the 179 conditionally 
essential genes identified by this approach extend far beyond L,D-transpeptidase 
partners for peptidoglycan polymerization to include proteins involved in stress 
response and in the assembly of outer membrane polymers. The unsuspected effects 
of β-lactams include loss of the lipoprotein-mediated covalent bond that links 
the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan, destabilization of the cell envelope in 
spite of effective peptidoglycan cross-linking, and increased permeability of 
the outer membrane. The latter effect indicates that the mode of action of 
β-lactams involves self-promoted penetration through the outer membrane."
562,"Site-specific tyrosine-type recombinases are effective tools for genome 
engineering, with the first engineered variants having demonstrated therapeutic 
potential. So far, adaptation to new DNA target site selectivity of 
designer-recombinases has been achieved mostly through iterative cycles of 
directed molecular evolution. While effective, directed molecular evolution 
methods are laborious and time consuming. Here we present RecGen (Recombinase 
Generator), an algorithm for the intelligent generation of 
designer-recombinases. We gather the sequence information of over one million 
Cre-like recombinase sequences evolved for 89 different target sites with which 
we train Conditional Variational Autoencoders for recombinase generation. 
Experimental validation demonstrates that the algorithm can predict recombinase 
sequences with activity on novel target-sites, indicating that RecGen is useful 
to accelerate the development of future designer-recombinases."
563,"Heart development is a continuous process involving significant remodeling 
during embryogenesis and neonatal stages. To date, several groups have used 
single-cell sequencing to characterize the heart transcriptomes but failed to 
capture the progression of heart development at most stages. This has left gaps 
in understanding the contribution of each cell type across cardiac development. 
Here, we report the transcriptional profile of the murine heart from early 
embryogenesis to late neonatal stages. Through further analysis of this dataset, 
we identify several transcriptional features. We identify gene expression 
modules enriched at early embryonic and neonatal stages; multiple cell types in 
the left and right atriums are transcriptionally distinct at neonatal stages; 
many congenital heart defect-associated genes have cell type-specific 
expression; stage-unique ligand-receptor interactions are mostly between 
epicardial cells and other cell types at neonatal stages; and mutants of 
epicardium-expressed genes Wt1 and Tbx18 have different heart defects. 
Assessment of this dataset serves as an invaluable source of information for 
studies of heart development."
564,"Introducing asexual reproduction through seeds - apomixis - into crop species 
could revolutionize agriculture by allowing F1 hybrids with enhanced yield and 
stability to be clonally propagated. Engineering synthetic apomixis has proven 
feasible in inbred rice through the inactivation of three genes (MiMe), which 
results in the conversion of meiosis into mitosis in a line ectopically 
expressing the BABYBOOM1 (BBM1) parthenogenetic trigger in egg cells. However, 
only 10-30% of the seeds are clonal. Here, we show that synthetic apomixis can 
be achieved in an F1 hybrid of rice by inducing MiMe mutations and egg cell 
expression of BBM1 in a single step. We generate hybrid plants that produce more 
than 95% of clonal seeds across multiple generations. Clonal apomictic plants 
maintain the phenotype of the F1 hybrid along successive generations. Our 
results demonstrate that there is no barrier to almost fully penetrant synthetic 
apomixis in an important crop species, rendering it compatible with use in 
agriculture."
565,"Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), also named as growth differentiation factor 
2 (GDF-2), is the strongest cytokine that promotes osteogenic differentiation in 
the BMP family, and has broad clinical application value. Nevertheless, the 
mechanism of BMP9 promotes osteogenic differentiation remain unclear. TAZ, a 
transcriptional co-activator, has great effects on cell proliferation, 
differentiation, and stem cell self-renewal. In this research, we investigated 
the effects of TAZ in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal 
stem cell line C3H10T1/2 (MSCs) and murine multi-lineage cell lines C2C12 and 
MEFs (MMCs) and explored its possible mechanisms. This study has found that BMP9 
induces the expression of TAZ and promotes its nuclear translocation. Meanwhile, 
our study found that Ad-TAZ and TM-25659, a TAZ agonist, can enhance the 
osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and MMCs induced by BMP9. Conversely, 
Ad-si-TAZ and verteporfin, an inhibitor of TAZ, have the contradictory effect. 
Likewise, the promotion of TAZ to the BMP9-induced ectopic bone formation in 
vivo was confirmed by the subcutaneous transplantation of MSCs in nude mice. 
Furthermore, we have detected that TAZ might increase the levels of the 
phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK induced by BMP9. 
Additionally, we also found that TAZ increased the total protein level of 
β-catenin induced by BMP9. In summary, our results strongly indicated that TAZ 
will promote the osteogenic differentiation in MSCs and MMCs induced by BMP9 
through multiple signal pathways."
566,"Ferroptosis is a type of regulated necrosis caused by unrestricted lipid 
peroxidation and subsequent plasma membrane rupture. However, the lipid 
remodeling mechanism that determines sensitivity to ferroptosis remains poorly 
understood. Here, we report a previously unrecognized role for the lipid 
flippase solute carrier family 47 member 1 (SLC47A1) as a regulator of lipid 
remodeling and survival during ferroptosis. Among 49 phospholipid scramblases, 
flippases, and floppases we analyzed, only SLC47A1 had mRNA that was selectively 
upregulated in multiple cancer cells exposed to ferroptotic inducers. 
Large-scale lipidomics and functional analyses revealed that the silencing of 
SLC47A1 increased RSL3- or erastin-induced ferroptosis by favoring 
ACSL4-SOAT1-mediated production of polyunsaturated fatty acid cholesterol 
esters. We identified peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA) 
as a transcription factor that transactivates SLC47A1. The depletion of PPARA 
and SLC47A1 similarly sensitized cells to ferroptosis induction, whereas 
transfection-enforced re-expression of SLC47A1 restored resistance to 
ferroptosis in PPARA-deficient cells. Pharmacological or genetic blockade of the 
PPARA-SLC47A1 pathway increased the anticancer activity of a ferroptosis inducer 
in mice. These findings establish a direct molecular link between ferroptosis 
and lipid transporters, which may provide metabolic targets for overcoming drug 
resistance."
567,"Gonad somatic cells acquire sex-specific fates during sex determination. In XX 
gonad, a subset of somatic cells expresses Foxl2 after sex determination which 
is considered the progenitor of granulosa cells. However, whether these cells 
also contribute to other cell types at later developmental stages is unknown. In 
the present study, the cell fate of Foxl2-expressing cells in fetal ovaries was 
analyzed by lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. We found that 
Foxl2-expressing cells gave rise to three cell types at later developmental 
stages, including granulosa cells, theca-interstitial cells, and stromal cells. 
Series single-cell RNA sequencing revealed FOXL2-positive cells were divided 
into two clusters at P0. One group further differentiated into granulosa cells 
and Theca-G (Theca-interstitial cells derived from granulosa) at P14. Another 
group was classified as stromal cell lineage, then a small portion of them 
further differentiated into 3β-HSD-positive Theca-S (Theca-interstitial cells 
derived from stroma). Cyp17a1 was expressed in Theca-S, but not in Theca-G. This 
study demonstrated that Folx2-expressing cells in XX gonad after sex 
determination are multipotent and theca-interstitial cells are derived from 
different progenitors. Our data provided an important resource, at single-cell 
resolution, for a better understanding of somatic cell differentiation in ovary 
development."
568,"Previous reports have confirmed that crude saponins (ginsenosides) in Panax 
ginseng have a preventive effect on chemotherapy-induced intestinal injury. 
However, the protective effects and possible mechanisms of ginsenoside Re (G-Re, 
a maker saponin in ginseng) against chemotherapy-induced intestinal damage have 
not been thoroughly studied. In this work, a series of experiments in vivo and 
in vitro on the intestinal toxicity caused by cisplatin have been designed to 
verify the improvement effect of G-Re, focusing on the levels of Wnt3a and 
[Formula: see text]-catenin. Mice were intragastric with G-Re for 10 days, and 
intestinal injury was induced by intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin at 
a dose of 20 mg/kg. Histopathology, gastrointestinal digestive enzyme 
activities, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative status were evaluated to 
investigate the protective effect. Furthermore, in IEC-6 cells, G-Re 
statistically reverses cisplatin-induced oxidative damage and cytotoxicity. The 
TUNEL and Hoechst 33258 staining demonstrated that G-Re possesses protective 
effects in cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Additionally, pretreatment with G-Re 
significantly alleviated the apoptosis via inhibition of over-expressions of 
B-associated X (Bax), as well as the caspase family members, such as caspase 3 
and 9, respectively, in vivo and in vitro. Notably, western blotting results 
showed that G-Re treatment decreased Wnt3a, Glycogen synthase kinase [Formula: 
see text] (GSK-[Formula: see text]), and [Formula: see text]-catenin expression, 
suggesting that nuclear accumulation of [Formula: see text]-catenin was 
attenuated, thereby inhibiting the activation of GSK-[Formula: see 
text]-dependent Wnt/[Formula: see text]-catenin signaling, which was consistent 
with our expected results. Therefore, the above evidence suggested that G-Re may 
be a candidate drug for the treatment of intestinal injury."
569,"PURPOSE: To evaluate how technology access affected substance use disorder (SUD) 
treatment prior to COVID-19 for people who use drugs in rural areas.
METHODS: The Rural Opioid Initiative (January 2018-March 2020) was a 
cross-sectional study of people with prior 30-day injection drug or 
nonprescribed opioid use from rural areas of 10 states. Using multivariable 
mixed-effect regression models, we examined associations between participant 
technology access and SUD treatment.
FINDINGS: Of 3,026 participants, 71% used heroin and 76% used methamphetamine. 
Thirty-five percent had no cell phone and 10% had no prior 30-day internet use. 
Having both a cell phone and the internet was associated with increased days of 
medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) use (aIRR 1.29 [95% CI 1.11-1.52]) and 
a higher likelihood of SUD counseling in the prior 30 days (aOR 1.28 [95% CI 
1.05-1.57]). Lack of cell phone was associated with decreased days of MOUD (aIRR 
0.77 [95% CI 0.66-0.91]) and a lower likelihood of prior 30-day SUD counseling 
(aOR 0.77 [95% CI 0.62-0.94]).
CONCLUSIONS: Expanding US rural SUD treatment engagement via telemedicine may 
require increased cell phone and mobile network access."
570,"Metasurface-generated holography has emerged as a promising route for fully 
reproducing vivid scenes by manipulating the optical properties of light using 
ultra-compact devices. However, achieving multiple holographic images using a 
single metasurface is still difficult due to the capacity limit of a single 
meta-atom. In this work, we present an inverse design method based on 
gradient-descent optimization to encode multiple pieces of holographic 
information into a single metasurface. The proposed method allows the inverse 
design of single-cell metasurfaces without the need for complex meta-atom design 
strategies, facilitating high-throughput fabrication using broadband low-loss 
materials. By exploiting the proposed design method, both multiplane RGB color 
and 3D holograms are designed and experimentally demonstrated. We achieve 
multiplane RGB color holograms with nine distinct holograms, demonstrating the 
state-of-the-art data capacity of a phase-only metasurface. We also present the 
first experimental demonstration of metasurface-generated 3D holograms with 
completely independent and distinct images in each plane. The current research 
findings provide a viable route for practical metasurface-generated holography 
by demonstrating the high-density holography produced by a single metasurface. 
It is expected to ultimately lead to optical storage, display, and full-color 
imaging applications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

571,"4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) is an industrially important aromatic compound, 
and there is an urgent need to establish a bioprocess to produce this compound 
in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner from renewable feedstocks 
such as cellulosic biomass. Here, we developed a bioprocess to directly produce 
4-HBA from cellulose using a recombinant Pichia pastoris strain that displays 
heterologous cellulolytic enzymes on its cell surface via the 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchoring system. β-glucosidase (BGL) from 
Aspergillus aculeatus, endoglucanase (EG) from Trichoderma reesei, and 
cellobiohydrolase (CBH) from Talaromyces emersonii were co-displayed on the cell 
surface of P. pastoris using an appropriate GPI-anchoring domain for each 
enzyme. The cell-surface cellulase activity was further enhanced using P. 
pastoris SPI1 promoter- and secretion signal sequences. The resulting strains 
efficiently hydrolyzed phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) to glucose. 
Then, we expressed a highly 4-HBA-resistant chorismate pyruvate-lyase (UbiC) 
from Providencia rustigianii in the cellulase-displaying strain. This strain 
produced 975 mg/L of 4-HBA from PASC, which corresponding to 36.8% of the 
theoretical maximum yield, after 96 h of batch fermentation without the addition 
of commercial cellulase. This 4-HBA yield was over two times higher than that 
obtained from glucose (12.3% of the theoretical maximum yield). To our 
knowledge, this is the first report on the direct production of an aromatic 
compound from cellulose using cellulase-displaying yeast. This article is

572,"The aging of precursor solutions is the major stumbling block for the 
commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time 
we used the state-of-the-art in situ liquid time-of-flight secondary ion mass 
spectrometry to molecularly explore the perovskite precursor solution chemistry. 
We identified that the methylammonium and formamidinium cations and the I- anion 
are the motivators of the aging chemistry. Further, we introduced two kinds of 
Lewis bases, triethyl phosphate (TP) and ethyl ethanesulfonate (EE), as new 
additives in the solution and unraveled that both of them can protect the 
reactive cations from aging through weak interactions. Significantly, TP is 
superior to EE in enhancing long-term solution stability as it can well-maintain 
the internal interaction structures within the solution phase. The PSC derived 
from a fresh TP-doped solution delivered a high power conversion efficiency of 
23.06%, 92.23% of which remained in that from a 21-day-old solution."
573,"OBJECTIVE: The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays critical roles in eating and food 
seeking in rodents and humans. Diets high in fats and sugars (""junk food"") 
produce persistent increases in NAc function in male obesity-prone rats. This 
study examines effects of junk food and junk food deprivation on NAc core medium 
spiny neuron (MSN) excitability and glutamate transmission in females.
METHODS: Obesity-prone female rats were given access to ad libitum junk food for 
10 days, and recordings were made from MSNs in the NAc core immediately or after 
a short (27-72 hours) or long (14-16 days) junk food deprivation period in which 
rats were returned to ad libitum standard chow. Controls remained on chow 
throughout. Whole-cell slice electrophysiology was used to examine MSN intrinsic 
membrane and firing properties and glutamatergic transmission.
RESULTS: The study found that intrinsic excitability was reduced, whereas 
glutamatergic transmission was enhanced, after the short, but not long, junk 
food deprivation period. A brief junk food deprivation period was necessary for 
increases in NAc calcium-permeable-AMPA receptor transmission and spontaneous 
excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) frequency, but not for increases in 
sEPSC amplitude.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that females are protected from long-lasting 
effects of sugary fatty foods on MSN neuronal function and provides evidence for 
sex-specific effects on plasticity in brain centers that influence food-seeking 
and feeding behavior."
574,"Phase separation in biological membranes is crucial for proper cellular 
functions, such as signaling and trafficking, as it mediates the interactions of 
condensates on membrane-bound organelles and transmembrane transport to targeted 
destination compartments. The separation of a lipid bilayer into phases and the 
formation of lipid rafts involve the restructuring of molecular localization, 
their immobilization, and local accumulation. By understanding the processes 
underlying the formation of lipid rafts in a cellular membrane, it is possible 
to reconstitute this phenomenon in synthetic biomimetic membranes, such as 
hybrids of lipids and polymers or membranes composed solely of polymers, which 
offer an increased physicochemical stability and unlimited possibilities of 
chemical modification and functionalization. In this article, we relate the main 
lipid bilayer phase transition phenomenon with respect to hybrid biomimetic 
membranes, composed of lipids mixed with polymers, and fully synthetic 
membranes. Following, we review the occurrence of phase separation in biomimetic 
hybrid membranes based on lipids and/or direct lipid analogs, amphiphilic block 
copolymers. We further exemplify the phase separation and the resulting 
properties and applications in planar membranes, free-standing and 
solid-supported. We briefly list methods leading to the formation of such 
biomimetic membranes and reflect on their improved overall stability and 
influence on the separation into different phases within the membranes. Due to 
the importance of phase separation and compartmentalization in cellular 
membranes, we are convinced that this compiled overview of this phenomenon will 
be helpful for any researcher in the biomimicry area."
575,"Mammalian cells frequently encounter subtle perturbations during recombinant 
protein production. Identifying the genetic factors that govern the cellular 
stress response can facilitate targeted genetic engineering to obtain production 
cell lines that demonstrate a higher stress tolerance. To simulate nutrient 
stress, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transferred into a 
glutamine(Q)-free medium and transcriptional dynamics using thiol(SH)-linked 
alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) along with standard 
RNA-seq of stressed and unstressed cells were investigated. The SLAM-seq method 
allows to differentiate between actively transcribed, nascent mRNA and total 
(previously present) mRNA in the sample, adding an additional, time-resolved 
layer to classic RNA-sequencing. The cells tackle amino acid (AA) limitation by 
inducing the integrated stress response (ISR) signaling pathway, reflected in 
Atf4 overexpression in the early hours post Q deprivation, leading to subsequent 
activation of its targets, Asns, Atf3, Ddit3, Eif4ebp1, Gpt2, Herpud1, Slc7a1, 
Slc7a11, Slc38a2, Trib3, and Vegfa. The GCN2-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway is confirmed by 
a significant halt in transcription of translation-related genes at 24 hours 
post Q deprivation. The downregulation of lipid synthesis indicates the 
inhibition of the mTOR pathway, further confirmed by overexpression of Sesn2. 
Furthermore, SLAM-seq detects short-lived transcription factors, such as Egr1, 
that would have been missed in standard experimental designs with RNA-seq. Our 
results describe the successful establishment of SLAM-seq in CHO cells and 
therefore facilitate its future use in other scenarios where dynamic 
transcriptome profiling in CHO cells is essential. This article is protected by

576,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is a relatively common disease characterized 
by low bone mass and microstructural changes of trabecular bone. The reduced 
bone strength is caused a variety of complications, including fragility fracture 
and sarcopenia. We used CCK-8 and EdU assays to evaluate cell proliferation 
rates. The osteogenesis effect was detected using ALP staining, alizarin red 
staining, and q-PCR. In vivo, the effects of exosomes derived from HUC-MSCs were 
evaluated using HE staining, IHC staining and Masson staining. In addition, we 
explored the mechanism of exosomes and found that the AKT signaling pathway 
played an important role in osteogenesis and cell proliferation. This paper 
mainly explored the function of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord 
mesenchymal stem cells (HUC-MSCs) and provided a new strategy for the treatment 
of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In conclusion, exogenous administration of 
exosomes can contribute to the treatment postmenopausal osteoporosis to a 
certain extent."
577,"BACKGROUND: MCM8 has been reported highly expressed in several human 
malignancies. However, its role in HCC has not yet been researched.
METHODS: The prognostic significance of MCM8 mRNA expression was analyzed using 
datasets from TCGA and GEO databases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was used 
to detect the MCM8 protein expression in HCC tissues. The Cox regression 
analysis was employed to determine the independent prognostic value of MCM8. 
Then, we established a nomogram for OS and RFS prediction based on MCM8 protein 
expression. We analyzed the DNA methylation and genetic alteration of MCM8 in 
HCC. Moreover, GO, KEGG and GSEA were utilized to explore the potential 
biological functions of MCM8. Subsequently, we evaluate the correlations between 
MCM8 expression and composition of the tumor microenvironment as well as 
immunocyte infiltration ratio in HCC.
RESULTS: MCM8 mRNA and protein were significantly overexpressed in HCC tissues. 
High MCM8 protein expression was an independent risk factor for OS and RFS of 
HCC patients. MCM8 expression is altered in 60% of queried HCC patients. In 
addition, higher methylation of the CpG site cg03098629, cg10518808, and 
17230679 correlated with lower MCM8 levels. MCM8 expression correlated with cell 
cycle and DNA replication signaling. Moreover, MCM8 may be correlated with 
different compositions of the tumor microenvironment and immunocyte infiltration 
ratio in HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: MCM8 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and was associated with 
poor prognosis. Meanwhile, high expression of MCM8 may induce immune cell 
infiltration and may be a promising prognostic biomarker for HCC."
578,"This study aims to explore the specific mechanisms of SALL4 on the migration, 
invasion and proliferation of HCC. HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were transfected 
with SALL4 NC, mimics and inhibitors. The proliferation capability and cell 
cycle progression of HCC cells were detected through CCK8 assay and flow 
cytometry, and their migration and invasion capabilities were detected by wound 
healing assay and Transwell assay. In SALL4 inhibitor NC group and SALL4 
inhibitor group, the PTEN inhibitor SF1670 was added, and the expression levels 
of PI3K/AKT, migration, invasion and proliferation-related proteins were 
detected by Western blotting. Results showed that after up-regulation of SALL4, 
the migration distance of HCC cells increased, the numbers of migrated cells and 
the number of colonies formed significantly rosed, and there were fewer cells in 
G1 phase but significantly more cells in S phase, thereby down-regulation of 
SALL4, the opposite results. The results of Western blotting revealed that after 
SF1670, the specific PTEN inhibitor was added in SALL4 inhibitor group and SALL4 
inhibitor NC group, the protein expression of PTEN in HCC cells significantly 
declined, while the protein expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, MMP2, MMP9, CyclinD, 
CyclinA1, PCNA and P62 significantly rose. In conclusion, SALL4 activates the 
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through targeting PTEN, thereby facilitating the 
migration, invasion and proliferation of HCC cells."
579,"Muscle mass decreases with aging, while the C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) 
increases with aging; in this context, CCL2 can be considered a potential 
aging-promoting factor. Thus, CCL2 knockout mice are expected to exhibit 
anti-aging effects including protection against loss of muscle mass. However, 
instead, muscle amount and recovery of damaged muscles are decreased in CCL2 
knockout mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that increasing CCL2 in the elderly 
might be related to compensation for loss of muscle mass. To confirm the 
relationship between muscle and CCL2, we sought to establish the role of CCL2 in 
C2C12 cells and Human Skeletal Muscle Myoblast (HSMM) cells. The myotube (MT) 
fusion index increased with CCL2 compared to 5day CCL2 vehicle only (27.0 % 
increase, P<0.05) in immunocytochemistry staining (ICC) data. CCL2 also restored 
MTs atrophy caused by dexamethasone (21.8 % increase, P<0.0001). p-mTOR/mTOR and 
p-AKT/total AKT increased with CCL2 compared to CCL2 vehicle only (18.3 and 
30.5% increase respectively, P<0.05) and decreased with CCR2-siRNA compared to 
CCL2 (38.9 % (P<0.05) and 56.7% (P<0.005) reduction respectively). In 
conclusion, CCL2 positively affects myogenesis by CCR2 via AKT-mTOR signaling 
pathways. CCL2 might have potential as a therapeutic target for low muscle mass 
and muscle recovery."
580,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an ER-localized transmembrane protein 
and the receptor for 2',3'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate&endash;adenosine 
monophosphate (cGAMP), which is a second messenger produced by cGAMP synthase 
(cGAS), a cytosolic double-stranded DNA sensor. The cGAS-STING pathway plays a 
critical role in the innate immune response to infection of a variety of DNA 
pathogens through the induction of the type I interferons. Pharmacological 
activation of STING is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, thus the 
development of potent and selective STING agonists has been pursued. Here we 
report that mouse STING can be activated by phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a membrane 
permeable trivalent arsenic compound that preferentially reacts with thiol group 
of cysteine residue (Cys). The activation of STING with PAO does not require 
cGAS or cGAMP. Mass spectrometric analysis of the peptides generated by trypsin 
and chymotrypsin digestion of STING identifies several PAO adducts, suggesting 
that PAO covalently binds to STING. Screening of STING variants with single Cys 
to serine residues (Ser) reveals that Cys88 and Cys291 are critical to the 
response to PAO. STING activation with PAO, as with cGAMP, requires the 
ER-to-Golgi traffic and palmitoylation of STING. Our results identify a 
non-nucleotide STING agonist that does not target the cGAMP-binding pocket, and 
demonstrate that Cys of STING can be a novel target for the development of STING 
agonist.Key words: STING agonist, cysteine modification, innate immunity, 
phenylarsine oxide."
581,"In embryonic stem (ES) cell colonies, a small subpopulation that changes cell 
shape and loses pluripotency often appears in two-dimensional (2D) cultures, 
even in the presence of a stemness factor. We have previously shown that 
membrane translocation of the syntaxin4, t-SNARE protein contributes to this 
phenomenon. Here, we show that ES cells in three-dimensional (3D) aggregates do 
not succumb to extruded syntaxin4 owing to suppressed expression of P-cadherin 
protein. While extracellular expression of syntaxin4 led to the striking 
upregulation of P-cadherin mRNA in both 2D and 3D-ES cells, morphological 
changes and appreciable expression of P-cadherin protein were detected only in 
2D-ES cells. Importantly, the introduction of an expression cassette for 
P-cadherin practically reproduced the effects induced by extracellular 
syntaxin4, where the transgene product was clearly detected in 2D-, but not 
3D-ES cells. An expression construct for P-cadherin-Venus harboring an in-frame 
insertion of the P2A sequence at the joint region gave fluorescent signals only 
in the cytoplasm of 2D-ES cells, demonstrating translational regulation of 
P-cadherin. These results provide the mechanistic insight into the 
uncontrollable differentiation in 2D-ES cells and shed light on the validity of 
the ""embryoid body protocol commonly used for ES cell handling"" for directional 
differentiation.Key words: differentiation, embryoid body, ES cells, P-cadherin, 
syntaxin4."

583,"A 61-year-old man presented with a 7-day history of watery diarrhea and loss of 
appetite after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 
vaccine. Laboratory studies showed significant eosinophilia and an elevated IgE 
level (white cell count, 18.4×109/L; eosinophil count, 9.5×109/L; and IgE level, 
540 IU/L). Symptoms resolved 10 days after vaccination without any steroids or 
antiallergic medications, and the eosinophil count had also returned to within 
normal limits 2 months later. Several cases of eosinophilic disorders following 
receipt of any type of injectable COVID-19 vaccine have been reported, so the 
etiology should be examined."
584,"Immune suppression in elderly individuals is one of the most important hygienic 
problems in aged societies. The primary immune organ thymus is histologically 
and functionally reduced by aging, which is known as thymic involution. The 
thymus is also involuted by nutritional deficiency, which frequently occurs in 
elderly individuals. However, there is no information on the thymic changes 
caused by nutritional deficiency with aging. Therefore, this study was conducted 
to examine the histological and molecular responses of the thymus to nutritional 
deficiency in young and aged mice. The thymic size was significantly smaller in 
16- or 18-week-old aged mice than in 7-week-old young mice. Dietary restriction 
for 48 h reduced the thymic size in young mice, but not in aged mice. 
Immunostaining with anti-keratin 5 antibody revealed that the integrity of the 
corticomedullary boundary was maintained in the aged thymus, whereas dietary 
restriction induced its disorganization in both young and aged thymus. The 
numbers of IgG-positive cells were increased upon dietary restriction in aged, 
but not in young, thymus. Dietary restriction, but not aging, upregulated the 
mRNA levels of Th2-related Il5, Il6, and Il10, whereas aging increased that of 
Th1-related Ifng. The dietary restriction-induced upregulation of 
prostanoid-synthesizing enzymes was clearly observed in the young thymus but 
attenuated in the aged thymus. Thus, nutritional deficiency and aging cause an 
involuted thymus with different properties. Moreover, the thymus in aged mice 
does not show further reduction in size by nutritional deficiency but still 
responds differently compared with that in young mice."
585,"PURPOSE: Dysregulated circular RNAs (circRNAs) have shown crucial modulatory 
functions in tumorigenesis, containing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 
purpose of this study was to explore the biological functions and regulatory 
theory of circ_0006220 in NSCLC.
METHODS: Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 
Western blot assay were conducted to measure RNA and protein expression, 
respectively. A total of 73 cases of NSCLC tumor samples were collected for 
expression analysis, and A-549 and NCI-H1299 cell lines were used for functional 
experiments. Cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting kit-8 assay, 
colony formation assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, and flow cytometry. 
Cell apoptosis, motility, and angiogenesis ability were analyzed by flow 
cytometry, transwell assays, and capillary-like network formation assay. 
Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were conducted 
to verify the target relationships.
RESULTS: Circ_0006220 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. 
Circ_0006220 silencing inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and 
angiogenesis but induced the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Circ_0006220 acted as a 
microRNA-342-3p (miR-342-3p) sponge, and circ_0006220 knockdown-induced changes 
on the phenotypes of NSCLC cells were largely overturned by the knockdown of 
miR-342-3p. miR-342-3p interacted with the 3' untranslated region of 
glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2), and GOT2 overexpression largely 
diminished miR-342-3p overexpression-mediated influences in NSCLC cells. 
Circ_0006220 could up-regulate GOT2 expression by sponging miR-342-3p.
CONCLUSION: Circ_0006220 promoted the malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells through 
mediating the miR-342-3p/GOT2 regulation cascade."
586,"Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) usually involves bone marrow (BM) and sometimes 
lymph nodes and spleen. LPL presenting as a hepatic mass lesion is extremely 
rare, with only one case reported in the English literature. A 70-year-old 
Japanese female presented to us with a right hypochondriac mass with tenderness. 
Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 14 cm-sized bulky hepatic mass. Laboratory 
findings showed a normal white blood cell count of 4.1×109/L with 4% 
plasmacytoid lymphocytes; normocytic anemia, Hb 9.4 g/dL; high soluble IL-2 
receptor level, 2,290 U/mL; and elevated IgG, 10,306 mg/dL. Furthermore, IgG-κ 
monoclonal protein was detected. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography/CT revealed abnormal uptake in the liver mass; left supraclavicular, 
parasternal, abdominal, and left inguinal lymph nodes; and bilateral lung bases. 
Magnetic resonance imaging showed no bone lesions. BM aspiration and liver 
biopsy showed predominant infiltration of small lymphocytes admixed with 
plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells. In the liver specimen, 
lymphoepithelial lesions were not observed. The small lymphocytes were positive 
for CD20, CD79a, and bcl-2, and negative for CD5, CD10, cyclin D1, and IRTA1; 
plasma cells in BM were positive for CD19, CD45, IgG, and κ-chain, and negative 
for CD20, and CD56. MYD88 L265P mutation, reported in approximately 40% of 
non-IgM LPL cases, was not detected in the liver specimen and BM cells. The 
frequency is lower than that of typical IgM LPL. These findings led us to a 
diagnosis of LPL with IgG-κ paraproteinemia. The patient underwent four courses 
of R-CHOP and two courses of Bendamustine-R. Partial remission was achieved."
587,"3q27 chromosomal translocation involving the BCL6 gene is one of the most 
frequent forms of cytogenetic abnormality observed in B-cell lymphoma. We report 
a case with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presenting dual 3q27 
translocations. The patient was a 71-year-old man who presented with swelling of 
multiple abdominal lymph nodes (LNs) and obstructive jaundice. LN biopsy 
exhibited dense proliferation of atypical large cells expressing CD20, 
MUM1/IRF4, BCL2, BCL6, and MYC, but not CD10. He was diagnosed with non-GCB/ABC 
type DLBCL and showed an initially good response to R-CHOP chemotherapy, but 
relapsed soon after the completion of therapy. Chromosomal analysis of the 
biopsied LN exhibited multiple abnormalities including t(3;14)(q27;q32) and 
t(3;22)(q27;q11). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using BCL6 
break-apart probes confirmed chromosomal breaks occurring on both BCL6 alleles. 
Molecular analysis revealed two independent rearrangements of BCL6, either with 
the IGH or the IGL gene. 3q27 breakpoints were located 1.2kb apart from each 
other within the first intron of BCL6, while the IGH and IGL breaks occurred at 
the 5' of IGHG2 and within IGLV3-1, respectively. The results suggest that 
biallelic BCL6 rearrangements might be a rare but recurrent genetic event in 
B-cell lymphoma."
588,"Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare malignancy showing morphologic and 
immunophenotypic features of histiocytes. HS has morphologic overlap with many 
other diseases, including various kinds of lymphomas. Gray zone lymphoma (GZL) 
is a rare B-cell lymphoma subtype characterized by overlapping features between 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma. The histologic 
overlap with other diverse diseases of HS and the pathological diversity of GZL 
make it difficult to render a diagnosis. A 44-year-old woman who was initially 
diagnosed with HS was diagnosed with GZL after reexamination, including a 
genetic alteration test. After 6 cycles of brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, 
vinblastine, and dacarbazine, she achieved a complete response. Genomic 
alteration assessment may be useful for the accurate diagnosis of malignant 
lymphomas, which are difficult to diagnose, such as GZL."
589,"The cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) regimen, 
containing doxorubicin (DXR), which is a key drug for aggressive non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL), is a standard chemotherapeutic regimen; however, its 
administration in elderly patients is often intolerable. Pirarubicin 
(tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin [THP]) is an anthracycline developed in Japan. We 
have conducted a phase II trial of a full-dose THP-COP (modified CHOP regimen 
with DXR replaced by THP) regimen for elderly patients with newly diagnosed, 
advanced-stage, aggressive NHL. Patients aged 70-79 years old with previously 
untreated NHL according to the Working Formulation (D through H and J), disease 
stage I with a bulky mass or stage II-IV, and performance status of 0-1 were 
eligible. The THP-COP regimen, which consisted of 750-mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 
50-mg/m2 THP, 1.4-mg/m2 vincristine (capped at 2.0 mg) on day 1, and 100-mg 
prednisolone daily on days 1 to 5, was delivered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. The 
primary endpoint was complete response (CR) rate. Twenty-nine patients were 
enrolled in the study. The CR rate was 65.5% (95% confidence interval, 
45.7-82.1%). The 3-year failure-free and overall survival rates were 54.1% and 
53.9%, respectively. The most frequent observed grade 3 or 4 toxicity was 
neutropenia, which occurred in 80% of the patients. Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction 
was observed in one patient. The full-dose THP-COP regimen exhibited similar 
efficacy and safety, and a tendency for less cardiac toxicity, when compared 
with the standard CHOP regimen in elderly Japanese patients with newly 
diagnosed, advanced-stage, aggressive NHL."
590,"Trophoblast invasion is a hallmark of hemochorial placentation. Invasive 
trophoblast cells replace the endothelial cells of uterine spiral arteries. The 
mechanism by which the invasive trophoblast cells acquire this phenotype is 
unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, during differentiation, a small population 
of trophoblast stem (TS) cells trans-differentiate into a hybrid cell type 
expressing markers of both trophoblast (TC) and endothelial (EC) cells. In 
addition, a compendium of EC-specific genes was found to be associated with TS 
cell differentiation. Using functional annotation, these genes were categorized 
into angiogenesis, cell adhesion molecules, and apoptosis-related genes. HES1 
repressed transcription of EC genes in TS cells. Interestingly, differentiated 
TCs secrete TRAIL, but its receptor DR4 is expressed only in ECs and not in TCs. 
TRAIL induced apoptosis in EC but not in TC. Co-culture of ECs with TC induced 
apoptosis in ECs via extrinsic apoptotic pathway. These results highlight that 
(a) TS cells possess the potential to trans-differentiate into 
""trophendothelial"" phenotype, regulated by HES1 and (b) trophoblast 
differentiation-induced TRAIL secretion directs preferential demise of ECs 
located in their vicinity."
591,"Direct contact between cells expressing either ephrin ligands or Eph receptor 
tyrosine kinase produces diverse developmental responses. Transmembrane ephrinB 
ligands play active roles in transducing bi-directional signals downstream of 
EphB/ephrinB interaction. However, it has not been well understood how ephrinB 
relays transcellular signals to neighboring cells and what intracellular 
effectors are involved. Here, we report that kindlin2 can mediate bi-directional 
ephrinB signaling through binding to a highly conserved NIYY motif in the 
ephrinB2 cytoplasmic tail. We show this interaction is important for 
EphB/ephrinB-mediated integrin activation in mammalian cells and for blood 
vessel morphogenesis during zebrafish development. A mixed two-cell population 
study revealed that kindlin2 (in ephrinB2-expressing cells) modulates 
transcellular EphB4 activation by promoting ephrinB2 clustering. This mechanism 
is also operative for EphB2/ephrinB1, suggesting that kindlin2-mediated 
regulation is conserved for EphB/ephrinB signaling pathways. Together, these 
findings show that kindlin2 enables EphB4/ephrinB2 bi-directional signal 
transmission."
592,"Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit, of which genetic etiologies are 
a frequent cause. Dominant and recessive mutations in TMC1, a gene encoding the 
pore-forming subunit of the hair cell mechanotransduction channel, cause DFNA36 
and DFNB7/11, respectively, accounting for ∼2% of genetic hearing loss. Previous 
work has established the efficacy of mutation-targeted RNAi in treatment of 
murine models of autosomal dominant non-syndromic deafness. However, application 
of such approaches is limited by the infeasibility of development and validation 
of novel constructs for each variant. We developed an allele-non-specific 
approach consisting of mutation-agnostic RNAi suppression of both mutant and WT 
alleles, co-delivered with a knockdown-resistant engineered WT allele with or 
without the use of woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory 
element (WPRE) to augment transgene expression. This therapeutic construct was 
delivered into the mature murine model of DFNA36 with an AAV vector and achieved 
robust hair cell and auditory brainstem response preservation. However, 
WPRE-enhanced Tmc1 expression resulted in inferior outcomes, suggesting a role 
for gene dosage optimization in future TMC1 gene therapy development."
593,"Developing high-performance catalysts for fuel cell catalysis is one of the most 
critical and challenging steps for the commercialization of fuel cell 
technology. Here one-dimensional trimetallic platinum-iron-cobalt nanosaws (Pt3 
FeCo NSs) with low-coordination features were designed as efficient bifunctional 
electrocatalysts for practical fuel cell catalysis. The oxygen reduction 
reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3 FeCo NSs (10.62 mA cm-2 and 4.66 A mg-1 Pt at 
0.90 V) is more than 25 folds higher than that of the commercial Pt/C, even 
after 30000 voltage cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal 
that the strong inter-d-orbital electron transfer minimizes the ORR barrier with 
even higher selectivity at robust valence states. The volcano correlation 
between the intrinsic structure featured with low-coordination Pt-sites and 
corresponding electronic activities is discovered, which guarantees high ORR 
activities. The Pt3 FeCo NSs located in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) 
also achieve very high peak power density (1800.6 mW cm-2 ) and competitive 
specific/mass activities (1.79 mA cm-2 and 0.79 A mg-1 Pt at 0.90 ViR-free cell 
voltage) as well as a long-term lifetime in specific H2 -O2 medium for proton 
exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ranking top electrocatalysts reported to 
date for MEA. This work represents a class of multimetallic Pt-based 
nanocatalysts for practical fuel cells and beyond. This article is protected by

595,"The Golgi apparatus modifies and transports secretory and membrane proteins. In 
some instances, the production of secretory and membrane proteins exceeds the 
capacity of the Golgi apparatus, including vesicle trafficking and the 
post-translational modification of macromolecules. These proteins are not 
modified or delivered appropriately due to insufficiency in the Golgi function. 
These conditions disturb Golgi homeostasis and induce a cellular condition known 
as Golgi stress, causing cells to activate the 'Golgi stress response,' which is 
a homeostatic process to increase the capacity of the Golgi based on cellular 
requirements. Since the Golgi functions are diverse, several response pathways 
involving TFE3, HSP47, CREB3, proteoglycan, mucin, MAPK/ETS, and PERK regulate 
the capacity of each Golgi function separately. Understanding the Golgi stress 
response is crucial for revealing the mechanisms underlying Golgi dynamics and 
its effect on human health because many signaling molecules are related to 
diseases, ranging from viral infections to fatal neurodegenerative diseases. 
Therefore, it is valuable to summarize and investigate the mechanisms underlying 
Golgi stress response in disease pathogenesis, as they may contribute to 
developing novel therapeutic strategies. In this review, we investigate the 
perturbations and stress signaling of the Golgi, as well as the therapeutic 
potentials of new strategies for treating Golgi stress-associated diseases."
596,"INTRODUCTION: Lung transplant (LTX) patients are at high risk of cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) infection, which is often associated with high mortality and morbidity. 
Reactivation of CMV causes cell injury due to the cytopathic effect of viral 
replication and triggering of T cell immunity. The aim of this study was to 
compare expression of Immune checkpoints (ICs) (PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3 and TIGIT) 
in CD4, CD8 and CD56 and activation markers CD137, CD154 and CD69 of end-stage 
patients awaiting lung transplant.
METHODS: Eighteen pre-LTX positive for anti-CMV IgG titres and 18 healthy 
subjects were enrolled. IC and activation markers has been evaluated through 
flow cytometric analysis in HC and pre-LTX patients. Reactive (QF+) and 
unreactive (QF-) patients were stratified according to QuantiFERON-CMV assays. 
ICs and activation markers expression were determined before and after in vitro 
stimulation with pp-65 and IE-1 antigens.
RESULTS: Lower expression of PD-1 was observed in CD4 and CD8 cells of pre-LTX 
patients than controls, whereas CTLA4 appeared up-regulated in CD56 and CD8 
cells. TIGIT is increased on the surface of CD4, CD8 and NK cells after peptide 
stimulation in QF-negative patients and PD-1 is only downregulated after 
stimulation in the QF-positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new evidence of immune dysregulation in 
patients with end-stage lung disorders, particularly in relation to immune 
checkpoint cell biology. The change in QF+ mostly happens on cytotoxic cells NK 
and CD8, while the changes in QF- were observed in adaptive immune cells, 
including CD4 and CD8."
597,"The passivity of aluminum is detrimental to its performance as an anode in 
batteries. Soaking of native oxide-covered aluminum in a chloroaluminate deep 
eutectic solvent gradually activates the electrode surface, which is reflected 
in a continuously decreasing open circuit potential. The underlying processes 
were studied by analyzing the 3 to 7 nm thick layer of native oxide after 
increasing periods of soaking with secondary neutral mass spectrometry, X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy in a transmission 
electron microscope. They consistently show permeation of electrolyte species 
into the layer associated with gradual swelling. After extended periods of 
soaking at open circuit potentials, local deposits of a range of foreign metals 
have been found in scanning electron microscopy images of the electrode surface. 
The pitting corrosion is caused by trace metal ion impurities present in the 
electrolyte and results in highly nonuniform current density distribution during 
discharge/charge cycling of battery cells as shown by local deposits of 
aluminum. The processes during soaking at open circuit potentials have been 
monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and could be analyzed by 
fitting an equivalent circuit model for pitting corrosion."
598,"The mechanisms by which angiotensin II type 1 receptor is distributed and the 
diffusional pattern in the plasma membrane (PM) remain unclear, despite their 
crucial role in cardiovascular homeostasis. In this work, we obtained 
quantitative information of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) lateral 
dynamics as well as changes in the diffusion properties after stimulation with 
ligands in living cells using photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) 
combined with image spatial-temporal correlation analysis. To study the 
organization of the receptor at the nanoscale, expansion microscopy (ExM) 
combined with PALM was performed. This study revealed that AT1R lateral 
diffusion increased after binding to angiotensin II (Ang II) and the receptor 
diffusion was transiently confined in the PM. In addition, ExM revealed that 
AT1R formed nanoclusters at the PM and the cluster size significantly decreased 
after Ang II treatment. Taking these results together suggest that Ang II 
binding and activation cause reorganization and changes in the dynamics of AT1R 
at the PM."
599,"Protein structure affects allergenicity, and critical structural elements, 
especially conformational epitopes that determine allergenicity, have attracted 
a great deal of interest. In this study, we aimed to identify the localized 
structure that affects the potential allergenicity of protein by making targeted 
modifications of Ara h 2 and comparing the structure and allergenicity of 
mutants with those of the wide-type allergen. The structures of the allergen and 
its mutants were characterized by circular dichroism and ultraviolet absorption 
spectroscopy and simulated by molecular dynamics. The allergenicity was assessed 
by Western blotting, an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 
a cell model, and a mouse model. Then, the structures that affect allergenicity 
were analyzed and screened. Our results showed that mutations in amino acids 
changed the nearby localized structure and the overall structures. The 
structural changes affected the IgE binding capacity of the allergen and reduced 
its potential allergenicity. The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of 
aromatic residues was positively correlated with the IgE binding capacity. The 
integrity of the disulfide bond is also critical for the binding of IgE to 
allergens. Interestingly, different mutations induced similar electrostatic 
potential and allergenicity changes, such as localized structure 
R62DPYSPSQDPYSPS75. In conclusion, the disulfide bond and the SASA of aromatic 
residues are important for the allergenicity of Ara h 2. The localized structure 
R62DPYSPSQDPYSPS75 is also crucial for the allergenicity of Ara h 2."
600,"Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) is renowned as a powerful 
genetic model for deciphering cellular and molecular biological phenomena, 
including cell division, chromosomal events, stress responses, and human 
carcinogenesis. Traditionally, Africans use S. pombe to ferment the beer called 
'Pombe', which continues to be consumed in many parts of Africa. Although not as 
widely utilized as the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. pombe has 
secured several niches in the food industry for human nutrition because of its 
unique metabolism. This review will explore three specific facets of human 
nutrition where S. pombe has made a significant impact: namely, in wine 
fermentation, animal husbandry and neutraceutical supplementation coenzyme Q10 
production. Discussions focus on the current gaps in these areas, and the 
potential research advances useful for addressing future challenges. Overall, 
gaining a better understanding of S. pombe metabolism will strengthen production 
in these areas and potentially spearhead novel future applications."
601,"Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in cerebral ischemic stroke (IS). In the 
acute phase of IS, microglia are activated towards the pro-inflammatory (M1) and 
anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. Argon, an inert gas, can reduce 
neuroinflammation and alleviate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, 
whether argon regulates M1/M2 polarization to protect against I/R injury as well 
as the underlying mechanism has not been reported. In this study, we analyzed 
the activation and polarization of microglia after I/R injury with or without 
argon administration and explored the effects of argon on NLRP3 
inflammasome-mediated inflammation in microglia in vitro and in vivo. The 
results showed that argon application inhibited the activation of M1 
microglia/macrophage in the ischemic penumbra and the expression of proteins 
related to NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis in microglia. Argon administration 
also inhibited the expression and processing of IL-1β, a primary 
pro-inflammatory cytokine. Thus, argon alleviates I/R injury by inhibiting 
pro-inflammatory reactions via suppressing microglial polarization towards M1 
phenotype and inhibiting the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. More 
importantly, we showed that argon worked better than the specific NLRP3 
inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 in suppressing neuroinflammation and protecting 
against cerebral I/R injury, suggesting the therapeutic potential of argon in 
neuroinflammation-related neurodegeneration diseases as a potent gas inhibitor 
of the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway."
602,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, 
annually resulting in 20 million infections, 3 million cases of clinical 
disease, and 60,000 fatalities worldwide, significantly endangering pregnant 
women and immunocompromised individuals. HEV-related research has been 
considerably delayed, and no HEV-specific therapeutics have yet been developed. 
We aimed to discover efficient anti-HEV drugs through high throughput screening 
that could be validated in vitro and in a preclinical animal study in vivo, and 
elucidate the underlying antiviral mechanism.
METHODS: Using appropriate cellular and rodent HEV infection models, we studied 
a critical pathway for host-HEV interaction and performed a preclinical study of 
the corresponding antivirals by targeting proteostasis of the HEV replicase.
RESULTS: We found 17 inhibitors that target HEV-HSP90 interactions by an 
unbiased compound library screening on human hepatocytes harboring an HEV 
replicon. Inhibitors of HSP90 (iHSP90) markedly suppressed HEV replication with 
efficacy exceeding that of conventional antivirals (IFNα and ribavirin) in 
vitro. Mechanistically, iHSP90 treatment released the viral replicase ORF1 
protein from the ORF1-HSP90 complex and triggered ORF1 for rapid 
ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in abrogated HEV 
replication. Furthermore, a preclinical trial in a Mongolian gerbil HEV 
infection model showed this novel anti-HEV strategy to be safe, efficient, and 
able to prevent HEV-induced liver damage.
CONCLUSIONS: This study collectively illustrates a critical proteostasis pathway 
for host-HEV interaction and paves the way for translating the new understanding 
of the HEV life cycle into clinically promising antivirals.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Appropriate treatment options for HEV-infected pregnant 
women as well as immunocompromised patients are lacking, creating an urgent need 
for developing safe HEV-specific therapies. This study identified new antivirals 
(inhibitors of HSP90) that significantly decrease the HEV infection by targeting 
viral replicase for degradation. Moreover, these anti-HEV drugs were validated 
in an HEV rodent model and found to be safe and efficient for prevention of 
HEV-induced liver injury in preclinical experiments. Our findings substantially 
promote the understanding of HEV pathobiology and the pace of antiviral 
development."
603,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) exhibit a baseline 
hypercoagulable state and are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism 
(VTE). There is little data on the efficacy of standard prophylaxis in 
preventing VTE following non-cardiovascular surgery in this patient population. 
Our objective was to investigate the incidence of VTE in patients with SCD 
undergoing non-cardiovascular surgery.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review for 352 patients with SCD who 
underwent non-cardiovascular surgery from August 2009 to August 2019 at Beaumont 
Hospitals. An equal number of controls without SCD were propensity-matched for 
age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and specific surgery. Data collected 
included demographics, comorbidities, VTE prophylaxis used, the occurrence of 
deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), hospital length of stay, and 
30-day mortality.
RESULTS: There was no difference in age, race, sex, ethnicity, operative time, 
or hospital length of stay between SCD and propensity-matched control patients. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis was used more frequently in SCD patients 
than in controls (96.3% vs 88.6%, P<.001). Four DVTs were seen in SCD patients 
(1.1%) vs five in the control group (1.4%, P>.999); one patients in each group 
developed a pulmonary embolism (PE) 0.3%, P>.999). There was no difference in 
30-day mortality among SCD patients vs controls (1, 0.3% vs 3, 0.9%, P=.312). Of 
those diagnosed with VTE within 30 days postoperatively, there were no 
differences in age, sex, race, BMI, or procedure type. DVT was diagnosed 
significantly later in SCD patients than in controls (median post-operative day 
12 vs 5, P=.014). None of the five SCD patients with VTE was a smoker, whereas 
four of the six non-SCD patients with VTE were current or former tobacco users 
(P=.061). All patients who developed VTE had received DVT prophylaxis at the 
time of surgery.
CONCLUSION: There appears to be no difference in the perioperative rates of DVT, 
PE, or mortality in SCD patients undergoing non-cardiovascular surgery compared 
with matched controls. Vigilant attention to routine venous prophylaxis seems to 
effectively reduce the VTE risk in these hypercoagulable patients. SCD patients 
may need VTE prophylaxis for a longer period postoperatively than those without 
SCD."
604,"Platelets are increasingly recognized as key regulators of inflammatory and 
immune responses, through their interaction with endothelium and immune cells. 
Therefore they might have a role in transfusion-related acute lung injury 
(TRALI), in which endothelial cells and neutrophils are the key players. In this 
study, by a classic TRALI animal model, combining a custom-designed system for 
intravital confocal microscopy of pulmonary microvasculature and a platelet 
tracking technique, we found that thrombin-activated platelets transfusion 
aggravated TRALI while resting platelets transfusion alleviated TRALI. Promoting 
endogenous platelets activation also aggravated TRALI while inhibiting 
endogenous platelets activation alleviated TRALI. Activated platelets interfered 
with the stability of endothelial barrier function while resting platelets 
modulated the activation of neutrophils. Anti-thrombin could alleviate TRALI, 
which was not reproduced upon anti-GPIIbIIIa or anti-P-selectin In conclusion, 
platelets might play a dual role (protective and pathogenic) in TRALI, the 
balance between the two roles is highly dependent on whether platelets are 
activated by thrombin or not. This might explain the conflicting results of 
previous researches studying the contribution of platelets in TRALI by platelet 
depletion technology, in which the induction of TRALI and the condition of 
animals were different, hence the state of platelets during TRALI was different. 
Moreover, anti-platelet-activation (such as anti-thrombin) might be a better 
approach than anti-activated-platelets (such as anti-P-selectin) to search for 
potential therapies in TRALI. Considering the involvement of thrombin-activated 
platelets in TRALI, anti-thrombin might be needed when blood component 
transfusion is performed."
605,"The changes in gut microbiota have been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC). 
The interplays between the host and gut microbiota remain largely unclear, and 
few studies have investigated these interplays using integrative multi-omics 
data. In this study, large-scale multi-comic datasets, including microbiome, 
metabolome, bulk transcriptomics and single cell RNA sequencing of CRC patients, 
were analyzed individually and integrated through advanced bioinformatics 
methods. We further examined the clinical relevance of these findings in the 
mice recolonized with microbiota from human. We found that CRC patients had 
distinct microbiota compositions compared to healthy controls. A 
machine-learning model was developed with 28 biomarkers for detection of CRC, 
which had high accuracy and clinical applicability. We identified multiple 
significant correlations between genera and well-characterized genes, suggesting 
the potential role of gut microbiota in tumor immunity. Further analysis showed 
that specific metabolites worked as profound communicators between these genera 
and tumor immunity. Integrating microbiota and metabolome perspectives, we 
catalogued gut taxonomic and metabolomic features that represented the key 
multi-omics signature of CRC. Furthermore, gut microbiota from CRC patients 
transplanted to compromise the response of CRC to immunotherapy. These 
phenotypes were strongly associated with the alterations in gut microbiota, 
immune cell infiltration as well as multiple metabolic pathways. The 
comprehensive interplays across multi-comic data of CRC might explain how gut 
microbiota influenced tumor immunity. Hence, we proposed that modifying the CRC 
microbiota using healthy donors might serve as a promising strategy to improve 
response to immunotherapy."
606,"Many cell cycle regulatory proteins catalyze cell cycle progression in a 
concentration-dependent manner. In the fission yeast S. pombe, the protein 
kinase Cdr2 promotes mitotic entry by organizing cortical oligomeric nodes that 
lead to inhibition of Wee1, which itself inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinase 
Cdk1. cdr2Δ cells lack nodes and divide at increased size due to overactive 
Wee1, but it has not been known how increased Cdr2 levels might impact Wee1 and 
cell size. It also has not been clear if and how Cdr2 might regulate Wee1 in the 
absence of the related kinase Cdr1/Nim1. Using a Tetracycline-inducible 
expression system, we found that a 6X increase in Cdr2 expression caused 
hyperphosphorylation of Wee1 and reduction in cell size even in the absence of 
Cdr1/Nim1. This overexpressed Cdr2 formed clusters that sequestered Wee1 
adjacent to the nuclear envelope. Cdr2 mutants that disrupt either kinase 
activity or clustering ability failed to sequester Wee1 and to reduce cell size. 
We propose that Cdr2 acts as a dosage-dependent regulator of cell size by 
sequestering its substrate Wee1 in cytoplasmic clusters, away from Cdk1 in the 
nucleus. This mechanism has implications for other clustered kinases, which may 
act similarly by sequestering substrates."
607,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are transient lipid storage organelles that can be readily 
tapped to resupply cells with energy or lipid building blocks, and therefore 
play a central role in cellular metabolism. However, the molecular factors and 
underlying mechanisms that regulate the growth and degradation of LDs are poorly 
understood. It has emerged that proteins that establish contacts between LDs and 
the ER play a critical role in regulating LD metabolism. Recently, the autophagy 
related protein, Double FYVE Domain Containing Protein 1 (DFCP1/ZFYV1) was shown 
to reside at the interface of the ER and LDs, however, little is known about the 
involvement of DFCP1 in autophagy and LD metabolism. Here, we show that DFCP1 is 
a novel NTPase that regulates free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism. Specifically, we 
show that DFPC1-knockdown, particularly during starvation, increases cellular 
FFAs and decreases the levels of cellular TAGs, resulting in accumulated small 
LDs. Using selective truncations, we show that DFCP1 accumulation on LDs in 
cells and in vitro is regulated by a previously unknown NTPase domain. Using 
spectroscopic approaches, we show that this NTPase domain can dimerize and can 
hydrolyze both ATP and GTP. Furthermore, mutations in DFCP1 that either impact 
nucleotide hydrolysis or dimerization result in changes in the accumulation of 
DFCP1 on LDs, changes in LD density and size, and colocalization of LDs to 
autophagosomes. Collectively, our findings suggest that DFCP1 is an NTPase that 
modulates the metabolism of LDs in cells."
608,"High-voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) is a promising next-generation cathode 
material due to its structural stability, high operation voltage, and low cost. 
However, the cycle life of LNMO cells is compromised by detrimental 
electrode-electrolyte reactions, chemical crossover, and rapid anode 
degradation. Here, we demonstrate that the cycling stability of LNMO can be 
effectively enhanced by a high-energy laser treatment. Advanced 
characterizations unveil that the laser treatment induces partial decomposition 
of the polyvinylidene fluoride binder and formation of a surface LiF phase, 
which mitigates electrode-electrolyte side reactions and reduces the generation 
of dissolved transition-metal ions and acidic crossover species. As a result, 
the solid electrolyte interphase of the graphite counter electrode is thin and 
is composed of fewer electrolyte decomposition products. This work demonstrates 
the potential of laser treatment in tuning the surface chemistry of cathode 
materials for lithium-ion batteries."
609,"Flexible perovskite solar cells (fPSCs) with the inverted structure (p-i-n 
structure) show a promising commercialization future, owing to their lightweight 
and high efficiencies. Phenyl-C61-butyric-acid methyl ester (PCBM) is widely 
used as the n-type material due to its excellent conductivity and solvent 
processability. However, the commonly used chlorobenzene (CB), as the solvent of 
PCBM solution, is well recognized as a halogenated contaminant in the 
environment and is harmful to human health. There is an imperative need to 
develop nonhalogenated green solvents to replace CB. This work discusses the 
selection of green solvents based on the Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs). It 
is found that 2-methylanisole (2-MEA) acts as an excellent alternative to CB, 
with which high-quality PCBM films could be deposited. The experimental and 
theoretical studies demonstrate that 2-MEA can suppress the formation of PCBM 
aggregations during the solvation process compared with CB. The more uniform 
PCBM film achieved from the 2-MEA solution benefits carrier extraction at the 
electronic transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface. As a result, better 
efficiencies are received among fPSCs based on the 2-MEA-processed PCBM, 
superior to that of the fPSCs based on the CB-processed PCBM. Moreover, using 
1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive is proven to further increase the 
solubility of PCBM in the 2-MEA solution, resulting in enhanced efficiencies of 
the flexible PSCs by more than 5% (from 19.25 to 20.30%). The developed 
green-solvent strategy is of great importance for the future large-scale 
production of environmentally sustainable fPSCs."
610,"INTRODUCTION: The Paris classification highlights the need to focus on 
accurately identifying high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC). Herein, we aimed 
to assess the overall implementation and diagnostic performance of the Paris 
classification for reporting urinary cytology in a cancer center.
METHODS: All urinary cytology reports from July 2018 to December 2019 were 
collected (n = 1,240). Only voided urine samples were included (n = 1,180). Risk 
of high-grade malignancy (ROHM) was calculated for each Paris category. The 
diagnostic performance of urinary cytology was assessed, including sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), 
and accuracy.
RESULTS: The distribution of categories was: 0.3% unsatisfactory, 90.5% negative 
for HGUC, 5.6% atypical urothelial cells (AUC), 1.6% suspicious for HGUC, 1.9% 
HGUC, and 0.1% other malignancies. No diagnosis of low-grade urothelial 
neoplasia was given. The ROHM was 21.4% for negative for HGUC, 66.7% for AUC, 
91.7% for suspicious for HGUC, and 100% for HGUC. When using suspicious for HGUC 
as a cutoff, the diagnostic performance of urinary cytology in identifying HGUC 
histology was 46% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 96% PPV, 68% NPV, and 74% 
accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Specificity of urinary cytology was very high (with only 1 
false-positive result), which is important since this will trigger a clinical 
intervention. The ROHM for each category was in accordance with literature, 
except for AUC where ROHM was slightly higher (66.7%). This may be explained by 
the study population characteristics (cancer center; many patients treated with 
intravesical therapies; lack of clinical annotation for patients referred from 
outside institutions)."
611,"Adequate mass and function of adipose tissues (ATs) play essential roles in 
preventing metabolic perturbations. The pathological reduction of ATs in 
lipodystrophy leads to an array of metabolic diseases. Understanding the 
underlying mechanisms may benefit the development of effective therapies. 
Several cellular processes, including autophagy and vesicle trafficking, 
function collectively to maintain AT homeostasis. Here, we investigated the 
impact of adipocyte-specific deletion of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) on AT homeostasis and systemic 
metabolism in mice. We report that PIK3C3 functions in all ATs and that its 
absence disturbs adipocyte autophagy and hinders adipocyte differentiation, 
survival, and function with differential effects on brown and white ATs. These 
abnormalities cause loss of white ATs, whitening followed by loss of brown ATs, 
and impaired ""browning"" of white ATs. Consequently, mice exhibit compromised 
thermogenic capacity and develop dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin 
resistance, and type 2 diabetes. While these effects of PIK3C3 largely contrast 
previous findings with the autophagy-related (ATG) protein ATG7 in adipocytes, 
mice with a combined deficiency in both factors reveal a dominant role of the 
PIK3C3-deficient phenotype. We have also found that dietary lipid excess 
exacerbates AT pathologies caused by PIK3C3 deficiency. Surprisingly, glucose 
tolerance is spared in adipocyte-specific PIK3C3-deficient mice, a phenotype 
that is more evident during dietary lipid excess. These findings reveal a 
crucial yet complex role for PIK3C3 in ATs, with potential therapeutic 
implications."
612,"Dose-limiting cardiotoxicity remains a major limitation in the clinical use of 
cancer chemotherapeutics. Here, we describe a role for Regulator of G protein 
Signaling 7 (RGS7) in chemotherapy-dependent heart damage, the demonstration for 
a functional role of RGS7 outside of the nervous system and retina. Though 
expressed at low levels basally, we observed robust up-regulation of RGS7 in the 
human and murine myocardium following chemotherapy exposure. In ventricular 
cardiomyocytes (VCM), RGS7 forms a complex with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase (CaMKII) supported by key residues (K412 and P391) in the RGS 
domain of RGS7. In VCM treated with chemotherapeutic drugs, RGS7 facilitates 
CaMKII oxidation and phosphorylation and CaMKII-dependent oxidative stress, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Cardiac-specific RGS7 knockdown 
protected the heart against chemotherapy-dependent oxidative stress, fibrosis, 
and myocyte loss and improved left ventricular function in mice treated with 
doxorubicin. Conversely, RGS7 overexpression induced fibrosis, reactive oxygen 
species generation, and cell death in the murine myocardium that were mitigated 
following CaMKII inhibition. RGS7 also drives production and release of the 
cardiokine neuregulin-1, which facilitates paracrine communication between VCM 
and neighboring vascular endothelial cells (EC), a maladaptive mechanism 
contributing to VCM dysfunction in the failing heart. Importantly, while RGS7 
was both necessary and sufficient to facilitate chemotherapy-dependent 
cytotoxicity in VCM, RGS7 is dispensable for the cancer-killing actions of these 
same drugs. These selective myocyte-intrinsic and myocyte-extrinsic actions of 
RGS7 in heart identify RGS7 as an attractive therapeutic target in the 
mitigation of chemotherapy-driven cardiotoxicity."
613,"The Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48 complex is a universal protein segregase that plays key 
roles in eukaryotic cellular processes. Its functions orchestrating the 
clearance or removal of polyubiquitylated targets are established; however, 
prior studies suggest that the complex also targets substrates modified by the 
ubiquitin-like protein SUMO. Here, we show that interactions between Ufd1 and 
SUMO enhance unfolding of substrates modified by SUMO-polyubiquitin hybrid 
chains by the budding yeast Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48 complex compared to substrates 
modified by polyubiquitin chains, a difference that is accentuated when the 
complex has a choice between these substrates. Incubating Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48 with a 
substrate modified by a SUMO-polyubiquitin hybrid chain produced a series of 
single-particle cryo-EM structures that reveal features of interactions between 
Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48 and ubiquitin prior to and during unfolding of ubiquitin. These 
results are consistent with cellular functions for SUMO and ubiquitin 
modifications and support a physical model wherein Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48, SUMO, and 
ubiquitin conjugation pathways converge to promote clearance of proteins 
modified with SUMO and polyubiquitin."
614,"During exocytosis, the fusion of secretory vesicle with plasma membrane forms a 
pore that regulates release of neurotransmitter and peptide. Heterogeneity of 
fusion pore behavior has been attributed to stochastic variation in a common 
exocytic mechanism, implying a lack of biological control. Using a fluorescent 
false neurotransmitter (FFN), we imaged dense core vesicle (DCV) exocytosis in 
primary mouse adrenal chromaffin cells by total internal reflection fluorescence 
microscopy at millisecond resolution and observed strikingly divergent modes of 
release, with fast events lasting <30 ms and slow events persisting for seconds. 
Dual imaging of slow events shows a delay in the entry of external dye relative 
to FFN release, suggesting exclusion by an extremely narrow pore <1 nm in 
diameter. Unbiased comprehensive analysis shows that the observed variation 
cannot be explained by stochasticity alone, but rather involves distinct 
mechanisms, revealing the bimodal nature of DCV exocytosis. Further, loss of 
calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 increases the proportion of slow events without 
changing the intrinsic properties of either class, indicating the potential for 
independent regulation. The identification of two distinct mechanisms for 
release capable of independent regulation suggests a biological basis for the 
diversity of fusion pore behavior."
615,"Many receptors signal upon phosphorylation of tyrosine-based motifs in their 
cytosolic tail, with intrinsic disorder as a common feature. Studies on CD3ζ and 
CD3ε tails, which are disordered and polybasic, suggested regulation of 
phosphorylation through accessibility of tyrosines, governed by electrostatic 
interactions with membrane anionic lipids. We noticed characteristics of 
intrinsic disorder and previously unappreciated features in tyrosine-based 
motif-bearing cytosolic tails of many, especially, inhibitory receptors. They 
are neutral or acidic polyampholytes, with acidic and basic residues linearly 
segregated. To explore roles of these electrostatic features, we studied 
inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR). Its cytosolic tail is 
a disordered neutrally charged polyampholyte, wherein juxtamembrane and membrane 
distal stretches are basic, and the intervening stretch is acidic. Despite 
lacking net charge, it interacted electrostatically with the plasma membrane. 
The juxtamembrane stretch was crucial for overall binding, which sequestered 
tyrosines in the lipid bilayer and restrained their constitutive 
phosphorylation. Human leukocyte antigen-C ligand binding to KIR released its 
tail from the plasma membrane to initiate signaling. Tail release occurred 
independently of KIR polymerization, clustering, or tyrosine phosphorylation, 
but required acidic residues of the acidic stretch. Tail interaction with the 
plasma membrane dictated signaling strength of KIR. These results revealed an 
electrostatic protein-lipid interaction that is unusual in being governed by 
segregated clusters of acidic and basic residues in polyampholytic disordered 
region of protein. In contrast to previously known, segregated distribution of 
oppositely charged residues made both binding and unbinding modules inherent to 
receptor tail, which could make the interaction an independent signaling switch."
616,"The limited efficacy of the current antitumor microenvironment strategies is due 
in part to the poor understanding of the roles and relative contributions of the 
various tumor stromal cells to tumor development. Here, we describe a versatile 
in vivo anthrax toxin protein delivery system allowing for the unambiguous 
genetic evaluation of individual tumor stromal elements in cancer. Our 
reengineered tumor-selective anthrax toxin exhibits potent antiproliferative 
activity by disrupting ERK signaling in sensitive cells. Since this activity 
requires the surface expression of the capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG2) 
toxin receptor, genetic manipulation of CMG2 expression using our 
cell-type-specific CMG2 transgenic mice allows us to specifically define the 
role of individual tumor stromal cell types in tumor development. Here, we 
established mice with CMG2 only expressed in tumor endothelial cells (ECs) and 
determined the specific contribution of tumor stromal ECs to the toxin's 
antitumor activity. Our results demonstrate that disruption of ERK signaling 
only within tumor ECs is sufficient to halt tumor growth. We discovered that 
c-Myc is a downstream effector of ERK signaling and that the MEK-ERK-c-Myc 
central metabolic axis in tumor ECs is essential for tumor progression. As such, 
disruption of ERK-c-Myc signaling in host-derived tumor ECs by our 
tumor-selective anthrax toxins explains their high efficacy in solid tumor 
therapy."
617,"Centromeres are the specialized regions of the chromosomes that direct faithful 
chromosome segregation during cell division. Despite their functional 
conservation, centromeres display features of rapidly evolving DNA and wide 
evolutionary diversity in size and organization. Previous work found that the 
noncanonical B-form DNA structures are abundant in the centromeres of several 
eukaryotic species with a possible implication for centromere specification. 
Thus far, systematic studies into the organization and function of non-B-form 
DNA in plants remain scarce. Here, we applied the oat system to investigate the 
role of non-B-form DNA in centromeres. We conducted chromatin 
immunoprecipitation sequencing using an antibody to the centromere-specific 
histone H3 variant (CENH3); this accurately positioned oat centromeres with 
different ploidy levels and identified a series of centromere-specific sequences 
including minisatellites and retrotransposons. To define genetic characteristics 
of oat centromeres, we surveyed the repeat sequences and found that dyad 
symmetries were abundant in oat centromeres and were predicted to form non-B-DNA 
structures in vivo. These structures including bent DNA, slipped DNA, Z-DNA, 
G-quadruplexes, and R-loops were prone to form within CENH3-binding regions. 
Dynamic conformational changes of predicted non-B-DNA occurred during the 
evolution from diploid to tetraploid to hexaploid oat. Furthermore, we applied 
the single-molecule technique of AFM and DNA:RNA immunoprecipitation with deep 
sequencing to validate R-loop enrichment in oat centromeres. Centromeric 
retrotransposons exhibited strong associations with R-loop formation. Taken 
together, our study elucidates the fundamental character of non-B-form DNA in 
the oat genome and reveals its potential role in centromeres."
618,"In Lepidoptera and Diptera, the fat body dissociates into single cells in 
nondiapause pupae, but it does not dissociate in diapause pupae until diapause 
termination. Using the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, as a model of 
pupal diapause insects, we illustrated the catalytic mechanism and physiological 
importance of fat body cell dissociation in regulating pupal development and 
diapause. In nondiapause pupae, cathepsin L (CatL) activates matrix 
metalloproteinases (Mmps) that degrade extracellular matrix proteins and cause 
fat body cell dissociation. Mmp-induced fat body cell dissociation activates 
lipid metabolism through transcriptional regulation, and the resulting energetic 
supplies increase brain metabolic activity (i.e., mitochondria respiration and 
insulin signaling) and thus promote pupal development. In diapause pupae, low 
activities of CatL and Mmps prevent fat body cell dissociation and lipid 
metabolism from occurring, maintaining pupal diapause. Importantly, as 
demonstrated by chemical inhibitor treatments and CRISPR-mediated gene 
knockouts, Mmp inhibition delayed pupal development and moderately increased the 
incidence of pupal diapause, while Mmp stimulation promoted pupal development 
and moderately averted pupal diapause. This study advances our recent 
understanding of fat body biology and insect diapause regulation."
619,"In this study, an aqueous nonlinear synaptic element showing plasticity behavior 
is developed, which is based on the chemical processes in an ionic diode. The 
device is simple, fully ionic, and easily configurable, requiring only two 
terminals-for input and output-similar to biological synapses. The key processes 
realizing the plasticity features are chemical precipitation and dissolution, 
which occur at forward- or reverse-biased ionic diode junctions in appropriate 
reservoir electrolytes. Given that the precipitate acts as a physical barrier in 
the circuit, the above processes change the diode conductivity, which can be 
interpreted as adjusting ""synaptic weight"" of the system. By varying the 
operating conditions, we first demonstrate the four types of plasticity that can 
be found in biological system: long-term potentiation/depression and short-term 
potentiation/depression. The plasticity of the proposed iontronic device has 
characteristics similar to those of neural synapses. To demonstrate its 
potential use in comparatively complex information processing, we develop a 
precipitation-based iontronic synapse (PIS) capable of both potentiation and 
depression. Finally, we show that the postsynaptic signals from the multiple 
excitatory or inhibitory PISs can be integrated into the total ""dendritic"" 
current, which is a function of time and input history, as in actual hippocampal 
neural circuits."
620,"Viruses impact host cells and have indirect effects on ecosystem processes. 
Plankton such as ciliates can reduce the abundance of virions in water, but 
whether virus consumption translates into demographic consequences for the 
grazers is unknown. Here, we show that small protists not only can consume 
viruses they also can grow and divide given only viruses to eat. Moreover, the 
ciliate Halteria sp. foraging on chloroviruses displays dynamics and interaction 
parameters that are similar to other microbial trophic interactions. These 
results suggest that the effect of viruses on ecosystems extends beyond (and in 
contrast to) the viral shunt by redirecting energy up food chains."
621,"Kinesin motor proteins perform several essential cellular functions powered by 
the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis reaction. Several single-point 
mutations in the kinesin motor protein KIF5A have been implicated to hereditary 
spastic paraplegia disease (HSP), a lethal neurodegenerative disease in humans. 
In earlier studies, we have shown that a series of HSP-related mutations can 
impair the kinesin's long-distance displacement or processivity by modulating 
the order-disorder transition of the linker connecting the heads to the coiled 
coil. On the other hand, the reduction of kinesin's ATP hydrolysis reaction rate 
by a distal asparagine-to-serine mutation is also known to cause HSP disease. 
However, the molecular mechanism of the ATP hydrolysis reaction in kinesin by 
this distal mutation is still not fully understood. Using classical molecular 
dynamics simulations combined with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics 
calculations, the pre-organization geometry required for optimal hydrolysis in 
kinesin motor bound to α/β-tubulin is determined. This optimal geometry has only 
a single salt-bridge (of the possible two) between Arg203-Glu236, putting a 
reactive water molecule at a perfect position for hydrolysis. Such geometry is 
also needed to create the appropriate configuration for proton translocation 
during ATP hydrolysis. The distal asparagine-to-serine mutation is found to 
disrupt this optimal geometry. Therefore, the current study along with our 
previous one demonstrates how two different effects on kinesin dynamics 
(processivity and ATP hydrolysis), caused by a different set of genotypes, can 
give rise to the same phenotype leading to HSP disease."
622,"The cnidarian Nematostella vectensis has developed into a powerful model system 
to study the mechanisms underlying animal development, regeneration, and 
evolution. However, despite the significant progress in the molecular and 
genetic approaches in this sea anemone, endogenous protein tagging is still 
challenging. Here, we report a robust method for knock in for Nematostella using 
CRISPR/Cas9. As an outcome, we generate endogenously tagged proteins that label 
core molecular components of several cellular apparatus, including the nuclear 
envelope, cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, endoplasmic reticulum, cell trafficking, 
and extracellular matrix. Using live imaging, we monitor the dynamics of 
vesicular trafficking and endoplasmic reticulum in embryos, as well as cell 
contractility during the peristaltic wave of a primary polyp. This advancement 
in gene editing expands the molecular tool kit of Nematostella and enables 
experimental avenues to interrogate the cell biology of cnidarians."
623,"The drug praziquantel (PZQ) is the key clinical therapy for treating 
schistosomiasis and other infections caused by parasitic flatworms. A 
schistosome target for PZQ was recently identified- a transient receptor 
potential ion channel in the melastatin subfamily (TRPMPZQ)-however, little is 
known about the properties of TRPMPZQ in other parasitic flatworms. Here, 
TRPMPZQ orthologs were scrutinized from all currently available parasitic 
flatworm genomes. TRPMPZQ is present in all parasitic flatworms, and the 
consensus PZQ binding site was well conserved. Functional profiling of 
trematode, cestode, and a free-living flatworm TRPMPZQ ortholog revealed 
differing sensitives (~300-fold) of these TRPMPZQ channels toward PZQ, which 
matched the varied sensitivities of these different flatworms to PZQ. Three loci 
of variation were defined across the parasitic flatworm TRPMPZQ pocketome with 
the identity of an acidic residue in the TRP domain acting as a gatekeeper 
residue impacting PZQ residency within the TRPMPZQ ligand binding pocket. In 
trematodes and cyclophyllidean cestodes, which display high sensitivity to PZQ, 
this TRP domain residue is an aspartic acid which is permissive for potent 
activation by PZQ. However, the presence of a glutamic acid residue found in 
other parasitic and free-living flatworm TRPMPZQ was associated with lower 
sensitivity to PZQ. The definition of these different binding pocket 
architectures explains why PZQ shows high therapeutic effectiveness against 
specific fluke and tapeworm infections and will help the development of better 
tailored therapies toward other parasitic infections of humans, livestock, and 
fish."
624,"Antibody heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) variable region exons are 
assembled by V(D)J recombination. V(D)J junctional regions encode 
complementarity-determining-region 3 (CDR3), an antigen-contact region immensely 
diversified through nontemplated nucleotide additions (""N-regions"") by terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). HIV-1 vaccine strategies seek to elicit 
human HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), such as the potent 
CD4-binding site VRC01-class bnAbs. Mice with primary B cells that express 
receptors (BCRs) representing bnAb precursors are used as vaccination models. 
VRC01-class bnAbs uniformly use human HC VH1-2 and commonly use human LCs Vκ3-20 
or Vκ1-33 associated with an exceptionally short 5-amino-acid (5-aa) CDR3. Prior 
VRC01-class models had nonphysiological precursor levels and/or limited 
precursor diversity. Here, we describe VRC01-class rearranging mice that 
generate more physiological primary VRC01-class BCR repertoires via 
rearrangement of VH1-2, as well as Vκ1-33 and/or Vκ3-20 in association with 
diverse CDR3s. Human-like TdT expression in mouse precursor B cells increased LC 
CDR3 length and diversity and also promoted the generation of shorter LC CDR3s 
via N-region suppression of dominant microhomology-mediated Vκ-to-Jκ joins. 
Priming immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer, which strongly engages VRC01 
precursors, induced robust VRC01-class germinal center B cell responses. 
Vκ3-20-based responses were enhanced by N-region addition, which generates 
Vκ3-20-to-Jκ junctional sequence combinations that encode VRC01-class 5-aa CDR3s 
with a critical E residue. VRC01-class-rearranging models should facilitate 
further evaluation of VRC01-class prime and boost immunogens. These new 
VRC01-class mouse models establish a prototype for the generation of 
vaccine-testing mouse models for other HIV-1 bnAb lineages that employ different 
HC or LC Vs."
625,"Due to its multifaceted impact in various applications, icing and ice dendrite 
growth has been the focus of numerous studies in the past. Dendrites on wetting 
(hydrophilic) and nonwetting (hydrophobic) surfaces are sharp, pointy, 
branching, and hairy. Here, we show a unique dendrite morphology on 
state-of-the-art micro/nanostructured oil-impregnated surfaces, which are 
commonly referred to as slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces or 
liquid-infused surfaces. Unlike the dendrites on traditional textured 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, the dendrites on oil-impregnated surfaces 
are thick and lumpy without pattern. Our experiments show that the unique ice 
dendrite morphology on lubricant-infused surfaces is due to oil wicking into the 
porous dendritic network because of the capillary pressure imbalance between the 
surface texture and the dendrites. We characterized the shape complexity of the 
ice dendrites using fractal analysis. Experiments show that ice dendrites on 
textured oil-impregnated surfaces have lower fractal dimensions than those on 
traditional lotus leaf-inspired air-filled porous structures. Furthermore, we 
developed a regime map that can be used as a design guideline for 
micro/nanostructured oil-impregnated surfaces by capturing the complex effects 
of oil chemistry, oil viscosity, and wetting ridge volume on dendrite growth and 
morphology. The insights gained from this work inform strategies to reduce 
lubricant depletion, a major bottleneck for the transition of 
micro/nanostructured oil-impregnated surfaces from bench-top laboratory 
prototypes to industrial use. This work will assist the development of 
next-generation depletion-resistant lubricant-infused ice-repellent surfaces."
626,"Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles are emerging as a new type of promising 
nanomaterials for immune evasion and targeted delivery. An underlying premise is 
that the unique biological functions of natural cell membranes can be conferred 
on the inherent physiochemical properties of nanoparticles by coating them with 
a cell membrane. However, the extent to which the membrane protein properties 
are preserved on these nanoparticles and the consequent bio-nano interactions 
are largely unexplored. Here, we synthesized two mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) 
membrane-coated silica nanoparticles (MCSNs), which have similar sizes but 
distinctly different stiffness values (MPa and GPa). Unexpectedly, a much lower 
macrophage uptake, but much higher cancer cell uptake, was found with the soft 
MCSNs compared with the stiff MCSNs. Intriguingly, we discovered that the soft 
MCSNs enabled the forming of a more protein-rich membrane coating and that 
coating had a high content of the MSC chemokine CXCR4 and MSC surface marker 
CD90. This led to the soft MCSNs enhancing cancer cell uptake mediated by the 
CD90/integrin receptor-mediated pathway and CXCR4/SDF-1 pathways. These findings 
provide a major step forward in our fundamental understanding of how the 
combination of nanoparticle elasticity and membrane coating may be used to 
facilitate bio-nano interactions and pave the way forward in the development of 
more effective cancer nanomedicines."
627,"Piezo1 and 2 are evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory cation channels known 
to function on the cell surface by responding to external pressure and 
transducing a mechanically activated Ca2+ current. Here we show that both Piezo1 
and 2 also exhibit concentrated intracellular localization at centrosomes. Both 
Piezo1 and 2 loss-of-function and Piezo1 activation by the small molecule Yoda1 
result in supernumerary centrosomes, premature centriole disengagement, 
multi-polar spindles, and mitotic delay. By using a GFP, Calmodulin and M13 
Protein fusion (GCaMP) Ca2+-sensitive reporter, we show that perturbations in 
Piezo modulate Ca2+ flux at centrosomes. Moreover, the inhibition of 
Polo-like-kinase 1 eliminates Yoda1-induced centriole disengagement. Because 
previous studies have implicated force generation by microtubules as essential 
for maintaining centrosomal integrity, we propose that mechanotransduction by 
Piezo maintains pericentrosomal Ca2+ within a defined range, possibly through 
sensing cell intrinsic forces from microtubules."
628,"Predator detection is key to animal's survival. Superior colliculus (SC) 
orchestrates the animal's innate defensive responses to visually detected 
threats, but how threat information is transmitted from the retina to SC is 
unknown. We discovered that narrow-field neurons in SC were key in this pathway. 
Using in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetics-assisted interrogation of circuit 
and synaptic connections, we found that the visual responses of narrow-field 
neurons were correlated with the animal's defensive behaviors toward visual 
stimuli. Activation of these neurons triggered defensive behaviors, and ablation 
of them impaired the animals' defensive responses to looming stimuli. They 
receive monosynaptic inputs from looming-sensitive OFF-transient alpha retinal 
ganglion cells, and the synaptic transmission has a unique band-pass feature 
that helps to shape their stimulus selectivity. Our results describe a cell-type 
specific retinotectal connection for visual threat detection, and a coding 
mechanism based on synaptic filtering."
629,"Small molecules that bind in the minor groove of DNA are in clinical use as 
antibiotics and antitumor drugs. Two members of this class of molecules, 
netropsin and chromomycin, are shown here to displace DNA from the nucleosome 
and promote transfer of the histone octamer to an acceptor protein. The effects 
of these groove-binding molecules are exploited to address an outstanding 
problem in the mechanism of the RSC chromatin remodeling complex. RSC and other 
remodeling complexes are DNA translocases, acting near the center of the 
nucleosomal DNA, but translocation is apparently impossible because DNA cannot 
slide across the histone surface in the nucleosome. Netropsin and chromomycin 
promote the release of DNA from the histone surface, enhance the formation of a 
RSC-nucleosome complex, and synergize with RSC in chromatin remodeling. These 
findings are in keeping with an involvement of bulge translocation in chromatin 
remodeling."
630,"Nanoparticles (NPs) are confronted with limited and disappointing delivery 
efficiency in tumors clinically. The tumor extracellular matrix (ECM), whose 
physical traits have recently been recognized as new hallmarks of cancer, forms 
a main steric obstacle for NP diffusion, yet the role of tumor ECM physical 
traits in NP diffusion remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the 
physical properties of clinical gastric tumor samples and observed limited 
distribution of NPs in decellularized tumor tissues. We also performed molecular 
dynamics simulations and in vitro hydrogel experiments through single-particle 
tracking to investigate the diffusion mechanism of NPs and understand the 
influence of tumor ECM physical properties on NP diffusion both individually and 
collectively. Furthermore, we developed an estimation matrix model with 
evaluation scores of NP diffusion efficiency through comprehensive analyses of 
the data. Thus, beyond finding that loose and soft ECM with aligned structure 
contribute to efficient diffusion, we now have a systemic model to predict NP 
diffusion efficiency based on ECM physical traits and provide critical guidance 
for personalized tumor diagnosis and treatment."
631,"Although antibodies targeting specific tumor-expressed antigens are the standard 
of care for some cancers, the identification of cancer-specific targets amenable 
to antibody binding has remained a bottleneck in development of new 
therapeutics. To overcome this challenge, we developed a high-throughput 
platform that allows for the unbiased, simultaneous discovery of antibodies and 
targets based on phenotypic binding profiles. Applying this platform to ovarian 
cancer, we identified a wide diversity of cancer targets including receptor 
tyrosine kinases, adhesion and migration proteins, proteases and proteins 
regulating angiogenesis in a single round of screening using genomics, flow 
cytometry, and mass spectrometry. In particular, we identified BCAM as a 
promising candidate for targeted therapy in high-grade serous ovarian cancers. 
More generally, this approach provides a rapid and flexible framework to 
identify cancer targets and antibodies."
632,"The convolutions of the mammalian cerebral cortex allow the enlargement of its 
surface and addition of novel functional areas during evolution while minimizing 
expansion of the cranium. Cognitive neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, 
including microcephaly and lissencephaly, are often associated with impaired 
gyrification. In the classical model of gyrification, surface area is initially 
set by the number of radial units, and the forces driving cortical folding 
include neuronal growth, formation of neuropil, glial cell intercalation, and 
the patterned growth of subcortical white matter. An alternative model proposes 
that specified neurogenic hotspots in the outer subventricular zone (oSVZ) 
produce larger numbers of neurons that generate convexities in the cortex. This 
directly contradicts reports showing that cortical neurogenesis and settling of 
neurons into the cortical plate in primates, including humans, are completed 
well prior to the formation of secondary and tertiary gyri and indeed most 
primary gyri. In addition, during the main period of gyrification, the oSVZ 
produces mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Here we describe how rapid 
growth of intracortical neuropil, addition of glial cells, and enlargement of 
subcortical white matter in primates are the primary forces responsible for the 
post-neurogenic expansion of the cortical surface and formation of gyri during 
fetal development. Using immunohistochemistry for markers of proliferation and 
glial and neuronal progenitors combined with transcriptomic analysis, we show 
that neurogenesis in the ventricular zone and oSVZ is phased out and transitions 
to gliogenesis prior to gyral development. In summary, our data support the 
classical model of gyrification and provide insight into the pathogenesis of 
congenital cortical malformations."
633,"WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) is a core scaffolding component of many multiprotein 
complexes that perform a variety of critical chromatin-centric processes in the 
nucleus. WDR5 is a component of the mixed lineage leukemia MLL/SET complex and 
localizes MYC to chromatin at tumor-critical target genes. As a part of these 
complexes, WDR5 plays a role in sustaining oncogenesis in a variety of human 
cancers that are often associated with poor prognoses. Thus, WDR5 has been 
recognized as an attractive therapeutic target for treating both solid and 
hematological tumors. Previously, small-molecule inhibitors of the 
WDR5-interaction (WIN) site and WDR5 degraders have demonstrated robust in vitro 
cellular efficacy in cancer cell lines and established the therapeutic potential 
of WDR5. However, these agents have not demonstrated significant in vivo 
efficacy at pharmacologically relevant doses by oral administration in animal 
disease models. We have discovered WDR5 WIN-site inhibitors that feature 
bicyclic heteroaryl P7 units through structure-based design and address the 
limitations of our previous series of small-molecule inhibitors. Importantly, 
our lead compounds exhibit enhanced on-target potency, excellent oral 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, and potent dose-dependent in vivo efficacy in a 
mouse MV4:11 subcutaneous xenograft model by oral dosing. Furthermore, these 
in vivo probes show excellent tolerability under a repeated high-dose regimen in 
rodents to demonstrate the safety of the WDR5 WIN-site inhibition mechanism. 
Collectively, our results provide strong support for WDR5 WIN-site inhibitors to 
be utilized as potential anticancer therapeutics."
634,"T cells differentiate into highly diverse subsets and display plasticity 
depending on the environment. Although lymphocytes are key mediators of 
inflammation, functional specialization of T cells in inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) has not been effectively described. Here, we performed deep profiling of T 
cells in the intestinal mucosa of IBD and identified a CD4+ tissue-resident 
memory T cell (Trm) subset that is increased in Crohn's disease (CD) showing 
unique inflammatory properties. Functionally and transcriptionally distinct CD4+ 
Trm subsets are observed in the inflamed gut mucosa, among which a CD-specific 
CD4+ Trm subset, expressing CD161 and CCR5 along with CD103, displays previously 
unrecognized pleiotropic signatures of innate and effector activities. These 
inflammatory features are further enhanced by their spatial proximity to gut 
epithelial cells. Furthermore, the CD-specific CD4+ Trm subset is the most 
predominant producer of type 1 inflammatory cytokines upon various stimulations 
among all CD4+ T cells, suggesting that the accumulation of this T cell subset 
is a pathological hallmark of CD. Our results provide comprehensive insights 
into the pathogenesis of IBD, paving the way for decoding of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying this disease."
635,"Impaired endothelial cell (EC)-mediated angiogenesis contributes to critical 
limb ischemia in diabetic patients. The sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway 
participates in angiogenesis but is repressed in hyperglycemia by obscure 
mechanisms. We investigated the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR39 on SHH 
pathway activation in ECs and ischemia-induced angiogenesis in animals with 
chronic hyperglycemia. Human aortic ECs from healthy and type 2 diabetic (T2D) 
donors were cultured in vitro. GPR39 mRNA expression was significantly elevated 
in T2D. The EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation were attenuated by 
adenovirus-mediated GPR39 overexpression (Ad-GPR39) or GPR39 agonist TC-G-1008 
in vitro. The production of proangiogenic factors was reduced by Ad-GPR39. 
Conversely, human ECs transfected with GPR39 siRNA or the mouse aortic ECs 
isolated from GPR39 global knockout (GPR39KO) mice displayed enhanced migration 
and proliferation compared with their respective controls. GPR39 suppressed the 
basal and ligand-dependent activation of the SHH effector GLI1, leading to 
attenuated EC migration. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that the GPR39 direct 
binding of the suppressor of fused (SUFU), the SHH pathway endogenous inhibitor, 
may achieve this. Furthermore, in ECs with GPR39 knockdown, the robust GLI1 
activation and EC migration were abolished by SUFU overexpression. In a chronic 
diabetic model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and low-dose streptozotocin 
(STZ)-induced hyperglycemia, the GPR39KO mice demonstrated a faster pace of 
revascularization from hind limb ischemia and lower incidence of tissue necrosis 
than GPR39 wild-type (GPR39WT) counterparts. These findings have provided a 
conceptual framework for developing therapeutic tools that ablate or inhibit 
GPR39 for ischemic tissue repair under metabolic stress."
636,"The cellular prion protein (PrPC) converts to alternatively folded pathogenic 
conformations (PrPSc) in prion infections and binds neurotoxic oligomers formed 
by amyloid-β α-synuclein, and tau. β-Endoproteolysis, which splits PrPC into N- 
and C-terminal fragments (N2 and C2, respectively), is of interest because a 
protease-resistant, C2-sized fragment (C2Sc) accumulates in the brain during 
prion infections, seemingly comprising the majority of PrPSc at disease endpoint 
in mice. However, candidates for the underlying proteolytic mechanism(s) remain 
unconfirmed in vivo. Here, a cell-based screen of protease inhibitors 
unexpectedly linked type II membrane proteins of the S9B serine peptidase 
subfamily to PrPC β-cleavage. Overexpression experiments in cells and assays 
with recombinant proteins confirmed that fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and 
its paralog, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), cleave directly at multiple sites 
within PrPC's N-terminal domain. For wild-type mouse and human PrPC substrates 
expressed in cells, the rank orders of activity were human FAP ~ mouse FAP > 
mouse DPP4 > human DPP4 and human FAP > mouse FAP > mouse DPP4 >> human DPP4, 
respectively. C2 levels relative to total PrPC were reduced in several tissues 
from FAP-null mice, and, while knockout of DPP4 lacked an analogous effect, the 
combined DPP4/FAP inhibitor linagliptin, but not the FAP-specific inhibitor 
SP-13786, reduced C2Sc and total PrPSc levels in two murine cell-based models of 
prion infections. Thus, the net activity of the S9B peptidases FAP and DPP4 and 
their cognate inhibitors/modulators affect the physiology and pathogenic 
potential of PrPC."
637,"Human behaviors, with whole-body coordination, involve large-scale sensorimotor 
interaction. Spontaneous bodily movements in the early developmental stage 
potentially lead toward acquisition of such coordinated behavior. These 
movements presumably contribute to the structuration of sensorimotor 
interaction, providing specific regularities in bidirectional information among 
muscle activities and proprioception. Whether and how spontaneous movements, 
despite being task-free, structure and organize sensorimotor interactions in the 
entire body during early development remain unknown. Herein, to address these 
issues, we gained insights into the structuration process of the sensorimotor 
interaction in neonates and 3-mo-old infants. By combining detailed motion 
capture and musculoskeletal simulation, sensorimotor information flows among 
muscle activities and proprioception throughout the body were obtained. 
Subsequently, we extracted spatial modules and temporal state in sensorimotor 
information flows. Our approach demonstrated that early spontaneous movements 
elicited body-dependent sensorimotor modules, revealing age-related changes in 
them, depending on the combination or direction. The sensorimotor interactions 
also displayed temporal non-random fluctuations analogous to those seen in 
spontaneous activities in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord. Furthermore, we 
found recurring state sequence patterns across multiple participants, 
characterized by a substantial increase in infants compared to the patterns in 
neonates. Therefore, early spontaneous movements induce the spatiotemporal 
structuration in sensorimotor interactions and subsequent developmental changes. 
These results implicated that early open-ended movements, emerging from a 
certain neural substrate, regulate the sensorimotor interactions through 
embodiment and contribute to subsequent coordinated behaviors. Our findings also 
provide a conceptual linkage between early spontaneous movements and spontaneous 
neuronal activity in terms of spatiotemporal characteristics."
638,"Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease comprising multiple distinct subtypes 
with different genetic features and pathological characteristics. Although a 
large number of antineoplastic compounds have been approved for clinical use, 
patient-to-patient variability in drug response is frequently observed, 
highlighting the need for efficient treatment prediction for individualized 
therapy. Several patient-derived models have been established lately for the 
prediction of drug response. However, each of these models has its limitations 
that impede their clinical application. Here, we report that the whole-tumor 
cell culture (WTC) ex vivo model could be stably established from all breast 
tumors with a high success rate (98 out of 116), and it could reassemble the 
parental tumors with the endogenous microenvironment. We observed strong 
clinical associations and predictive values from the investigation of a broad 
range of BC therapies with WTCs derived from a patient cohort. The accuracy was 
further supported by the correlation between WTC-based test results and 
patients' clinical responses in a separate validation study, where the 
neoadjuvant treatment regimens of 15 BC patients were mimicked. Collectively, 
the WTC model allows us to accomplish personalized drug testing within 10 d, 
even for small-sized tumors, highlighting its potential for individualized BC 
therapy. Furthermore, coupled with genomic and transcriptomic analyses, 
WTC-based testing can also help to stratify specific patient groups for 
assignment into appropriate clinical trials, as well as validate potential 
biomarkers during drug development."
639,"Unraveling cell-cell interaction is fundamental to understanding many biological 
processes. To date, genetic tools for labeling neighboring cells in mammals are 
not available. Here, we developed a labeling strategy based on the Cre-induced 
intercellular labeling protein (CILP). Cre-expressing donor cells release a 
lipid-soluble and membrane-permeable fluorescent protein that is then taken up 
by recipient cells, enabling fluorescent labeling of neighboring cells. Using 
CILP, we specifically labeled endothelial cells surrounding a special population 
of hepatocytes in adult mice and revealed their distinct gene signatures. Our 
results highlight the potential of CILP as a platform to reveal cell-cell 
interactions and communications in vivo."
640,"γδ T cells are involved in the control of Staphylococcus aureus infection, but 
their importance in protection compared to other T cells is unclear. We used a 
mouse model of systemic S. aureus infection associated with high bacterial load 
and persistence in the kidney. Infection caused fulminant accumulation of γδ T 
cells in the kidney. Renal γδ T cells acquired tissue residency and were 
maintained in high numbers during chronic infection. At day 7, up to 50% of 
renal γδ T cells produced IL-17A in situ and a large fraction of renal γδ T 
cells remained IL-17A+ during chronic infection. Controlled depletion revealed 
that γδ T cells restricted renal S. aureus replication in the acute infection 
and provided protection during chronic renal infection and upon reinfection. Our 
results demonstrate that kidney-resident γδ T cells are nonredundant in limiting 
local S. aureus growth during chronic infection and provide enhanced protection 
against reinfection."
641,"After natalizumab (NAT) cessation, some multiple sclerosis (MS) patients 
experience a severe disease rebound. The rebound pathophysiology is still 
unclear; however, it has been linked to interleukin-17-producing T-helper (Th17) 
cells. We demonstrate that during NAT treatment, MCAM+CCR6+Th17 cells gradually 
acquire a pathogenic profile, including proinflammatory cytokine production, 
pathogenic transcriptional signatures, brain endothelial barrier impairment, and 
oligodendrocyte damage via induction of apoptotic pathways. This is accompanied 
by an increase in Th17 cell frequencies in the cerebrospinal fluid of 
NAT-treated patients. Notably, Th17 cells derived from NAT-treated patients, who 
later developed a disease rebound upon treatment cessation, displayed a distinct 
transcriptional pathogenicity profile associated with altered migratory 
properties. Accordingly, increased brain infiltration of patient Th17 cells was 
illustrated in a humanized mouse model and brain histology from a rebound 
patient. Therefore, peripheral blood-accumulated MCAM+CCR6+Th17 cells might be 
involved in rebound pathophysiology, and monitoring of changes in Th17 cell 
pathogenicity in patients before/during NAT treatment cessation might enable 
rebound risk assessment in the future."
642,"Obesity is a major risk factor for cancer. Conventional thought suggests that 
elevated adiposity predisposes to heightened inflammatory stress and potentiates 
tumor growth, yet underlying mechanisms remain ill-defined. Here, we show that 
tumors from patients with a body mass index >35 carry a high burden of senescent 
cells. In mouse syngeneic tumor models, we correlated a pronounced accretion of 
senescent cancer cells with poorly immunogenic tumors when mice were subjected 
to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Highly immunogenic tumors showed lesser 
senescence burden suggesting immune-mediated elimination of senescent cancer 
cells, likely targeted as a consequence of their senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype. Treatment with the senolytic BH3 mimetic small molecule inhibitor 
ABT-263 selectively stalled tumor growth in mice with DIO to rates comparable to 
regular diet-fed mice. Thus, consideration of body adiposity in the selection of 
cancer therapy may be a critical determinant for disease outcome in poorly 
immunogenic malignancies."
643,"Mutations in GBA1, encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase), cause Gaucher disease 
(GD) and are also genetic risks in developing Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Currently, the approved therapies are only effective for directly treating 
visceral symptoms, but not for primary neuronopathic involvement in GD (nGD). 
Progranulin (PGRN), encoded by GRN, is a novel modifier of GCase, but the impact 
of PGRN in GBA1 mutation-associated pathologies in vivo remains unknown. Herein, 
Grn-/- mice crossed into Gba9v/9v mice, a Gba1 mutant line homozygous for the 
Gba1 D409V mutation, generating Grn-/-Gba9v/9v (PG9V) mice. PG9V mice exhibited 
neurobehavioral deficits, early onset, and more severe GD phenotypes compared to 
Grn-/- and Gba9v/9v mice. Moreover, PG9V mice also displayed PD-like phenotype. 
Mechanistic analysis revealed that PGRN deficiency caused severe 
neuroinflammation with microgliosis and astrogliosis, along with impaired 
autophagy associated with the Gba1 mutation. A PGRN-derived peptide, termed ND7, 
ameliorated the disease phenotype in GD patient fibroblasts ex vivo. 
Unexpectedly, ND7 penetrated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and effectively 
ameliorated the nGD manifestations and PD pathology in Gba9v/null and PG9V mice. 
Collectively, this study not only provides the first line of in vivo but also 
ex vivo evidence demonstrating the crucial role of PGRN in GBA1/Gba1 
mutation-related pathologies, as well as a clinically relevant mouse model for 
mechanistic and potential therapeutics studies for nGD and PD. Importantly, a 
BBB penetrant PGRN-derived biologic was developed that may provide treatment for 
rare lysosomal storage diseases and common neurodegenerative disorders, 
particularly nGD and PD."
644,"Growing evidence suggests that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) likely increases 
the risks of dementia, yet little is known about the relative contributions of 
different constituents. Here, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort 
study (2000 to 2017) by integrating the Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse 
database and two independently sourced datasets of high-resolution PM2.5 major 
chemical composition, including black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), nitrate 
(NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), ammonium (NH4+), and soil dust (DUST). To investigate 
the impact of long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents on incident all-cause 
dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), hazard ratios for dementia and AD were 
estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, and penalized splines were used 
to evaluate potential nonlinear concentration-response (C-R) relationships. 
Results using two exposure datasets consistently indicated higher rates of 
incident dementia and AD for an increased exposure to PM2.5 and its major 
constituents. An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 mass was associated with 
a 6 to 7% increase in dementia incidence and a 9% increase in AD incidence. For 
different PM2.5 constituents, associations remained significant for BC, OM, 
SO42-, and NH4+ for both end points (even after adjustments of other 
constituents), among which BC and SO42- showed the strongest associations. All 
constituents had largely linear C-R relationships in the low exposure range, but 
most tailed off at higher exposure concentrations. Our findings suggest that 
long-term exposure to PM2.5 is significantly associated with higher rates of 
incident dementia and AD and that SO42-, BC, and OM related to traffic and 
fossil fuel combustion might drive the observed associations."
645,"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, which are dimers of 
a glycosylated polymorphic transmembrane heavy chain and the small-protein 
β2-microglobulin (β2m), bind peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum that are 
generated by the cytosolic turnover of cellular proteins. In virus-infected 
cells, these peptides may include those derived from viral proteins. 
Peptide-MHC-I complexes then traffic through the secretory pathway and are 
displayed at the cell surface where those containing viral peptides can be 
detected by CD8+ T lymphocytes that kill infected cells. Many viruses enhance 
their in vivo survival by encoding genes that down-regulate MHC-I expression to 
avoid CD8+ T cell recognition. Here, we report that two accessory proteins 
encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 
down-regulate MHC-I expression using distinct mechanisms. First, ORF3a, a 
viroporin, reduces the global trafficking of proteins, including MHC-I, through 
the secretory pathway. The second, ORF7a, interacts specifically with the MHC-I 
heavy chain, acting as a molecular mimic of β2m to inhibit its association. This 
slows the exit of properly assembled MHC-I molecules from the endoplasmic 
reticulum. We demonstrate that ORF7a reduces antigen presentation by the human 
MHC-I allele HLA-A*02:01. Thus, both ORF3a and ORF7a act post-translationally in 
the secretory pathway to lower surface MHC-I expression, with ORF7a exhibiting a 
specific mechanism that allows immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2."
646,"Oral delivery of siRNA provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that 
require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal and systemic 
barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of 
siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which 
hurdles the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small-sized, 
fluorinated nanocapsules (F-NCs) were developed to mediate efficient oral 
delivery of TNF-α siRNA for anti-inflammation treatment. The NCs possessed a 
disulfide-cross-linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the 
gastrointestinal tract. Because of their small size (∼30 nm) and 
fluorocarbon-assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best-performing F3 -NCs 
showed excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without 
impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 
20.4% in relative to i.v. injection. The disulfide cross-linker could be cleaved 
inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate 
the TNF-α silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic 
inflammation, orally delivered F3 -NCs provoked efficient TNF-α silencing and 
pronounced anti-inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a 
transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and would render promising 
utilities for anti-inflammation treatment. This article is protected by

647,"Calcium overload is one of the early determinants of the core cellular events 
that contribute to the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI), which include 
oxidative stress, ATP depletion, calcium overload, and inflammatory response 
with self-amplifying and interactive feedback loops that ultimately lead to 
cellular injury and renal failure. Excluding adjuvant therapy, there are 
currently no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AKI. Using an 
adipic dihydride linker, we modified the hyaluronic acid polymer chain with a 
potent antioxidant, bilirubin, to produce an amphiphilic conjugate. 
Subsequently, we developed a kidney-targeted and reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)-responsive drug delivery system based on the flash nanocomplexation method 
to deliver a well-known intracellular calcium chelator, 
1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester 
(BAPTA-AM, BA), with the goal of rescuing renal cell damage via rapidly 
scavenging of intracellularly overloaded Ca2+. In the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) 
induced AKI rat model, a single dose of as-prepared formulation (BA 100 μg·kg-1) 
6 h post-reperfusion significantly reduced renal function indicators by more 
than 60% within 12 h, significantly alleviated tissular pathological changes, 
ameliorated tissular oxidative damage, significantly inhibited apoptosis of 
renal tubular cells and the expression of renal tubular marker kidney injury 
molecule 1, etc., thus greatly reducing the risk of kidney failure. 
Mechanistically, the treatment with BA-loaded NPs significantly inhibited the 
activation of the ER stress cascade response (IRE1-TRAF2-JNK, ATF4-CHOP, and 
ATF6 axis) and regulated the downstream apoptosis-related pathway while also 
reducing the inflammatory response. The BA-loaded NPs hold great promise as a 
potential therapy for I/R injury-related diseases."
648,"Adoptively transferred virus-specific T-cells (VSTs) have shown remarkable 
safety and efficacy for the treatment of virus-associated diseases and 
malignancies in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, for whom 
VSTs are derived from the HSCT donor (DD-VSTs). Autologous VSTs have also shown 
promise for the treatment of virus-driven malignancies outside the HSCT setting. 
In both cases VSTs are manufactured as patient-specific products and the time 
required for procurement, manufacture, and release testing precludes their use 
in acutely ill patients. Further, good manufacturing practices (GMP)-compliant 
products are expensive, and failures are common in virus naive HSCT donors and 
in patient-derived VSTs rendered anergic by immunosuppressive tumors. Hence, 
highly characterized, banked VSTs (B-VSTs) that can be used for multiple 
unrelated recipients are highly desirable. The major challenges facing B-VSTs 
result from the inevitable mismatches in the highly polymorphic and immunogenic 
human leukocyte antigens (HLA) that presents internally processed antigens to 
the T-cell receptor leading to the requirement for partial HLA matching between 
B-VST and recipient. HLA mismatches lead to rapid rejection of allogenic T-cell 
products, and graft versus host disease induced by alloreactive T-cells in the 
infusion product. Here we summarize clinical outcomes to date of trials of 
B-VSTs used for the treatment of viral infections and malignancies, and their 
potential as a platform for chimeric antigen receptors targeting non-viral 
tumors. We will highlight the properties of VSTs that make them attractive 
off-the-shelf cell therapies, as well as the challenges that must be overcome 
before they can become mainstream."
649,"B cells are an essential component of humoral immunity. Their primary function 
is to mount antigen-specific antibody responses to eliminate pathogens. Despite 
an increase in B-cell number, we found that serum-IgG levels were low in breast 
cancer patients. To solve this conundrum, we used high-dimensional 
flow-cytometry to analyse the heterogeneity of B-cell populations and identified 
a tumor-specific CD19+CD24hiCD38hi IL10-producing B regulatory (Breg) cell 
subset. Although IL10 is a Breg-cell marker, being an intracellular protein, it 
is of limited value for Breg-cell isolation. Highly-expressed Breg cell-surface 
proteins CD24 and CD38 also impede the isolation of viable Breg cells. These are 
hurdles that limit understanding of Breg-cell functions. Our transcriptomic 
analysis identified, CD39-negativity as an exclusive, sorting-friendly surface 
marker for tumor-associated Breg cells. We found that the identified 
CD19+CD39-IL10+ B-cell population was suppressive in nature as it limited T 
helper-cell proliferation, type-1 cytokine production, and T effector-cell 
survival, and augmented CD4+FOXP3+ Treg-cell generation. These tumor-associated 
Breg cells were also found to restrict autologous T follicular helper (Tfh)-cell 
expansion and IL21 secretion, thereby inhibiting germinal transcript formation 
and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression involved in H-chain 
class-switch recombination. This isotype-switching abnormality was shown to 
hinder B-cell differentiation into class-switched memory B cells and subsequent 
high-affinity antibody-producing plasma B cells, which collectively led to the 
dampening of IgG-mediated antibody responses in cancer patients. As low IgG is 
associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients, Breg-cell depletion could be 
a promising future therapy for boosting plasma B cell-mediated antibody 
responses."
650,"Assemblies of proteins and charged macromolecules (polyelectrolytes) find 
important applications as pharmaceutical formulations, biocatalysts, and 
cell-contacting substrates. A key question is how the polymer component 
influences the structure and function of the protein. The present paper 
addresses the influence of charged polymers on the thermal stability of two 
model beta-hairpin-forming peptides through an all-atom, replica exchange 
molecular dynamics simulation. The (negatively charged) peptides consist of the 
terminal 16 amino acids of the B1 domain of Protein G (GB1) and a variant with 
three of the GB1 residues substituted with tryptophan (Tryptophan Zipper 4, or 
TZ4). A (cationic) lysine polymer is seen to thermally stabilize TZ4 and 
destabilize GB1, while a (also cationic) chitosan polymer slightly stabilizes 
GB1 but has essentially no effect on TZ4. Free energy profiles reveal folded and 
unfolded conformations to be separated by kinetic barriers generally acting in 
the direction of the thermodynamically favored state. Through application of an 
Ising-like statistical mechanical model, a mechanism is proposed based on 
competition between (indirect) entropic stabilization of folded versus unfolded 
states and (direct) competition for hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic 
interactions. These findings have important implications to the design of 
polyelectrolyte-based materials for biomedical and biotechnological 
applications."
651,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule produced by NO synthases (NOS1-3) to 
control processes such as neurotransmission, vascular permeability, and immune 
function. Although myeloid cell-derived NO has been shown to suppress T-cell 
responses, the role of NO synthesis in T cells themselves is not well 
understood. Here, we showed that significant amounts of NO were synthesized in 
human and murine CD8+ T cells following activation. Tumor growth was 
significantly accelerated in a T cell-specific, Nos2-null mouse model. Genetic 
deletion of Nos2 expression in murine T cells altered effector differentiation, 
reduced tumor infiltration, and inhibited recall responses and adoptive cell 
transfer function. These data show that endogenous NO production plays a 
critical role in T cell-mediated tumor immunity."
652,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have emerged in the past years as 
significant pharmacological targets in the development of new therapeutics due 
to their key roles in determining pathological pathways. Herein, we present 
fragments on energy surfaces, a simple and general design strategy that 
integrates the analysis of the dynamic and energetic signatures of proteins to 
unveil the substructures involved in PPIs, with docking, selection, and 
combination of drug-like fragments to generate new PPI inhibitor candidates. 
Specifically, structural representatives of the target protein are used as 
inputs for the blind physics-based prediction of potential protein interaction 
surfaces using the matrix of low coupling energy decomposition method. The 
predicted interaction surfaces are subdivided into overlapping windows that are 
used as templates to direct the docking and combination of fragments 
representative of moieties typically found in active drugs. This protocol is 
then applied and validated using structurally diverse, important PPI targets as 
test systems. We demonstrate that our approach facilitates the exploration of 
the molecular diversity space of potential ligands, with no requirement of prior 
information on the location and properties of interaction surfaces or on the 
structures of potential lead compounds. Importantly, the hit molecules that 
emerge from our ab initio design share high chemical similarity with 
experimentally tested active PPI inhibitors. We propose that the protocol we 
describe here represents a valuable means of generating initial leads against 
difficult targets for further development and refinement."
653,"The ocular skeleton is composed of the scleral cartilage and the scleral 
ossicles. Teleost scleral cartilage is composed of a single layer of 
chondrocytes embedded in the sclera of the eye. The teleost scleral cartilage 
ring can vary in depth across teleost families and species, from a narrow ring a 
few cells wide to a deeper ring that resembles a cup and surrounds the entire 
sclera. However, very little research has been conducted on the development and 
morphology of teleost scleral cartilage. Thus, this study aims to characterize 
the development of the scleral cartilage in the zebrafish and Mexican tetra, 
with respect to the timing of emergence, depth throughout development, and 
positioning within the eye. We hypothesized that the scleral cartilage would 
first emerge in the scleral tissue closely abutting the ora serrata, and that 
growth would proceed in an anterior-to-posterior direction, resulting in 
differences in scleral cartilage depth between different fish species. We found 
that the scleral cartilage ring does not develop uniformly along its 
circumference, and that its relationship to the ora serrata varies between the 
rostral and caudal regions. Furthermore, distinct differences in the growth 
trajectory of the scleral cartilage indicate that the deep scleral cartilage of 
the Pachón cavefish is the result of both decreased eye size and prolonged 
cartilage growth. A significant difference in the size of the scleral 
chondrocytes was also noted. Overall, this study provides the first 
characterization of early scleral cartilage development in teleost fish and 
indicates that some aspects of scleral cartilage development and morphology are 
highly conserved while others are not."
654,"Surfeit 4 is a polytopic transmembrane protein that primarily resides in the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It is ubiquitously expressed and functions 
as a cargo receptor, mediating cargo transport from the ER and the Golgi 
apparatus via the canonical coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles or 
specific vesicles. It also participates in ER-Golgi protein trafficking through 
a tubular network. Meanwhile, it facilitates retrograde transportation of cargos 
from the Golgi apparatus to the ER through COPI-coated vesicles. Surf4 can 
selectively mediate export of diverse cargos, such as proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), 
progranulin, α1-antitrypsin, STING, proinsulin, and erythropoietin. It has been 
implicated in facilitating VLDL secretion, promoting cell proliferation and 
migration, and increasing replication of positive-strand RNA viruses. Therefore, 
Surf4 plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathophysiological 
processes and emerges as a promising therapeutic target. However, the molecular 
mechanisms by which Surf4 selectively sorts diverse cargos for ER-Golgi protein 
trafficking remain elusive. Here, we summarize the most recent advances in 
Surf4, focusing on its role in lipid metabolism."
655,"Acute canine monocytic ehrlichiosis due to Ehrlichia canis (aCME), and primary 
immune thrombocytopenia (pITP) are major differentials for dogs presented with 
thrombocytopenia, and the two diseases may clinically overlap. The aim of this 
study was to compare dogs diagnosed with naturally occurring aCME and pITP, to 
establish potentially useful clinical and clinicopathologic discriminators. A 
clinical record-based retrospective study was performed in 35 dogs diagnosed 
with aCME and 29 dogs with pITP. Dogs with aCME were significantly younger, and 
were more likely to experience depression or lethargy, anorexia, body weight 
loss, fever, lymphadenomegaly, tick infestation and ocular discharge on 
admission, compared to dogs with pITP. In contrast, dogs with pITP presented 
more frequently with overt bleeding and had a significantly higher bleeding 
score compared to dogs with aCME. Dogs with aCME were more likely to be anemic 
and hypoalbuminemic on presentation compared to dogs with pITP. Dogs with pITP 
had higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts as well as lower platelet 
counts than dogs with aCME and were more likely to present with leukocytosis, 
neutrophilia and monocytosis. These clinical, hematological, and biochemical 
findings may be helpful discriminators between aCME and pITP, on the 
understanding that they will be interpreted in the context of disease-specific 
testing."
656,"The claustrum coordinates the activities of individual cortical areas through 
abundant reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex. Although these 
excitatory connections have been extensively investigated in three subregions of 
the claustrum-core region and dorsal and ventral shell regions-the contribution 
of GABAergic neurons to the circuitry in each subregion remains unclear. Here, 
we examined the distribution of GABAergic neurons and their dendritic and axonal 
arborizations in each subregion. Combining in situ hybridization with 
immunofluorescence histochemistry showed that approximately 10% of neuronal 
nuclei-positive cells expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 mRNA across the 
claustral subregions. Approximately 20%, 30%, and 10% of GABAergic neurons were 
immunoreactive for parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vasoactive 
intestinal polypeptide, respectively, in each subregion, and these neurochemical 
markers showed little overlap with each other. We then reconstructed PV and SOM 
neurons labeled with adeno-associated virus vectors. The dendrites and axons of 
PV and SOM neurons were preferentially localized to their respective subregions 
where their cell bodies were located. Furthermore, the axons were preferentially 
extended in a rostrocaudal direction, whereas the dendrites were relatively 
isotropic. The present findings suggest that claustral PV and SOM neurons might 
execute information processing separately within the core and shell regions."
657,"BACKGROUND: Peri-operative anemia and transfusions are associated with adverse 
operative outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Their 
individual association with long-term outcomes is unclear.
METHODS: CABG patients 65 and older in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult 
Cardiac Surgery Database (STS ACSD) (N=504,596; 2011-2018) were linked to 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) data to assess long-term 
survival. The association of intra-operative anemia defined by nadir 
intra-operative hematocrit (nadir-Hct) and red blood cell transfusions 
(RBC-transfusion), and their interactions on long-term mortality were assessed 
with Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable Cox regression. Restricted cubic 
splines were used to explore the association between nadir-Hct as a continuous 
variable and long-term mortality.
RESULTS: 258,398 on-pump CABG STS ACSD patients surviving the peri-operative 
period were linked to CMS. 41% had pre-operative anemia per World Health 
Organization criteria. Mean intra-operative nadir-Hct was 24%. RBC-transfusion 
rate was 43.7%. Univariable analysis associated both RBC-transfusion and lower 
nadir-Hct with worse survival. Lower nadir-Hct was only marginally associated 
with risk-adjusted mortality: adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 
(95%CI)=1.04(1.01-1.06) and 1.07(1.00-1.14) at nadir-Hct=20% and at 
nadir-HCT=14%, respectively. RBC-transfusion were associated with significantly 
higher adjusted mortality irrespective of timing of transfusion [AHR(95%CI): 
AHR(IntraOp)=1.21(1.18-1.27); AHR(PostOp)=1.26(1.22-1.30); 
AHR(Both)=1.46(1.40-1.52) and across all levels of nadir-Hct. RBC-transfusion 
was not associated with improved survival at any level of nadir-Hct.
CONCLUSIONS: In Medicare CABG patients, RBC-transfusions were associated with 
increased risk-adjusted late mortality across all levels of nadir-Hct while 
intra-operative anemia was only marginally so. Tolerance of lower 
intra-operative nadir-Hct than currently accepted may be preferable to 
transfusions."
658,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Lack of thorough knowledge for complicated 
immune-microenvironment (IM) within a variety of liver metastases (LMs) leads to 
inappropriate treatment and unsatisfactory prognosis. We aimed to characterize 
IM subtypes and investigate potential mechanisms in LMs.
METHODS: Mass cytometry was applied to characterize immune landscape of primary 
liver cancers and liver metastases cohort. Transcriptomic and whole exome 
sequencing were used to explore potential mechanisms across distinct IM 
subtypes. Single cell transcriptomic sequencing, multiplex fluorescent 
immunohistochemistry, cell culture, mouse model, western blot, quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used for validation.
RESULTS: Five IM subtypes were revealed in 100 LMs and 50 primary liver cancers. 
Patients featured terminally exhausted (IM1) or rare-T-cell-inflamed (IM2 and 
IM3) immune characteristics showed worse outcome. Increased intra-tumor 
heterogeneity, enriched somatic TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA mutations and 
hyper-activated hypoxia signaling accounted for the formation of vicious 
subtypes. SLC2A1 promoted immune suppression and desert via increasing 
proportion of Spp1+ macrophages and their inhibitory interactions with T cells 
in liver metastatic lesions. Furthermore, SLC2A1 promoted immune escape and 
liver metastasis through inducing regulatory T cells including Tregs and 
LAG3+CD4+ T cells in primary colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSION: The study provided integrated multi-omics landscape of liver 
metastasis, uncovering potential mechanisms for vicious IM subtypes and 
confirming the roles of SLC2A1 in regulating tumor microenvironment remodeling 
in both primary tumor and liver metastatic lesions."
659,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common form of pediatric cancer 
affecting the lymphoblast, a type of white blood cell found in the bone marrow. 
In this disease, the normal lymphoblast cells transform into leukemic cells and 
subsequently enter the bloodstream. Leukemic cells found in patients with ALL 
have shown differences in cholesterol uptake and utilization. Current treatment 
consists of chemotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, and 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In addition, minimal residual 
disease (MRD) has become an effective tool in measuring treatment efficacy and 
the potential for relapse. Chemotherapy resistance remains a significant barrier 
in the treatment of ALL. Biomarkers such as an upregulated Akt signaling pathway 
and an overexpressed VLA-4 integrin-protein have been associated with drug 
resistance. Nanoparticles have been used to favorably alter the pharmacokinetic 
profile of conventional drug agents. These drug-delivery systems are designed to 
selectively deliver their drug payloads to desired targets. Therefore, 
nanoparticles offer advantages such as improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. 
This review highlights conventional treatment options, distinctive 
characteristics of pediatric ALL, therapeutic challenges encountered during 
therapy, and the key role that nanotherapeutics play in the treatment of ALL."
660,"Consumption of zearalenone (ZEN) detrimentally affects tissues and systems 
throughout the body, and these deleterious effects are especially pronounced in 
swine. The objectives of this project were to determine the effects of 
short-term consumption of ZEN (at concentrations that could be found on-farm) on 
growth, carcass weight, liver weight and reproductive tissues of pubertal gilts, 
and to determine if the effects are transient or persistent. Cross-bred gilts 
(107.25 ± 2.69 kg) were randomly assigned to one of three feed additives: 1) 
solvent only for 21 d (CON; n=10), 2) ZEN for 7 d followed by 14 d of solvent 
(ZEN-7; 6 mg/d; n=10), and 3) ZEN for 21 d (ZEN-21; 6 mg/d; n=10). Body weights 
were collected at the beginning and end of the experiment (189.1 ± 0.8 and 211.1 
± 0.8 days of age, respectively). Carcass weights and tissues were collected at 
harvest. There were no treatment-based differences in growth, carcass, liver or 
reproductive tissue weights. Histological analyses revealed differences based on 
treatment and the interaction between treatment and luteal status. The thickness 
of the ampullary muscularis declined with ZEN exposure (P<0.05), while the 
isthmic epithelial cell height (P<0.01) and uterine endometrial thickness 
(P<0.02) increased. Interestingly, the thickness of the isthmic muscularis, 
uterine myometrium and epithelial cell height only differed in the presence of a 
corpus luteum. Uterine epithelial cell height in the luteal phase was lowest in 
ZEN-7 pigs (P<0.01). The isthmic muscularis in the luteal phase was thinner in 
pigs from both ZEN treatments (P<0.01). Conversely, the luteal-stage myometrium 
was thicker in pigs from both ZEN treatments (P<0.01). The discovery of these 
tissue-based differences during the luteal phase is particularly concerning 
since this corresponds with the time when embryos would be affected by the 
functional competency of the oviduct and uterus. The results of this work 
demonstrate that short-term consumption of ZEN produces microscopic, but not 
macroscopic alterations in reproductive organs which are likely to have negative 
effects on their subsequent function and that these differences persist even 
after ZEN consumption ceases. Taken together, these results indicate that it is 
insufficient to rely solely on outwardly visible symptoms as indicators of 
zearalenone exposure, as detrimental effects on reproductive tissues were found 
in the absence of phenotypic and morphologic changes."
661,"Superhydrophobic surfaces possess enormous potential in various applications on 
account of their versatile functionalities. However, artificial superhydrophobic 
surfaces with ultralow solid/liquid adhesion often require complicated structure 
fabrication and surface fluorination processes. Here, we designed a 
superhydrophobic surface possessed of micro/nanoscale structures by employing 
facile and low-cost demolding and initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) 
processes. The achieved micro/nanostructured superhydrophobic surface has a 
maximum static contact angle of ∼170°, a roll-off angle and contact angle 
hysteresis below 1°, ultralow solid/liquid adhesion for water droplets, and 
maintains excellent superhydrophobicity after exposure to strongly corrosive 
species, like strong acid/base and salt solutions, for 60 h. This 
reasonability-designed method of creating the superhydrophobic surface could 
provide valuable guidelines for the manufacture of transferable superhydrophobic 
surfaces and facilitate potential applications extending from optoelectronic 
devices to self-cleaning materials, such as solar cells, windows, and electronic 
displays."
662,"Cancer is one of the most serious malignant diseases, and chemotherapy is 
cancer's main clinical treatment method. However, chemotherapy inevitably 
produces drug resistance, and side effects accompany them. Adjuvant therapy is 
an effective way to enhance chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity and reduce side 
effects. This study found allicin, garlic's active ingredient, is an inhibitor 
of transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A), a novel drug target of lung 
adenocarcinoma. Allicin concentration-dependently inhibited TMEM16A currents 
with an IC50 of 24.35 ± 4.14 μM. Allicin thiosulfinate moieties bound with 
R535A/E624A/E633A residues of TMEM16A blocked the ion transport function and 
downregulated TMEM16A protein expression affecting the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase signal transduction. Then, allicin reduced the viability and migration of 
LA795 cells, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, multitarget combination 
administration results indicated that the therapeutic effect of 3.56 mg/kg 
allicin and 3 mg/kg cisplatin combined administration was superior to the 
superposition of the two drugs alone, demonstrating that the anticancer effects 
of allicin and cisplatin were synergistic. In addition, low-concentration 
combined administration also avoided the side effects of cisplatin in mice. 
Based on the good tumor suppressor effect and high biosafety of allicin and 
cisplatin combination in vivo, allicin can be used for food adjuvant therapy of 
cisplatin chemotherapy."
663,"Age-dependent formation of insoluble protein aggregates is a hallmark of many 
neurodegenerative diseases. We are interested in the cell chemistry that drives 
the aggregation of polyQ-expanded mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) protein into 
insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs). Using an inducible cell model of Huntington's 
disease, we show that a transient cold shock (CS) at 4 °C followed by recovery 
incubation at temperatures of 25-37 °C strongly and rapidly induces the 
compaction of diffuse polyQ-expanded HuntingtinExon1-enhanced green fluorescent 
protein chimera protein (mHtt) into round, micron size, cytosolic IBs. This 
transient CS-induced mHtt IB formation is independent of microtubule integrity 
or de novo protein synthesis. The addition of millimolar concentrations of 
sodium chloride accelerates, whereas urea suppresses this transient CS-induced 
mHtt IB formation. These results suggest that the low temperature of CS 
constrains the conformation dynamics of the intrinsically disordered mHtt into 
labile intermediate structures to facilitate de-solvation and hydrophobic 
interaction for IB formation at the higher recovery temperature. This work, 
along with our previous observation of the effects of heat shock protein 
chaperones and osmolytes in driving mHtt IB formation, underscores the primacy 
of mHtt structuring and rigidification for H-bond-mediated cross-linking in a 
two-step mechanism of mHtt IB formation in living cells."
664,"A protein synthesis system is one of the most important and complex biological 
networks, which translates DNA-encoded information into specific functions. 
Here, ePURE_JSBML, a tool for constructing biologically relevant large-scale and 
detailed computational models based on a reconstituted cell-free protein 
synthesis system, is presented; the user can specify the mRNA sequence, initial 
component concentration, and decoding rule. Model construction is based on 
Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) using JSBML, a pure Java programming 
library. The tool generates simulation files, executable with Matlab, that 
enable a variety of simulation experiments including the synthesis of proteins 
of a few hundred residues."
665,"The oncogene ERBB2 encoding the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2) 
is frequently overexpressed or amplified and occasionally mutated in a variety 
of human cancers. The early discovery of this oncogene, its established 
oncogenic relevance in diverse cancers, its substantial expression on surface of 
cancer cells, and its druggable catalytic activity have made it one of the most 
pursued targets in the history of cancer drug development. Initiatives targeting 
HER2 provided the early stimulus for several transformational pharmaceutical 
technologies including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 
antibody-drug conjugates, and others. The seismic impact of these efforts has 
been felt in treatment of many cancers including breast, gastroesophageal, lung, 
colorectal and others. This impact continues to broaden with increasing 
indications on the horizon and a plethora of novel agents in development. 
However, implementation of these therapeutic strategies has been complex. The 
clinical translation of every one of these classes of agents has been notable 
for underperformance or overperformance characteristics that have informed new 
lines of research providing deeper insights into the mechanistic complexities 
and unrealized opportunities provided by this molecular target. Despite all the 
successes to date, the preponderance of scientific evidence indicates that the 
full potential of HER2 as a target for cancer therapeutics is far greater than 
currently realized and numerous lines of investigation are ongoing to deepen and 
broaden the scope of impact of HER2 as a signaling, homing, or immunologic 
target. In this review, we explore the existing data and evolving paradigms 
surrounding this remarkable target for cancer therapy."
666,"The high Zn ion desolvation energy, sluggish Zn deposition kinetics, and top Zn 
plating pattern are the key challenges toward practical Zn anodes. Herein, these 
key issues are addressed by introducing zinc pyrovanadate (ZVO) as a solid 
zinc-ion conductor interface to induce smooth and fast Zn deposition underneath 
the layer. Electrochemical studies, computational analysis, and in situ 
observations reveal the boosted desolvation and deposition kinetics, and 
uniformity by ZVO interface. In addition, the anti-corrosion ability of Zn 
anodes is improved, resulting in high Zn stripping/plating reversibility. 
Consequently, the ZVO layer renders fast rechargeability and durable life in 
both Zn symmetric cells (1050 h at 10 mA cm-2 , 1 mAh cm-2 ) and Zn/V2 O5 
batteries (79.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1 ) with low 
electrode polarization. This work provides insights into the design of solid 
zinc-ion conductor interface to enhance the interface stability and kinetics of 
Zn metal anodes."
667,"Antioxidant natural products and their analogs especially phenolic compounds, 
exhibit diverse biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
and anticancer activities. Ginger which is widely used worldwide for various 
beneficial effects also contains several phenolic antioxidants, and 6-gingerol 
is one of the natural products studied extensively. However, the molecular 
mechanism of synthetically synthesized 6-gingerdione (compound 1) from 
6-gingerol was not known. In this study, compound 1 and methylated 6-gingerdione 
(compound 2) were obtained semi synthetically from 6-gingerol. Compound 1 and 2 
are subjected to SwissADME prediction. Then the protective effect of compound 1 
was analyzed in 2 % EtOH induced HepG2 cells and zebrafish larvae. Hydroxyl and 
nitric oxide scavenging assays reveal that compound 1 showed more antioxidant 
activity than compound 2 at 50 μM. Moreover, compound 1 exhibited good 
anti-inflammatory activity via lipoxygenase inhibition and proteinase 
inhibition. Apoptosis and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells were induced by 2 % 
EtOH and treated with compound 1. Compound 1 significantly inhibited the EtOH 
induced nitric oxide production, apoptosis, and ROS generation in HepG2 cells. 
Encouraged by the in-vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, 
compound 1 was then investigated for its protective effect in 2 % EtOH induced 
ALD zebrafish larva. Compound 1 protected the zebrafish larvae from liver injury 
by suppressing inflammatory (COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-1β) and lipogenic genes 
(C/EBP-α, SREBP1, and IL-1β) while upregulating the antioxidant gene. Our 
findings indicate that compound 1 synthesized from 6-gingerol ameliorated liver 
injury that likely, contributes to its potential antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties."
668,"The aggregation of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide is one of the molecular hallmarks 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although Aβ deposits have mostly been observed 
extracellularly, various studies have also reported the presence of 
intracellular Aβ assemblies. Because these intracellular Aβ aggregates might 
play a role in the onset and progression of AD, it is important to investigate 
their possible origins at different locations of the cell along the secretory 
pathway of the amyloid precursor protein, from which Aβ is derived by 
proteolytic cleavage. Senile plaques found in AD are largely composed of the 
42-residue form of Aβ (Aβ42). Intracellularly, Aβ42 is produced in the 
endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Since lipid bilayers have been 
shown to promote the aggregation of Aβ, in this study, we measure the effects of 
the lipid membrane composition on the in vitro aggregation kinetics of Aβ42. By 
using large unilamellar vesicles to model cellular membranes at different 
locations, including the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane, late 
endosomes, the ER, and the Golgi apparatus, we show that Aβ42 aggregation is 
inhibited by the ER and Golgi model membranes. These results provide a 
preliminary map of the possible effects of the membrane composition in different 
cellular locations on Aβ aggregation and suggest the presence of an evolutionary 
optimization of the lipid composition to prevent the intracellular aggregation 
of Aβ."
669,"Gangliosides are acidic glycosphingolipids, containing ceramide moieties and 
oligosaccharide chains with one or more sialic acid residue(s) and are highly 
diverse isomeric structures with distinct biological roles. Matrix-assisted 
laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) enables the 
untargeted spatial analysis of gangliosides, among other biomolecules, directly 
from tissue sections. Integrating trapped ion mobility spectrometry with MALDI 
IMS allows for the analysis of isomeric lipid structures in situ. Here, we 
demonstrate the gas-phase separation and identification of disialoganglioside 
isomers GD1a and GD1b that differ in the position of a sialic acid residue, in 
multiple samples, including a standard mixture of both isomers, a biological 
extract, and directly from thin tissue sections. The unique spatial 
distributions of GD1a/b (d36:1) and GD1a/b (d38:1) isomers were determined in 
rat hippocampus and spinal cord tissue sections, demonstrating the ability to 
structurally characterize and spatially map gangliosides based on both the 
carbohydrate chain and ceramide moieties."
670,"Elastic strains in metallic catalysts induce enhanced selectivity for carbon 
dioxide reduction (CO2R) toward valuable multicarbon (C2+) products. However, 
under working conditions, the structure of catalysts inevitably undergoes 
reconstruction, hardly retaining the initial strain. Herein, we present a 
metal/metal oxide synthetic strategy to introduce and maintain the tensile 
strain in a copper/ceria heterostructure, enabled by the presence of a thin 
interface layer of Cu2O/CeO2. The tensile strain in the copper domain and 
deficient electron environment around interfacial Cu sites resulted in 
strengthened adsorption of carbonaceous intermediates and promoted *CO 
dimerization. The strain effect in the copper/ceria heterostructure leads to an 
improved C2+ selectivity with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 76.4% and a 
half-cell power conversion efficiency of 49.1%. The fundamental insights gained 
from this system can facilitate the rational design of heterostructure catalysts 
for CO2R."
671,"Cell cycle progression plays a vital role in regulating proliferation, 
metabolism, and apoptosis. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have emerged as 
an important class of in vitro disease models, and incorporating the variation 
occurring from cell cycle progression in these systems is critical. Here, we 
report the use of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging to 
identify subtle biochemical changes within cells, indicative of the G1/S and 
G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Following previous studies, we first synchronized 
samples from two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, confirmed their states by flow 
cytometry and DNA quantification, and recorded spectra. We determined two 
critical wavenumbers (1059 and 1219 cm-1) as spectral indicators of the cell 
cycle for a set of isogenic breast cancer cell lines (MCF10AT series). These two 
simple spectral markers were then applied to distinguish cell cycle stages in a 
3D cell culture model using four cell lines that represent the main stages of 
cancer progression from normal cells to metastatic disease. Temporal dependence 
of spectral biomarkers during acini maturation validated the hypothesis that the 
cells are more proliferative in the early stages of acini development; later 
stages of the culture showed stability in the overall composition but unique 
spatial differences in cells in the two phases. Altogether, this study presents 
a computational and quantitative approach for cell phase analysis in tissue-like 
3D structures without any biomarker staining and provides a means to 
characterize the impact of the cell cycle on 3D biological systems and disease 
diagnostic studies using IR imaging."
672,"A series of small (7-12 mer) amphipathic cationic peptides were designed and 
synthesized to create short helical peptides with broad-range bactericidal 
activity and selectivity toward the bacterial cells. The analysis identified a 
lead 12-mer peptide 8b with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive (MIC = 
3.1-6.2 μg/mL) and Gram-negative (MIC = 6.2-12.5 μg/mL) bacteria and selectivity 
toward prokaryotic versus eukaryotic cells (HC50 = 280 μg/mL, >75% cell 
viability at 150 μg/mL). The rapid membranolytic action of 8b was demonstrated 
by a calcein dye leakage assay and confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. 
According to circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy, the peptides have an 
irregular spatial structure in water. A lipid bilayer induced an amphipathic 
helix only in 12-mer peptides, including 8b. Molecular dynamics simulations 
provided detailed information about the interaction of 8b and its closest 
analogues with bacterial and mammalian membranes and revealed the roles of 
particular amino acids in the activity and selectivity of peptides."
673,"Cytosolic DNA promotes inflammatory responses upon detection by the cyclic 
GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). It has been suggested that cGAS downregulation 
is an immune escape strategy harnessed by tumor cells. Here, we used 
glioblastoma cells that show undetectable cGAS levels to address if alternative 
DNA detection pathways can promote pro-inflammatory signaling. We show that the 
DNA-PK DNA repair complex (i) drives cGAS-independent IRF3-mediated type I 
Interferon responses and (ii) that its catalytic activity is required for 
cGAS-dependent cGAMP production and optimal downstream signaling. We further 
show that the cooperation between DNA-PK and cGAS favors the expression of 
chemokines that promote macrophage recruitment in the tumor microenvironment in 
a glioblastoma model, a process that impairs early tumorigenesis but correlates 
with poor outcome in glioblastoma patients. Thus, our study supports that 
cGAS-dependent signaling is acquired during tumorigenesis and that cGAS and 
DNA-PK activities should be analyzed concertedly to predict the impact of 
strategies aiming to boost tumor immunogenicity."
674,"The role of cytosolic stress granules in the integrated stress response has 
remained largely enigmatic. Here, we studied the functionality of the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in cells that were unable to form stress 
granules. Surprisingly, the inability of cells to form cytosolic stress granules 
had primarily a negative impact on the functionality of the nuclear UPS. While 
defective ribosome products (DRiPs) accumulated at stress granules in thermally 
stressed control cells, they localized to nucleoli in stress granule-deficient 
cells. The nuclear localization of DRiPs was accompanied by redistribution and 
enhanced degradation of SUMOylated proteins. Depletion of the SUMO-targeted 
ubiquitin ligase RNF4, which targets SUMOylated misfolded proteins for 
proteasomal degradation, largely restored the functionality of the UPS in the 
nuclear compartment in stress granule-deficient cells. Stress granule-deficient 
cells showed an increase in the formation of mutant ataxin-1 nuclear inclusions 
when exposed to thermal stress. Our data reveal that stress granules play an 
important role in the sequestration of cytosolic misfolded proteins, thereby 
preventing these proteins from accumulating in the nucleus, where they would 
otherwise infringe nuclear proteostasis."
675,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the independent and combined use of indirect computed 
tomographic lymphography (ICTL) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) for 
sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in dogs with integumentary mast cell tumors 
(MCT) and report the metastatic LN rate.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.
ANIMALS: Twenty client-owned dogs.
METHODS: Dogs underwent preoperative ICTL, then intraoperative NIRF SLN mapping 
and excision of the anatomic lymph node (ALN) and/or SLN, and primary MCT. 
Technique agreement was complete if the same SLN was detected, and partial if 
the same SLN was detected along with additional SLN. No agreement occurred if 
the techniques detected different or no SLN. MCT were graded using two- and 
three-tier schemes, and LN were graded from HN0-3; HN2-3 were considered 
metastatic.
RESULTS: Complete, partial, and no agreement between ICTL and NIRF was seen in 
8/20 (40%), 8/20 (40%), and 4/20 (20%) dogs, respectively. Detection of ICTL-SLN 
and NIRF-SLN failed in 1/20 (5%) and 4/20 (20%), respectively. Tumors were grade 
II/low-grade in 19/20 (95%) and grade III/high-grade in 1/20 (5%) dogs. Nineteen 
out of 20 (95%) dogs had HN2-3 LN.
CONCLUSIONS: Technique agreement of at least one SLN was seen in 16/20 (80%) 
dogs. Although most MCT were classified as intermediate to low grade, LN 
metastases were commonly detected.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Combining ICTL and NIRF for MCT SLN mapping yields high 
SLN detection rates. Lymph node metastasis may be more common than previously 
reported for intermediate to low grade MCT."
676,"The application of drug delivery systems based on ferritin nanocarrier has been 
developed as a potential strategy in cancer therapy. The limited permeability of 
ferritin remains a challenge for drug penetration into the deeper tumor tissues. 
CendR peptides have been reported to bear tumor-specific penetration by 
recognizing neuropilin (NRP-1) receptor that overexpressed on a wide range of 
cancer cells. Herein, we modified CendR peptide L(RGERPPR), its retro-inverso 
peptide D(RPPREGR), and inverso peptide D(RGERPPR) on the outer surface of human 
H chain ferritin by sulfhydryl-maleimide coupling reaction. Approximately 45 
paclitaxel (PTX) molecules could be loaded into each ferritin inner cavity by a 
thermal-triggered method at a specific ionic strength. The penetration ability 
of three peptide-modified ferritin constructs showed that D(RGERPPR)-modified 
HFtn was able to be engulfed by A549 and MCF-7 tumor cells and spheroids at the 
highest level. Due to the dual-targeting effect of ferritin and modified 
peptides, the PTX-loaded nanocomposites could effectively enter the cells with 
high expression of TfR1 and NRP-1 receptors and enhanced the cytotoxicity 
against tumor cells. Remarkably, H-D(RGE)-PTX displayed a superior tumor growth 
suppression efficacy in A549 tumor-bearing nude mice. The inverso CendR 
peptide-modified HFtn nanocarrier was first generated and could provide an 
effective dual-targeting platform for treatment of cancers."
677,"CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells have demonstrated efficacy in graft-versus-host 
disease (GvHD) prevention and treatment. Preclinical and clinical studies 
indicate that Treg are able to protect from GvHD without interfering with the 
graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), 
although the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. To elucidate 
Treg suppressive function during in vivo suppression of acute GvHD, we performed 
paired T cell receptor (TCRa, TCRb genes) repertoire sequencing and RNA 
sequencing analysis on conventional T cells (Tcon) and Treg before and after 
transplantation in an MHC major-mismatch mouse model of HCT. We show that both 
Treg and Tcon underwent clonal restriction and that Treg did not interfere with 
the activation of alloreactive Tcon clones and the breadth of their TCR 
repertoire, however, markedly suppressed their expansion. Transcriptomic 
analysis revealed that Treg predominantly affected the transcriptome of CD4 Tcon 
and to a lesser extent of CD8 Tcon, modulating the transcription of genes 
encoding pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules as well as enzymes involved in 
metabolic processes, inducing a switch from glycolysis to oxidative 
phosphorylation. Finally, Treg did not interfere with the induction of gene sets 
involved in the GvT effect. Our results shed light into the mechanisms of acute 
GvHD suppression by Treg and will support the clinical translation of this 
immunoregulatory approach."
678,"Disorders of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are known to influence the 
incidence and mortality of various diseases. It remains largely unknown whether 
and how the UPS affects the onset and progression of acute graft-versus host 
disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(allo-HSCT). The present study demonstrated that the deubiquitinase OTUD1 is an 
essential regulator of aGVHD. Activation of CD4+ T cells after allo-HSCT 
elevated the protein levels of OTUD1, which in turn interacted with the 
Notch2-ICD (NICD) to cleave the ubiquitin of NICD at the K1770 site, thereby 
inducing NICD protein accumulations in T cells. OTUD1-driven NICD signaling 
promoted the differentiation and functions of Th1 and Th17 cells and amplified 
the cascade of aGVHD. Moreover, by screening a FDA-approved drugs library the 
study identified dapagliflozin as an inhibitor targeting the OTUD1/NICD axis. 
Dapagliflozin administration significantly prolonged the survival of aGVHD mice. 
The present study characterized a previously unknown role of OTUD1 in T 
cell-mediated allogeneic responses and provided a promising therapeutic strategy 
to target OTUD1 for the alleviation of aGVHD."
679,"Most overweight individuals do not develop diabetes due to compensatory islet 
responses to restore glucose homeostasis. Therefore, regulatory pathways that 
promote β-cell compensation are potential targets for treatment of diabetes. The 
melastatin transient receptor potential 7 protein (TRPM7), harboring a cation 
channel and a serine/threonine kinase, has been implicated in controlling cell 
growth and proliferation. Here, we report that selective deletion of Trpm7 in 
β-cells disrupts insulin secretion and leads to progressive glucose intolerance. 
We indicate that the diminished insulinotropic response in β-cell-specific Trpm7 
knockout mice is caused by decreased insulin production due to an impaired 
enzymatic activity of this protein. Accordingly, high-fat fed mice with a 
genetic loss of TRPM7 kinase activity (Trpm7R/R) display a marked glucose 
intolerance accompanied by hyperglycemia. These detrimental glucoregulatory 
effects are engendered by reduced compensatory β-cell responses due to mitigated 
AKT/ERK signaling. Collectively, our data identify TRPM7 kinase as a novel 
regulator of insulin synthesis, β-cell dynamics, and glucose homeostasis under 
obesogenic diet."
680,"Central integration of peripheral appetite-regulating signals ensures 
maintenance of energy homeostasis. Thus, plasticity of circulating molecule 
access to neuronal circuits involved in feeding behavior plays a key role in the 
adaptive response to metabolic changes. However, the mechanisms involved remain 
poorly understood despite their relevance for therapeutic development. Here, we 
investigated the role of median eminence mural cells, including smooth muscle 
cells and pericytes, in modulating gut hormone effects on 
orexigenic/anorexigenic circuits. We found that conditional activation of median 
eminence vascular cells impinged on local blood flow velocity, and altered 
ghrelin-stimulated food intake by delaying ghrelin access to target neurons. 
Thus, activation of median eminence vascular cells modulates food intake in 
response to peripheral ghrelin by reducing local blood flow velocity and access 
to the metabolic brain."
681,"T helper 17 (Th17) cells have a prominent role in autoimmune diseases. In 
contrast, the nature of these cells in cancer is controversial, with either pro 
or anti-tumorigenic activities depending on various cancer settings. Chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a B-cell malignancy, is characterized by an 
imbalance in T-cell immune responses contributing to disease progression and 
increased mortality. Many clinical reports indicate an increase in Th17 cells 
and/or IL-17 serum cytokine levels in CLL patients compared to healthy 
individuals which correlates with various prognostic markers and significant 
changes in the tumor microenvironment. The exact mechanisms by which Th17 might 
contribute to CLL progression is still less investigated. In this review, we 
provide an updated presentation of the clinical information related to the 
significance of Th17 cells in CLL, and their interaction with the complex 
leukemic microenvironment including various mediators, immune and non-immune 
cells. Herein, we also address the available data regarding the effects of CLL 
targeted therapies on Th17 cells, and the potential of using these cells in 
adoptive cell therapies. Having a sound understanding of the role played by Th17 
in CLL is crucial for designing novel therapies that can achieve immune 
homeostasis and maximize clinical benefits."
682,"Limitation of excessive inflammation due to selective degradation of 
pro-inflammatory proteins is one of the cytoprotective functions attributed to 
autophagy. In the current study, we highlight that selective autophagy also 
plays a vital role in promoting the establishment of a robust inflammatory 
response. Under inflammatory conditions, here TLR3-activation by poly(I:C) 
treatment, the inflammation repressor TNIP1 (TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1) is 
phosphorylated by Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) activating an LIR motif that 
leads to the selective autophagy-dependent degradation of TNIP1, supporting the 
expression of pro-inflammatory genes and proteins. This selective autophagy 
efficiently reduces TNIP1 protein levels early (0-4 h) upon poly(I:C) treatment 
to allow efficient initiation of the inflammatory response. At 6 h, TNIP1 levels 
are restored due to increased transcription avoiding sustained inflammation. 
Thus, similarly as in cancer, autophagy may play a dual role in controlling 
inflammation depending on the exact state and timing of the inflammatory 
response."
683,"Contractile epithelial tubes are found in various organs, such as lung airways 
and blood capillaries. Their ability to sense luminal pressure and respond with 
adequate contractility is essential for their physiology, and its mis-regulation 
results in diseases such as asthma and hypertension. Here, we describe a 
mechanoresponsive regulatory pathway downstream of tissue stretching that 
controls contraction of the C. elegans spermatheca, a tubular structure where 
fertilization occurs. Using live-imaging, we show that ovulation-induced 
stretching of spermathecal cells leads to recruitment of the RhoGEF RHGF-1 to 
stress fibers, which activates RHO-1 and myosin II in a positive feedback loop. 
Through deletion analysis, we identified the PDZ domain of RHGF-1 as responsible 
for F-actin binding, and genetic epistasis analysis with the RhoGAP spv-1 
demonstrated that tension-dependent recruitment of RHGF-1 to F-actin is required 
for robust spermathecal contractility. Our study illustrates how 
mechanosensitive regulators of Rho GTPases provide epithelial tubes the ability 
to tune their contractility in response to internal pressure."
684,"Microfluidic diffusional sizing (MDS) is a recent and powerful method for 
determining the hydrodynamic sizes and interactions of biomolecules and 
nanoparticles. A major benefit of MDS is that it can report the size of a 
fluorescently labeled target even in mixtures with complex, unpurified samples. 
However, a limitation of MDS is that the target itself has to be purified and 
covalently labeled with a fluorescent dye. Such covalent labeling is not 
suitable for crude extracts such as native nanodiscs directly obtained from 
cellular membranes. In this study, we introduce fluorescent universal lipid 
labeling for MDS (FULL-MDS) as a sparse, noncovalent labeling method for 
determining particle size. We first demonstrate that the inexpensive and 
well-characterized fluorophore, Nile blue, spontaneously partitions into lipid 
nanoparticles without disrupting their structure. We then highlight the key 
advantage of FULL-MDS by showing that it yields robust size information on lipid 
nanoparticles in crude cell extracts that are not amenable to other sizing 
methods. Furthermore, even for synthetic nanodiscs, FULL-MDS is faster, cheaper, 
and simpler than existing labeling schemes."
685,"OBJECTIVE: Neurodegeneration induced by inflammatory stress in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) leads to long-term neurological disabilities that are not 
amenable to current immunomodulatory therapies.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report that neuronal downregulation of Splicing 
factor 3b subunit 2 (SF3B2), a component of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
(snRNP), preserves retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and axonal integrity in 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced mice. By employing an 
in vitro system recapitulating the inflammatory environment of MS lesion, we 
show that when SF3B2 levels are downregulated, cell viability and axon integrity 
are preserved in cortical neurons against inflammatory toxicity. Notably, 
knockdown of SF3B2 suppresses the expression of injury-response and necroptosis 
genes and prevents activation of Sterile Alpha and TIR Motif Containing 1 
(Sarm1), a key enzyme that mediates programmed axon degeneration.
INTERPRETATION: Together, these findings suggest that the downregulation of 
SF3B2 is a novel potential therapeutic target to prevent secondary 
neurodegeneration in MS."
686,"IMPORTANCE: Real-world evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is needed to 
understand the prevalence of infection in the Japanese population.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct sentinel screening of the Japanese population to determine 
the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals, with 
complementary analysis for symptomatic patients as reported by active 
epidemiologic surveillance used by the government.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study of a sentinel 
screening program investigated approximately 1 million asymptomatic individuals 
with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 
February 22 and December 8, 2021. Participants included children, students, 
employed adults, and older individuals, as well as volunteers to broadly reflect 
the general Japanese population in the 14 prefectures of Japan that declared a 
state of emergency. Saliva samples and a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 
approximately 40 as standard in Japan were used. Polymerase chain reaction 
testing for symptomatic patients was separately done by public health 
authorities, and the results were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour, 
and Welfare of Japan to complement data on asymptomatic infections from the 
present study.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Temporal trends in positivity and prevalence 
(including surges of different variants) and demographic associations (eg, age, 
geographic location, and vaccination status) were assessed.
RESULTS: The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1 082 976 asymptomatic 
individuals (52.08% males; mean [SD] age 39.4 [15.7] years) was 0.03% (95% CI, 
0.02%-0.05%) during periods without surges and a maximum of 0.33% (95% CI, 
0.25%-0.43%) during peak surges at the Japanese standard Ct value of 
approximately 40; however, the positive rate would have been 10-fold less at a 
Ct value of 25 as used elsewhere in the world (eg, UK). There was an increase in 
patients with a positive PCR test result with a Ct value of 25 or 30 preceding 
surges in infection and hotspots of asymptomatic infections.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of asymptomatic 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population of Japan in 2021, as investigated 
by sentinel surveillance, a low rate of infection was seen in the Japanese 
population compared with reported levels elsewhere in the world. This finding 
provides real-world data on the state of infection in Japan."
687,"Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar absorbers have attracted intensive 
investigations for next-generation photovoltaic applications. Here, by using ab 
initio static and molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the anion 
compositional dependence of electron-vibration interaction in CZTSSe materials. 
We found that the conduction band fluctuates more than the valence band, and as 
a result, the band gap variation is more sensitive to the change of the former, 
which can be understood in terms of p-d hybridization in the valence bands. 
Electron-phonon coupling is smaller in CZTSSe alloy compared to pure S- or 
Se-containing structures, as evidenced by the smaller fluctuation of excitation 
energy, and can be attributed to the weaker structural dynamics of the 
metal-anion bond. Small electron-phonon coupling strength may lead to better 
charge transport in these materials. We also elucidated the interplay between 
disordered structures and S/Se stoichiometry through analysis of optical line 
width. The results highlight the importance of anion composition engineering and 
provide new insights into the rational design of high-performing kesterite 
absorbers for solar cells."
688,"BACKGROUND: Chronic liver disease has emerged as a leading cause of 
non-AIDS-related mortality in hepatitis C virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV)-coinfected patients. The relationship between CD4 cell count and 
HIV-related opportunistic infections and tumors has been well characterized; 
however, it is unclear whether CD4 cell count is associated with HCV-related 
hepatic events.
METHODS: This observational cohort study enrolled HCV/HIV-coinfected patients 
from the National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Program of China from 2004 to 
2019 in Guangzhou. The primary outcome was a composite of hepatic events, 
including cirrhosis complications, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 
liver-related mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Among the 793 patients, 43 developed hepatic events during a median 
follow-up of 6.7 years, including 35 cirrhosis complications, 13 HCC cases, and 
14 cases of liver-related mortality. The 5-year and 10-year cumulative 
incidences of hepatic events were 4.2% and 9.3%, respectively. Patients who 
developed hepatic events had a less satisfactory increase in CD4 cell count, 
lower peak CD4 (354.5/μL vs. 560.0/μL, P < 0.001), and lower percentage of peak 
CD4 > 500/μL (30.2% vs. 60.7%, P < 0.001) after the initiation of antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) than those who did not. The cumulative incidences of hepatic 
events were higher in patients with lower peak CD4 levels with adjusted odds 
ratios of 3.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-10.40), 2.25 (95% CI: 
0.87-5.86), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.35-2.74) for patients with peak CD4 at <200/μL, 
200-350/μL, and 351 to 500/μL, respectively, relative to those with peak CD4 > 
500/μL. Peak CD4 was negatively associated with the risk of hepatic events in a 
dose-response manner (P-value for trend = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Persistently low CD4 cell counts after ART are independently 
associated with a high risk of hepatic events in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients, 
highlighting the important role of immune reconstitution in improving liver 
outcomes."
689,"BACKGROUND: Ubiquitination plays an essential role in many biological processes, 
including viral infection, and can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes 
(DUBs). Although some studies discovered that DUBs inhibit or enhance viral 
infection by various mechanisms, there is lack of information on the role of 
DUBs in virus regulation, which needs to be further investigated.
METHODS: Immunoblotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, in vivo/in vitro 
deubiquitination, protein immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and 
co-localization biological techniques were employed to examine the effect of 
ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3) on APOBEC3G (A3G) stability and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. To analyse the relationship between 
USP3 and HIV disease progression, we recruited 20 HIV-infected patients to 
detect the levels of USP3 and A3G in peripheral blood and analysed their 
correlation with CD4+ T-cell counts. Correlation was estimated by Pearson 
correlation coefficients (for parametric data).
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that USP3 specifically inhibits HIV-1 
replication in an A3G-dependent manner. Further investigation found that USP3 
stabilized 90% to 95% of A3G expression by deubiquitinating Vif-mediated 
polyubiquitination and blocking its degradation in an enzyme-dependent manner. 
It also enhances the A3G messenger RNA (mRNA) level by binding to A3G mRNA and 
stabilizing it in an enzyme-independent manner. Moreover, USP3 expression was 
positively correlated with A3G expression (r = 0.5110) and CD4+ T-cell counts 
(r = 0.5083) in HIV-1-infected patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that USP3 restricts HIV-1 viral infections by increasing 
the expression of the antiviral factor A3G. Therefore, USP3 may be an important 
target for drug development and serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against 
viral infections."
690,"BACKGROUND: In this study, the authors sought to describe the cytologic features 
of primary gynecologic germ cell tumors and carcinomas exhibiting germ cell 
differentiation because little information currently exists.
METHODS: An institutional database search was performed to identify 
histologically confirmed gynecologic germ cell tumors and carcinomas with germ 
cell tumor differentiation. Available cytologic material was reviewed by three 
observers, and morphologic features were recorded in addition to patient age at 
original diagnosis, primary tumor site, site(s) from which the examined 
cytologic material was obtained, and the type of examined cytologic 
preparations.
RESULTS: In total, 15 cytologic specimens from 12 women (aged 19-82 years) were 
identified and included touch preparations of core biopsies from various sites 
(n = 6), fine-needle biopsies (n = 2), pelvic washings (n = 1), ascitic fluids 
(n = 4), pelvic cyst fluid (n = 1), and endometrial aspirate (n = 1). Of the 12 
patients, seven had primary gynecologic germ cell tumors, four had gynecologic 
(ovarian and endometrial) tumors exhibiting somatic yolk sac tumor-like 
differentiation, and the remaining patient had an intestinal-type adenocarcinoma 
arising within an ovarian teratoma. There was morphologic overlap among many of 
the cases, although cytoplasmic vacuolation/granular cytoplasm was seen in 75% 
of primary yolk sac tumors or carcinomas with yolk sac tumor differentiation, 
and dense/squamoid cytoplasm was seen in 100% of teratomatous elements that were 
sampled.
CONCLUSIONS: Germ cell tumors and somatic neoplasms exhibiting germ cell tumor 
differentiation occurring in adult women share some cytologic features and may 
be difficult to distinguish from one another, although some tumor types showed 
characteristic cytomorphologic findings."
691,"BACKGROUND: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is one of the most common primary glomerular 
diseases worldwide, especially in young Asian adults. Long RNA H19 is associated 
with renal pathologies, such as renal cell injury; however, a connection between 
serum H19 expression and kidney disease progression has not been demonstrated.
METHOD: Our cohort consisted of 204 patients with IgAN. Serum H19 levels were 
determined with reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase between 1 May, 
2014 and 1 May, 2015. H19 levels were log-transformed and categorical variables 
were categorized according to cutoff points of a ROC curve. Restricted cubic 
spline and generalized estimating equation analyses were performed to determine 
the association between serum H19 and kidney disease progression.
RESULTS: H19 expression was significantly downregulated in patients with IgAN 
compared to healthy controls. Restricted cubic spline analyses showed that the 
relationship was negatively and linearly correlated (P for nonlinearly = 0.256). 
After adjusting for other potential clinical, pathologic, and treatment factors, 
H19 was found to be a protective factor for prognosis in IgAN (HR, 0.52; 95% CI 
0.32-0.84; P = 0.008). ROC curve analysis showed that the clinical value of 
lncRNA H19 with CKD and area under the ROC curve was 0.746 (95% CI 0.663-0.829; 
P < 0.001) of the clinical prognostic value of H19. Serum restricted cubic 
spline analyses showed that the relationship was negatively and linearly 
correlated (P for non-linearly = 0.256). H19 > 0.097 in patients in IgAN was 
associated with a reduction of the risk of kidney progression by approximately 
70% within 5 years compared to H19≤0.097 (HR, 0.30;95% CI 0.12-0.74; P = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: H19 is an independent protective factor, and a high level of H19 
often indicates better renal outcome within 5 years."
692,"Myelodysplastic neoplasms, formerly known as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 
represent a group of clonal disorders characterized by a high degree of clinical 
and molecular heterogeneity, and an invariable tendency to progress to acute 
myeloid leukemia. MDS typically present in the elderly with cytopenias of 
different degrees and bone marrow dysplasia, the hallmarks of the disease. 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the sole curative approach to 
date. Nonetheless, given the disease's demographics, only a minority of patients 
can benefit from this procedure. Currently used prognostic schemes such as the 
Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (R-IPSS), and most recently the 
molecular IPSS (IPSS-M), guide clinical management by dividing MDS into two big 
categories: lower- and higher-risk cases, based on a cut-off score of 3.5. The 
main clinical problem of the lower-risk group is represented by the management 
of cytopenias, whereas the prevention of secondary leukemia progression is the 
goal for the latter. Herein, we discuss the non-transplant treatment of MDS, 
focusing on current practice and available therapeutic options, while also 
presenting new investigational agents potentially entering the MDS therapeutic 
arsenal in the near future."
693,"Cerebral infarction (CI), also known as ischemic stroke, has a high incidence 
rate and mortality rate. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
potential effect and mechanism of Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1) in the 
CI progression. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) treated rats and 
oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) stimulated PC12 cells were used 
to establish CI model in vivo and in vitro. The cell proliferation and apoptosis 
was determined by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. 
Immunoprecipitation and western blot was performed to test the lactylation 
levels of LCP1. The cells were treated with cycloheximide to determined the 
protein stability of LCP1. The glucose uptake and lactate production was 
determined with commercial kits. The extracellular acidification rate were 
evaluated by Seahorse. The results showed that LCP1 was upregulated in the MCAO 
rats and OGD/R stimulated PC12 cells. LCP1 knockdown dramatically decreased the 
neurological score, infarct volume and the brain water content of MCAO rats. 
Besides, LCP1 knockdown promoted the cell viability while decreased the 
apoptosis rate of the OGD/R stimulated PC12 cells. Additionally, the global 
lactylation and lactylation levels of LCP1 was prominently enhanced in vivo and 
in vitro in cerebral infarction. 2-DG treatment prominently decreased it. In 
conclusion, inhibiting the glycolysis decreased the lactylation levels of LCP1 
and resulted in the degradation of LCP1, which eventually relieved the CI 
progression."
694,"BACKGROUND: Characteristics of AL amyloidosis across Asia are not well-described 
in the literature. Thus, we overviewed the incidence and disease characteristics 
of AL amyloidosis in Korea.
METHODS: We collected medical records of 302 AL amyloidosis patients and 
compared survival outcomes by predominant treatment strategy and at four time 
points: 1995-2003, 2004-2008, 2009-2013, and 2014-2018.
RESULTS: The median age was 62 years (36-83). One hundred forty-one patients 
were classified as stage III (26.3%) or IV (47.9%). The patients diagnosed 
between 2014 and 2018 survived longer than those diagnosed at other time points 
due to the introduction of bortezomib (p < 0.01). In addition, patients who 
received upfront ASCT survived longer than those who received salvage ASCT or 
chemotherapy alone (p < 0.01). However, most of the 85 patients who experienced 
early death within 6 months were older than 75 years, had BMI less than 20, and 
had a high disease burden.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AL amyloid has increased and survival outcomes 
have improved gradually, most likely due to introduction of novel agents and 
upfront ASCT. However, not all patients are suitable for these potent treatment 
modalities, and avoiding early death within 6 months remains a challenge."
695,"The rarity and biological heterogeneity of the peripheral T-cell lymphomas has 
made subtype- and biomarker-driven approaches challenging to realize and even 
more challenging to evaluate in clinical practice. Out of necessity, treatment 
of T-cell lymphomas has historically been derivative of other aggressive 
lymphomas, utilizing intensive combination chemotherapy programs in the upfront 
setting and non-overlapping cytotoxic regimens upon relapse. However, due to 
tremendous work in understanding the oncogenic basis of these varied diseases, 
an increasing exploration of rational, targeted therapies is underway. Still, 
clinical successes have at times lagged behind pathobiological realizations, and 
there is an evolving need for biologically based, subtype-specific strategies in 
the clinic. Herein we propose a framework for future success that relies upon 
optimizing standard therapy in populations known to benefit from combination 
chemotherapy, building upon CHOP (or CHOP-like) induction with the CHOP + X 
model, exploring the use of targeted platforms in the relapsed and refractory 
setting, and designing biomarker-informed clinical trials that target-specific 
subhistologies and unique molecular subsets."
696,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a rare myeloproliferative disease in children. 
The primary cause of CML is the chimeric BCR::ABL1 gene in hematopoietic stem 
cells, which leads to leukocytosis, platelet proliferation, and splenomegaly. 
Lately, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have replaced hematopoietic cell 
transplantation, which was previously considered the only curative therapy, as 
the first-line treatment for chronic-phase CML. However, the clinical efficacy 
of TKIs, including those effective in adult CML, has not been well-investigated 
in pediatric CML. This review describes the recommended TKI-based management 
strategies for pediatric CML according to the literature and guidelines. 
Furthermore, we discuss the prospects for TKI discontinuation to avoid important 
adverse events, such as growth impairment, in children."
697,"Selenium (Se) is an essential element and antioxidant that catalyzes the 
destruction of hydrogen peroxide formed during cellular oxidative metabolism. 
Doses of Se as selenomethionine (SeMe) by oral route are 0.1-0.3 mgSe/kg DM, 
while the dose by parenteral route with sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) is 0.1 
mgSe/BW. The effects of supranutritional Se supplementation on normal kids have 
rarely been studied. The objective of the study was to evaluate both Se sources 
on growth performance, Se in tissues, histopathological findings, and meat 
characteristics. Forty-five kids of the Pastoreña breed with 25-day age were 
distributed (4.7 ± 1.13 kg) in three treatments: a) control group, C: 
consumption with goat milk (GM: containing 0.135 mgSe/g); b) NaSe: GM plus 
Na2SeO3 injectable, 0.25 mgSe/kg BW; c) SeMe: GM plus oral dosage, 0.3 mgSe as 
SeMe daily. Fifteen animals per treatment were slaughtered at 7, 14, and 
21 days. Feed conversion improved (P < 0.05) with Se supplement (P < 0.05) at 7 
and 14 days. SeMe had higher protein and fat meat content (P < 0.05). SeMe 
increased Se liver at 14 and 21 days. NaSe and SeMe had higher (P < 0.05) levels 
of Se kidney. SeMe-21d showed 42% mononuclear and periportal cell infiltration 
lesions. In conclusion, Se administered through milk in goat kids was 
insufficient to prevent nutritional muscular dystrophy. The supranutritional 
dose of 0.25 mg/kg as NaSe was sufficient to maintain the Se level in tissues. 
SeMe increased Se liver and kidney efficiently. Both Se sources improved the 
bioavailability of the mineral in kids."
698,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative treatment is performed for locally advanced colon 
cancer with extensive tumor proximity or suspected invasion of skeletal muscles, 
major organs, and blood vessels. Oxaliplatin-based regimens are often used in 
preoperative chemotherapy. However, microsatellite instability (MSI)-high 
colorectal cancer is often resistant to cytotoxic anticancer agents. Herein, we 
describe a case of treatment of anticancer drug-resistant MSI-high locally 
advanced colon cancer and review cases of complete response to immune checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy for colorectal cancer.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a large 
tumor in the descending colon and extensive thoracic and abdominal wall 
involvement, including the ribs and diaphragm. No distant metastasis was 
observed. The tumor had perforated the abdominal wall and formed an abscess. 
Upon visiting our hospital, emergency surgery was performed. An abdominal wall 
incision was made to drain the abscess and laparoscopic colostomy was performed. 
Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens revealed an adenocarcinoma 
with positive immunohistochemical expressions of both CDX2 and CK20. The patient 
was diagnosed with a descending colon cancer. Genetic examination found 
MSI-high, Kras mutation (F12G), and wild-type BRAF. After the inflammation 
improved, chemotherapy with the FOLFIRI regimen was initiated, but the tumor 
grew rapidly. As a second-line treatment, nivolumab and ipilimumab combination 
therapy was initiated. After four cycles of these therapies, the patient was 
administered nivolumab alone for five cycles. Tumor shrinkage was observed and 
radical surgery was performed. The patient underwent laparoscopic descending 
colon and partial thoracic and abdominal wall resection. The abdominal wall 
muscle was dissected from the abdominal cavity, and subcutaneous tissues, 
diaphragm, ribs were dissected from the body surface. Pathological examination 
revealed mucus components, fibrous tissues, and no malignant cells, indicating a 
complete pathological response (pCR). The patient had a good postoperative 
course and returned to work after being discharged. No recurrence was observed 
six months postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report a case of anticancer drug-resistant MSI-high 
colon cancer that was resected after treatment with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, and a pCR was achieved. This new treatment strategy can be used for 
the treatment of cases that are not responsive to conventional therapies."
699,"Graphene (G) has been a game-changer for conductive optical devices and has 
shown promising aspects for its implementation in the power industry due to its 
diverse structures. Graphene has played an essential role as electrodes, hole 
transport layers (HTLs), electron transport layers (ETLs), and a chemical 
modulator for perovskite layers in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past 
decade. Nitrogen-doped graphene (N-DG) derivatives are frequently evaluated 
among the existing derivatives of graphene because of their versatility of

highlighted."
700,"BACKGROUND: Mondia whitei root is often used in Africa as a local therapeutic 
agent for libido enhancement. The fractions of the M. whitei leaves (MWL) lack 
chemical characterization of their bioactive components and possible molecular 
targets. We characterized and investigated its molecular target as therapeutic 
agents in an in vitro and in silico assay. Mineral compositions, antioxidant, 
and GC-MS characterization were studied. The cytotoxicity effect was measured on 
HeLa and HT-29 cells by MTT assay. In silico potential inhibitors of Cathepsin B 
(CathB) as a cancer biomarker were determined.
RESULTS: The flame photometry produced marked Na+ and K+. GC-MS revealed 
eighteen bioactive components. The fractions (chloroformic 47.00, ethanolic 
45.52, and aqueous 40.13) of MWL caused a higher inhibition ratio compared to 
standards. The MWL showed a significant cytotoxic effect on the treated cell 
lines at concentrations of 150 and 200 μg/ml and 100, 150, and 200 μg/ml for 
HT-29 and HeLa cells, respectively. Ten bioactives (MWL 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 
15, 17, and 18) showed potential inhibition of CathB with binding affinities of 
-4.40 to -8.3 Kcal/Mol. However, MWL 4, 9, 14, and 17 which have higher binding 
affinities (-6.7, -7.1, -8.2, and -8.3, respectively) than the standard 
inhibitor (-6.5) were the lead molecules.
CONCLUSION: These chemical profiles and potential molecular targets unraveled in 
this study propose that MWL has a promising anticancer activity."
701,"INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a heterogeneous malignancy with 
dismal prognosis. However, few studies have conducted on the metabolic 
heterogeneity in SCLC.
OBJECTIVE: We therefore identify SCLC classifications using untargeted 
metabolomics and lipidomics. We also compared their survival and the 
immunotherapy responses.
METHODS: Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
analysis was performed in 191 SCLC serum samples. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) analysis was conducted to identify metabolic pathways. The 
Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were used to analyze the survival curves. The 
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used 
to evaluate prognostic factors for OS in patients with SCLC.
RESULTS: Distinct subtypes of SCLC were identified by consensus clustering 
algorithm using partioning around medoids (pam) based on untargeted metabolomics 
and lipidomics. Four distinct subtypes of SCLC were identified, with distinct 
metabolic pathways. Subgroup 2 had the longest survival whereas Subgroup 1 had 
the shortest. Subtype 2 benefited most from immunotherapy in OS, as in contrast 
to Subtype 3 with shortest survival.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the metabolic heterogeneity in SCLC and 
identified four subtypes with distinct metabolic features. It indicates 
promising therapeutic and prognostic value that may guide treatment for SCLC. 
The subtype-specific clinical trials may be designed and would be instructive 
for drug development."
702,"Prostate cancer (PCa) has long been the leading cause of cancer-associated 
deaths among male worldwide. Our previous studies have shown that Bloom syndrome 
protein (BLM) plays a vital role in PCa proliferation, yet the underlying 
molecular mechanism remains largely obscure. Mechanistically, BLM directly 
interacted with hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). Functionally, BLM and 
HDGF knockdown resulted in the higher impairment of PC3 proliferation, 
clonogenicity, migration and invasion than that their counterpart with either 
BLM or HDGF knockdown exclusively. Of note, HDGF overexpression expedited, 
whereas its knockdown suppressed, PC3 proliferation, clonogenicity, migration 
and invasion. Additionally, the potentiation or attenuation was partially 
antagonized upon BLM depletion or overexpression. In line with the vitro data, 
the impact of BLM and HDGF on tumor growth was investigated in mouse xenograft 
models. ChIP-seq, dual-luciferase reporter and western blotting assays were 
employed to expound the regulatory network in PC3 cells. The results unveiled 
that HDGF activated KRAS and suppressed RhoA transcription, and that the 
function of HDGF was mediated, in part, by interaction with BLM. Accordingly, 
the MAPK/ERK pathway was activated. Moreover, the regulation of HDGF on KRAS and 
RhoA had a signal crosstalk. To recapitulate, BLM and HDGF may serve as novel 
prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in PCa."
703,"PURPOSE: Using a comprehensive flow cytometric panel, simultaneously obtained 
mid-luteal immunophenotypes from peripheral blood and endometrium were compared 
and values correlated. Is a peripheral blood evaluation of reproductive 
immunophenotype status meritorious relative to local endometrial evaluation to 
directly assess the peri-implantation environment?
METHODS: Fifty-five patients had a mid-luteal biopsy to assess the local 
endometrial immunophenotype, while simultaneously providing a peripheral blood 
sample for analysis. Both samples were immediately assessed using a 
comprehensive multi-parameter panel, and lymphocyte subpopulations were 
described and compared.
RESULTS: Distinct lymphocyte proportions and percentage differences were noted 
across the two compartments, confirming the hypothesis that they are distinct 
environments. The ratio of CD4 + to CD8 + T cells were reversed between the two 
compartments, as were Th1 and Th2-type CD4 + T cell ratios. Despite these 
differences, some direct relationships were noted. Positive Pearson correlations 
were found between the levels of CD57 + expressing natural killer cells, 
CD3 + NK-T cells and CD4 + Th1 cells in both compartments.
CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric evaluation provides a rapid and objective analysis 
of lymphocyte subpopulations. Endometrial biopsies have become the gold standard 
technique to assess the uterine immunophenotype in adverse reproductive outcome, 
but there may still a place for peripheral blood evaluation in this context. The 
findings demonstrate significant variations in cellular proportions across the 
two regions, but some positive correlations are present. Immunological 
assessment of these specific peripheral blood lymphocyte subtypes may provide 
insight into patients with potential alterations of the uterine immune 
environment, without the risks and inconveniences associated with an invasive 
procedure."
704,"Extraction and characterization of natural products provide the opportunity to 
expand our arsenal of drug candidates against a wide range of diseases including 
cancer and inflammatory disorders. Previous studies have shown bee venom to have 
immense potential as an anti-inflammatory drug candidate. In this study, we 
focused on the venom of Apis mellifera anatoliaca and characterized its content 
by HPLC. An in vitro inflammation model based on lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-stimulated mammalian macrophages was utilized to examine the venom's 
anti-inflammatory potential. Additionally, its antiproliferative activity was 
evaluated in vitro against a human glioblastoma cell line. Based on the TNF, 
IL6, GMCSF, and IL12p40 pro-inflammatory cytokine production level in 
LPS-induced macrophages, venom-treated groups showed substantial decrease in the 
inflammatory action compared to untreated LPS-stimulated macrophages. When the 
cells were analyzed for viability, the venom did not have any cytotoxic effect 
on the macrophages at the concentration ranges that were utilized. Moreover, 
IC50 value of the venom was above 60 µg/mL on glioblastoma cancer cell line. 
These results suggest that the Apis mellifera anatoliaca venom does not have 
anticancer drug candidate potential, whereas it can efficiently be used against 
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first study 
to specifically examine the effect of anti-inflammatory activity of Apis 
mellifera anatoliaca venom on macrophages."
705,"Diabetic patients often have impaired heart rate (HR) control. HR is regulated 
both intrinsically within the sinoatrial node (SAN) and via neuronal input. 
Previously, we found lower ex vivo HR in type 2 diabetic rat hearts, suggesting 
impaired HR generation within the SAN. The major driver of pacemaking within the 
SAN is the activity of hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 4 
(HCN(4)) channels. This study aimed to investigate whether the lower intrinsic 
HR in the type 2 diabetic heart is due to changes in HCN4 function, protein 
expression and/ or distribution. The intrinsic HR response to HCN4 blockade was 
determined in isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts of Zucker type 2 Diabetic 
Fatty (ZDF) rats (DM) and their non-diabetic ZDF littermates (nDM). HCN4 protein 
expression and membrane localisation were determined using western blot and 
immunofluorescence, respectively. We found that the intrinsic HR was lower in DM 
compared to nDM hearts. The change in intrinsic HR in response to HCN4 blockade 
with ivabradine was diminished in DM hearts, which normalised the intrinsic HR 
between the groups. HCN4 protein expression was decreased in the SAN of DM 
compared to nDM controls with no change in the fraction of HCN4 localised to the 
membrane of SAN cardiomyocytes. The lower intrinsic HR in DM is likely due to 
decreased HCN4 expression and depressed HCN4 function. Our study provides a 
novel understanding into the intrinsic mechanisms underlying altered HR control 
in type 2 diabetes."
706,"Treatment of nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) is a major clinical concern 
and challenge for clinicians. Despite the advancement in treatment strategies, 
there is no definitive treatment for complicated nonhealing DFUs. Animal models 
are crucial for understanding pathogenesis and investigating novel therapeutic 
small molecules and the rodent model is commonly used for research related to 
cutaneous wound healing. Sexual dimorphism and its effect on the efficacy of sex 
hormones in enhancing healing in cutaneous wounds using a rodent model have been 
discussed, however, there is a lack of data related to diabetic foot ulcers. 
Further, the effects of sexual dimorphism on the issues related to induction of 
diabetes, differential immune response, type and size of the wound, the 
effectiveness of topical versus systemic treatment, and molecular mechanisms 
involved in wound healing like hemostasis, granulation tissue formation, the 
response of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, inflammation, and skin anatomy are 
scarcely discussed. Understanding these aspects is of significance and will help 
in choosing the correct sex, species, and strain of rodents while investigating 
therapeutic small molecules for DFUs. This review critically summarized these 
issues and their translational aspects followed by highlighting the effect of 
sexual dimorphism on these important aspects."
707,"Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been widely used in medicine such as imaging, 
drug delivery and therapeutics due to their multifunctional properties. 
Alterations in neuronal function may contribute to various neurological 
diseases. Transferrin plays a primary role in iron transportation and delivery 
and has recently been utilized for drug delivery to the brain. We have 
investigated effects of transferrin-conjugated GNPs (Tf-GNPs) on anxiety and 
locomotor behavior in vivo and also hippocampal neuronal activity ex vivo. 
Electrophysiological effects of Tf-GNP on hippocampal neurons were determined by 
patch clamp method. Fifteen male young adult C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided 
into three groups as control (200 µL PBS), GNP (bare GNP; 2.2 μg/g in PBS) and 
Tf-GNPs (2.2 μg/g Tf-GNP). Animals intraperitoneally received the respective 
treatments for seven consecutive days and were subjected to elevated plus maze 
(EPM) and open field tests (OFT). Ex vivo, firing frequency of the neurons 
significantly increased by GNP treatment (p < 0.001). In vivo, animals in Tf-GNP 
group showed significantly longer distance in open arms but significantly lower 
number of entries to the open arms in EPM (p < 0.05). Mice received bare GNPs 
had significantly higher locomotor activity in OFT (p < 0.05), while Tf-GNP did 
not alter the locomotor activity significantly (p = 0.051). Animals in Tf-GNP 
group spent significantly longer time in the peripheral zone in OFT (p < 0.05). 
The present findings have shown that Tf-GNP induces anxiety-like behavior 
without altering spontaneous firing rate of hippocampal neurons. We suggest that 
neurobiological effects of Tf-GNP should be pre-determined before using in 
medical applications."
708,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a specialized circular structure, are deregulated 
in cancers and play essential roles in biological processes involved in tumor 
progression. However, the mechanism by which circRNAs affect lung tumorigenesis 
and progression remains largely unexplored. To investigate the role of circRNA 
in lung cancer, circRNA expression profile was screened by bioinformatics 
analysis. The levels of circTAB2, miR-3142, and GLIS family zinc finger 2 
(GLIS2) were measured by quantitate real-time (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected by EdU, flow 
cytometry, and transwell assays, respectively. Bioinformatics, western blot, 
RIP, pull down, dual luciferase reporter and rescue experiments were used to 
verify the direct relationship between miR-3142 and circTAB2 or GLIS2. The 
xenograft assays were used to assess the role of circTAB2 in vivo.CircTAB2 
exhibited low expression in cancer tissues. Gain and loss-of-function assays 
indicated that circTAB2 could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and 
invasion. Functional studies revealed that circTAB2 acted as a miRNA sponge, 
directly interacted with miR-3142 and consequently regulated GLIS2 /AKT. Taken 
together, circTAB2 serves as an inhibitory role in lung cancer through a novel 
circTAB2 /miR-3142 /GLIS2 /AKT pathway and could be exploited a novel marker in 
lung cancer."
709,"Wound treatment, especially for chronic and infected wounds, has been a 
permanent socio-economical challenge. This study aimed to investigate the 
ability of red light at 661 nm to accelerate wound healing an in vitro wound 
model using 3T3 fibroblasts. The purpose is further specified in clarifying the 
mechanisms of wound closure by means of intracellular ROS production, 
proliferation and migration of cells, and cellular orientation. Illumination 
effects of red light from a diode laser (661 nm) at different doses on 3T3 cell 
viability was assessed via MTT assay and tested in a scratch wound model. Wound 
closure rates were calculated by image analysis at 0, 24, and 48 h after laser 
treatment. ROS production was monitored and quantified immediately and 24 h 
after the treatment by fluorescence microscopy. Cellular orientation was 
quantified by image analysis. No phototoxic energy doses used and increased cell 
viability in most of the groups. Scratch assay revealed an energy interval of 
3 - 4.5 J/cm2 that promote higher wound healing rate 24 h post treatment. An 
increase in ROS production was also observed 24 h post irradiation higher in the 
group with the highest wound healing rate. Also, cellular orientation toward the 
margin of the wound was observed and quantified after irradiation. Low power 
laser light at 661 nm activated both the migration and proliferation in the in 
vitro model used, providing evidence that it could also accelerate wound healing 
in vivo. Also, ROS production and cellular orientation seem to play an important 
role in wound healing process."
710,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect worldwide and a 
main cause of perinatal and infant mortality. Our previous genome-wide 
association study identified 53 SNPs that associated with CHD in the Han Chinese 
population. Here, we performed functional screening of 27 orthologous genes in 
zebrafish using injection of antisense morpholino oligos. From this screen, 5 
genes were identified as essential for heart development, including iqgap2, 
ptprt, ptpn22, tbck and maml3. Presumptive roles of the novel CHD-related genes 
include heart chamber formation (iqgap2 and ptprt) and atrioventricular canal 
formation (ptpn22 and tbck). While deficiency of maml3 led to defective cardiac 
trabeculation and consequent heart failure in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, we 
found that maml3 mutants showed decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation which 
caused a reduction in cardiac trabeculae due to inhibition of Notch signaling. 
Together, our study identifies 5 novel CHD-related genes that are essential for 
heart development in zebrafish and first demonstrates that maml3 is required for 
Notch signaling in vivo."
711,"AIMS: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common diabetic complication. 
Aberrant mitochondrial function causes neurodegeneration under 
hyperglycemia-induced metabolic stress, which in turn results in DPN 
progression. m6A and m6A reader (YTHDC2) are closely related to diabetes and 
diabetes complications, while the role of YTHDC2 in regulating mitochondrial 
metabolism in DPN needs to be further probed.
METHODS: For HG treatment, Schwann cells (RSC96) were subjected to D-glucose for 
72 h. db/db mice were used as the diabetic mouse model. Me-RIP assay was 
performed to evaluate KDM5B m6A level. RNA degradation assay was conducted to 
examine KDM5B mRNA stability. In addition, OCR and ECAR were examined by XF96 
Analyzer. Moreover, the content of ATP and PDH activity in RSC96 cells were 
detected using kits, and the level of ROS was detected using MitoSOX staining. 
RIP, RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were carried out to 
verify the binding relationships between YTHDC2, KDM5B and SIRT3.
RESULTS: We first observed that KDM5B expression and KDM5B mRNA stabilization 
were significantly increased in DPN. The m6A reader YTHDC2 was lowly expressed 
in DPN. Meanwhile, YTHDC2 over expression decreased KDM5B mRNA stability in an 
m6A-dependent manner. Our results also revealed that YTHDC2 overexpression 
resulted in reduced ROS level and increased ATP level, PDH activity, OCR and 
ECAR in HG-treated Schwann cells, while these effects were reversed by KDM5B 
overexpression. Additionally, SIRT3 served as the target of YTHDC2/KDM5B axis in 
regulating mitochondrial metabolism in DPN.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, YTHDC2 promoted SIRT3 expression by reducing the 
stabilization of KDM5B to improve mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming in DPN."
712,"Tropospheric ozone (O3) has become one of the main urban air pollutants. In the 
present study, we assessed impact of ambient and future ground-level O3 on nine 
commonly growing urban tree species under Free Air Ozone Enrichment 
(FAOE) condition. During the study period, mean ambient and elevated ozone (EO3) 
concentrations were 48.59 and 69.62 ppb, respectively. Under EO3 
treatment, stomatal density (SD) significantly decreased and guard cell length 
(GCL) increased in Azadirachta indica, Bougainvillea spectabilis, Plumeria 
rubra, Saraca asoca and Tabernaemontana divaricata, while SD increased and GCL 
decreased in Ficus benghalensis and Terminalia arjuna. Proline levels increased 
in all the nine plant species under EO3 condition. EO3 significantly reduced 
photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance (gs), and transpiration rates (E). 
Only A. indica and N. indicum showed higher gs and E under EO3 treatment. Water 
use efficiency (WUE) significantly increased in F. benghalensis and decreased in 
A. indica and T. divaricata. Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) significantly 
increased in Ficus religiosa and S. asoca whereas it decreased in B. spectabilis 
and A. indica. Of all the plant species B. spectabilis and A. indica were the 
most sensitive to EO3 (high gs and less ascorbic acid content) while S. asoca 
and F. religiosa were the most tolerant (lowgs and more ascorbic acid content). 
The sensitivity of urban tree species to EO3 is a cause of concern and should be 
considered for future urban forestry programmes. Our study should guide more 
such studies to identify tolerant trees for urban air pollution abatement."
713,"Prostate cancer, one of the major causes of mortality globally is regarded as 
the second leading cause of mortality among men. It is known to affect the 
stromal cells surrounding it. Through the use of exosomes, the affected stromal 
cells can promote the growth and spread of the cancer. Exosomes are known to 
play a role not only in the development and progression of cancer but also 
contribute to the drug-resistance character of cancer cells. Recently, the 
discovery of the small non-coding RNAs or miRNA has attracted attention of 
cancer researchers as they can regulate the expression of different genes. 
Therefore, exosomal miRNA can be used as a novel and reliable biomarker for the 
diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. In addition, exosomal miRNAs can 
also be used as a potential treatment for prostate cancer. The goal of this 
review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current knowledge about the 
role of exosomal miRNAs in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer and 
their potential role in monitoring the disease."
714,"Cancer is a prevalent cause of mortality globally, where early diagnosis leads 
to a reduced death rate. Many researchers' common strategies are based on 
personalized diagnostic methods with rapid response and high accuracy. This 
technology was developed by applying liquid biopsy instead of tissue biopsies in 
the case of tumor cell analysis that facilitates point-of-care testing for 
cancer diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, significant progress in 
microfluidic technology led to the successful isolation, analysis, and 
monitoring of cancer biomarkers in body liquid biopsy with merits like high 
sensitivity and flexibility, low sample usage, cost effective, and the ability 
of automation. The most critical and informative markers in body liquid refer to 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and extracellular vesicles derived from tumors 
(EVs) that carry various biomarkers in their structure (DNAs, proteins, and 
RNAs) as compared to ctDNA. The released ctDNA has a low half-life and decreased 
sensitivity due to large amounts of nucleic acid in serum. This review intends 
to highlight different cancer screening tests with a particular focus on the 
details regarding the only FDA-approved and awaiting technologies for FDA 
clearance to isolate CTCs and EVs based on microfluidics systems."
715,"The recent advances in the application of machine learning to drug discovery 
have made it a 'hot topic' for research, with hundreds of academic groups and 
companies integrating machine learning into their drug discovery projects. 
Nevertheless, there remains great uncertainty regarding the most appropriate 
ways to evaluate the relative performance of these powerful methods against more 
traditional cheminformatics approaches, and many pitfalls remain for the unwary. 
In 2020, researchers at MIT (Stokes et al., Cell 180(4), 688-702, 2020) reported 
the discovery of a new compound with antibacterial activity, halicin, through 
the use of a neural network machine learning method. A robust ability to 
identify new active chemotypes through computational methods would be very 
useful. In this study, we have used the Stokes et al. dataset to compare the 
performance of this method to two other approaches, Mapping of Activity Through 
Dichotomic Scores (MADS) by Todeschini et al. (J Chemom 32(4):e2994, 2018) and 
Random Matrix Theory (RMT) by Lee et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 116(9):3373-3378, 
2019). Our results demonstrate that all three methods are capable of predicting 
halicin as an active antibacterial compound, but that this result is dependent 
on the dataset composition, pre-processing and the molecular fingerprint used. 
We have further assessed overall performance as determined by several 
performance metrics. We also investigated the scaffold hopping potential of the 
methods by modifying the dataset by removal of the β-lactam and fluoroquinolone 
chemotypes. MADS and RMT are able to identify actives in the test set that 
contained these substructures. This ability arises because of high scoring 
fragments of the withheld chemotypes that are in common with other active 
antibiotic classes. Interestingly, MADS is relatively better compared to the 
other two methods based on general predictive performance."
716,"PURPOSE: Existing biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk 
prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors 
for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.
METHODS: An animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR 
technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA 
sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of 
different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were 
subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes 
involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological 
function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and 
apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.
RESULTS: We identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis 
and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. 
Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes 
(RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was 
constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural 
network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified 
patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better 
prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction 
model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA 
successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated 
apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and 
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for 
metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications."
717,"OBJECTIVE: Considering the chemical and structural properties of dentin, this 
study was aimed at evaluating the effect of dentin matrix alone or combined with 
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) on postextraction alveolar bone regeneration.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Wistar rats were subjected to tooth extraction with 
osteotomy and allocated into groups according to the graft inserted: (1) 
Gelita-Spon®, (2) Bio-Oss®, (3) Dentin, (4) MSC, (5) Dentin/MSC, and (6) 
Control. Maxillae were analyzed by means of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 
staining, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, microcomputed tomography 
(micro-CT), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Serum levels of calcium and 
phosphorus were quantified.
RESULTS: The Bio-Oss group showed less bone than Gelita-Spon and Dentin/MSC; no 
other significant differences were seen in H&E analysis. The Bio-Oss group 
showed higher expression of collagen type I compared to the Dentin and 
Dentin/MSC groups and also higher osteocalcin expression than the Dentin/MSC 
group. There was a tendency of higher expression of osteopontin in the MSC, 
Dentin, and Dentin/MSC groups and higher VEGF in the MSC group. On micro-CT 
analysis, the Bio-Oss and the Dentin/MSC groups exhibited greater bone volume 
than the Control. Serum calcium and phosphorus levels did not significantly 
differ between the groups. SEM analysis depicted particles of Bio-Oss and dentin 
in the respective groups, as well as significant cellularity in the MSC group.
CONCLUSION: Autogenous nondemineralized dentin is an alternative for alveolar 
bone grafting, which can be improved by combination with MSC.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This work provides support for the clinical applicability of 
dentin graft alone or combined with MSC."
718,"Deep space flight missions will expose astronauts to multiple stressors, 
including sleep fragmentation and space radiation. There is debate over whether 
sleep disruptions are an issue in deep space. While these stressors 
independently impair sensorimotor function, the combined effects on performance 
are currently unknown. String-pulling behavior involves highly organized 
bimanual reach-to-grasp and withdraw movements. This behavior was examined under 
rested wakeful conditions and immediately following one session of sleep 
fragmentation in Sham and irradiated rats 3 months after exposure (10 cGy 
4Helium or 5-ion simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation). Sleep fragmentation 
disrupted several aspects of string-pulling behavior, such that rats' ability to 
grasp the string was reduced, reach endpoint concentration was more variable, 
and distance traveled by the nose increased in the Y-range compared to rested 
wakeful performance. Overall, irradiated rats missed the string more than Sham 
rats 3 months post-exposure. Irradiated rats also exhibited differential 
impairments at 3 months, with additional deficits unveiled after sleep 
fragmentation. 4Helium-exposed rats took longer to approach the string after 
sleep fragmentation. Further, rats exposed to 4Helium traveled shorter withdraw 
distances 3 months after irradiation, while this only emerged in the other 
irradiated group after sleep fragmentation. These findings identify sleep 
fragmentation as a risk for fine motor dysfunction in Sham and irradiated 
conditions, in addition to radiation exposure. There may be complex temporal 
alterations in performance that are stressor- and ion-dependent. Thus, it is 
critical to implement appropriate models of multi-flight stressors and 
performance assessments in preparation for future deep space flight missions."
719,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-enclosed nanoparticles that 
deliver bioactive proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other small molecules 
from donor to recipient cells. They have attracted significant interest recently 
due to their important roles in regulating plant-microbe interaction. During 
microbial infection, plant EVs play a prominent role in defense by delivering 
small regulatory RNA into pathogens, resulting in the silencing of pathogen 
virulence genes. Pathogens also deliver small RNAs into plant cells to silence 
host immunity genes. Recent evidence indicates that microbial EVs may be 
involved in pathogenesis and host immunity modulation by transporting RNAs and 
other biomolecules. However, the biogenesis and function of microbial EVs in 
plant-microbe interaction remain ill-defined. In this review, we discuss various 
aspects of microbial EVs, with a particular focus on current methods for EV 
isolation, composition, biogenesis, and their roles in plant-microbe 
interaction. We also discussed the potential role of microbial EVs in 
cross-kingdom RNA trafﬁcking from pathogens to plants, as it is a highly likely 
possibility to explore in the future."
720,"The genes encoding the phosphate uptake system in Xanthomonas citri pv. glycines 
12-2 were previously found to be upregulated when in soybean leaves. This study 
thus explored the role of the phosphate uptake system on its virulence to 
soybean. While phoB and pstSCAB mutants were greatly impaired in both inciting 
disease symptoms and growth in soybean, the virulence and growth in soybean of a 
phoU mutant was not reduced when compared with the wildtype strain. The 
expression of phoB and pstSCAB was highly induced in phosphate-deficient media. 
In addition, the expression of phoB, assessed with a fusion to a promoterless 
ice nucleation reporter gene, was greatly increased in soybean leaves, 
confirming that the soybean apoplast is a phosphorus-limited habitat for X. 
citri pv. glycines. Global gene expression profiles of phoB and phoU mutants of 
X. citri pv. glycines conducted under phosphate limitation conditions in vitro 
using RNA-seq revealed that PhoB positively regulated genes involved in signal 
transduction, the xcs cluster type II secretion system, cell motility, and 
chemotaxis, while negatively regulating cell wall and membrane biogenesis, DNA 
replication / recombination and repair, and several genes with unknown function. 
PhoU also positively regulated the same genes involved in cell motility and 
chemotaxis. The severity of bacterial pustule disease was decreased in soybean 
plants grown under high phosphate fertilization conditions, demonstrating that 
high phosphate availability in soybean plants can affect infection by X. citri 
pv. glycines by modulation of the expression of phosphate uptake systems."
721,"Cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet increased bioenergetic 
demands. Studies in cells and mice have highlighted the importance of oxidative 
metabolism and lipogenesis in prostate cancer, however, the metabolic landscape 
of human prostate cancer remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we 
performed radiometric (14C) and stable (13C) isotope tracing assays in 
precision-cut slices of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Glucose, glutamine, 
and fatty acid oxidation was variably upregulated in malignant PDXs compared to 
benign PDXs. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) and storage of free fatty acids into 
phospholipids and triacylglycerols were increased in malignant PDXs. There was 
no difference in substrate utilization between localized and metastatic PDXs and 
hierarchical clustering revealed marked metabolic heterogeneity across all PDXs. 
Mechanistically, glucose utilization was mediated by acetyl-CoA production 
rather than carboxylation of pyruvate, while glutamine entered the TCA cycle 
through transaminase reactions before being utilized via oxidative or reductive 
pathways. Blocking fatty acid uptake or fatty acid oxidation with 
pharmacological inhibitors was sufficient to reduce cell viability in 
PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs), whereas blockade of DNL, or glucose or glutamine 
oxidation induced variable and limited therapeutic efficacy. These findings 
demonstrate that human prostate cancer, irrespective of disease stage, can 
effectively utilize all metabolic substrates, albeit with marked heterogeneity 
across tumors. We also confirm that fatty acid uptake and oxidation are 
targetable metabolic dependencies in human prostate cancer. Implications: 
Prostate cancer utilizes multiple substrates to fuel energy requirements, yet 
pharmacological targeting of fatty acid uptake and oxidation reveals metabolic 
dependencies in localised and metastatic tumors."
722,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of melanoma. 
However, the majority of patients have primary or acquired resistance to ICIs, 
limiting durable responses and patient survival. Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) 
signaling and the expression of IFNγ-stimulated genes correlate with either 
response or resistance to ICIs, in a context-dependent manner. While 
IFNγ-inducible immunostimulatory genes are required for response to ICIs, 
chronic IFNγ signaling induces the expression of immunosuppressive genes, 
promoting resistance to these therapies. Here, we show that high levels of ULK1 
correlate with poor survival in melanoma patients and overexpression of ULK1 in 
melanoma cells enhances IFNγ-induced expression of immunosuppressive genes, with 
minimal effects on the expression of immunostimulatory genes. In contrast, 
genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 reduces expression of IFNγ-induced 
immunosuppressive genes. ULK1 binds IRF1 in the nuclear compartment of melanoma 
cells, controlling its binding to the PD-L1 promoter region. Additionally, 
pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy further 
reduces melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Our data suggest that targeting ULK1 
represses IFNγ-dependent immunosuppression. These findings support the 
combination of ULK1 drug-targeted inhibition with ICIs for the treatment of 
melanoma patients to improve response rates and patient outcomes. Implications: 
This study identifies ULK1, activated downstream of IFNγ signaling, as a 
druggable target to overcome resistance mechanisms to ICI therapy in metastatic 
melanoma."
723,"System paclitaxel-based chemotherapy is the first-line treatment regimen of 
defense against breast cancer, but inherent or acquired chemotherapy resistance 
remains a major obstacle in breast cancer therapy. Elucidating the molecular 
mechanism of chemoresistance is essential to improve the outcome of patients 
with breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate that IFT20 is positively associated 
with shorter relapse-free survival in patients with system paclitaxel-based 
chemotherapy. High-expressed IFT20 in breast cancer cells increases resistance 
to cell death upon paclitaxel treatment; in contrast, IFT20 knockdown enhances 
apoptosis in breast cancer cells in response to paclitaxel. Mechanistically, 
IFT20 triggers β-arrestin-1 to bind with ASK1 and promotes the ubiquitination of 
ASK1 degradation, leading to attenuating ASK1 signaling and its downstream JNK 
cascades, which helps cells to escape from cell death during paclitaxel 
treatment. Our results reveal that IFT20 drives paclitaxel resistance through 
modulating ASK1 signaling and identifies IFT20 as a potential molecular 
biomarker for predicting the response to paclitaxel therapeutic in breast 
cancer. Implications: IFT20 drives paclitaxel resistance through modulating ASK1 
signaling and IFT20 may act as a potential molecular biomarker for predicting 
the response to paclitaxel therapeutic in breast cancer."
724,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most prevalent cell types 
within the tumor microenvironment (TME). While several physicochemical cues from 
the TME, including growth factors, cytokines, and ECM specificity, have been 
identified as essential factors for CAF activation, the precise mechanism of how 
the ECM architecture regulates CAF initiation remains elusive. Using a 
gelatin-based electrospun fiber mesh, we examined the effect of matrix fiber 
density on CAF activation induced by MCF-7 conditioned media (CM). A less dense 
(3D) gelatin mesh matrix facilitated better activation of dermal fibroblasts 
into a CAF-like phenotype in the CM than a highly dense (3D) gelatin mesh 
matrix. In addition, it was discovered that CAF activation on the less dense 
(LD) matrix is dependent on the cell size-related AKT/mTOR signaling cascade, 
accompanied by an increase in intracellular tension within the well-spread 
fibroblasts."
725,"PURPOSE: Clinical trials have demonstrated higher complete response (CR) rates 
in the immuno-oncology (IO)-based combination arms than in the tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI) arms in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). We 
aimed to characterize real-world patients who experienced CR to the contemporary 
first-line therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC), 
response-evaluable patients who received frontline IO-based combination therapy 
or TKI monotherapy were analyzed. Baseline characteristics of patients and 
post-landmark overall survival (OS) were compared based on best overall 
response, as per RECIST 1.1.
RESULTS: A total of 52 (4.6%) of 1126 and 223 (3.0%) of 7557 patients 
experienced CR to IO-based and TKI therapies, respectively (P=.005). An adjusted 
odds ratio for CR achieved by IO-based combination therapy (versus TKI 
monotherapy) was 1.56 (95% CI 1.11-2.17; P=.009). Among patients who experienced 
CR, the IO-based cohort had a higher proportion of non-clear cell histology 
(15.9% and 4.7%; P=.016), sarcomatoid dedifferentiation (29.8% and 13.5%; 
P=.014), and multiple sites of metastases (80.4% and 50.0%; P<.001) than the TKI 
cohort. CR was independently associated with post-landmark OS benefit in both 
the IO-based and TKI cohorts, giving respective adjusted hazard ratios of 0.17 
(95% CI 0.04-0.72; P=.016) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.21-0.38; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The CR rate was not as high in the real-world population as in the 
clinical trial population. Among those who experienced CR, several adverse 
clinicopathological features were more frequently observed in the IO-based 
cohort than in the TKI cohort. CR was an indicator of favourable OS."
726,"Protein film electrochemistry (PFE) has given unrivalled insight into the 
properties of redox proteins and many electron-transferring enzymes, allowing 
investigations of otherwise ill-defined or intractable topics such as unstable 
Fe-S centers and the catalytic bias of enzymes. Many enzymes have been 
established to be reversible electrocatalysts when attached to an electrode, and 
further investigations have revealed how unusual dependences of catalytic rates 
on electrode potential have stark similarities with electronics. A special case, 
the reversible electrochemistry of a photosynthetic enzyme, ferredoxin-NADP+ 
reductase (FNR), loaded at very high concentrations in the 3D nanopores of a 
conducting metal oxide layer, is leading to a new technology that brings PFE to 
myriad enzymes of other classes, the activities of which become controlled by 
the primary electron exchange. This extension is possible because FNR-based 
recycling of NADP(H) can be coupled to a dehydrogenase, and thence to other 
enzymes linked in tandem by the tight channelling of cofactors and intermediates 
within the nanopores of the material. The earlier interpretations of catalytic 
wave-shapes and various analogies with electronics are thus extended to initiate 
a field perhaps aptly named ""cascade-tronics"", in which the flow of reactions 
along an enzyme cascade is monitored and controlled through an electrochemical 
analyzer. Unlike in photosynthesis where FNR transduces electron transfer and 
hydride transfer through the unidirectional recycling of NADPH, the 
""electrochemical leaf"" (e-Leaf) can be used to drive reactions in both oxidizing 
and reducing directions. The e-Leaf offers a natural way to study how enzymes 
are affected by nanoconfinement and crowding, mimicking the physical conditions 
under which enzyme cascades operate in living cells. The reactions of the 
trapped enzymes, often at very high local concentration, are thus studied 
electrochemically, exploiting the potential domain to control rates and 
direction and the current-rate analogy to derive kinetic data. Localized NADP(H) 
recycling is very efficient, resulting in very high cofactor turnover numbers 
and new opportunities for controlling and exploiting biocatalysis."
727,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. 
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the first choice for treatment of CRC, but it cannot 
avoid the negative effects from local high glucose (Glu) in tumor. Recently, 
5-FU therapy has been combined with other treatment modalities for CRC 
synergistic therapy. Although these combination therapy strategies are more 
effective in cancer therapy, the toxicity side effects to the liver and cause 
metabolic acidosis still exist. Herein, we report an emerging amorphous 
honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped carbon (N/C) nanozyme with nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase and catalase (CAT) activity and cascade it with 
natural glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) to realize NAD+ regeneration and further 
hyperglycemia management. In this case, by the coupling of N/C nanozyme with 
natural GDH to form a N/C-GDH system, the electron transfer route can switch 
from Glu to a common but limited electron receptor, i.e., NAD+ to ubiquitous 
large amounts of oxygen, achieving the purpose of sustainable consumption of Glu 
under NAD+ circulation and regeneration, and importantly escaping the generation 
of toxic H2O2. The combination of the N/C-GDH system and 5-FU on CRC cells was 
investigated to assess their synergistic bioeffects. Notably, our results showed 
that the N/C-GDH system and 5-FU in combination significantly suppress the 
proliferation of human colon cancer cells (HCT-116) by reducing the sugar level 
and induced apoptosis compared with either material or drug used alone. This 
work expands the nanozymes in blood Glu management as well as the promising 
cancer cell inhibition and provides the possibility of nonmetallic nanomaterials 
in the realization of effective treatment of cancer."
728,"The homeostatic control of their environment is an essential task of living 
cells. It has been hypothesized that, when microenvironmental pH inhomogeneities 
are induced by high cellular metabolic activity, diffusing protons act as 
signaling molecules, driving the establishment of exchange networks sustained by 
the cell-to-cell shuttling of overflow products such as lactate. Despite their 
fundamental role, the extent and dynamics of such networks is largely unknown 
due to the lack of methods in single-cell flux analysis. In this study, we 
provide direct experimental characterization of such exchange networks. We 
devise a method to quantify single-cell fermentation fluxes over time by 
integrating high-resolution pH microenvironment sensing via ratiometric 
nanofibers with constraint-based inverse modeling. We apply our method to cell 
cultures with mixed populations of cancer cells and fibroblasts. We find that 
the proton trafficking underlying bulk acidification is strongly heterogeneous, 
with maximal single-cell fluxes exceeding typical values by up to 3 orders of 
magnitude. In addition, a crossover in time from a networked phase sustained by 
densely connected ""hubs"" (corresponding to cells with high activity) to a sparse 
phase dominated by isolated dipolar motifs (i.e., by pairwise cell-to-cell 
exchanges) is uncovered, which parallels the time course of bulk acidification. 
Our method addresses issues ranging from the homeostatic function of proton 
exchange to the metabolic coupling of cells with different energetic demands, 
allowing for real-time noninvasive single-cell metabolic flux analysis."
729,"Advanced therapies have transformed the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; 
however, many patients fail to respond, highlighting the need for therapies 
tailored to the underlying cell and molecular disease drivers. The 
first-in-class oral molecule ABX464 (obefazimod), which selectively up-regulates 
miR-124, has demonstrated its ability to be a well-tolerated treatment with 
rapid and sustained efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we 
provide evidence that ABX464 impacts the immune system in vitro, in murine model 
of IBD, as well as in patients with UC. In vitro, ABX464 treatment up-regulated 
miR-124 and led to decreases in proinflammatory cytokines including IL17 and 
IL6, and in the chemokine CCL2. Consistently, miR-124 expression was upregulated 
in the rectal biopsies and blood samples of UC patients and a parallel reduction 
in Th17 cells and IL17a levels was observed in serum samples. In a mouse model 
of induced intestinal inflammation with dextran sulfate sodium, ABX464 reversed 
the increases in multiple proinflammatory cytokines in the colon and the 
upregulation of IL17a secretion in the mesenteric lymph nodes. By up-regulating 
miR-124, ABX464 acts as ""a physiological brake"" of inflammation which may 
explain the efficacy of ABX464 with a favorable tolerability and safety profile 
in UC patients."
730,"Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is a nutritionally important fruit of high nutritive 
value, delicious in taste with an attractive aroma. Due to their antioxidant and 
therapeutic potential, mango fruits are receiving special attention in 
biochemical and pharmacognosy-based studies. Fruit quality determines consumer's 
acceptance, and hence, understanding the physiological, biochemical, and 
molecular basis of fruit development, maturity, ripening, and storage is 
essential. Transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and molecular genetic 
approaches have led to the identification of key genes, metabolites, protein 
candidates, and quantitative trait loci that are associated with enhanced mango 
fruit quality. The major pathways that determine the fruit quality include amino 
acid metabolism, plant hormone signaling, carbohydrate metabolism and transport, 
cell wall biosynthesis and degradation, flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis, 
and carotenoid metabolism. Expression of the polygalacturonase, cutin synthase, 
pectin methyl esterase, pectate lyase, β-galactosidase, and ethylene 
biosynthesis enzymes are related to mango fruit ripening, flavor, firmness, 
softening, and other quality processes, while genes involved in the MAPK 
signaling pathway, heat shock proteins, hormone signaling, and phenylpropanoid 
biosynthesis are associated with diseases. Metabolomics identified volatiles, 
organic acids, amino acids, and various other compounds that determine the 
characteristic flavor and aroma of the mango fruit. Molecular markers 
differentiate the mango cultivars based on their geographical origins. Genetic 
linkage maps and quantitative trait loci studies identified regions in the 
genome that are associated with economically important traits. The review 
summarizes the applications of omics techniques and their potential applications 
toward understanding mango fruit physiology and their usefulness in future mango 
breeding."
731,"BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a cutaneous tumor with a high 
tendency to metastasize, and a significant proportion of patients have 
metastases at first presentation. This study aims to determine the value of 
baseline ultrasound (US) and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (18 FDG-PET/CT) imaging in both patients with 
clinically localized MCC (Stage I/II) and patients who present with palpable 
lymph nodes (Stage III).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort included 135 MCC patients who underwent 
baseline US (with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)) and/or FDG-PET/CT 
imaging between 2015 and 2021.
RESULTS: Of the 104 patients with clinically localized disease, 48% were 
upstaged to Stage III and 3% to Stage IV by imaging or sentinel lymph node 
biopsy (SLNB). FDG-PET/CT imaging identified regional metastases in 23%, while 
US with FNAC identified regional metastases in 19%. SLNB was performed in 56 
patients, of whom 57% were upstaged to Stage III. Of the 31 patients who 
presented with palpable lymph nodes, 16% were upstaged to Stage IV by FDG-PET/CT 
imaging.
CONCLUSION: Baseline imaging frequently upstages Stage I/II MCC patients to 
Stage III, both by US and FDG-PET/CT, Stage IV disease is rarely identified. 
Patients who present with palpable nodes are frequently upstaged to Stage IV by 
FDG-PET/CT imaging."
732,"BACKGROUND: Compared to other sarcomas, myxoid liposarcoma (ML) is known to be 
radiosensitive, with improved oncologic outcomes. Although these tumors ""shrink"" 
following radiotherapy, there is a paucity of data examining the degree of 
radiosensitivity and oncologic outcome. The purpose of the study was to evaluate 
pre- and postradiotherapy tumor volume to determine if size reduction impacts 
outcome.
METHODS: We reviewed 62 patients with ML undergoing surgical resection combined 
with preoperative radiotherapy, with pre- and postradiotherapy MRI. This 
included 34 (55%) males, with a mean age of 47 ± 14 years. All tumors were deep 
to the fascia, and 12 (19%) patients had tumors with a >5% round-cell component.
RESULTS: The mean volume reduction was 54% ± 29%. Compared to patients with >25% 
volume reduction, patients with reduction ≤25% had worse 10-year disease 
specific survival (86% vs. 37%, p < 0.01), in addition to an increased risk of 
metastatic disease (HR 4.63, p < 0.01) and death due to disease (HR 4.52, 
p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Lack of volume reduction is a risk factor for metastatic disease and 
subsequent death due to disease in patients with extremity ML treated with 
combined preoperative radiotherapy and surgery. This data could be used to 
stratify patients for adjuvant therapies and follow-up intervals."
733,"Nanotechnology-based drug-free therapeutic systems utilizing external stimuli 
can avoid the inherent side effects of drugs and become an attractive 
therapeutic strategy. However, the cellular stress responses (CSR) are activated 
encounter with external stimuli, which greatly weaken the efficacy of the 
drug-free antitumor. Thus, we proposed a CSR regulation strategy and synthesized 
the glucose oxidase (GOx)-modified Cu3 BiS3 nanosheets (CBSG NSs) encapsulated 
by calcium carbonate (CBSG@CaCO3 ) as the novel drug-free nanoagent. The 
CBSG@CaCO3 not only cause external stimuli such as energy consumption and 
oxidative stress damage, but also can destroy the CSR mechanism to guarantee 
optimal efficacy of starvation-chemodynamic therapy. In tumor cells, the CaCO3 
shell layer of CBSG@CaCO3 is rapidly degraded, releasing the slowly degradable 
CBSG NSs with NIR-II photothermal propertie that accelerated the production of 
external stimuli under laser irradiation. Meanwhile, CaCO3 can block CSR to 
disrupt the adaptive viability of cancer cells by inhibiting expresstion of P27 
and NRF2. Importantly, the CSR regulation achieves selective treatment on tumor 
cells based on the difference in physiological conditions between cancer cells 
and normal cells. This drug-free cancer therapy with selectivity improves the 
problem of poor efficacy under the action of CSR, which offers a new avenue in 
the cancer-related disease treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

734,"OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive data synthesis of the clinical parameters that affect 
plasma EGFR mutation test results in non-small cell lung carcinoma is lacking. 
Although individual studies have suggested a variety of patient characteristics 
that can affect diagnostic accuracy, no unified conclusion has been reached.
METHODS: We analyzed 170 plasma EGFR mutation tests performed between 2015 and 
2021 at our institution and carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
identify clinical and imaging features that correlate with plasma EGFR mutation 
test sensitivity.
RESULTS: Data synthesis from 14 studies of 2,576 patients revealed that patients 
with stage IV disease had a significantly lower false-negative rate than those 
with stage I through III disease. For our institutional cohort, which consisted 
of 75 paired plasma and tissue tests that were assessable for diagnostic 
accuracy, the overall sensitivity was 70.59% (95% confidence interval, 
56.17%-82.51%). Patients who had distant metastases and more suspicious lymph 
nodes on imaging findings correlated with a low false-negative rate.
CONCLUSIONS: While interpreting plasma EGFR mutation results, extra caution 
should be exercised for patients with early-stage, localized disease to 
accommodate the possibility of false-negative results. These meta-analyses and 
clinical data may enable clinicians to make evidence-based judgments for 
individual patients."
735,"A 50-year-old ophthalmic technician was referred by her retina specialist for 
urgent consultation due to markedly elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) 
unresponsive to medical therapy. Her history included chronic polyarticular 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and chronic uveitis requiring ongoing topical 
steroid therapy. She had a sub-Tenon injection of Kenalog (triamcinolone) 18 
months prior to referral. Chronic topical anti-inflammatory therapy included 
nepafenac (Ilevro) and prednisolone acetate 2 times a day. Attempts to 
discontinue topical steroid resulted in worsening inflammation. The patient was 
referred when the IOP measured 44 mm Hg in the left eye despite aggressive 
medical therapy, including acetazolamide. The IOP improved slightly when 
loteprednol was substituted for prednisolone acetate. Current medications in the 
left eye include brimonidine 3 times a day, loteprednol 2 times a day, nepafenac 
2 times a day, and fixed combination latanoprost + netarsudil at bedtime. Her 
only medication in the right eye was travoprost. She is intolerant to 
dorzolamide. She was also taking acetazolamide 500 mg 2 times a day. She was not 
taking any anticoagulants. Past surgical history included cataract surgery in 
each eye. She has not had laser trabeculoplasty in either eye. Examination 
revealed uncorrected visual acuity of J1+ in the right eye (near) and 20/30 in 
the left eye (mini-monovision). There was no afferent pupillary defect. There 
was mild band keratopathy in each eye while the central cornea was clear in both 
eyes without keratic precipitates. Here angles were open to gonioscopy without 
peripheral anterior synechia. There was mild to moderate flare in each eye with 
trace cells. The IOP was 17 mm Hg in the right eye and 31 mm Hg in the left. 
Central corneal thickness measured 560 μm and 559 μm in the right and left eye 
respectively. There was a well-positioned intraocular lens within each capsule 
with a patent posterior capsulotomy. There was mild vitreous syneresis but no 
vitreous cell. The cup to disc ratio was 0.5 in each eye with a symmetrical 
neural rim. The retina was flat without macular edema. Visual field was normal 
in both eyes (Figures 1 and 2). Optical coherence tomography of retinal nerve

736,"The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in the retinal thickness and 
microvasculature based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) depending on 
baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 
bilateral pneumonia. The prospective study was carried out among 62 patients 
with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent ophthalmic examination after hospital 
discharge. They were divided into three groups depending on the oxygen 
saturation (SpO2) on admission: ≤90% (group 1), &gt;90% and ≤95% (group 2), and 
&gt;95% (group 3). The following parameters were assessed in the 
ophthalmological examination and correlated with the baseline SpO2: ganglion 
cell layer (GCL), the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in the macular area, RNFL 
in the peripapillary area, the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in superficial 
capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP), vessel density (VD) in 
SCP, in DCP, and in the choriocapillaris plexus (CC). Baseline saturation ≤90% 
in COVID-19 patients caused a decrease of VD in some areas of SCP and DCP and an 
increase in FAZ area in SCP and DCP. In the group of patients with SpO2 ≤ 90% 
statistically significant thinning of the retina in the inner superior ring 
(ISR) (p = 0.029), the inner temporal ring (ITR) (p = 0.34), the outer superior 
ring (OSR) (p = 0.012), and the outer temporal ring (OTR) (p= 0.004)] was 
observed. The statistically significant thickening of RNFL optic disc and 
thinning of RNFL retina in some macular areas in patients with SpO2 ≤ 90% were 
reported. The size of FAZ area in SCP and vessel density were significantly 
greater in some areas of SCP, DCP, and CC in patients with SpO2 ≤ 90% (p = 
0.025). Baseline oxygen saturation ≤90% has been found to influence the ocular 
parameters of OCT in COVID-19 patients. We noticed a widened FAZ zone in SCP and 
increased VD in some regions of the retina and choroid as a response to systemic 
hypoxia."
737,"Exosomes, as messengers of cell-to-cell communication, have many functional 
properties similar to those of their derived cells. Because they contain a large 
number of bioactive components that regulate recipient cell behavior, they are 
inanimate and do not require external maintenance or assistance. Various 
cell-derived exosomes are involved in many physiological processes of bone 
tissue repair. Hydrogels are widely used as scaffolding materials for bone 
tissue repair because their 3D network structure resembles the natural 
extracellular matrix. Moreover, their material properties and biological 
functions were adjustable. Exosomes can be delivered directly to the bone tissue 
damage site by hydrogel, and their duration of action in vivo can be prolonged 
by slow release. Therefore, the exosome-loaded hydrogel (Exo-Gel) system is a 
promising material for bone tissue engineering. In this study, we review the 
progress of the application of Exo-Gel in bone tissue repair and review the 
improvement strategies, problems, and research prospects of the current exosomes 
and hydrogels that have been applied to the Exo-Gel system for bone tissue 
repair. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
738,"Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a rare form of diabetes which 
affects between 1% and 5% of diagnosed diabetes cases. Clinical 
characterizations of MODY include onset of diabetes at an early age (before the 
age of 30), autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, impaired glucose-induced 
secretion of insulin, and hyperglycemia. Presently, 14 MODY subtypes have been 
identified. Within these subtypes are several mutations which contribute to the 
different MODY phenotypes. Despite the identification of these 14 subtypes, MODY 
is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus due to an overlap in 
clinical features, high cost and limited availability of genetic testing, and 
unfamiliarity with MODY outside of the medical profession. The primary aim of 
this review is to investigate the genetic characterization of the MODY subtypes. 
Additionally, this review will elucidate the link between the genetics, 
function, and clinical manifestations of MODY in each of the 14 subtypes. In 
providing this knowledge, we hope to assist in the accurate diagnosis of MODY 
patients and, subsequently, in ensuring they receive appropriate treatment."
739,"An ideal binder for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries should effectively 
inhibit volume effects, exhibit specific functional properties (e.g., 
self-repair capabilities and high ionic conductivity), and require low-cost, 
environmentally friendly mass production processes. This study adopts a 
synergistic strategy involving gradient (strong-weak) hydrogen bonding to 
construct a hard/soft polymer composite binder with self-healing abilities and 
high battery cell environments adaptability in LIBs. The meticulously designed 
3D network structure comprising continuous electron transport pathways buffers 
the mechanical stresses caused by changes in silicon volume and improves the 
overall stability of the solid electrolyte interphase film. The Si-based anode 
with a polymer composite binder (Si/PAA-UPy5% /PEO) achieves a reversible 
capacity of 1245 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, which is 6.6 times higher 
than that of Si/PAA anode. After 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 , a half-cell 
comprising Si/C anode with a polymer composite binder (Si/C/PAA-UPy5% /PEO) has 
a remaining specific capacity of 420 mAh g-1 and a capacity retention rate of 
79%. The corresponding full cell with a Li-based cathode (LiFePO4 
/Si/C/PAA-UPy5% /PEO) has an initial area capacity of 0.96 mAh cm-2 and retains 
an area capacity of 0.90 mAh cm-2 (capacity retention rate = 93%) after 100

740,"Clinical success of regenerative medicine for treating deep-tissue skin injuries 
depends on the availability of skin grafts. Though bioengineered constructs are 
tested clinically, lack of neovascularization provide only superficial healing. 
Thus constructs, which promotes wound healing and supports vascularization has 
gained priority in tissue engineering. In this study, 
chitosan-collagen-fibrinogen (CCF) scaffold was fabricated using freeze-drying 
method without using any chemical crosslinkers. CCF scaffolds proved 
cytocompatibility and faster healing in in vitro scratch assay of primary human 
adult dermal fibroblasts cells with progressively increasing vascular 
endothelial growth factor-A and reducing vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor 1 expressions. Skin regeneration evaluated on in vivo full thickness 
wound model confirmed faster remodeling with angiogenic signatures in CCF 
scaffold-implanted mice. Histopathological observations corroborated with 
stereo-zoom and SS-optical coherence tomography images of wound sites to prove 
the maturation of healing-bed, after 12 days of CCF implantation. Therefore, it 
is concluded that CCF scaffolds are promising for skin tissue regeneration and 
demonstrates pro-angiogenic potential."
741,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies have linked inflammation and oxidative stress with 
the pathogenesis of depression. Artesunate is a commonly used medication to 
treat malaria and has been shown to produce antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
immunomodulatory effects. However, its prophylactic effects on depression and 
depression-related brain pathology are unknown.
METHODS: In Experiment 1, using a PC12 cell line, we investigated whether 
artesunate can prevent hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 )-induced oxidative injury that 
mimics oxidative stress commonly observed in the depressed brain. Next, using 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of depression, we investigated 
whether artesunate can prevent behavioral deficits observed in the open field 
test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, sucrose preference test, forced swimming 
test, and tail suspension procedure.
RESULTS: We found that artesunate significantly prevented a H2 O2 -induced 
reduction in PC12 cell activity, suggesting its antioxidant potential. We also 
found that mice pretreated with artesunate (5, 15 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 
(i.p.) prior to the LPS (.8 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment showed fewer and less severe 
depression- and anxiety-like behaviors than the LPS-treated control mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that artesunate produces antioxidant effect, 
as well as antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Importantly, our findings 
first demonstrate that artesunate can prevent LPS-induced depression- and 
anxiety-like symptoms, strongly suggesting its prophylactic potential in the 
treatment of depression and, perhaps, other psychiatric disorders associated 
with inflammation and oxidative stress."
742,"Previous research has found that octacalcium phosphate (OCP) increases 
macrophage accumulation and alters the initial inflammatory response. However, 
the role of the immune response induced by OCP in osteogenesis remains unknown. 
This study investigated the behavior of macrophages and bone regeneration 
capacity during the early inflammatory stage of OCP-mediated osteogenesis. To 
assess the change in macrophage polarization and osteogenic capacity, we used a 
standardized rat defect model filled with OCP or calcium-deficient 
hydroxyapatite (CDHA)-a material obtained through the hydrolysis of the original 
OCP. OCP or CDHA granules were incubated with RAW264 cells for 5 days to 
investigate the effect of physicochemical characteristics on macrophage 
cytokine/chemokine expression in vitro. Our in vivo results show that due to the 
OCP implantation, macrophages in the rat tibial defect area tend to polarize to 
the M2 phenotype (anti-inflammatory) and inhibit the formation of the M1 
phenotype (pro-inflammatory). In comparison to CDHA, OCP exhibited superior bone 
regeneration potential due to its rapid promotion of cortical bone healing and 
stimulation of macrophage-related growth factors. Furthermore, our in vitro 
results have shown that OCP regulates the expression of macrophage chemokines 
over time. Compared to incubation with CDHA, incubation with OCP caused changes 
in the ionic microenvironment. These findings suggest that the OCP-mediated 
macrophage polarization and secretion profile not only regulate immune function 
but also positively affect osteogenesis."
743,"Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as an appealing source for 
surrogates to evaluate the disease status. Herein, we present a novel proteomic 
strategy to identify proteins and phosphoproteins from salivary EVs to 
distinguish oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients from healthy 
individuals and explore the feasibility to evaluate therapeutical outcomes. 
Bi-functionalized magnetic beads (BiMBs) with Ti (IV) ions and a lipid analog, 
1,2-Distearoyl-3-sn-glycerophosphoethanolamine (DSPE) are developed to 
efficiently isolate EVs from small volume of saliva. In the discovery stage, 
label-free proteomics and phosphoproteomics quantification showed 315 
upregulated proteins and 132 upregulated phosphoproteins in OSCC patients among 
more than 2,500 EV proteins and 1,000 EV phosphoproteins, respectively. We 
further applied targeted proteomics by coupling parallel reaction monitoring 
with parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (prm-PASEF) to measure panels of 
proteins and phosphoproteins from salivary EVs collected before and after 
surgical resection. A panel of 3 total proteins and 3 phosphoproteins, most of 
which have previously been associated with OSCC and other cancer types, show 
sensitive response to the therapy in individual patients. Our study presents a 
novel strategy to the discovery of effective biomarkers for non-invasive 
assessment of OSCC surgical outcomes with small amount of saliva. Significance 
Statement We reported here the first time to large-scale profile proteins and 
phosphoproteins in saliva extracellular vesicles (EVs) and demonstrate the 
feasibility of monitoring EV phosphoproteins to assess therapeutic outcomes with 
small amount of saliva. Salivary EVs were isolated by a novel bi-functionalized 
magnetic beads (BiMBs) with high efficiency and specificity, facilitating 
downstream proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses and longitudinal measurement 
of individual patients before and after oral surgery. This article is protected

744,"Aberrant vascular remodeling contributes to the progression of many 
aging-associated diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), where 
heterogeneous capillary density, endothelial transcriptional alterations and 
increased vascular permeability correlate with poor disease outcomes. Thus, 
identifying disease-driving mechanisms in the pulmonary vasculature may be a 
promising strategy to limit IPF progression. Here, we identified Ccn3 as an 
endothelial-derived factor that is upregulated in resolving but not in 
persistent lung fibrosis in mice, and whose function is critical for vascular 
homeostasis and repair. Loss and gain of function experiments were carried out 
to test the role of CCN3 in lung microvascular endothelial function in vitro 
through RNAi and addition of recombinant human CCN3 protein, respectively. 
Endothelial migration, permeability, proliferation, and in vitro angiogenesis 
were tested in cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells. Loss of CCN3 
in lung ECs resulted in transcriptional alterations along with impaired wound 
healing responses, in vitro angiogenesis, barrier integrity as well as increased 
pro-fibrotic activity through paracrine signals, whereas the addition of 
recombinant CCN3 augmented endothelial function. Altogether, our results 
demonstrate that the matricellular protein CCN3 plays an important role in lung 
endothelial function and could serve as a promising therapeutic target to 
facilitate vascular repair and promote lung fibrosis resolution."
745,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most devastating brain tumor and highly resistant to 
conventional chemotherapy. Herein, we introduce biomimetic nanosonosensitizer 
systems (MDNPs) combined with noninvasive ultrasound (US) actuation for 
orthotopic GBM-targeted delivery and sonodynamic-enhanced chemotherapy. MDNPs 
were fabricated with biodegradable and pH-sensitive polyglutamic acid (PGA) and 
the chemotherapeutic agent and sonosensitizer doxorubicin (DOX), camouflaged 
with human GBM U87 cell membranes. MDNPs presented homologous targeting 
accumulation and in vivo long-term circulation ability. They effectively passed 
through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under US assistance and reached the 
orthotopic GBM site. MDNPs exhibited controllable US-elicited sonodynamic effect 
by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS not only induced cancer cell 
apoptosis but also downregulated drug-resistance-related factors to disrupt 
chemoresistance and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy. The in vivo study of 
orthotopic GBM treatments further proved that MDNPs exhibited US-augmented 
synergistic antitumor efficacy and strongly prolonged the survival rate of mice. 
The use of low-dose DOX and the safety of US enabled repeated treatment (4 
times) without obvious cardiotoxicity. This effective and safe US-enhanced 
chemotherapy strategy with the advantages of noninvasive brain delivery and high 
drug sensitivity holds great promise for deep-seated and drug-resistant tumors."
746,"Water safety plans (WSPs) are intended to assure safe drinking water (DW). WSPs 
involve assessing and managing risks associated with microbial, chemical, 
physical and radiological hazards from the catchment to the consumer. Currently, 
chemical hazards in WSPs are assessed by targeted chemical analysis, but this 
approach fails to account for the mixture effects of the many chemicals 
potentially present in water supplies and omits the possible effects of 
non-targeted chemicals. Consequently, effect-based monitoring (EBM) using in 
vitro bioassays and well plate-based in vivo assays are proposed as a 
complementary tool to targeted chemical analysis to support risk analysis, risk 
management and water quality verification within the WSP framework. EBM is 
frequently applied to DW and surface water and can be utilised in all defined 
monitoring categories within the WSP framework (including 'system assessment', 
'validation', 'operational' and 'verification'). Examples of how EBM can be 
applied within the different WSP modules are provided, along with guidance on 
where to apply EBM and how frequently. Since this is a new area, guidance 
documents, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and decision-making frameworks 
are required for both bioassay operators and WSP teams to facilitate the 
integration of EBM into WSPs, with these resources being developed currently."
747,"Bacterial contamination of water and food is a grave health concern rendering 
humans quite vulnerable to disease(s), and proving, at times, fatal too. 
Exploration of the novel diagnostic tools is, accordingly, highly called for to 
ensure rapid detection of the pathogenic bacteria, particularly Escherichia 
coli. The current manuscript, accordingly, reports the use of 
silane-functionalized glass matrices and antibody-conjugated cadmium telluride 
(CdTe) quantum dots (QDs) for efficient detection of E. coli. Synthesis of QDs 
(size: 5.4-6.8 nm) using mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) stabilizer yielded stable 
photoluminescence (∼62%), corroborating superior fluorescent characteristics. A 
test sample, when added to antibody-conjugated matrices, followed by 
antibody-conjugated CdTe-MPA QDs, formed a pathogen-antibody QDs complex. The 
latter, during confocal microscopy, demonstrated rapid detection of the 
selectively captured pathogenic bacteria (10 microorganism cells/10 μL) with 
enhanced sensitivity and specificity. The work, overall, encompasses 
establishment and design of an innovative detection platform in microbial 
diagnostics for rapid capturing of pathogens in water and food samples."
748,"Mycotoxins, the most researched biological toxins, can contaminate food and 
feed, resulting in severe health implications for humans and animals. Physical, 
chemical, and biological techniques are used to mitigate mycotoxin 
contamination. The biotransformation method using whole microbial cells or 
isolated enzymes is the best choice to mitigate mycotoxins. Using specific 
enzymes may avoid the disadvantages of utilizing a full microbe, such as 
accidental harm to the product's organoleptic characteristics and hazardous 
safety features. Moreover, the degradation rates of the isolated enzymes are 
higher than those of the whole-cell reactions, and they are substrate-specific. 
Their specificity is comprehensive and is shown at the positional and/or chiral 
center in many circumstances. Currently, only a few enzymes of microbial origin 
are commercially available. Therefore, there is a need to identify more novel 
enzymes of microbial origin that can mitigate mycotoxins. In this review, we 
conducted an in-depth summary of the microbial enzymes involved in the 
biotransformation of mycotoxins."
749,"Cancer is the most prevalent disease of concern worldwide for several decades. 
Diverse therapeutic aspects are in applications to control this phenomenal 
disease and also for decennaries. Among many causes and consequences of cancer, 
senescence has gained much interest in recent times. Senescence, also termed 
aging, is the natural process that induces cancer in neighbouring cells through 
Senescence-Associated-Secretory Phenotypes (SASPs) production. As a cure or 
preventive measure of cancer progression, studies already light upon multiple 
proteins and their roles in associated pathways but the aspect of different 
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is emerging recently and is under extensive research. 
Different approaches toward controlling senescence and inhibiting senescent cell 
accumulation are other aspects of cancer procurement. Thus, the role of ncRNA 
molecules in senescence and aging is getting much more interest as an alternate 
therapy for cancer treatment. In this review, at first, the roles of different 
ncRNAs related to several cellular processes are described. Then we tried to 
highlight the roles of different non-coding RNAs in senescence-induced cancer 
formation that extends with increasing age and emphasized non-coding RNAs as a 
therapeutic target solely or in combination with small molecules where drugging 
of small molecules targeting these non-coding RNAs can control cancer 
development."
750,"High blood concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) provoke various 
metabolic disorders and are associated with mammary tissue injury and decreased 
milk production in dairy cows. Nuciferine, an alkaloid found in Nelumbo nucifera 
leaves, has great potential for correcting lipid metabolism derangements and 
lipotoxicity. In this study, we evaluated the lipotoxicity induced by excessive 
NEFA in bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) and investigated whether 
nuciferine alleviates NEFA-induced lipotoxicity and the underlying molecular 
mechanisms. We found that excessive NEFA (1.2 and 2.4 mM) induced lipid 
accumulation, apoptosis, and migration ability impairment in bMECs, whereas 
nuciferine could ameliorate these disarrangements, as indicated by decreasing 
triglyceride content, protein abundance of SREBP-1c, cytoplasmic cytochrome c, 
and cleaved caspase-3 and increasing protein abundance of PPARα and migration 
ability. Moreover, nuciferine could reverse NEFA-induced LKB1/AMPK signaling 
inhibition, and the protective effect of nuciferine on lipotoxicity caused by 
NEFA was abrogated by AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin. Furthermore, transfection 
with LKB1 siRNA (si-LKB1) largely abolished the activation effect of nuciferine 
on AMPK. Overall, nuciferine can protect bMECs from excessive NEFA-induced lipid 
accumulation, apoptosis, and impaired migration by activating LKB1/AMPK 
signaling pathway."
751,"NAD(P)H is a vital hydrogen donor and electron carrier involved in numerous 
biological processes. The development of small-molecule tools for intravital 
imaging of NAD(P)H is significant for further exploring their pathophysiological 
roles. Herein, we rationally designed a fluorescent probe NADH-R by a simple 
graft of pyridiniumylbutenenitrile on a 1-methylquinolinium moiety in the 
3-position. Benefited from the reduction of quinolinium by NAD(P)H, this probe 
releases the free push-pull fluorophore NADH-RH, allowing a turn-on red-emitting 
fluorescence response together with an ultralow detection limit of 12 nM. Under 
the assistance of the probe, we first monitored exogenous and endogenous 
generation of NAD(P)H in living cells, subsequently observed dynamic changes of 
NAD(P)H levels in living cells under different metabolic perturbations, and 
finally visualized the declined NAD(P)H levels in live mouse brain in a stroke 
model. Unexpectedly, the time-dependent colocalization experiment revealed that 
the probe reacts with mitochondrial NAD(P)H, followed by a shift of its reduced 
product NADH-RH from mitochondria to the nucleus, highlighting that NADH-RH is a 
novel nucleus-directed dye scaffold, which would facilitate the development of 
nucleus-targeting fluorescent probes and drugs."
752,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer mainly occurs in 
younger pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women and threatens their health. 
Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been considered as novel targets in 
endometrial cancer treatment. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effect of miRNA 
(miR)-196a-5p in estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer.
METHODS: 17β-estradiol (E2; 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 nM) was used to treat RL95-2, 
HEC-1B and ECC-1 cells followed by cell viability assessment using 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The level of 
miR-196a-5p was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We 
then transfected miR-196a-5p mimic/inhibitor and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) 
small interfering RNA (siRNA) into E2-treated cells. Apoptotic cells were 
measured by flow cytometry. Wound healing and Transwell assays were implemented 
to assess migration and invasion. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays 
were applied to confirm the interaction between miR-196a-5p and FOXO1. 
Immunoblotting determined the levels of FOXO1, Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase 3.
RESULTS: E2 promoted cell viability and miR-196a-5p expression in RL95-2 and 
ECC-1 cells. miR-196a-5p mimic enhanced cell viability, migration and invasion 
but suppressed apoptosis and FOXO1, whilst miR-196a-5p inhibitor blocked these 
processes. In addition, miR-196a-5p upregulated Bcl-2, but down regulated Bax 
and Caspase 3 expression, an effect that was reversed by miR-196a-5p inhibitor. 
We determined that miR-196a-5p targeted FOXO1, and that si-FOXO1 blocked the 
effects of miR-196a-5p inhibitor on viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion 
of E2-treated RL95-2 and ECC-1 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested potential diagnostic and therapeutic 
applications for miR-196a-5p and its FOXO1 target in patients suffering from 
estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer."
753,"The Warburg effect suggests that upregulated glycolysis arising from high 
glucose uptake in cancer cells might be accompanied with suppressed 
mitochondrial respiration. However, recent studies have shown that the 
mitochondrial temperature in cancer cells could be relatively higher than that 
in normal cells, suggesting hyperactive mitochondrial respiration in cancer 
cells. However, hot mitochondria have not been reported in patients with cancer. 
Here, near-infrared small-molecule fluorescent probes TRNs are rationally 
designed with two ethyl amino groups as the temperature-sensitive moiety. 
Afterward, a mitochondrial targeting group is installed via ether bonds on TRN-8 
to build MTN. To the best of our knowledge, MTN is the near-infrared probe with 
the highest sensitivity for mitochondrial temperature. Moreover, it also 
displays high photostability, wide linearity, and high specificity. Using MTN, 
we can monitor the ups and downs of mitochondrial temperature in cancer cells 
upon the perturbations of mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, we demonstrate 
that the mitochondrial temperature in surgically resected human tumors is 
relatively higher than that in paracancerous tissues. Our results indicate that 
relatively hot mitochondria may exist in tumors from patients. We envisage that 
our study provides critical evidence for revisiting the Warburg effect and 
cancer metabolism."
754,"Guaiazulene and related derivatives were famous for diverse biological 
activities. In an effort to discover new highly efficient candidate drugs 
derived from guaiazulene, four series of guaiazulene derivatives were designed, 
synthesized, and evaluated for antiproliferation, antiviral, anti-inflammatory 
and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signalling pathway 
agonist activities. Among them, two guaiazulene condensation derivatives showed 
selective cytotoxic activities towards K562 cell with IC50 values 5.21 µM and 
5.14 µM, respectively, accompanied by slight effects on normal cell viability. 
For the first time, one guaiazulene derivative from series I exhibited 
potent antiviral activity towards influenza A virus with IC50 of 17.5 µM. A 
guaiazulene-based chalcone showed higher anti-inflammatory activity than 
positive drug indomethacin with an inhibitory rate of 34.29% in zebrafish 
model in vivo. One guaiazulene-based flavonoid could strongly agitate 
PPARγ pathway at 20 µM, indicating the potential of guaiazulene 
derivatives to reduce obesity development and ameliorate hepatic steatosis. 
Preliminary in silico ADME studies predicted the excellent drug-likeness 
properties of bioactive guaiazulene derivatives."
755,"In this work, we design a bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator (BA-TENG) as a 
first-aid rescue for instant and robust wound sealing, and ultrasound-driven 
accelerated wound healing. This BA-TENG is fabricated with biocompatible 
materials, and integrates a flexible TENG as the top layer and bioadhesive as 
the bottom layer, resulting in effective electricity supply and strong 
sutureless sealing capability on wet tissues. When driven by ultrasound, BA-TENG 
can produce stable voltage of 1.50 V and current of 24.20 μA underwater. The ex 
vivo porcine colon organ models showed that BA-TENG sealed defects instantly (∼ 
5 s) with high interfacial toughness (∼ 150 J m-2 ), while the rat bleeding 
liver incision model confirmed that BA-TENG performed rapid wound closure and 
hemostasis, reducing the blood loss by 82%. When applied in living rats, BA-TENG 
not only sealed skin injuries immediately but also produced a strong electric 
field (E-field) of about 0.86 kV m-1 stimulated by ultrasound to accelerate skin 
wound healing significantly. The in vitro studies confirmed that these effects 
were attributed to the E-field-accelerated cell migration and proliferation. In 
addition, these TENG adhesives could be applied to not only wound treatment, 
nerve stimulation and regeneration, and charging batteries in implanted devices.

756,"In vitro-cultured oocytes are separated from the follicular microenvironment in 
vivo and are more vulnerable than in vivo oocytes to changes in the external 
environment. This vulnerability disrupts the homeostasis of the intracellular 
environment, affecting oocyte meiotic completion and subsequent embryonic 
developmental competence in vitro. Glycine, one of the main components of 
glutathione (GSH), plays an important role in the protection of porcine oocytes 
in vitro. However, the protective mechanism of glycine needs to be further 
clarified. Our results showed that glycine supplementation promoted cumulus cell 
expansion and oocyte maturation. Detection of oocyte development ability showed 
that glycine significantly increased the cleavage rate and blastocyst rate 
during in vitro fertilization (IVF). SMART-seq revealed that this effect was 
related to glycine-mediated regulation of cell membrane structure and function. 
Exogenous addition of glycine significantly increased the levels of the 
antioxidant GSH and the expression of antioxidant-related genes (glutathione 
peroxidase 4 (GPX4), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), superoxide 
dismutase 2 (SOD2) and mitochondrial solute carrier family 25, member 39 
(SLC25A39)), decreased the lipid peroxidation caused by reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and reduced the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) by enhancing the functions 
of mitochondria, peroxisomes and lipid droplets (LDs) and the levels of lipid 
metabolism-related factors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor 
coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ 
(PPARγ), sterol regulatory element binding factor 1 (SREBF1), autocrine motility 
factor receptor (AMFR), and ATP). These effects further reduced ferroptosis and 
maintained the normal structure and function of the cell membrane. Our results 
suggest that glycine plays an important role in oocyte maturation and later 
development by regulating ROS-induced lipid metabolism, thereby protecting 
against biomembrane damage."
757,"To maximize fuel cell performance, transport pathways for electrons, ions, and 
reactants should be connected well. This demands a well-constructed 
microstructure in the catalyst layer (CL). Herein we design and optimize a 
cathode CL for a direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC) using a perovskite oxide as the 
catalyst to reduce reliance on platinum group metals (PGMs). The effects of 
tailoring carbon, ionomer, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) content in cathode 
CLs (CCLs) were explored, and several DAFCs were tested. Using the same catalyst 
and operating conditions, the lowest maximum current density and peak power 
density obtained were 85.3 mA cm-2 and 5.92 mW cm-2, respectively, which 
substantially increased to 317 mA cm-2 and 30.1 mW cm-2 through proper carbon, 
ionomer, and PTFE optimization, illustrating the importance of an effective 
three-phase interface. The findings reveal that despite employment of an active 
catalyst for oxygen reduction at the cathode site, the true performance of the 
catalyst cannot be reflected unless it is supported by proper design of the CCL. 
The study also reveals that by optimizing the CCL, similar performances to those 
of Pt/C-based CCLs in literature can be obtained at a cost reduction."
758,"This study aimed to describe pronephros and mesonephros morphology during the 
embryonic development of Podocnemis expansa. Eggs were collected on an 
artificial beach at Balbina, Amazonas, Brazil, during the entire incubation 
period (mean of 59 days). The kidney-gonad complex was processed using light 
microscopy and the mesonephros using transmission electron microscopy. The 
pronephros was present for the first time on stage 4, composed of external 
glomeruli devoid of a capsule, protruding into the coelomic cavity, and 
internally composed of a capillary network. The pronephros degenerated after 
development stage 15. The first sign of the appearance of the mesonephros 
occurred around stage 8, indicated by the early formation of renal corpuscles. 
The mesonephros comprised an renal corpuscles, neck segment, proximal tubule, 
intermediate segment, distal tubule, collector tubule, and collector duct. 
Ultrastructural analysis of the mesonephros brush border was done in the 
proximal tubule, and the presence of cells with structural characters indicative 
of secretory activity was detected in the juxtatubular region. Renal corpuscles 
and proximal tubules were the main components that underwent morphological 
alterations during mesonephros degeneration. The pronephros is a transient 
kidney, and the mesonephros became the functional embryonic kidney in P. 
expansa. Mesonephros degeneration occurs in the cranial-caudal direction, and 
histologically, the degeneration is identified by changes in the morphology of 
the renal corpuscle and proximal tubule. However, the mesonephros is still 
present after hatching."
759,"Cherenkov radiation (CR) derived from the decay of diagnostic and therapeutic 
radionuclides is currently being studied by the scientific community to 
determine if these emissions can be harnessed for cancer detection and therapy. 
While Cherenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) has been studied in the preclinical 
and clinical settings, Cherenkov radiation-induced cancer therapy (CRICT) is a 
relatively new area of research that harnesses the emitted photons to kill 
cancer cells through free radical generation and DNA damage. Nanoparticles seem 
well suited for developing a theranostic platform that would allow researchers 
to visualize therapy delivery and also generate the reactive oxygen species 
necessary to kill cancer cells. Herein, we report the preparation of an 
89Zr-TiO2-MnO2 nanocomposite that incorporates transferrin onto the nanoparticle 
surface to enhance cancer cell growth inhibition. The incorporation of the 
positron emission tomography (PET) radioisotope 89Zr (half-life: 3.3 days) 
allowed for the detection of the nanoparticle using PET and for the creation of 
Cherenkov emissions that interacted with the nanoparticle surface to generate 
free radicals for therapy delivery. After preparation, these systems were 
observed to be stable in various media and provided excellent tumor growth 
control after being intratumorally injected into mice bearing CT-26 tumors. 
These results demonstrate that a therapeutically efficient CRICT platform can be 
generated using commercially available and affordable materials."
760,"BACKGROUND: The X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a DNA repair 
gene. Various studies have examined the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) susceptibility 
with contradictory results. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed 
to assess whether variants of this polymorphism increase the HNSCC risk or not.
RECENT FINDINGS: Thirty three studies consisting of 14282 subjects (6012 cases 
and 8270 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Variants of XRCC1 
Arg194Trp polymorphism were associated with increased HNSCC risk and the 
associations were significant based on heterozygous and dominant models 
(heterozygous model: OR = 1.182, 95%CI = 1.015-1.377, P = 0.032; homozygous

this polymorphism and HNSCC risk based on Asian ethnicity under dominant model, 
hospital control source under different genetic models, PCR-RFLP genotyping 
method under dominant model and oral cavity tumor site under heterozygous and 
dominant models.
OBJECTIVE: The X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a DNA repair 
gene. Various studies have examined the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) susceptibility 
with contradictory results. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed 
to assess whether variants of this polymorphism increase the HNSCC risk or not.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literatures published till April 2022 was 
conducted using Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library 
and Embase databases. The heterogeneity was assessed with the I-Square 
statistic. A random effects model or fixed effects model was used to analyze the 
data. Data were reported by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The p value was considered significant if p < .05.
RESULTS: Thirty three studies consisting of 14 282 subjects (6012 cases and 8270 
controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Variants of XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism were associated with increased HNSCC risk and the associations were 
significant based on heterozygous and dominant models (heterozygous model: 
OR = 1.182, 95%CI = 1.015-1.377, p = .032; homozygous model: OR = 1.274, 
95%CI = 0.940-1.727, p = .119; dominant model: OR = 1.194, 95%CI = 1.027-1.388, 
p = .021; recessive model: OR = 1.181, 95%CI = 0.885-1.576, p = .119). There 
were significant associations between variants of this polymorphism and HNSCC 
risk based on Asian ethnicity under dominant model, hospital control source 
under different genetic models, PCR-RFLP genotyping method under dominant model 
and oral cavity tumor site under heterozygous and dominant models.
CONCLUSION: Variants of XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism were significantly 
associated with increased risk of HNSCC development based on heterozygous and 
dominant genetic models."
761,"A series of novel substituted pyrazole-fused oleanolic acid derivative were 
synthesized and evaluated as selective α-glucosidase inhibitors. Among these 
analogs, compounds 4a-4f exhibited more potent inhibitory activities compared 
with their methyl ester derivatives, and standard drugs acarbose and miglitol as 
well. Besides, all these analogs exhibited good selectivity towards 
α-glucosidase over α-amylase. Analog 4d showed potent inhibitory activity 
against α-glucosidase (IC50 = 2.64 ± 0.13 μM), and greater selectivity towards 
α-glucosidase than α-amylase by ~33-fold. Inhibition kinetics showed that 
compound 4d was a non-competitive α-glucosidase inhibitor, which was consistent 
with the result of its simulation molecular docking. Moreover, the in vitro 
cytotoxicity of compounds 4a-4f towards hepatic LO2 and HepG2 cells was tested."
762,"The relatively quiet mutational landscape of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) suggests 
that epigenetic deregulation could be central to oncogenesis and tumour 
aggressiveness. Histone variants have long been recognised as important 
epigenetic regulators of gene expression. However, the role of histone variants 
in RMS has not been studied hitherto. In this study, we show that histone 
variant H3.3 is overexpressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), an aggressive 
subtype of RMS. Functionally, knockdown of H3F3A, which encodes for H3.3, 
significantly impairs the ability of ARMS cells to undertake migration and 
invasion and reduces Rho activation. In addition, a striking reduction in 
metastatic tumour burden and improved survival is apparent in vivo. Using 
RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing analyses, we identified Melanoma Cell 
Adhesion Molecule (MCAM/CD146) as a direct downstream target of H3.3. Loss of 
H3.3 resulted in a reduction in the presence of active marks, and an increase in 
the occupancy of H1 at the MCAM promoter. Cell migration and invasion were 
rescued in H3F3A-depleted cells through MCAM overexpression. Moreover, we 
identified G9a, a lysine methyltransferase encoded by EHMT2, as an upstream 
regulator of H3F3A. Therefore, this study identifies a novel H3.3 dependent axis 
involved in ARMS metastasis. These findings establish the potential of MCAM as a 
therapeutic target for high-risk ARMS patients. This article is protected by

763,"For stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a high risk of recurrence, 
intensified adjuvant chemotherapy can improve overall survival. We aimed to 
develop a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation marker model for predicting 
the relapse risk of stage III CRC patients. Differentially methylated markers 
identified between 53 normal mucosa samples and 165 CRC tissue samples, as well 
as between plasma samples from 75 stage I/II (early-stage) CRC patients and 55 
stage IV (late-stage) CRC patients, were analyzed using Student's t-tests. The 
overlapping methylation markers shared by plasma and tissue samples were used to 
establish a methylation marker model to evaluate the tumor burden in the 
peripheral blood of CRC patients by using the random forest method. This model 
was verified in the validation cohort (n= 44) and then applied to predict 
recurrence risk in 50 stage III CRC patients and monitor the clinical disease 
course in serial samples from 4 CRC patients. We built a five-marker-based ctDNA 
methylation model that had high sensitivity (84.21%) and specificity (84%) in 
identifying late-stage CRC in a validation cohort containing 24 stage I/II CRC 
patients and 20 stage IV CRC patients. The model achieved high sensitivity 
(87.5%) and specificity (94.12%) in predicting tumor relapse in an independent 
cohort of 50 stage III CRC patients and could be an independent recurrence risk 
factor for stage III patients (HR, 60.4; 95% CI: 7.68-397; P = 9.73e-5). 
Analysis of serial blood samples of CRC showed that the model could monitor 
disease relapse earlier than imaging examination and serum carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA) and so may provide an opportunity for the early adjustment of 
therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the model could potentially monitor the 
clinical course and treatment response dynamically. This article is protected by

764,"The present study examined the effects of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) 
on its adsorption capacity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). Moreover, the study evaluated 
the toxicity of MSNs with AFB1 using NIH3T3 cells and hemolysis test. The 
obtained MSNs were spherical, irregular-like in shape, having a mean size of 
39.97 ± 7.85 nm and a BET surface area of 1195 m2/g. At 0.1 mg mL-1 
concentration of MSN, the AFB1 adsorption capacity was 30%, which reached 70% 
when the MSN concentration increased to 2.0 mg mL-1. Our findings showed that 
AFB1 was adsorbed (∼67%) in the first few minutes on being in contact with MSNs, 
reaching an adsorption capacity of ∼70% after 15 min. Thereafter, the adsorption 
capacity remained constant in solution, demonstrating that the MSNs adsorbed 
toxins even beyond overnight. MSN treatment (0.5-2.0 mg mL-1) using NIH3T3 cells 
did not result in any reduction in cell viability. In addition, MSN treatment 
completely reversed the cytotoxic effect of AFB1 at all concentrations. 
Hemolysis test also revealed no hemolysis in MSNs evaluated alone and in those 
combined with AFB1. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to 
demonstrate that MSN can reduce cell toxicity produced by AFB1 due to its 
potential to adsorb mycotoxins."
765,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common histologic diagnosis among the 
aggressive lymphomas, accounting for 30% of all lymphomas. Human herpes virus 
8-negative effusion-based lymphoma (HHV8-negative EBL) is a rare form of 
lymphoma, under recognized and still not well characterized in the literature. 
In contrast to primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), HHV8-negative EBL is 
characterized by malignant effusion in essentially serous body cavity with no 
detectable contiguous tumor masses and is no associated with human 
immunodeficiency virus and HHV8 infections. The presence of comorbid medical 
conditions can hide this type of lymphoma and made diagnosis more challenging. 
Here, we describe a rare case of an 82-year-old male suffering from peritoneal

HHV8-negative EBL."
766,"Echinacoside (ECH) is the main compound of Cistanche deserticola, which

The present study investigated the protective effects of echinacoside on type 2

insulin-resistant LO2 cell model. The results demonstrated that ECH probably 
alleviated T2DM-induced injury by mediating the AKT pathway, which provided a

767,"The maintenance of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane is an 
integral aspect of photosynthesis that is mainly established by the splitting of 
water molecules in photosystem II and plastoquinol oxidation at the cytochrome 
complex, and it is necessary for the generation of ATP in the last step of 
photophosphorylation. Although environmental stresses, such as high 
temperatures, are known to disrupt this fundamental process, only a few studies 
have explored the molecular mechanisms underlying proton gradient regulation 
during stress. The present study identified a heat-sensitive mutant that 
displays aberrant photosynthesis at high temperatures. This mutation was mapped 
to AtFtsH11, which encodes an ATP-dependent AAA-family metalloprotease. We 
showed that AtFtsH11 localizes to the chloroplast inner envelope membrane and is 
capable of degrading the ATP synthase assembly factor BFA3 under heat stress. We 
posit that this function limits the amount of ATP synthase integrated into the 
thylakoid membrane to regulate proton efflux from the lumen to the stroma. Our 
data also suggest that AtFtsH11 is critical in stabilizing photosystem II and 
cytochrome complexes at high temperatures, and additional studies can further 
elucidate the specific molecular functions of this critical regulator of 
photosynthetic thermotolerance. This article is protected by copyright. All

768,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to protect against fatty 
liver diseases, but the mechanism is still not clear. Menstrual blood-derived 
endometrial stem cells (MenSCs) are a substantial population of MSCs that can be 
obtained in a noninvasive manner. In the present study, we investigated the 
therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of MenSC transplantation in mouse 
models of diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The results 
revealed that MenSCs markedly promoted hepatic glycogen storage and attenuated 
lipid accumulation after transplantation. We further identified Rnf186 as a 
novel regulator involved in MenSC-based therapy for NAFLD mice. Rnf186 
deficiency substantially inhibited high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and 
abnormal hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in mice. Mechanistically, Rnf186 
regulated glucose and lipid metabolism through the AMPK-mTOR pathway. More 
importantly, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is identified as the key functional 
cytokine secreted by MenSCs and decreases the expression of hepatic Rnf186. HGF 
deficient MenSCs can't attenuate glucose and lipid accumulation after 
transplantation in NAFLD mice. Collectively, our results provide preliminary 
evidence for the protective roles of HGF secreted by MenSCs in fatty liver 
diseases through downregulation of hepatic Rnf186 and suggest that MenSCs or 
Rnf186 may be an alternative therapeutic approach/target for the treatment of 
NAFLD."
769,"Tissue engineering uses cells and biomaterials to develop bioartificial tissue 
substitutes for different purposes. For example, although several skin models 
have been developed for pharmaceutical and cosmetic research and skin wound 
healing, there are few studies on 3D cultures of keratinocytes in 3D printed 
scaffolds. So, this work aimed to develop a 3D-printed hydrogel scaffold to 
promote human keratinocyte growth. Mesh 3D scaffolds were printed using an 
extrusion-based method with a 20% gelatin/5% alginate hydrogel, where HaCaT 
cells were cultured for 7 days. Scaffolds kept their structure for over 1 week, 
and their stiffness only decreased after 7 days, showing good mechanical and 
structural characteristics and biodegradability (27% weight lost). Viable 
keratinocytes (MTT assay) are aggregated into spheroids, a 3D model capable of 
mimicking in vivo cell properties and phenotypes. Spheroids were formed on 47% 
of scaffolds pores and grew over time, showing promising cell proliferation. 
F-actin staining showed cells' irregular and interconnected shapes and 
organization over time. This method offers an easy and inexpensive solution for 
keratinocyte spheroid formation, which may be helpful in tissue engineering as a 
cell delivery system, for pharmacological or basic research, or wound healing 
medical applications."
770,"Elevated expression of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) contributes to the malignant 
tumor progression in multiple cancers. However, the role of LOXL2 in the 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. 
This study aimed to explore the effects of LOXL2 on 5-FU sensitivity in CRC. The 
mRNA and protein levels of LOXL2 were explored in public databases by 
bioinformatics, validated in clinical tissues using immunohistochemistry, and 
detected in 5-FU treated cell lines. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) 
values were quantified based on the cell viability at different concentrations 
of 5-FU with CCK-8 assays. Colony formation and flow cytometry assays were 
performed to measure the proliferation and apoptosis rates. Gene set enrichment 
and correlation analyses were conducted to identify the probable mechanism of 
LOXL2 in TCGA samples. Critical molecules of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and 
anti-apoptotic BCL2 in protein levels were detected with Western blotting. It 
concluded that LOXL2 was up-regulated and positively linked to the unfavorable 
prognosis of CRC patients. The LOXL2 expression increased with the rising 5-FU 
concentrations, especially at 20 and 40 μM. Elevated LOXL2 promoted the 
resistance to 5-FU, augmented the proliferation, and inhibited 5-FU-induced 
apoptosis of CRC cells. LOXL2 activated the Hedgehog signaling pathway by 
promoting the expression of SMO, GLI1, and GLI2, leading to the upregulation of 
downstream target gene BCL2 in CRC cells. Moreover, the Hedgehog signaling 
pathway inhibitor cyclopamine blocked the BCL2 upregulation mediated by LOXL2. 
This study has demonstrated that LOXL2 can reduce 5-FU sensitivity through the 
Hedgehog/BCL2 signaling pathway in CRC."
771,"Autophagy plays works by degrading misfolded proteins and dysfunctional 
organelles and maintains intracellular homeostasis. Apelin-13 has been 
investigated as an agent that might protect the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from 
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this study, we examined whether 
apelin-13 protects cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, important 
components of the BBB, from I/R injury by regulating autophagy. To mimic I/R 
injury, the mouse cerebral microvascular endothelia l cell line bEnd 3 undergoes 
the process of oxygen and glucose deprivation and re feeding in the process of 
culture. Cell viability was detected using a commercial kit, and cell migration 
was monitored by in vitro scratch assay. The tight junction (TJ) proteins ZO-1 
and occludin; the autophagy markers LC3 II, beclin 1, and p62; and components of 
the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway were detected by Western blotting and 
immunofluorescence. To confirm the role of autophagy in OGD/R and the protective 
effect of apelin-13, we treated the cells with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a 
pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Our results demonstrated that OGD/R 
increased autophagic activity but decreased viability, abundance of TJs, and 
migration. Viability and TJ abundance were further reduced when the OGD/R group 
was treated with 3-MA. These results indicated that bEnd.3 upregulates autophagy 
to ameliorate the effects of OGD/R injury on viability and TJs, but that the 
autophagy induced by OGD/R alone is not sufficient to protect against the effect 
on cell migration. Treatment of OGD/R samples with apelin-13 markedly increased 
viability, TJ abundance, and migration, as well as autophagic activity, whereas 
3-MA inhibited this increase, suggesting that apelin-13 exerted its protective 
effects by upregulating autophagy."
772,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Melasma is a refractory skin disease due to its 
complex pathogenesis and difficult treatment. Studies have found that human 
umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUCMSC-Exos) could serve 
as a novel cell-free therapeutic strategy in regenerative and esthetic medicine. 
It could potentially treat melasma, but the skin barrier is a challenge. In this 
study, we aim to explore the safety and efficacy of hUCMSC-Exos in the treatment 
of melasma and the means to promote its percutaneous penetration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the animal study about the effect of penetration, 
percutaneous penetration of PKH67-labeled hUCMSC-Exos was studied under 
microneedles, 1565 nm nonablative fractional laser (NAFL), and a plasma named 
Peninsula Blue Aurora Shumin Master (PBASM) treatments, observed by confocal 
laser scanning microscopy. In the clinical application study, 60 patients with 
melasma treated in our department were divided into four groups. NAFL combined 
with normal saline treatment was used for Group A. Microneedles, NAFL, and PBASM 
combined with hUCMSC-Exos treatments were used for Groups B, C, and D, 
respectively. Each patient received four treatments at 1-month intervals. 
Assessments were done using the degree of pain posttreatment, melasma area and 
severity score, improvement rate, physician global assessment score, 
satisfaction, and complications.
RESULTS: In the animal study about the effect of penetration, hUCMSC-Exos can 
penetrate the deep dermis under microneedles, NAFL, and PBASM treatments. In the 
clinical application study, compared with Group A, Groups B, C, and D showed 
significantly improved therapeutic effect and patient satisfaction (p < 0.05), 
and there was no significant difference among Groups B, C, and D.(p > 0.05). 
Patients in Group B reported higher pain levels than those in the other three 
groups (p < 0.05); the treatment experience of patients in Group D was better.
CONCLUSION: hUCMSC-Exos can improve the symptoms of melasma safely and 
effectively. Compared with microneedles, NAFL and PBASM can also achieve a good 
effect toward promoting penetration. These findings are worthy of exploration 
and clinical application."
773,"BACKGROUND: A neurodevelopmental disease, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurs 
in males three times more commonly than girls. Higher prenatal testosterone 
exposure may result in autistic-like behaviour in boys, according to earlier 
research. It is unclear how fetal testosterone affects the development of 
autism. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal testosterone 
exposure in an animal model may result in autistic behaviors by modifying 
seratonin, dopamine, IGF-1, and oxytocin levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Group 1 (control, n = 6) and Group 2 (testosterone 
undecanoate, n = 6) of female rats were randomly assigned. For two to three days 
during the oestrus cycle, female rats were housed with a reproductive male 
(three females/one male). On the tenth day of gestation, rats in Group 1 
received 1 ml/kg% 0.9 NaCl saline whereas rats in Group 2 received 250 mg/kg 
testosterone undecanoate. Until weaning on postnatal day 21 (P21), the mothers 
were permitted to care for their pups. On P21, 40 littermates-10 male and female 
for control, 10 male and female from mothers that exposed to testosterone-were 
arbitrarily split up and housed. On P50, these mature rats were tested for their 
behavior. The rats were then sacrificed. The brain tissue was subjected to 
histological examinations as well as biochemical tests for homovanillic acid 
(HVA), 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), oxytocin and Insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1).
RESULTS: The groups differed significantly in the behavioral examinations 
(three-chamber social test, passive avoidance learning analysis, open field 
test), with the testosterone-exposed groups exhibiting autistic symptoms to a 
higher extent. When compared to the control groups, testosterone exposure caused 
significant histological changes in the hippocampus CA1 and CA3 areas, including 
gliosis and cell death of neurons. In the testosterone-exposed groups, HVA, 
5-HIAA and IGF-1 tissue expressions in the brain elevated whereas oxytocin 
levels reduced. These findings point to a potential connection between 
neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD and exposure to testosterone during 
gestation.
CONCLUSION: Overall, we revealed that prenatal testosterone exposure led to 
autistic traits by elevating seratonin, dopamine, and IGF-1 levels while 
lowering oxytocin levels."
774,"Evidence points to the indispensable function of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in 
normal lung development and tissue homeostasis. However, the importance of AMs 
in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been elucidated. Here, we identified 
a significant role of abnormal AM proliferation and polarization in alveolar 
dysplasia during BPD, which is closely related to the activation of the 
IL-33-ST2 pathway. Compared with the control BPD group, AMs depletion partially 
abolished the epithelialmesenchymal transition process of AECII and alleviated 
pulmonary differentiation arrest. In addition, IL-33 or ST2 knockdown has 
protective effects against lung injury after hyperoxia, which is associated with 
reduced AM polarization and proliferation. The protective effect disappeared 
following reconstitution of AMs in injured IL-33 knockdown mice, and the 
differentiation of lung epithelium was blocked again. In conclusion, the 
IL-33-ST2 pathway regulates AECII transdifferentiation by targeting AMs 
proliferation and polarization in BPD, which shows a novel strategy for 
manipulating the IL-33-ST2-AMs axis for the diagnosis and intervention of BPD."
775,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived liver organoids serve as 
models of organogenesis, disease, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. 
Prevailing methods for generating organoids rely on Matrigel, whose 
batch-to-batch variability and xenogeneic source pose challenges to mechanistic 
research and translation to human clinical therapy. In this report, we 
demonstrate that self-assembled Matrigel-free iPSC-derived organoids developed 
in rotating wall vessels (RWVs) exhibit greater hepatocyte-specific functions 
than organoids formed on Matrigel. We show that RWVs produce highly-functional 
liver organoids in part by eliminating the need for Matrigel, which has adverse 
effects on hepatic lineage differentiation. RWV liver organoids sustain durable 
function over long-term culture and express a range of mature functional genes 
at levels comparable to adult human liver, while retaining some fetal features. 
Our results indicate that RWVs provide a simple and high-throughput way to 
generate Matrigel-free liver organoids suitable for research and clinical 
applications."
776,"The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1 is widely expressed in cells within and outside 
the brain. However, our understanding of its roles in brain functions throughout 
development, as well as in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, has been 
severely hindered by the lack of reliable data on its developmental and 
(sub)cellular expression patterns. We provide here the first properly controlled 
analysis of NKCC1 protein expression in various cell types of the mouse brain 
using custom-made antibodies and an NKCC1 knock-out validated 
immunohistochemical procedure, with parallel data based on advanced mRNA 
approaches. NKCC1 protein and mRNA are expressed at remarkably high levels in 
oligodendrocytes. In immature neurons, NKCC1 protein was located in the somata, 
whereas in adult neurons, only NKCC1 mRNA could be clearly detected. NKCC1 
immunoreactivity is also seen in microglia, astrocytes, developing pericytes, 
and in progenitor cells of the dentate gyrus. Finally, a differential expression 
of NKCC1 splice variants was observed, with NKCC1a predominating in non-neuronal 
cells and NKCC1b in neurons. Taken together, our data provide a cellular basis 
for understanding NKCC1 functions in the brain and enable the identification of 
major limitations and promises in the development of neuron-targeting 
NKCC1-blockers."
777,"Nav 1.5 sodium channels contribute to the generation of the rapid upstroke of 
the myocardial action potential and thereby play a central role in the 
excitability of myocardial cells. At present, the patch clamp method is the gold 
standard for ion channel inhibitor screening. However, this method has 
disadvantages such as high technical difficulty, high cost and low speed. In 
this study, novel machine learning models to screen chemical blockers were 
developed to overcome the above shortage. The data from the ChEMBL Database were 
employed to establish the machine learning models. Firstly, six molecular 
fingerprints together with five machine learning algorithms were used to develop 
30 classification models to predict effective inhibitors. A validation and a 
test set were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Subsequently, the 
privileged substructures tightly associated with the inhibition of the Nav 1.5 
ion channel were extracted using the bioalerts Python package. In the validation 
set, the RF-Graph model performed best. Similarly, RF-Graph produced the best 
result in the test set in which the Prediction Accuracy (Q) was 0.9309 and 
Matthew's correlation coefficient was 0.8627, further indicating the model had 
high classification ability. The results of the privileged substructures 
indicated Sulfa structures and fragments with large Steric hindrance tend to 
block Nav 1.5. In the unsupervised learning task of identifying sulfa drugs, 
MACCS and Graph fingerprints had good results. In summary, effective machine 
learning models have been constructed which help to screen potential inhibitors 
of the Nav 1.5 ion channel and key privileged substructures with high affinity 
were also extracted."
778,"Since the report of the first COVID-19 case in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 variants of 
concern (VOCs) have continued to emerge, manifesting diverse infectivity, 
evasion of host immunity and pathology. While ACE2 is the predominant receptor 
of SARS-CoV-2, TMPRSS2, Kim-1, NRP-1, CD147, furin, CD209L and CD26 have also 
been implicated as viral entry-related cofactors. To understand the variations 
in infectivity and pathogenesis of VOCs, we conducted infection analysis in 
human cells from different organ systems using pseudoviruses of VOCs including 
Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Recombinant spike S1, RBD, ACE2, Kim-1 and NRP-1 
proteins were tested for their ability to block infection to dissect their roles 
in SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Compared with wild type SARS-CoV-2 (WT), 
numerous VOCs had significant increases of infectivity across a wide spectrum of 
cell types. Recombinant ACE2 protein more effectively inhibited the infection of 
VOCs including Delta and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) than that of WT. Interestingly, 
recombinant S1, RBD, Kim-1 and NRP-1 proteins inhibited the infection of all 
pseudoviruses in a manner dependent on the levels of ACE2 expression in 
different cell types. These results provide insights into the diverse 
infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, which might be helpful for managing the 
emergence of new VOCs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

779,"Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the deadliest and frequently diagnosed 
metastatic cancers worldwide. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the cell population 
within the tumor niche, having an epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition 
phenotype, high self-renewal, vigorous metastatic capacity, drug resistance, and 
tumor relapse. Identification of targets for induction of apoptosis is essential 
to provide novel therapeutic approaches in BC. Our earlier studies showed that 
Vitamin C induces apoptotic cell death by losing redox balance in TNBC CSCs. In 
this study, we have attempted to identify previously unrecognized CSC survival 
factors that can be used as druggable targets for bCSCs apoptosis regulators 
isolated from the TNBC line, MDA MB 468. After a thorough literature review, 
Oct-4 was identified as the most promising marker for its unique abundance in 
cancer and absence in normal cells and the contribution of Oct-4 to the 
sustenance of cancer cells. We then validated a very high expression of Oct-4 in 
the MDA MB 468 bCSCs population using flow-cytometry. The loss of Oct-4 was 
carried out using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown in the bCSCs, 
followed by assessing for cellular apoptosis. Our results indicated that Oct-4 
knockdown induced cell death, changes in cellular morphology, inhibited 
mammosphere formation, and positive for Annexin-V expression, thereby indicating 
the role of Oct-4 in bCSC survival. Moreover, our findings also suggest the 
direct interaction between Oct-4 and Vitamin C using in silico docking. This 
data, hence, contributes towards novel information about Oct-4 highlighting this 
molecule as a novel survival factor in bCSCs."
780,"Sulfur mustard (SM) is a chemical warfare agent with well-known severe toxic 
effects and may cause long-term debilitating injuries. We aimed to evaluate 
aging and longevity in Iranian SM-exposed survivors using some endocrine and 
molecular biomarkers for the first time. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 
prolactin (PRL), cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) were 
measured in 289 male SM-veterans and 66 age-matched males using the ELISA 
method. Leukocyte Telomere Length (LTL) measurement and p16INK4a expression were 
measured in the peripheral blood leukocytes of 55 males who were exposed to SM. 
We found a significantly lower serum DHEAS level and higher serum PRL level in 
SM-exposed groups (without any related to the severity of lung injuries) 
compared to healthy controls, but no significant difference in serum levels of 
cortisol, testosterone, and LH. The molar ratio of DHEAS/cortisol was 
significantly higher in controls compared to the SM-exposed individuals 
especially those with severe lung damage. Some biological parameters of 
allostatic load score such as DHEAS and DHEAS/cortisol ratio significantly 
decreased long-term after the SM exposure. Additionally, we found that LTL was 
shorter in SM-exposed veterans rather than unexposed controls while p16INK4a 
gene expression significantly increased in these groups. It seems that DHEAS, 
DHEAS/cortisol ratio, LTL, and p16INK4a gene expression have changed 
significantly in favor of cellular senescence in SM-exposed patients. Therefore, 
it seems that SM exposure increases biological age compared to chronological age 
in SM-exposed survivors."
781,"The incidence of heart failure (HF) is generally preceded by cardiac hypertrophy 
(CH), which is the enlargement of cardiac myocytes in response to stress. During 
CH, the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA), which is present in the cell 
membrane phospholipids, is modulated. Metabolism of AA gives rise to 
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) via 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) ω-hydroxylases and CYP epoxygenases, respectively. A 
plethora of studies demonstrated the involvement of CYP-mediated AA metabolites 
in the pathogenesis of CH. Also, inflammation is known to be a characteristic 
hallmark of CH. In this review, our aim is to highlight the impact of 
inflammation on CYP-derived AA metabolites and CH. Inflammation is shown to 
modulate the expression of various CYP ω-hydroxylases and CYP epoxygenases and 
their respective metabolites in the heart. In general, HETEs such as 20-HETE and 
mid-chain HETEs are pro-inflammatory, while EETs are characterized by their 
anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties. Several mechanisms are 
implicated in inflammation-induced CH, including the modulation of NF-κB and 
MAPK. This review demonstrated the inflammatory modulation of cardiac CYPs and 
their metabolites in the context of CH and the anti-inflammatory strategies that 
can be employed in the treatment of CH and HF."
782,"In this work, a microfluidic lung chip with membrane supporting cell growth that 
can produce multiple concentration gradients of gas and liquid is introduced. 
The chip is composed of a gas gradient layer in the upper part, a porous 
membrane supporting cell growth in the middle and a liquid gradient layer in the 
lower part. The gas-liquid interface environment of the cells on the membrane 
can expose the cells to the gas in the upper layer and the liquid in the lower 
layer at the same time. Then, the chip is applied to the toxicity testing of 
formaldehyde in A549 cells. The results showed that at 6 × 10-5 mol/L 
formaldehyde, the survival rate of the cells in four channels were 90, 87, 81, 
and 71%, which shows a dose-response trend under the influence of different 
concentrations of formaldehyde. ROS staining results also showed that 
formaldehyde exposure at 6 × 10-5 mol/L lead to the increase of ROS level in the 
cells. These results suggest that the chip based on cell growth on membrane 
could be used for toxicological evaluation of environmental polluting gases."
783,"Artificial enzymes have demonstrated therapeutic benefit against diverse 
malignant tumors, yet their antitumor potencies are still severely compromised 
by non-selective catalysis, low atomic utilization efficiency, and undesired 
off-target toxicity. Herein, we report that the peroxidase-like biomineralized 
copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages 
(CuCH-NCs) act as a pH-activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor-selective and 
synergistic chemodynamic/chemo-immunotherapy against aggressive triple-negative 
breast cancers (TNBCs). These CuCH-NCs show pH-sensitive Cu2+ release, which 
spontaneously undergoes glutathione (GSH)-mediated reduction into Cu+ species 
for catalyzing the evolution of H2 O2 into hydroxyl radicals in a 
single-atom-like manner to cause chemodynamic cell injury, and simultaneously 
activates non-toxic disulfiram to cytotoxic complex for yielding selective 
chemotherapeutic damage via blocking cell proliferation and amplifying cell 
apoptosis. CuCH-NCs exhibit considerable tumor-targeting capacity with deep 
penetration depth, thus affording preferable efficacy against orthotopic breast 
tumors through synergistic chemodynamic/chemotherapy, together with good in vivo 
safety. Moreover, CuCH-NCs arouse distinct immunogenic cell death effect and 
upregulate PD-L1 expression upon disulfiram combination, and thus synergize with 
anti-PD-L1 antibody to activate adaptive and innate immunities, together with 
relieved immunosuppression, finally yielding potent antitumor efficacy against 
both primary and metastatic TNBCs. These results provide insights into smart and 
high-performance proenzymes for synergistic therapy against aggressive cancers.

784,"Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element associated with animal growth and 
antioxidant and metabolic processes. However, whether Se, especially organic Se 
with higher bioavailability, can alleviate the adverse effects of low salinity 
stress on marine economic crustacean species has not been investigated. 
Accordingly, juvenile Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were reared in 
two culture conditions (low and standard salinity) fed diets supplemented with 
increasing levels of L-selenomethionine (0.41, 0.84 and 1.14 mg/kg Se) for 56 
days, resulting in four treatments: 0.41 mg/kg under standard seawater (salinity 
31) and 0.41, 0.84 and 1.14 mg/kg Se under low salinity (salinity 3). The diet 
containing 0.84 mg/kg Se significantly improved the survival and weight gain of 
shrimp under low salinity stress and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the 
hepatopancreas. The increased numbers of B and R cells may be a passive change 
in hepatopanclear histology in the 1.14 mg/kg Se group. Transcriptomic analysis 
found that L-selenomethionine was involved in the regulatory pathways of energy 
metabolism, retinol metabolism and steroid hormones. In conclusion, dietary 
supplementation with 0.84 mg/kg Se (twice the recommended level) effectively 
alleviated the effects of low salinity stress on L. vannamei by regulating 
antioxidant capacity, hormone regulation and energy metabolism."
785,"Accessory thoracic muscles in humans are relatively common and it is important 
to draw awareness to their variable presentations and potential clinical 
implications owing to their close association with the axilla. Here we report 
four cases of accessory thoracic muscle variations identified in the ethnically 
diverse whole-body donation population in Northern California (4 out of 48 
donors, 8.3%). Of these, combined presentations of thoracic accessory muscles 
were observed in two of the donors, one involving bilateral axillary arches and 
a pectoralis quartus on the left and the other a unilateral axillary arch on the 
left and bilateral pairs of pectoral fascicles. In the former, the proximal ends 
of the left axillary arch and pectoralis quartus joined to form a common 
aponeurosis which inserted onto the deep tendon of the pectoralis major; in the 
latter, the pectoral fascicles originated from the surface of the ribs and 
inserted into the deep surface of the pectoralis major muscle. In the other two 
donors, unilateral axillary arches were observed. Our observations illustrate 
that accessory thoracic muscles, in isolated as well as combined forms, are 
commonplace in the general population. We also describe the proposed embryonic 
origins of these accessory muscles, which may reflect their frequent occurrence, 
and potential clinical implications of these muscles, as discussed in 
literature."
786,"Plasmid fitness is directed by two orthogonal processes-vertical transfer 
through cell division and horizontal transfer through conjugation. When 
considered individually, improvements in either mode of transfer can promote how 
well a plasmid spreads and persists. Together, however, the metabolic cost of 
conjugation could create a tradeoff that constrains plasmid evolution. Here, we 
present evidence for the presence, consequences, and molecular basis of a 
conjugation-growth tradeoff across 40 plasmids derived from clinical Escherichia 
coli pathogens. We discover that most plasmids operate below a conjugation 
efficiency threshold for major growth effects, indicating strong natural 
selection for vertical transfer. Below this threshold, E. coli demonstrates a 
remarkable growth tolerance to over four orders of magnitude change in 
conjugation efficiency. This tolerance fades as nutrients become scarce and 
horizontal transfer attracts a greater share of host resources. Our results 
provide insight into evolutionary constraints directing plasmid fitness and 
strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance."
787,"Cadmium as a heavy metal contaminates the agricultural soil and effect plant 
growth due to rapid increases in industrialization and anthropogenic activities. 
Smoke water of Moringa olferia was used in the current study to alleviate the 
effect of cadmium on the physiological, biochemical, metabolic, and antioxidant 
profile of Basmati 385 and Shaheen Basmati seedling. Cadmium stress of 100, 200, 
and 400 µM were given to 28 days-old seedlings along with smoke water (1:1,000) 
for one week in hydroponic culture. As a result, Cd+2 toxicity negatively 
affects the seedling length, fresh and dry weight, photosynthetic pigment, and 
electrolytes leakage, while the application of smoke water alleviated those 
effects. Furthermore, Cd+2 content, cell injury, metabolic parameters (proline, 
total soluble sugar), and antioxidants (peroxidase, catalase) were increased 
with increasing Cd+2 concentration while smoke water-treated seedlings showed 
reduction at high concentration. From present study, it can be concluded that 
smoke water had some regulatory compound which could reduce the Cd+2 stress 
level in rice seedlings and improve plant growth."
788,"Tissue dissociation, a crucial step in single-cell sample preparation, can alter 
the transcriptional state of a sample through the intrinsic cellular stress 
response. Here we demonstrate a general approach for measuring transcriptional 
response during sample preparation. In our method, transcripts made during 
dissociation are labeled for later identification upon sequencing. We found 
general as well as cell-type-specific dissociation response programs in 
zebrafish larvae, and we observed sample-to-sample variation in the dissociation 
response of mouse cardiomyocytes despite well-controlled experimental 
conditions. Finally, we showed that dissociation of the mouse hippocampus can 
lead to the artificial activation of microglia. In summary, our approach 
facilitates experimental optimization of dissociation procedures as well as 
computational removal of transcriptional perturbation response."
789,"Up to 50% of patients treated with curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer 
will develop recurrence, contributing to the dismal survival associated with 
this disease. Regional recurrence may represent disease that is not yet widely 
metastatic and may therefore be amenable to more-aggressive treatment. We sought 
to assess all patients treated with curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer 
who developed regional recurrence. We retrospectively identified all patients 
who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma at a single institution from January 2000 to August 
2019. In total, 1626 patients were included in the study cohort. As of June 
2022, 595 patients had disease recurrence, which was distant or systemic in 435 
patients (27%), regional in 125 (7.7%), and local in 35 (2.2%). On multivariable 
analysis, neoadjuvant chemoradiation with a total radiation dose <45 Gy (hazard 
ratio [HR], 3.5 [95% CI, 1.7-7.3]; P=0.001), pathologic node-positive disease 
(HR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-3.0]; P=0.003), and lymphovascular invasion (HR, 1.6 [95% 
CI, 1.0-2.5]; P=0.049) were predictors of isolated nodal recurrence, whereas 
increasing age (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]; P=0.001) and increasing number of 
excised lymph nodes (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]; P=0.021) were independently 
associated with decreased risk of regional recurrence. Patients treated with a 
combination of local and systemic therapies had better survival outcomes than 
patients treated with systemic therapy alone (P<0.001). In patients with 
recurrence of esophageal cancer limited to regional lymph nodes, salvage 
treatment may be possible. Higher radiation doses and more-extensive 
lymphadenectomy may reduce the risk of regional recurrence. This article is

790,"For proper functioning of the nervous system, it is crucial that neurons find 
their appropriate partners and build the correct neural connection patterns. 
Although cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) have been studied for many years as 
essential players in neural connections, we have yet to unravel the code by 
which CAMs encode synaptic specificity. We analyzed the effects of mutations in 
CAM genes on the morphology and synapses of a set of sensory neurons in the 
C.　elegans male tail. B-type ray sensory neurons express ten genes encoding 
CAMs. We examined the effect on axon trajectory and localization of presynaptic 
components in viable mutants of nine of these. We found axon trajectory defects 
in mutants of UNC-40/DCC, SAX-3/ROBO, and FMI-1/Flamingo/Celsr1. None of the 
mutations caused loss of presynaptic components in axons, and in several the 
level even appeared to increase, suggesting possible accumulation of 
presynapses. B-type sensory neurons fasciculate with a second type of ray 
sensory neuron, the A-type, in axon commissures. We found a CAM expressed in 
A-type functions additively with a CAM expressed in B-type in B-type axon 
guidance, and lack of a CAM expressed in B-type affected A-type axon guidance. 
Overall, single and multiple mutants of CAM genes had limited effects on ray 
neuron trajectories and accumulation of synaptic components."
791,"Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is a major cause of childhood morbidity. 
Mono-allelic mutations in Trim71, a conserved stem-cell-specific RNA-binding 
protein, cause CH; however, the molecular basis for pathogenesis mediated by 
these mutations remains unknown. Here, using mouse embryonic stem cells as a 
model, we reveal that the mouse R783H mutation (R796H in human) alters Trim71's 
mRNA substrate specificity and leads to accelerated stem-cell differentiation 
and neural lineage commitment. Mutant Trim71, but not wild-type Trim71, binds 
Lsd1 (Kdm1a) mRNA and represses its translation. Specific inhibition of this 
repression or a slight increase of Lsd1 in the mutant cells alleviates the 
defects in stem cell differentiation and neural lineage commitment. These 
results determine a functionally relevant target of the CH-causing Trim71 mutant 
that can potentially be a therapeutic target and provide molecular mechanistic 
insights into the pathogenesis of this disease."
792,"DNAzyme-based sensors remain at the forefront of metal-ion imaging efforts, but 
most lack the subcellular precision necessary to their applications in specific 
organelles. Here, we seek to overcome this limitation by presenting a 
DNAzyme-based biosensor technology for spatiotemporally controlled imaging of 
metal ions in mitochondria. A DNA nanodevice was constructed by integrating an 
optically activatable DNAzyme sensor and an upconversion nanoparticle with an 
organelle-targeting signal. We exemplify that this approach allows for 
mitochondria-specific imaging of Zn2+ in living cells in a near-infrared 
light-controlled manner. Based on this, the system is used for the monitoring of 
mitochondrial Zn2+ during drug treatment in a cellular model of ischemia insult. 
Furthermore, the DNA nanodevice is employed to assess dynamic Zn2+ change and 
pharmacological interventions in an injury cell model of Zn2+ toxicity. This 
method paves the way for engineering of DNAzyme sensors to investigate the 
pathophysiological roles of metal ions at the subcellular level."
793,"Paneth cells are versatile secretory cells located in the crypts of Lieberkühn 
of the small intestine. In normal conditions, they function as the cornerstones 
of intestinal health by preserving homeostasis. They perform this function by 
providing niche factors to the intestinal stem cell compartment, regulating the 
composition of the microbiome through the production and secretion of 
antimicrobial peptides, performing phagocytosis and efferocytosis, taking up 
heavy metals, and preserving barrier integrity. Disturbances in one or more of 
these functions can lead to intestinal as well as systemic inflammatory and 
infectious diseases. This review discusses the multiple functions of Paneth 
cells, and the mechanisms and consequences of Paneth cell dysfunction. It also 
provides an overview of the tools available for studying Paneth cells."
794,"Young adults (YA) represent a minority among recipients of allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In order to describe the 
outcome of YA following HSCT in Germany, 9299 patients who were registered with 
the German Registry for Stem Cell Transplantation were included in this 
retrospective analysis of the years 1998-2019. The impact of the variables, such 
as patient age and sex, sex differences, stem cell source, donor type, 
conditioning, year of HSCT, the diagnosis, and the achieved remission status 
were tested in univariable and multivariable analysis for overall, event-free 
and relapse-free survival as well as for the cumulative incidences of 
non-relapse and therapy-related mortality. Altogether, the outcome of YA after 
HSCT improved over time and was determined by the underlying disease, the age at 
disease onset, stem cell source, and donor type. Patients were most likely to 
die from relapse, and survival of HSCT recipients after 10 years was reduced by 
more than half in comparison to the general population of YA. Deeper 
understanding of modifiable risk factors may be gained by studies comparing the 
outcome of YA post-HSCT with that of children, adolescents and elderly patients. 
A deliberate and strong patient selection may further improve mortality rates."
795,"Abscisic acid (ABA) drives stomatal closure to minimize water loss due to 
transpiration in response to drought. We examined the subcellular location of 
ABA increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, 
which drive stomatal closure, in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). 
ABA-dependent increases in fluorescence of the generic ROS sensor, 
dichlorofluorescein (DCF), were observed in mitochondria, chloroplasts, cytosol, 
and nuclei. The ABA response in all these locations were lost in an 
ABA-insensitive quintuple receptor mutant. The ABA-increased fluorescence in 
mitochondria of both DCF and an H2O2-selective probe, Peroxy Orange 1 (PO1), 
colocalized with Mitotracker Red. ABA treatment of guard cells transformed with 
the genetically-encoded H2O2 reporter targeted to the cytoplasm (roGFP2-Orp1), 
or mitochondria (mt-roGFP2-Orp1), revealed H2O2 increases. Consistent with 
mitochondrial ROS changes functioning in stomatal closure, we found that guard 
cells of a mutant with mitochondrial defects, ABA overly sensitive 6 (abo6), 
have elevated ABA-induced ROS in mitochondria and enhanced stomatal closure. 
These effects were phenocopied with rotenone, which increased mitochondrial ROS. 
In contrast, the mitochondrially targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, dampened ABA 
effects on mitochondrial ROS accumulation and stomatal closure in Col-0 and 
reversed the guard cell closure phenotype of the abo6 mutant. ABA-induced ROS 
accumulation in guard cell mitochondria was lost in mutants in genes encoding 
Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog (RBOH) enzymes and reduced by treatment with 
the RBOH inhibitor VAS2870, consistent with RBOH machinery acting in 
ABA-increased ROS in guard cell mitochondria. These results demonstrate that ABA 
elevates H2O2 accumulation in guard cell mitochondria to promote stomatal 
closure."
796,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are contingent upon clinical manifestations 
and serological markers. However, researchers are struggling to find biomarkers 
with higher sensitivity and specificity. DNA methylation has been the most 
studied epigenetic feature in SLE. So, in this study, we performed a systematic 
review of studies about DNA methylation alterations in SLE patients compared to 
healthy controls.
METHODS: By searching PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to July 2022, all 
case-control studies in which DNA methylation of specific genes was assessed by 
a non-high-throughput technique and passed the quality of bias assessment were 
included.
RESULTS: In total, 44 eligible studies underwent a data extraction process. In 
all, 3471 SLE patients and 1028 healthy individuals were included. Among the 
studies that reported the patients' gender (n = 2853), 89.41% were female and 
10.59% were male. Forty studies have been conducted on adult patients. The 
number of works on fractionated and unfractionated blood cells was almost equal. 
In this regard, 22 studies were conducted on whole blood or peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells and two studies on unfractionated white blood cells. Sorted 
blood cells were biological sources in 20 studies. The most investigated gene 
was IFI44L. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic power of methylation levels 
were only reported for IFI44L in five studies. The most employed methylation 
profiling method was bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction. The 
correlation between methylation patterns and clinical parameters was explored in 
22 studies, which of them 16 publications displayed a remarkable association 
between DNA methylation status and clinical indices.
CONCLUSIONS: The methylation status of some genes especially IFI44L, FOXP3, and 
MX1 has been suggested as promising SLE biomarkers. However, given the 
conflicting findings between studies because of potential confounders such as 
different sample types, methylation profiling methods, and ethnicity as well as 
shared DNA methylation patterns of SLE and other autoimmune diseases, DNA 
methylation biomarkers are currently not reliable diagnostic biomarkers and do 
not represent surrogate markers of SLE disease activity. Future investigations 
on a larger scale with the discarding of limitations of previous studies would 
probably lead to a consensus."
797,"Plant respiration is a foundational biological process with the potential to be 
optimized to improve crop yield. To understand and manipulate the outputs of 
respiration, the inputs of respiration - respiratory substrates - need to be 
probed in detail. Mitochondria house substrate catabolic pathways and 
respiratory machinery, so transport into and out of these organelles plays an 
important role in committing substrates to respiration. The large number of 
mitochondrial carriers and catabolic pathways that remain unidentified hinder 
this process and lead to confusion about the identity of direct and indirect 
respiratory substrates in plants. The sources and usage of respiratory 
substrates vary and are increasing found to be highly regulated based on 
cellular processes and environmental factors. This review covers the use of 
direct respiratory substrates following transport through mitochondrial carriers 
and catabolism under normal and stressed conditions. We suggest introduction of 
enzymes not currently found in plant mitochondria to enable serine and acetate 
to be direct respiratory substrates in plants. We also compare respiratory 
substrates by assessing energetic yields, availability in cells, and their full 
or partial oxidation during cell catabolism. This information can assist in 
decisions to use synthetic biology approaches to alter the range of respiratory 
substrates in plants. As a result, respiration could be optimized by 
introducing, improving, or controlling specific mitochondrial transporters and 
mitochondrial catabolic pathways."
798,"Studies prior to next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed that the frequent 
indolent course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is related to most cells 
remaining quiescent in the G0 -G1 cell cycle phase, due to the expression of 
dysregulated cyclin genes. Of note, the activating nature of the NOTCH1 mutation 
in T lymphoblastic leukaemia also drives the dysregulation of cell cycle genes. 
Our goal was to comprehensively revisit the cell cycle in NOTCH1-mutated CLL 
(NOTCH1MUT ) to test for potential therapeutic targets. Among 378 NGS-annotated 
CLL cases, NOTCH1MUT cells displayed a unique transcriptome profile of G0 -G1 
cell cycle components, with an overexpression of early-phase effectors, reaching 
a 38-, 27- and ninefold change increase for the complex elements CCND3, CDK4 and 
CDK6, respectively. This NOTCH1MUT cells' profile was related to more cells 
traversing through the cell cycle. In-vitro targeted inhibition of NOTCH1 
gamma-secretase and CDK4/6 reversed the distribution of cells through the cycle 
phases and enhanced the killing of NOTCH1MUT CLL cells, suggesting new 
therapeutic approaches."
799,"MOTIVATION: There is a rapidly growing interest in high-throughput drug

800,"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the effect of circ_0008003 on the 
progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its underlying regulation 
mechanism.
METHODS: Expression of hsa_circ_0008003, miRNA (miR)-548I and karyopherin 
subunit α 4 (KPNA4) was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction. Cell viability and proliferation ability were detected by cell 
counting kit-8 assay and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, respectively. Flow 
cytometry was performed to monitor cell apoptosis. Western blot assay was used 
to evaluate the protein levels of KPNA4, Bax, and Bcl-2. Cell migration and 
invasion were assessed by transwell assays. The targeted relationship between 
miR-548I and hsa_circ_0008003 or KPNA4 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter 
and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, the role of hsa_circ_0008003 in 
vivo was investigated by xenograft assay.
RESULTS: Circ_0008003 expression was increased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. 
Circ_0008003 knockdown reduced cell viability, migration, invasion, 
angiogenesis, and caused apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Moreover, miR-548I was 
targeted by circ_0008003, and miR-548I knockdown reversed the influence of 
circ_0008003 silence on NSCLC progression. KPNA4 was targeted by miR-548I, and 
miR-548I overexpression suppressed cell viability, migration, invasion, 
angiogenesis, and promoted cell apoptosis via decreasing KPNA4. In addition, 
circ_0008003 regulated KPNA4 expression via miR-548I. Circ_0008003 knockdown 
decreased NSCLC cell growth in the xenograft model.
CONCLUSION: Circular RNA hsa_circ_0008003 promoted progression in NSCLC by 
sponging miR-548I and regulating KPNA4 expression, hinting that circ_0008003 
participates in NSCLC pathogenesis."
801,"SUMMARY: Recent innovations in single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing 
(scCAS) have revolutionized the characterization of epigenomic heterogeneity. 
Estimation of the number of cell types is a crucial step for downstream analyses 
and biological implications. However, efforts to perform estimation specifically 
for scCAS data are limited. Here we propose ASTER, an ensemble learning-based 
tool for accurately estimating the number of cell types in scCAS data. ASTER 
outperformed baseline methods in systematic evaluation on 27 datasets of various 
protocols, sizes, numbers of cell types, degrees of cell-type imbalance, cell 
states, and qualities, providing valuable guidance for scCAS data analysis.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ASTER along with detailed documentation is 
freely accessible at https://aster.readthedocs.io/ under the MIT License. It can 
be seamlessly integrated into existing scCAS analysis workflows. The source code 
is available at https://github.com/biox-nku/aster.

802,"BACH2 [BTB (broad-complex, tramtrak and bric à brac) and CNC (cap 'n' collar) 
homolog 2] is known as a transcriptional repressor and broadly functions in 
regulating immune cell differentiation. Here, we focus on BACH2 function in B 
cells, where BACH2 was first shown to play an important role in the immune 
system. In B cells, BACH2 orchestrates the gene regulatory network that promotes 
class-switch and affinity-maturation of antibodies and simultaneously represses 
plasma-cell differentiation. In this context, BACH2 regulates gene expression by 
modulating chromatin organization, cooperatively with other transcription 
factors and chromatin regulators, such as IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) 
and PC4 (positive coactivator 4), respectively. In addition, our recent 
observation raises the possibility that BACH2 has diverse functions, such as 
those in gene activation. Since dysfunction of BACH2 leads to the onset of human 
immune deficiencies, revealing new functions of BACH2 may give a cue to solve 
how BACH2 contributes to preventing these diseases."
803,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent and recurrent psychiatric disorder. 
Aberrant neural structure and activity play fundamental roles in the occurrence 
of depression. Mitotic arrest deficient protein (MAD2B) is highly expressed in 
neurons and may be implicated in synaptic plasticity in the central nervous 
system. However, the effect of MAD2B in depression, as well as the related 
molecular mechanism, is uncertain.
METHODS: Here, we employed mouse models of depression induced by chronic 
unpredictable stress (CUS) exposure or corticosterone (CORT) stimulation. 
Depression-like behaviors in mice were evaluated by sucrose preference, forced 
swimming, and tail suspension tests. Hippocampal MAD2B overexpression was 
mediated by adeno-associated virus 8 containing eGFP. In vitro, primary neuronal 
cells were obtained from the hippocampus of rat embryos and were treated with 
CORT; while MAD2B overexpression was performed using lentivirus. MAD2B and 
glutamate metabotropic receptor 4 (GRM4) levels were evaluated by Western blots 
and qPCR. Primary neuronal miR-29b-3p expression was detected by qPCR.
RESULTS: MAD2B expression was reduced in the hippocampus in mice exhibiting 
depressive-like behaviors. However, hippocampal MAD2B overexpression protected 
mice from developing either CUS- or CORT-induced depression-like behaviors, an 
effect associated with reduced expression of GRM4, a presynaptic receptor 
involved in depression. Moreover, MAD2B overexpression in primary neuronal cells 
also decreased GRM4 expression while enhancing the level of miR-29b-3p; this 
phenomenon was also observed under CORT stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an important role of neuronal MAD2B in the 
pathogenesis of depression via the miR-29b-3p/ GRM4 signaling pathway. MAD2B 
could be a potential therapeutic target for depressive disorders."
804,"OBJECTIVES: The transtibial pull-out repair (TP) is a relatively new method for 
treating meniscal root tear; however, the clinical evaluation of its healing 
effect remains controversial. Due to ethical constraints and limitations of 
imaging techniques in humans, here we dynamically observe the healing effects of 
TP and TP with platelet-rich plasma gel (PRG) at the histological level using an 
animal model.
METHODS: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and PRG of rabbits were prepared. 
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) 
levels in PRP and PRG were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. A rabbit model of anterior horn tear of the medial meniscus and TP 
surgery were created. PRG was injected between the anterior horn of the medial 
meniscus and the tibial tunnel. Rabbits were divided into three groups: the 
anterior horn tear group (Tear group), the anterior horn tear + TP group (TP 
group), and the anterior horn tear + TP + PRG group (TP + PRG group). The 
healing effect was observed dynamically using histopathological studies and 
biomechanical experiments.
RESULTS: The platelet content in PRP significantly increased to approximately 
4.57 times that of whole blood. PDGF and TGF-β1 concentrations in PRG increased 
to 2.46 and 4.15 times those in PRP, respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 
and Masson staining showed that the number of inflammatory cells in healing 
tissue decreased and the collagen fibers significantly increased in TP and 
TP + PRG groups at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively compared to those in Tear 
group. Neatly arranged, interlaced, and dense collagen fibers were found between 
the anterior horn and bone at 12 weeks. H&E and toluidine blue staining showed 
that the injury to the femoral condyle cartilage was alleviated. The healing 
performance in TP + PRG group was better and faster than that in TP group. The 
maximum tensile fracture strength of the meniscus progressively increased at 8 
and 12 weeks postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior horn injury of the medial meniscus in rabbits can be 
repaired using the TP technique, and the addition of autologous PRG to the bone 
tunnel promotes early healing of the meniscus and bone postoperatively. 
Meanwhile, both treatments can reduce the secondary damage to the cartilage due 
to osteoarthritis."
805,"BACKGROUND: IFNL4 genetic variants that are strongly associated with clearance 
of hepatitis C virus have been linked to risk of certain opportunistic 
infections (OIs) and cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma, cytomegalovirus 
infection, and herpes simplex virus infection. As the interferon (IFN) λ family 
plays a role in response to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, IFNL4 
genotype might affect risk for a wide range of OIs/cancers.
METHODS: We examined associations between genotype for the functional IFNL4 
rs368234815 polymorphism and incidence of 16 OIs/cancers among 2310 men with 
human immunodeficiency virus (2038 white; 272 black) enrolled in the Multicenter 
AIDS Cohort Study during 1984-1990. Our primary analyses used Cox proportional 
hazards models adjusted for self-reported racial ancestry to estimate hazard 
ratios with 95% confidence intervals, comparing participants with the genotypes 
that generate IFN-λ4 and those with the genotype that abrogates IFN-λ4. We 
censored follow-up at the introduction of highly effective antiretroviral 
therapies.
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant association between IFNL4 
genotype and the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma (hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% confidence 
interval, .76-1.11]), cytomegalovirus infection (0.94 [.71-1.24]), herpes 
simplex virus infection (1.37 [.68-2.93]), or any other OI/cancer. We observed 
consistent results using additive genetic models and after controlling for CD4 
cell count through time-dependent adjustment or restriction to participants with 
a low CD4 cell count.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of associations between IFNL4 genotype and these 
OIs/cancers provides evidence that this gene does not affect the risk of disease 
from opportunistic pathogens."
806,"The kidney tubule consists of a single layer of epithelial cells supported by 
the tubular basement membrane (TBM), a thin layer of specialized extracellular 
matrix (ECM). The mechanical properties of the ECM are important for regulating 
a wide range of cell functions including proliferation, differentiation and cell 
survival. Increased ECM stiffness plays a role in promoting multiple 
pathological conditions including cancer, fibrosis and heart disease. How 
changes in TBM mechanics regulate tubular epithelial cell behavior is not fully 
understood. Here we introduce a cell culture system that utilizes in 
vivo-derived TBM to investigate cell-matrix interactions in kidney proximal 
tubule cells. Basement membrane mechanics was controlled using genipin, a 
biocompatibility crosslinker. Genipin modification resulted in a dose-dependent 
increase in matrix stiffness. Crosslinking had a marginal but statistically 
significant impact on the diffusive molecular transport properties of the TBM, 
likely due to a reduction in pore size. Both native and genipin-modified TBM 
substrates supported tubular epithelial cell growth. Cells were able to attach 
and proliferate to form confluent monolayers. Tubular epithelial cells polarized 
and assembled organized cell-cell junctions. Genipin modification had minimal 
impact on cell viability and proliferation. Genipin stiffened TBM increased gene 
expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines and altered gene expression for N-cadherin, 
a proximal tubular epithelial specific cell-cell junction marker. This work 
introduces a new cell culture model for cell-basement membrane mechanobiology 
studies that utilizes in vivo-derived basement membrane. We also demonstrate 
that TBM stiffening affects tubular epithelial cell function through altered 
gene expression of cell-specific differentiation markers and induced increased 
expression of pro-fibrotic growth factors."
807,"OBJECTIVES: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) with prognosis in various 
infectious diseases. For fractured patients admitted to the intensive care units 
(ICU), an accurate and fast appraisal is essential. To investigate the 
association between RDW and prognosis in fractured patients admitted to the ICU 
utilizing the MIMIC-III database.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort from the MIMIC III database from 2001 and 2012 
was constructed. RDW and other information were collected with in-hospital 
mortality as the primary outcome and 90-day mortality and hospital and intensive 
care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) as secondary outcomes. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression models with propensity score inverse 
probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to investigate the 
prognostic value of RDW. A nomogram was built with significant prognostic 
factors to predict in-hospital mortality, and the performance of the nomogram 
was evaluated and compared with other severity assessment scores. Subgroup 
analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 2721 fracture patients admitted to the ICU were identified. 
After IPTW, the group with higher RDW was significantly associated with elevated 
in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.19-2.37), 90-day mortality (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04-1.86), prolonged hospital 
LOS (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03-1.50), and ICU LOS significantly (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 
1.05-1.53) in the multivariate logistics model. The nomogram showed optimal 
discriminative ability and predictive accuracy with an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.77.
CONCLUSION: RDW independently predicted in-hospital mortality, 90-day mortality, 
and hospital and ICU LOS in fractured patients admitted to ICU. The nomogram 
including RDW could also be a promising tool with potential clinical benefits."
808,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this case series was to collect preliminary data on 
safety and efficacy of treating cats suffering from refractory feline chronic 
gingivostomatitis with a single intravenous therapy of cryopreserved 
placenta-derived mesenchymal stromal cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We planned the prospective inclusion of cats suffering 
from refractory chronic gingivostomatitis in three veterinary clinics. All cats 
received a single infusion of 10×106 cryopreserved cells. Follow-up evaluations 
were done at day 15 and at 2-, 3- and 6-months following infusion. Clinical 
disease severity was evaluated by dental specialists using a published 
stomatitis disease activity index scoring system coupled with an owners' 
assessment questionnaire.
RESULTS: All eight cats attended all follow up visits. Cryopreserved 
ready-to-use placenta-derived cells administered systemically were safe and 
resulted in notable clinical improvement in all cats as reported by stomatitis 
disease activity index scoring and owner's survey.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Infusion of cryopreserved freshly thawed placenta-derived 
mesenchymal stromal cells appears to promote clinical and consequently 
behavioural benefits in cats with refractory chronic gingivostomatitis after 
having undergone full-mouth or premolar-molar tooth extraction. Future 
randomised studies are required to confirm safety and efficacy of this 
treatment."
809,"BACKGROUND: Despite the conventional cancer therapeutic, cancer treatment 
remains a medical challenge due to neoplasm metastasis and cancer recurrence, 
therefore, new approaches promoting therapeutic strategies are highly desirable. 
As a new therapy, the use of whole neoplastic stem cells or cancer stem cell 
(CSC)-based vaccines is one strategy to overcome these obstacles. We 
investigated the effects of whole CSC-based vaccines on the solid tumor 
development, metastasis, and survival rate.
METHODS: Primary electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Web 
of Science), and a major clinical registry were searched. Interventional studies 
of whole CSC-based vaccines in rodent cancer models (38 studies), and human 
cancer patients (11 studies) were included; the vaccine preparation 
methodologies, effects, and overall outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Preclinical studies were divided into four groups, CSC-lysates/ 
inactivated-CSC-based vaccines, CSC-lysate-loaded dendritic cell (CSC-DC) 
vaccines, cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) vaccines generated with CSC-DC (CSC-DC-CTL), 
and combinatorial treatments carried out in the prophylactic and therapeutic 
experimental models. The majority of preclinical studies reported a promising 
effect on tumor growth, survival rate, and metastasis. Moreover, whole CSC-based 
vaccines induced several antitumor immune responses. A small number of clinical 
investigations suggested that the whole CSC-based vaccine treatment is 
beneficial, however further research is required.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive review provides an overview of the available 
methods for assessing the efficacy of whole CSC-based vaccines on tumor 
development, metastasis, and survival rate. In addition, it presents a set of 
recommendations for designing high-quality clinical studies that may allow to 
determine the efficacy of whole CSC-based-vaccines in cancer therapy."
810,"During nervous system development, neurons send out axons, which must navigate 
large distances to reach synaptic targets. Axons grow out sequentially. The 
early outgrowing axons, pioneers, must integrate information from various 
guidance cues in their environment to determine the correct direction of 
outgrowth. Later outgrowing follower axons can at least in part navigate by 
adhering to pioneer axons. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the right side of the 
largest longitudinal axon tract, the ventral nerve cord, is pioneered by the AVG 
axon. How the AVG axon navigates is only partially understood. In this study we 
describe the role of two members of the IgCAM family, wrk-1 and rig-5, in AVG 
axon navigation. While wrk-1 and rig-5 single mutants do not show AVG navigation 
defects, both mutants have highly penetrant pioneer and follower navigation 
defects in a nid-1 mutant background. Both mutations increase the fraction of 
follower axons following the misguided pioneer axon. We found that wrk-1 and 
rig-5 act in different genetic pathways, suggesting that we identified two 
pioneer-independent guidance pathways used by follower axons. We assessed 
general locomotion, mechanosensory responsiveness and habituation to determine 
whether axonal navigation defects impact nervous system function. In rig-5 nid-1 
double mutants we found no significant defects in free movement behaviour, 
however a subpopulation of animals shows minor changes in response duration 
habituation after mechanosensory stimulation. These results suggest that 
guidance defects of axons in the motor circuit do not necessarily lead to major 
movement or behavioural defects, but impact more complex behavioural modulation."
811,"Due to their advantages in structural stability and versatility, cysteine-rich 
peptides, which are secreted from the venom glands of venomous animals, 
constitute a naturally occurring pharmaceutical arsenal. However, the correct 
folding of disulfide bonds is a challenging task in the prokaryotic expression 
system like Escherichia coli due to the reducing environment. Here, a secretory 
expression plasmid pSE-G1M5-SUMO-HWTX-I for the spider neurotoxin huwentoxin-I 
(HWTX-I) with three disulfides as a model of cysteine-rich peptides was 
constructed. By utilizing the signal peptide G1M5, the fusion protein 
6 × His-SUMO-HWTX-I was successfully secreted into extracellular medium of 
BL21(DE3). After enrichment using cation-exchange chromatography and 
purification utilizing the Ni-NTA column, 6 × His-SUMO-HWTX-I was digested via 
Ulp1 kinase to release recombinant HWTX-I (rHWTX-I), which was further purified 
utilizing RP-HPLC. Finally, both impurities with low and high molecular weights 
were completely removed. The molecular mass of rHWTX-I was identified as being 
3750.8 Da, which was identical to natural HWTX-I with three disulfide bridges. 
Furthermore, by utilizing whole-cell patch clamp, the sodium currents of hNav1.7 
could be inhibited by rHWTX-I and the IC50 value was 419 nmol/L."
812,"CONTEXT: The advent of immune check inhibitors (ICIs) has tremendously changed 
the prognosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), adding an unseen 
substantial overall survival benefit. These agents could be administered alone 
or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) 
therapies. So far, treatment allocation is based only on clinical stratification 
risk models.
OBJECTIVE: Herein, we aimed to report the different molecular classifications 
reported in the first-line treatment of mRCC and discuss the awaited clinical 
implications in terms of treatment selection.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Medline database as well as European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference 
proceedings were searched to identify biomarker studies. Inclusion criteria 
comprised randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials that included patients 
treated in the first line of mRCC setting, patients treated with anti-VEGF 
therapies or ICIs, biological modeling, and available survival outcomes.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Four classification models were identified with subsequent 
clinical implications: Beuselinck model (34 gene signatures), IMmotion150, 
Hakimi, and JAVELIN 101 model. Tumor profiling shows distinct outcomes when 
treated with one or other combination. Patients are clustered into two gene 
signatures: angiogenic and proinflammatory (as per JAVELIN). The first is more 
likely to respond to therapy that includes anti-VEGF agents, while the best 
outcomes are obtained with an ICI combination with the second.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented here were mostly derived from ancillary 
registered studies of new drugs in the setting of mRCC. Further validation is 
needed, which sets new paradigms for investigation in clinical research based on 
tumor biology for treatment allocation and not only on clinical stratification 
tools.
PATIENT SUMMARY: First-line treatment of metastatic kidney includes 
immunotherapy alone or in combination with antiangiogenic therapy. However, 
clinical practice demonstrated that the ""one treatment fits all"" strategy might 
not be the best approach. In fact, recent studies showed that the addition of 
immunotherapy agents will not benefit all patients equally, and some still 
respond either equally to or better than anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
alone. This review revealed biomarker modeling that impacts treatment selection. 
Recent tumor profiling into ""angiogenic signature"" more sensitive to angiogenic 
agents versus ""immune signature"" more likely to achieve the best response with 
immunotherapy should be validated. Tumor biology features might be more powerful 
than clinical classification for a tailored treatment approach."
813,"While multiple mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the therapeutic 
effect of lymph node (LN) yield in patients with urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) 
undergoing radical cystectomy (RC), the effect of stage migration, commonly 
known as the Will Rogers effect, is often discounted. We reviewed the National 
Cancer Database for patients with UCC undergoing RC with pathologically 
node-negative (pN0) disease from 2004 to 2016. We tested for an adjusted 
association between LN yield and overall survival using multivariable Cox 
proportional-hazard models. Median survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. We identified 19 939 patients with pN0 UCC treated with RC. After 
adjustment, patients in the highest quantile for LN yield (≥26 LNs) had a 34% 
lower risk of death in comparison to patients in the lowest quantile (≤5 LNs). 
As we increased the threshold for LN yield for dichotomization from >5 to >15 to 
>25 LNs, median survival increased from 83 to 95 to 103 mo. The pN0 group with 
higher LN yield appeared to live longer in this analysis owing to the 
mathematical artifact of how patients are indexed. Resection of a greater number 
of negative LNs will lead to higher fidelity for pN0 cohorts being evaluated, as 
the likelihood of contamination by pN+ cases that were missed will be lower.
PATIENT SUMMARY: A strategy to dissect a high number of lymph nodes in patients 
undergoing removal of their bladder for bladder cancer can be associated with 
side effects, and the benefit in terms of cancer control or survival remains 
uncertain. Urologists and their patients should engage in shared decision-making 
and consider the risks and benefits of more extensive lymph node dissection 
during surgery."
814,"This article's main contributions are twofold: 1) to demonstrate how to apply 
the general European Union's High-Level Expert Group's (EU HLEG) guidelines for 
trustworthy AI in practice for the domain of healthcare and 2) to investigate 
the research question of what does ""trustworthy AI"" mean at the time of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we present the results of a post-hoc 
self-assessment to evaluate the trustworthiness of an AI system for predicting a 
multiregional score conveying the degree of lung compromise in COVID-19 
patients, developed and verified by an interdisciplinary team with members from 
academia, public hospitals, and industry in time of pandemic. The AI system aims 
to help radiologists to estimate and communicate the severity of damage in a 
patient's lung from Chest X-rays. It has been experimentally deployed in the 
radiology department of the ASST Spedali Civili clinic in Brescia, Italy, since 
December 2020 during pandemic time. The methodology we have applied for our 
post-hoc assessment, called Z-Inspection®, uses sociotechnical scenarios to 
identify ethical, technical, and domain-specific issues in the use of the AI 
system in the context of the pandemic."
815,"The idea of cancer immunotherapy has spread, and it has made tremendous progress 
with the advancement of new technology. Immunotherapy, which serves to assist 
the natural defenses of the body in eradicating cancerous cells, is a remarkable 
achievement that has revolutionized both cancer research and cancer treatments. 
Currently, the use of stem cells in immunotherapy is widespread and shares a 
special characteristic, including cancer cell migration, bioactive component 
release, and immunosuppressive activity. In the context of cancer, mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) are rapidly being identified as vital stromal regulators of 
tumor progression. MSCs therapy has been implicated in treating a wide range of 
diseases, including bone damage, autoimmune diseases, and particularly 
hematopoietic abnormalities, providing stem cell-based therapy with an extra 
dimension. Moreover, the implication of MSCs does not have ethical concerns, and 
the complications known in pluripotent and totipotent stem cells are less common 
in MSCs. MSCs have a lot of distinctive characteristics that, when coupled, make 
them excellent for cellular-based immunotherapy and as vehicles for gene and 
drug delivery in a variety of inflammations and malignancies. MSCs can migrate 
to the inflammatory site and exert immunomodulatory responses via cell-to-cell 
contacts with lymphocytes by generating soluble substances. In the current 
review, we discuss the most recent research on the immunological characteristics 
of MSCs, their use as immunomodulatory carriers, techniques for approving MSCs 
to adjust their immunological contour, and their usages as vehicles for 
delivering therapeutic as well as drugs and genes engineered to destroy tumor 
cells."
816,"BACKGROUND: Realgar, a Chinese herbal decoction, has been used to treat various 
types of tumors with positive outcomes; however, there is a lack of convincing 
evidence on its use for the treatment of esophageal cancer (EC). In this study, 
the role of the p62-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in the regulation of EC cell 
proliferation, migration, and ferroptosis in response to realgar was assessed.
METHODS: Different concentrations of realgar (0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 
µmol/L) were applied to the EC cell lines Eca109 and KYSE150. The inhibition 
rate and half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) were determined using the Cell 
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method. Subsequently, the cells were treated with realgar 
(1/2IC50, IC50, 2IC50). Cell migration was measured using the scratch assay, and 
cell invasion was measured using the transwell assay. The mRNA expression of 
p62, Keap1, and Nrf2 was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR), and the protein expression of p62, Keap1, Nrf2, matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, E-cadherin, Slug, N-cadherin, and vimentin was 
measured by Western blot. The control, 2IC50, shRNA-NC, shRNA-p62, 2IC50 + 
shRNA-NC, 2IC50 + shRNA-p62, shRNA-Keap1, 2IC50 + shRNA-Keap1, and 2IC50 + 
shRNA-p62 + shRNA-Keap1 groups were defined. The CCK-8 method was used to 
measure the cell inhibition rate, and the clone formation assay was used to 
measure the clone formation ability. Moreover, the scratch assay was used to 
detect the cell migration ability, and the transwell assay was used to detect 
the cell invasion ability. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe 
the mitochondrial morphology, Prussian blue staining was used to observe the 
intracellular iron particle distribution, and flow cytometry was used to detect 
changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species. In addition, qRT-PCR was 
performed to detect p62, Keap1, Nrf2, and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA 
expression, and Western blot was performed to detect p62, Keap1, Nrf2, 
E-cadherin, Slug, N-cadherin, and GPX4 protein expression.
RESULTS: Realgar inhibited Eca109 and KYSE150 cell proliferation in a time- and 
concentrationdependent manner. It also significantly inhibited the migration and 
invasion of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells and affected the mRNA and protein 
expression of p62, Keap1, and Nrf2. In response to realgar, low p62 expression 
inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of Eca109 and KYSE150 
cells, as well as ferroptosis induction.
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that inhibiting the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 
signaling pathway promotes the inhibitory effects of realgar on EC cells."
817,"The pathophysiological importance of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cell cytokines in 
pathological pain has been highly debated in recent decades. However, the 
analgesic strategy targeting individual cytokines still has a long way to go for 
clinical application. In this review, we focus on the contributions of Th1 
cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and 
IL-13) in rodent pain models and human pain-related diseases. A large number of 
studies have shown that Th1 and Th2 cytokines have opposing effects on pain 
modulation. The imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines might determine the final 
effect of pain generation or inhibition. However, increasing evidence indicates 
that targeting the individual cytokine is not sufficient for the treatment of 
pathological pain. It is practical to suggest a promising therapeutic strategy 
against the combined effects of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. We summarize the current 
advances in stem cell therapy for pain-related diseases. Preclinical and 
clinical studies show that stem cells inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and 
release enormous Th2 cytokines that exhibit a strong analgesic effect. 
Therefore, a shift of the imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines induced by stem 
cells will provide a novel therapeutic strategy against intractable pain. Thus, 
it is extremely important to reveal the cellular and molecular mechanisms of 
stem cell-mediated analgesia. The efficiency and safety of stem cell therapy 
should be carefully evaluated in animal models and patients with pathological 
pain."
818,"Since late 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused 
considerable mortality worldwide. This pandemic raised concerns and provoked 
research on the diagnosis and treatment of viruses-based diseases. The accurate 
diagnosis of a virus requires high specificity and sensitivity. Piezoelectric 
sensors are analytical devices that work on mass-sensitivity-based 
micromechanical transducers. The change in the mass by the interaction between 
biological elements and the frequency is recorded by measuring the alternate 
current and voltage. In addition to diagnosis, antiviral intervention strategies 
for mitigating various viral diseases are required. Nanomaterials-based 
antiviral therapy is efficient, particularly with carbon/metal/metal oxide 
(organic/inorganic) nanoparticles. Metal/metal oxide nanoparticles, such as gold 
(Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), zinc oxide (ZnO), magnesium oxide 
(MgO), carbon dots (CDs), and carbon quantum dots (CQDs), are promising 
candidates for antiviral therapy. This review discusses the piezoelectric 
sensors used to detect various viruses, including COVID-19, and the various 
organic and inorganic nanoparticles involved in the antiviral therapy."
819,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the most important barriers to increasing life 
expectancy in all countries in the 21st century. Investigations of new 
anti-cancer drugs with low side effects are an urgent demand for medicinal 
chemists. Considering the known antitumor and immunomodulatory activity of 
thiazoles, this work presents the synthesis and antineoplastic activity of new 
thiazoles.
METHODS: The 22 new compounds (2a-v) were synthesized from different 
thiosemicarbazones and 2-bromoacetophenone. The compounds were evaluated on: 
MOLT-4, HL-60, HL-60/MX1, MM1S, SKMEL-28, DU145, MCF-7, and T47d.
RESULTS: Compound 2b induced cellular viability on MOLT-4 (37.1%), DU145 
(41.5%), and HL-60/MX1 (58.8%) cells. On MOLT-4 cells, compound 2b exhibited an 
IC50 of 8.03 μM, and against DU145 cells, an IC50 of 6.04μM. Besides, at IC50 
and fold of IC50, 20% to 30% of dead cells were found, most due to necrosis/late 
apoptosis. Most compounds showed no cytotoxicity against fibroblast cells L929 
at the concentrations tested. The compound did not alter the cell cycle of DU145 
cells when compared to the negative control. Therefore, compound 2b stands out 
against DU145 and MOLT-4 cells.
CONCLUSION: Our study reinforced the importance of 1,3-thiazoles nuclei in 
antitumor activity. In addition, derivative 2b stands out against DU145 and 
MOLT-4 cells and could be a starting point for developing new antineoplastic 
agents."
820,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to verify miRNAs and the molecular mechanisms of 
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for rectal adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Two miRNA datasets of rectal adenocarcinoma were obtained from GEO and 
TCGA. GEO2R tool, Venn diagram, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, KEGG pathway 
analyses, DIANA TOOLS, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for biological 
information analysis. The diagnostic utility of miRNAs and immune infiltration 
of tumors in Chinese patients were validated by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence 
analysis.
RESULTS: MiR-21-5P and miR-455-5p were both found to have a significant 
correlation with poor prognosis and higher expression in rectal adenocarcinoma. 
Besides, the ability to prognosis was independent of the clinicopathological 
stage. MiR-21-5P and miR-455-5p were enriched in the TGF-beta, Wnt, MAKP, and 
PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. Meanwhile, the high expression phenotype of 
miR-21-5P and miR-455-5p decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we found two significant diagnostic and prognostic 
miRNAs of rectal adenocarcinoma via integrated bioinformatics approach and 
clinical trials, which might decrease CD4+ and CD8+ T cells."
821,"BACKGROUND: The synthesis of conjugates with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs could improve their activity with less toxicity and these compounds could 
be used for the treatment of cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present investigation was the synthesis of 
3,5-bis(dodecyloxy)benzoate -PAMAM conjugates with indomethacin and mefenamic 
acid to examine their anticancer activity.
METHODS: The anticancer activity was studied of the conjugates against six human 
cancer cells U-251, PC-3, K-562, HCT-15, MCF-7, SKLU-1, and the COS-7 (as a 
control) cell lines. The conjugates with indomethacin and mefenamic acid were 
characterized by 1H, 13C NMR one- and two-dimension spectroscopy.
RESULTS: All the conjugates synthetized with indomethacin or mefenamic acid 
showed anticancer activity against all the human cancer cell lines. The first 
generation of indomethacin conjugates showed better activity against the PC-3 
(human prostatic adenocarcinoma) cell line than the second generation. But the 
second generation with indomethacin showed better activity against PC-3 than the 
first generation. The second-generation conjugate with mefenamic acid had strong 
selectivity to PC-3 cells with an IC50 value of 10.23±1.2 M in vitro.
CONCLUSION: In the paper, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic analyses of 
new indomethacin or mefenamic acid conjugates. The overall results showed that 
the conjugate of the second generation with mefenamic acid could be a potential 
nanocarrier for human prostatic adenocarcinoma cancer treatment, our research 
will be continued."
822,"BACKGROUND: Several chromene derivatives have a wide variety of biological and 
pharmacological activity. They had anticancer activity, antimicrobial activity, 
antituberculosis activity, anticonvulsant activity, antidiabetic activity, 
antichlolinesterase activity, and inhibitor of monoamine oxidase activity. The 
above-mentioned activities directed us to synthesize novel chromene derivatives, 
chromeno[2,3-d][1,3]oxazines, and chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidines. The starting 
material was 
2-amino-8-(2-chlorobenzylidene)-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile.
METHODS: Several novel chromene derivatives had been synthesized. Compound 1 
reacted with carbon disulfide, and ethyl chloroformate to afford chromene 
derivatives 2, 3. Chromene derivative 3 reacted with hydrazine dydrate to give 
compound 4. Chromene derivative 1 reacted with acetic acid and sulphuric acid to 
produce compounds 5, and 6. Amino derivative 5 reacted with chloro acyl 
derivative to afford compounds 7a-c which cycalized in dry xylene to afford 
compounds 8a-c. Chromene derivative 8a reacted with hydroxyl amine to afford 
compound 9.
RESULTS: The structures of novel synthesized chromene derivatives had been 
confirmed using mass spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Most of the prepared compounds 
were screened against liver cancer cell lines (HepG-2), human colon cancer cell 
lines (HT-29), and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (MCF-7). Chromene derivative 
2 had anticancer activity against human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29) higher 
than the reference drug doxorubicin. The rest of the tested compounds had 
anticancer activity against human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29) lower than 
that of the reference drug doxorubicin. Chromene derivative 5 had anticancer 
activity against liver cancer cell lines (HepG-2) higher than the reference drug 
doxorubicin.
CONCLUSION: Several chromene derivatives had been synthesized and their 
structures had been confirmed using different spectroscopic techniques. Some of 
the chromene derivatives that were screened against different cancer cell lines 
showed promising anticancer activity higher than the reference standard drug. 
For example, chromene derivative 2 had anticancer activity against human colon 
cancer cell lines (HT-29) higher than the reference drug doxorubicin. Chromene 
derivative 5 had anticancer activity against liver cancer cell lines (HepG-2) 
higher than the reference drug doxorubicin. Chromene derivative 6 had anticancer 
activity against breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (MCF-7) higher than the 
standard drug."
823,"BACKGROUND: Xanthones, natural or synthetic, due to their wide range of 
biological activities, have become an interesting subject of investigation for 
many researchers. Xanthonic scaffold has proven to have a vital role in 
anticancer drug development since many of its derivatives have shown anticancer 
activities on various cell lines. In addition, targeting epigenetic markers in 
cancer has yielded promising results. There have also been reports on the impact 
of xanthone and related polyphenolic compounds on epigenetics markers in cancer 
prevention and therapy.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to comprehensively highlight the main 
natural and non-natural sources of xanthones having potential anti-cancer 
effects along with their key structural elements, structure-activity 
relationships (SARs), mechanisms of action, and epigenetic profile of 
xanthone-based anti-cancer compounds. The challenges and future directions of 
xanthone-based therapies are also discussed briefly.
METHOD: The methods involved in the preparation of the present review included 
the collection of all recent information up to November 2021 from various 
scientific databases, indexed periodicals, and search engines such as Medline 
Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science, and Science 
Direct.
RESULTS: Exploration of the diversity of the xanthone scaffold led to the 
identification of several derivatives having prominent anti-cancer activity. 
Their unique structural diversity and synthetic modifications showed the ongoing 
endeavour of enriching the chemical diversity of the xanthone molecular 
framework to discover pharmacologically interesting compounds. However, studies 
regarding their modes of action, pharmacokinetic properties, clinical data, 
epigenetics, and safety are limited.
CONCLUSION: Elucidation of the exact biological mechanisms and the associated 
targets of xanthones will yield better opportunities for these compounds to be 
developed as potential anticancer drugs. Further clinical studies with 
conclusive results are required to implement xanthones as treatment modalities 
in cancer."
824,"BACKGROUND: p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is abnormally expressed in glioma, but 
its roles and mechanisms in glioma remain unclear. This study aims to explore 
the effects of PAK1 inhibition on the proliferation, migration and invasion of 
glioma cells.
METHODS: Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) 
incorporation and colony formation assays were performed to evaluate the effects 
of PAK1 inhibition on the proliferation of glioma cells. The cell cycle 
distribution and apoptosis rate of glioma cells were explored by flow cytometry. 
Wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to investigate the effects of 
PAK1 inhibition on glioma cell migration and invasion. The orthotopic xenograft 
glioma model was used to probe the effect of PAK1 silencing on glioma tumor 
formation.
RESULTS: PAK1 inhibition arrested cells at the G1 phase and induced apoptosis of 
glioma cells. Moreover, the knockdown of PAK1 decreased the protein expression 
levels of MDM2, p38, p-p38, cyclin D1, CDK4, Bcl-2, MMP2, MMP9, and cofilin but 
increased the protein levels of p53, Bax, p21 and cleaved caspase-3. A xenograft 
glioma model confirmed that the silencing of PAK1 repressed the formation of 
tumors induced by U87 cell transplantation.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that PAK1 inhibition impedes the proliferation, 
migration, and invasion of glioma cells."
825,"We report the histopathological, immunohistochemical (IHC), and molecular 
findings in 3 patients with adult pancreatoblastoma, including 2 with autopsy 
features. The tumors were located in the tail and body of the pancreas, and the 
2 autopsy examinations revealed liver and lung metastases. Histopathologically 
the neoplasms were composed of solid epithelial elements with nested or 
trabecular growth patterns, fibrous stroma, and squamoid clusters. Keratin 19 
was positive mainly in squamoid corpuscles, and trypsin or chymotrypsin was 
positive in the acinar component. Neuroendocrine differentiation was observed in 
all tumors, and nuclear β-catenin expression in 2 tumors. Despite nuclear 
β-catenin expression, CTNNB1 mutation was found only in tumor 2. APC mutation 
was detected in tumor 1, and SMAD4 as well as MEN1 mutations in tumor 3. This 
last tumor also revealed chromosomal instability with many chromosomal losses 
and gains. The follow-up showed regional or distant metastases in all patients. 
Two patients died of disease after 3 and 26 months of follow-up and 1 patient is 
alive with no evidence of disease 6 years and 2 months after surgery. Adult 
pancreatoblastoma can display genetic heterogeneity, diverse histological 
appearance, and overlapping IHC findings. As a result, the differential 
diagnosis with other adult pancreatic tumors, such as acinar cell carcinoma, 
neuroendocrine neoplasm, solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, and mixed tumors may be 
challenging, especially when dealing with limited tumor tissue. The 
identification of squamoid corpuscles is essential for diagnosis. Although 
molecular findings might provide useful information, the integration of 
clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings is essential in 
pancreatoblastoma diagnosis."
826,"Background: Methylated SEPT9 (mSEPT9) has a role in the occurrence and 
development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we studied the significance 
of plasma mSEPT9 for predicting prognosis-associated pathological parameters in 
patients with HCC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 205 subjects, 
including 111 HCC patients, 53 patients with at-risk liver disease (ARD) and 41 
healthy donors (HDs). Analysis of plasma mSEPT9 was performed using 
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Levels of mSEPT9 among different 
groups were compared using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test or a one-way 
ANOVA test. Correlations between pretreatment plasma mSEPT9 and 
clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed using the Chi-square. 
Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors related to 
microvascular invasion (MVI). Performance of variables for MVI prediction was 
evaluated by receiver operating characteristics curve. Results: A specific 
increase of plasma mSEPT9 in HCC was found when compared with ARD and HDs (HCC 
vs ARD, P  =  1.1  ×  10-5 and HCC vs HDs, P  =  3.7  ×  10-10). Pretreatment 
plasma mSEPT9 was significantly correlated tumor number (P  =  .004), tumor size 
(P  =  4.6  ×  10-5), MVI (P  =  .002) and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 
(P  =  .012). Levels of plasma mSEPT9 correlated significantly with Ki67 
expression in tumor (r  =  0.356, P  =  1.3  ×  10-4). Univariate and 
multivariate analyses showed that plasma mSEPT9 and serum protein induced by 
vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) were independent predictors for 
MVI. A combination of these 2 markers exhibited a larger areas under the curve 
(areas under the curve [AUC]  =  0.72) than mSEPT9 or PIVKA alone (AUC  =  0.67 
and 0.65), especially in early-stage HCC. Conclusions: Plasma mSEPT9 is a 
promising noninvasive biomarker for predicting MVI and tumor proliferation in 
HCC. Integration plasma mSEPT9 detection into clinical settings might facilitate 
the patient management."
827,"BACKGROUND Carney complex (CNC) is a rare multiple neoplasia syndrome with 
autosomal dominant inheritance. CNC is frequently misdiagnosed owing to its 
diverse clinical characteristics. We reported the case of a 14-year-old Saudi 
boy with a history of gynecomastia, Cushing syndrome, large-cell calcifying 
Sertoli cell tumor of the testis, and CNC. CASE REPORT The patient was referred 
to the pediatric endocrine clinic for evaluation of bilateral slow progressing 
gynecomastia for 1-year duration. His clinical examination revealed lentigenes, 
bilateral diffuse breast enlargement (consistent with Tanner stage III), and 
asymmetrical testicular enlargement, more on the left side. Other systemic 
examinations were unremarkable. The initial blood workup showed elevated 
estradiol level with unsuppressed cortisol after an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone 
suppression test. Breast ultrasound (US) confirmed true gynecomastia. Testicular 
US revealed microcalcification and the testicular biopsy confirmed diagnoses of 
large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor (LCCSCT). A 2-step dexamethasone 
suppression test showed a paradoxical rise in serum and urine cortisol levels, 
which are characteristic for PPNAD. LCCSCT and PPNAD are 2 major criteria 
fulfilling a diagnosis of CNC. The gene test showed heterozygous mutation in the 
PRKAR1A gene, which is diagnostic for CNC. The patient underwent bilateral 
mastoplasty and was planned for radical left orchiectomy. CONCLUSIONS 
Gynecomastia and LCCSCT can be presenting features of CNC, which mandates 
careful, thorough clinical examination and tailored investigation to reach a 
diagnosis."
828,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic wounds are a major drain on healthcare resources and can 
lead to substantial reductions in quality of life for those affected. Moreover, 
they often precede serious events such as limb amputations and premature death. 
In the long run, this burden is likely to escalate with an ageing population and 
lifestyle diseases such as obesity. Thus far, the identification of beneficial 
therapeutics against chronic wounds have been hindered by the lack of an ideal 
chronic wound animal model. Although animal models of delayed healing have been 
developed, none of these models fully recapitulate the complexity of the human 
chronic wound condition. Furthermore, most animals do not develop chronic 
wounds. Only the thoroughbred racehorse develops chronic ulcers.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, the different characteristics of chronic wounds 
that highlight its complexity are described. In addition, currently available 
models reflecting different aspects of chronic wound pathology and their 
relevance to human chronic wounds are discussed. This article concludes by 
listing relevant features representative of an ideal chronic wound model. 
Additionally, alternative approaches for the development of chronic wound models 
are discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: Delayed models of healing, including the streptozotocin diabetic 
model, skin flap model and magnet-induced IR models have emerged. While these 
models have been widely adopted for preclinical therapeutic testing, their 
relevance towards human chronic wounds remains debatable. In particular, current 
delayed healing models often fail to fully incorporate the key characteristics 
of chronic ulcers. Ultimately, more representative models are required to 
expedite the advancement of novel therapeutics to the clinic."
829,"The maize (Zea mays) ear represents one of the most striking domestication 
phenotypes in any crop species, with the cob conferring an exceptional yield 
advantage over the ancestral form of teosinte. Remodeling of the grain-bearing 
surface required profound developmental changes. However, the underlying 
mechanisms remain unclear and can only be partly attributed to the known 
domestication gene Teosinte glume architecture 1 (Tga1). Here we show that a 
more complete conversion involves strigolactones (SLs), and that these are 
prominent players not only in the Tga1 phenotype, but also other domestication 
features of the ear and kernel. Genetic combinations of a teosinte tga1 allele 
with three SL-related mutants progressively enhanced ancestral morphologies. The 
SL mutants, in addition to modulating the tga1 phenotype, also reshaped 
kernel-bearing pedicels and cupules in a teosinte-like manner. Genetic and 
molecular evidence are consistent with SL regulation of TGA1, including direct 
interaction of TGA1 with components of the SL-signaling system shown here to 
mediate TGA1 availability by sequestration. Roles of the SL network extend to 
enhancing maize seed size and, importantly, coordinating increased kernel growth 
with remodeling of protective maternal tissues. Collectively, our data show that 
SLs have central roles in releasing kernels from restrictive maternal encasement 
and coordinating other factors that increase kernel size, physical support, and 
their exposure on the grain-bearing surface."
830,"Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, with a 
5-year survival rate of about 10%. Early warning signs and symptoms of 
pancreatic cancer are vague or nonexistent, and most patients are diagnosed in 
Stage IV, when surgery is not an option for about 80%-85% of patients. For 
patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer, current conventional treatment 
modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) have suboptimal efficacy. 
Tumor progression is closely associated with the tumor microenvironment, which 
includes peripheral blood vessels, bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells, 
fibroblasts, immune cells, signaling molecules, and extracellular matrix. Tumor 
cells affect the microenvironment by releasing extracellular signaling 
molecules, inducing peripheral immune tolerance, and promoting tumor 
angiogenesis. In turn, the immune cells of the tumor affect the survival and 
proliferation of cancer cells. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are key cellular 
components in the tumor microenvironment and exert immunosuppressive functions 
by producing cytokines, recognizing other immune cells, and promoting tumor 
growth and metastasis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are the main regulator 
of the tumor immune response and a key target for tumor treatments. Since the 
combination of RT and immunotherapy is the main strategy for the treatment of 
pancreatic cancer, it is very important to understand the immune mechanisms 
which lead to MDSCs generation and the failure of current therapies in order to 
develop new target-based therapies. This review summarizes the research advances 
on the role of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the progression of pancreatic 
cancer and its treatment application in recent years."
831,"Differences in gene-wide DNA methylation of the Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)-associated genes BIN1, HLA-DRB5, SORL1, SLC24A4, and ABCA7 are reported to 
be associated with AD in post-mortem brain samples. We investigated whether the 
same associations could be found in leukocytes collected pre-mortem. Using 
cohort data of 544 Swedish twins (204 dementia diagnoses), we replicated the 
findings in HLA-DRB5 and SLC24A4 at P < 0.05. However, co-twin control analyses 
indicated that the associations were partly explained by familial confounding. 
Thus, DNA methylation differences in HLA-DRB5 and SLC24A4 are present in both 
neuronal cells and leukocytes, and not fully explained familial factors."
832,"BACKGROUND: Although many biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have been 
identified, their specificity and sensitivity remain unsatisfactory. Endothelial 
lipase gene (LIPG) plays an important role in a variety of cancers, but its role 
in lung adenocarcinoma remains unclear.
METHODS: TCGA, GEO, K-M plotter, CIBERSORT, GSEA, HPA, and GDSC were used to 
analyze LIPG in LUAD. Data analysis was mainly achieved by R 4.0.3.
RESULTS: The expression of LIPG in LUAD tissues was higher than that in adjacent 
normal tissues, especially in women, patients aged >65 years, and those with 
lymph node metastasis. High expression predicted a poor prognosis. The results 
of enrichment analysis suggest that LIPG may exert profound effects on the 
development of LUAD through multiple stages of lipid metabolism and immune 
system regulation. In addition, LIPG expression was significantly correlated 
with the expression levels of multiple immune checkpoint genes and the abundance 
of multiple immune infiltrates, including the activated memory CD4 T cell, M1 
macrophage, neutrophil, plasma cells, and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in the 
LUAD microenvironment content. At the same time, patients with high LIPG 
expression respond well to a variety of antitumor drugs and have a low rate of 
drug resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: LIPG is a prognostic marker and is associated with lipid metabolism 
and immune infiltration in LUAD."
833,"Pediatric oncology and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients are 
facing many gastrointestinal side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, 
vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea. International guidelines advise early enteral 
tube feeding as the first option of nutritional support in children undergoing 
myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. When using enteral 
feeding tubes for nutritional purposes as well as drug administration, some 
pharmaceutical, nursing, and technical issues have to be taken into account. 
Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone, widely used because of its broad spectrum 
antimicrobial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. However, its 
co-administration with polyvalent cations (as present in enteral feeding) makes 
the absorption of ciprofloxacin more difficult and may alter the pharmacokinetic 
parameters. Literature data are conflicting on how long the enteral feeding 
should be discontinued for patients receiving ciprofloxacin via an enteral 
feeding tube, ranging from 2 h before to 6 h after the administration of 
ciprofloxacin. Our research question was guided by challenges and concerns of 
nurses about the delay time between ciprofloxacin administration and restart of 
the enteral feeding without compromising the nutritional intake of the children. 
Our guideline was adapted, nurses were instructed accordingly, and patient 
leaflets with correct information were created."
834,"OBJECTIVE: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are new targeted therapies used to 
treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to RET gene 
rearrangements. The objective of this article is to review selpercatinib and 
pralsetinib in the context of RET-fusion-positive NSCLC.
DATA SOURCES: The pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials were evaluated regarding 
the use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib as treatment for RET-fusion-positive 
NSCLC. Comparative studies, review articles and current studies on selpercatinib 
and pralsetinib in RET-fusion-positive NSCLC were searched on pubmed.org and 
scholar.google.com using ""selpercatinib,"" ""pralsetinib,"" and ""NSCLC"" as 
keywords. Product monographs were searched on google.ca and uptodate.com using 
the keywords ""selpercatinib,"" ""pralsetinib,"" and/or ""monograph.""
DATA SUMMARY: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are orally administered highly 
selective RET inhibitors approved by the FDA following the accelerated approvals 
granted due to the pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials which evaluated 
selpercatinib and pralsetinib, respectively. Both drugs have shown efficacy for 
brain metastases and are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 through hepatic 
metabolism. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects of selpercatinib were 
hypertension, increased ALT level, and increased AST level while for 
pralsetinib, it was neutropenia, hypertension, and anemia. The safety profile 
shows similarities in severity and tolerability but additional monitoring for QT 
prolongation in patients on selpercatinib is recommended, compared to the risks 
of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis for patients on pralsetinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the increased use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib has led 
to the implementation of these drugs in the clinical practice of healthcare 
professionals such as pharmacists."
835,"Tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) are an important cash crop and are cultivated 
worldwide for their commercial value (Palanisamy et al. 2014). Tea gray blight 
is an important tea plant disease as it can cause a decline in tea quality and 
reduce yields by 20-30% (Sanjay et al. 2008). In August 2018, a disease survey 
was conducted on 400 ha of organic tea plantations in the Pu'er area of Yunnan 
Province (22.48° N, 100.58° E). The survey found that widespread disease was 
causing damage to 40% of the tea plantations and that the most seriously 
affected tea variety was Yunkang No. 10, which had an average disease incidence 
of 30-35%. The affected leaves grew small yellow-green spots on their tips or 
margins in the early stage that expanded into round or irregular brown spots 
with distinct concentric whorls and black conidial disks arranged in whorls when 
the humidity was high (Fig. 1A-B), which is consistent with tea gray blight 
disease (Zheng et al. 2021). Twenty-four diseased leaf samples were collected 
from four different tea plantations and transported to the Pu-Erh Tea Research 
Laboratory. Leaves with disease spots were cut into 4 mm ×4 mm square pieces, 
surface-sterilized with 75% alcohol for 1 min, disinfected with 1% sodium 
hypochlorite for 3 min, and washed thrice with sterile water. The tissue pieces 
were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates containing 100 µg ml-1 of 
chloramphenicol (Wang et al. 2021). After 3 d of culturing in the dark at 28 C, 
twenty pure cultures with similar morphology were obtained, and two 
representative isolates were selected and transferred into new PDA media. After 
7 d, circular fungal colonies with dense aerial mycelium produced black, wet 
spore masses that grew on the PDA media (Fig. 1C-D). The conidia were 
spindle-shaped with four septa, measuring 25.0 (21.0-26.0) × 6.0 (4.5-7.0) µm 
(n=15). The conidia had three median cells, two of which were dark brown in 
color with unclear separations, with a single basal hyaline appendage 3.8 
(3.5-4.5) µm (n=30) in length and 2-3 apical hyaline appendages 31 (27-35) µm in 
length (n=30) (Fig. 1E), similar to the conidial characteristics of 
Neopestalotiopsis piceana (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2014). Two isolates were 
selected for DNA extraction. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, 
partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-α) gene, and partial 
β-tubulin (tub2) gene were amplified using the ITS1F-ITS4 primer set (White et 
al 1990), the EF-1α-F and EF-1α-R primer sets (Li et al. 2018), and the tub1 and 
tub2 primers, respectively (Chauhan et al. 2007). The ITS (OP535632 to 
OP535632), tef1-α (OP589285,OP589287), and tub2 (OP589286,OP589288) sequences 
were submitted to NCBI GenBank. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis 
demonstrated that these sequences were 100% similar to those of N. piceana 
isolates available in GenBank. The sequences were compared using the Mafft 
software package, and sequences with the same ID were concatenated using 
scripts. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MEGA 
(ver. 5.1) software package based on the concatenated sequences (ITS, tef1-α, 
and tub2). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that C-5 and B-3 showed 95% bootstrap 
support with N. piceana isolates in references (Fig. 2). According to the 
morphology and molecular characterization, C-5 and B-3 were identified as N. 
piceana. Pathogenicity tests on these two isolates were conducted using 36 
healthy tea plants. The leaves were scratched slightly with sterile toothpick 
tips, after which pathogen cakes (6 mm diameter) were placed on the wounds with 
the mycelial side facing down and covered with sterile absorbent cotton to 
maintain a moist environment. Control leaves were wounded and covered with 
sterile PDA plugs (three replicates per treatment, three plants per replicate). 
Seven days later, the inoculated leaves exhibited similar symptoms observed 
under natural conditions, whereas the control leaves exhibited no symptoms. The 
same isolates as the introduced strains were isolated from the diseased tea 
leaves, completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report 
of N. piceana causing gray blight on tea leaves in China. These results provide 
valuable information for the prevention and management of gray blight on tea 
leaves. References: Chauhan, J. B., et al. 2007. Indian J Biotechnol. 6: 404-406

836,"Extranodal follicular dendritic cell sarcomas are infrequent diagnostically 
challenging tumors. Because of their rarity, heterogeneous histomorphologic 
features and variable histologic grades a significant number of extranodal 
lesions are prone to be misdiagnosed. Even though they have a characteristic 
immunoprofile, expression of a range of nonspecific markers is well documented. 
Even though they are typically negative for keratins, few authors have reported 
lesions expressing keratin. Keratin expressing tumors are more likely to be 
misinterpreted by pathologists further deterring their inclusion in the 
differential diagnosis. We report an intraabdominal mesenteric follicular 
dendritic cell sarcoma in a 44-year-old male that immunophenotypically expressed 
keratin antigens. The lesion showed a high-grade pleomorphic epithelioid 
appearance and the initial differential diagnosis included lymphoma, sarcomas, 
melanoma, and carcinomas. Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma was not considered. 
Expression of epithelial membrane antigen and keratin further deterred the 
diagnosis which was reached only after extensive use of immunomarkers. The tumor 
cells expressed CD21, CD23, and D2-40. Morphologically, the tumor showed some 
thymoma-like features with occasional TDT-expressing background T-lymphocytes. 
These features were hints to reconsider our differential diagnosis to include 
follicular dendritic cell tumors. Awareness of this aberrant staining of 
epithelial immunomarkers and attention to certain clues should encourage 
pathologists to consider this entity. Speculative assumptions may explain this 
unusual keratin expression in some lesions. The histomorphologic and 
immunohistochemical heterogeneity may suggest different variants and grades of 
follicular dendritic cell sarcomas. The prevalence, importance, and histogenesis 
of keratin expression in follicular dendritic cell sarcomas warrant further 
studies."
837,"Accumulation of neurotoxic protein aggregates is the pathological hallmark of 
neurodegenerative disease. Proper clearance of these waste metabolites is an 
essential process for maintaining brain microenvironment homeostasis and may 
delay or even halt the onset and progression of neurodegeneration. Vascular 
endothelial cells regulate the molecular exchange between the circulation and 
brain parenchyma, thereby protecting the brain against the entry of xenobiotics 
and decreasing the accumulation of neurotoxic proteins. In this review, we 
provide an overview of cerebrovascular endothelial cell characteristics and 
their impact on waste metabolite clearance. Lastly, we speculate that molecular 
changes in cerebrovascular endothelial cells are the drivers of 
neurodegenerative diseases."
838,"PURPOSE: To investigate the association of red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin 
(Hb), red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV), and red 
cell distribution width-standard deviation (RDW-SD) with preoperative deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA).
METHODS: A total of 2059 TJA patients were enrolled. We used the ratios of RBC, 
Hb, RDW-CV, and RDW-SD to DVT before TJA to create the receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve, thereby calculating the cut-off values and the area 
under the curve (AUC). The patients were categorized into groups based on 
cut-off value, and risk factors for DVT before TJA were subsequently analyzed. 
We included the variates that were statistically significant in the univariate 
analysis in the multivariate binary logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Preoperative DVT occurred in 107 cases (5.20%). Based on the ROC curve, 
we found that the AUC for RBC, Hb, RDW-CV, and RDW-SD were 0.658, 0.646, 0.568, 
and 0.586, respectively. Multivariate binary regression analysis revealed that 
the risk of preoperative DVT in TJA patients with RBC≤3.92*109 /L, Hb≤118g/L, 
RDW-CV≥13.2%, and RDW-SD≥44.6fL increased 3.02 (P < 0.001, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) [2.0-4.54]), 2.15 (P < 0.001, 95% CI [1.42-3.24]), 1.54 
(P = 0.038, 95% CI [1.03-2.3]), and 1.98 times (P = 0.001, 95% CI [1.32-2.98]), 
respectively. The risk of preoperative DVT in patients with corticosteroid use 
increased approximately 2.6 times (P = 0.002, 95% CI [1.22-5.81]).
CONCLUSION: We found that decreased RBC and Hb, increased RDW-CV and RDW-SD, and 
corticosteroid use were independent risk factors for preoperative DVT in 
patients undergoing TJA."
839,"Adrenal cortical cancer has a relatively low incidence, but a dismal 5-year 
survival rate. Surgical intervention is the gold standard of care today. In 
spite of this progress, patients continue to have a dismal outlook. The results 
of this study demonstrate that kinin superfamily (KIF) has strong ties to many 
different types of cancers. However, their prognostic and immune cell 
infiltration of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) remain unclear. Multiple 
databases were searched for information on the transcription level of KIFs, its 
correlation with clinical data of ACC patients, patients' overall survival (OS), 
first progression survival (FPS), and progression free interval (PFI). Its role 
and association with immune cells were also investigated. We observed an 
increase in the expression of KIF4A, KIF11, KIF20A, and KIF22. There was a 
strong correlation between them and the advancedness of ACC tumors. Parallel to 
this, KIFs are connected to the concepts of operating systems, distributed file 
systems, and partitioned file systems. Similarly, we found five key genes, PRC1, 
PLK1, KIF23, KIFC1, and KIF5A, through data analysis, all of which participate 
in multiple cellular pathways. Both KIF4A and KIF11 expression levels were 
marginally positively correlated with immune infiltration. Because KIF4A, KIF11, 
KIF20A, and KIF22 are involved in multiple ACC processes and can influence the 
onset and progression of ACC, they provide a mechanistically grounded framework 
for diagnosing and managing the disease."
840,"Brain state transitions are readily apparent from changes in brain rhythms1, but 
are difficult to predict, suggestive that the underlying cause is latent to 
passive recording methods. Among the most important transitions, clinically, are 
the starts of seizures. We here show that an ""active probing"" approach may have 
several important benefits for epileptic management, including by helping 
predict these transitions. We used mice expressing the optogenetic actuator, 
channelrhodopsin, in pyramidal cells, allowing this population to be stimulated 
in isolation. Intermittent stimulation at frequencies as low as 0.033 Hz 
(period = 30 s) delayed the onset of seizure-like events in an acute brain slice 
model of ictogenesis, but the effect was lost if stimulation was delivered at 
even lower frequencies (1/min). Notably, active probing additionally provides 
advance indication of when seizure-like activity is imminent, revealed by 
monitoring the postsynaptic response to stimulation. The postsynaptic response, 
recorded extracellularly, showed an all-or-nothing change in both amplitude and 
duration, a few hundred seconds before seizure-like activity began - a 
sufficient length of time to provide a helpful warning of an impending seizure. 
The change in the post-synaptic response then persisted for the remainder of the 
recording, indicative of a state change from a pre-epileptic to a pro-epileptic 
network. This occurred in parallel with a large increase in the 
stimulation-triggered Ca2+ entry into pyramidal dendrites, and a step increase 
in the number of postsynaptic somatic action potentials, both consistent with a 
reduction in the threshold for dendritic action potentials. In 0 Mg2+ bathing 
media, the reduced threshold was not associated with changes in glutamatergic 
synaptic function, nor of GABAergic release from either parvalbumin or 
somatostatin interneurons, but simulations indicate that the step change in the 
optogenetic response can instead arise from incremental increases in 
intracellular [Cl-]. The change in the response to stimulation was replicated by 
artificially raising intracellular [Cl-], using the optogenetic chloride-pump, 
Halorhodopsin. By contrast, increases in extracellular [K+] cannot account for 
the firing patterns in the response to stimulation, although this, and other 
cellular changes, may contribute to ictal initiation in other circumstances. We 
describe how these various cellular changes form a synergistic network of 
positive feedback mechanisms, which may explain the precipitous nature of 
seizure onset. This model of seizure initiation draws together several major 
lines of epilepsy research and as well as providing an important 
proof-of-principle regarding the utility of open-loop brain stimulation for 
clinical management of the condition."
841,"BACKGROUND: Bacteria belonging to the genus Mycoplasma are small-sized, have no 
cell walls and small genomes. They commonly cause respiratory disorders in their 
animal hosts. Three species have been found in the respiratory tract of horses 
worldwide, i.e. Mycoplasma (M.) equirhinis, M. pulmonis and M. felis, but their 
role in clinical cases remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to i) develop and validate tools to 
detect, isolate and identify different Mycoplasma spp. strains in clinical 
equine respiratory-tract specimens and ii) subsequently define the prevalence of 
the three species in France depending on sample types and horse characteristics 
(age, breed, sex).
STUDY DESIGN: Validation of a workflow for mycoplasma diagnosis and subsequent 
prevalence study.
METHODS: Mycoplasma-free tracheal wash samples spiked with numerated strains and 
DNA dilutions were used to validate the culture methods and real-time PCR 
(rt-PCR) assay. Isolated strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 
Prevalences were determined on a population of 616 horses with respiratory 
disorders, sampled in France in 2020.
RESULTS: In total, 104 horses (16.9%) were found to be positive for Mycoplasma 
spp. by at least one method. M. equirhinis was the predominant circulating 
species, accounting for 85% of the rt-PCR-positive samples and 98% of the 40 
cultured strains.
MAIN LIMITATION: The proposed pre-enrichment procedure improves the sensitivity 
of detection but hinders the quantification of initial mycoplasma load in the 
clinical specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of mycoplasma varied with age, breed, and type of 
sample. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
842,"Mitochondria, often called ""the powerhouse"" of the cell due to their role as the 
main energy supplier, regulate numerous complex processes including 
intracellular calcium homeostasis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, 
regulation of immune responses, and apoptosis. So, mitochondria are a 
fundamental metabolic hub that also control cell survival and cell death. 
However, they are not unique in all these functions. Indeed, peroxisomes are 
small cytoplasmic organelles that also ensure metabolic functions such as fatty 
acid oxidation and ROS production. This common relationship also extends beyond 
function as peroxisomes themselves can form from mitochondrial-derived 
precursors. Given this interconnection between mitochondria and peroxisomes 
involving biogenesis and function, in our recent work we determined if their 
turnover was also linked."
843,"Pontine infarction is the major subtype of brainstem stroke causing severe 
neurological deficits. The pathophysiology and treatment of pontine infarction 
was rarely studied. A rat model of acute pontine infarction was established via 
injection of endothelin-1 in the pons. Single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to 
detect the cellular response in pontine infarction. Based on this finding, a 
potential treatment for pontine infarction targeting microglia was verified. 
Occlusion of penetrating artery caused by endothelin-1 led to pontine 
infarction. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a subtype of activated 
microglia, SPP1+ microglia, which were different from M1-like or M2-like 
depolarization. SPP1+ microglia interacted with oligodendrocytes and contributed 
to the demyelination of nerve tracts. Cyclin B1 regulated the proliferation of 
SPP1+ microglia. Cucurbitacin E, a cyclin B1 inhibitor, reduced the 
proliferation of SPP1+ microglia around the injured myelin sheath and alleviated 
the demyelination. Moreover, cucurbitacin E treatment decreased the ischemic 
infarction volume and neurological deficits after pontine infarction. SPP1+ 
microglia contributed to axonal demyelination in the pontine infarction, and 
inhibition of SPP1+ microglia provided neuroprotection for pontine infarction."
844,"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a frequent event in patients 
undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and is 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to eventual progress to 
end-organ disease. Letermovir prophylaxis for CMV infections has become a 
standard of care in adult HCT recipients due to its efficacy and high 
tolerability. However, it is not yet approved for paediatric patients.
OBJECTIVE: In a retrospective single-centre observational study we evaluated the 
use of letermovir for prophylaxis or pre-emptive treatment of cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) infection in seropositive paediatric HCT recipients receiving the compound 
outside of clinical trials. The primary endpoint was CMV reactivation requiring 
a change of medication.
METHODS: A total of 17 patients (seven female/ten male; median age 12.2 
[range 3.5-19] years, median body weight 39.5 [range 15-63] kg; median follow-up 
time 463.7 [range 41-1022] days) were identified who were started on oral (14) 
or intravenous (3) followed by oral (2) letermovir shortly after neutrophil 
engraftment at doses determined on the basis of age, weight, and concomitant 
cyclosporine use.
RESULTS: Five patients had no evidence of viral replication (prophylactic use), 
while 12 patients had varying extents of viral replication (pre-emptive 
therapy). A change of therapy was required in one patient due to a sustained 
increase in CMV viral load, and in two patients, letermovir was stopped without 
later reactivation after initiation of palliative care for recurrent leukaemia. 
Of the 14 patients who completed treatment, 3 had evidence of transient viral 
replication after end of treatment that required no further antiviral treatment. 
No patients (of 17) discontinued letermovir due to an adverse event.
CONCLUSION: Letermovir was effective in controlling CMV infection in 
seropositive paediatric allogeneic HCT recipients and was overall well 
tolerated. Pending completion of the still ongoing paediatric investigation 
plans, letermovir will be an important adjunct to our options for control of 
infectious complications in this special population."
845,"Pectate lyases (Pels) have a vital function in degradation of the primary plant 
cell wall and the middle lamella and have been widely used in the industry. In 
this study, two pectate lyase genes, IDSPel16 and IDSPel17, were cloned from a 
sheep rumen microbiome. The recombinant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia 
coli and functionally characterized. Both IDSPel16 and IDSPel17 proteins had an 
optimal temperature of 60 ℃, and an optimal pH of 10.0. IDSPel16 was relatively 
stable below 60 °C, maintaining 77.51% residual activity after preincubation at 
60 °C for 1 h, whereas IDSPel17 denatured rapidly at 60 °C. IDSPel16 was 
relatively stable between pH 6.0 and 12.0, after pretreatment for 1 h, retaining 
over 60% residual activity. IDSPel16 had high activity towards polygalacturonic 
acid, with a Vmax of 942.90 ± 68.11, whereas IDSPel17 had a Vmax of only 
28.19 ± 2.23 μmol/min/mg. Reaction product analyses revealed that IDSPel17 
liberated unsaturated digalacturonate (uG2) and unsaturated trigalacturonate 
(uG3) from the substrate, indicating a typical endo-acting pectate lyase (EC 
4.2.2.2). In contrast, IDSPel16 initially generated unsaturated 
oligogalacturonic acids, then converted these intermediates into uG2 and 
unsaturated galacturonic acid (uG1) as end products, a unique depolymerization 
profile among Pels. To the best of our knowledge, the IDSPel16 discovered with 
both endo-Pel (EC 4.2.2.2) and exo-Pel (EC 4.2.2.9) activities. These two 
pectate lyases, particularly the relatively thermo- and pH-stable IDSPel16, will 
be of interest for potential application in the textile, food, and feed 
industries. KEY POINTS: • Two novel pectate lyase genes, IDSPel16 and IDSPel17, 
were isolated and characterized from the sheep rumen microbiome. • Both IDSPel16 
and IDSPel17 are alkaline pectate lyases, releasing unsaturated digalacturonate 
and unsaturated trigalacturonate from polygalacturonic acid. • IDSPel16, a 
bifunctional pectate lyase with endo-Pel (EC 4.2.2.2) and exo-Pel (EC 4.2.2.9) 
activities, could be a potential candidate for industrial application."
846,"""Oligoastrocytoma"" disappeared as of the revised fourth edition of the World 
Health Organization Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System,

histopathological and genetic backgrounds of cases with dual features of 
astrocytoma/oligodendroglioma have been sparsely reported. We encountered a 
54-year-old man with right frontal glioma comprising two distinct parts on 
imaging and histopathological examination: grade 4 astrocytoma with IDH1-R132H, 
ATRX loss, p53-positivity and intact 1p/19q; and oligodendroglioma with 
IDH1-R132H, intact ATRX, p53-negativity and partially deleted 1p/19q. At 
recurrence, histopathology showed low-grade mixed astrocytic and 
oligodendroglial features: the former with IDH1-R132H, ATRX loss, p53-positivity 
and intact 1p/19q and the latter showing IDH1-R132H, intact ATRX, p53-negativity 
and 1p/19q codeletion. At second recurrence, histopathology was astrocytoma 
grade 4 with IDH1-R132H, ATRX loss, p53-positivity and intact 1p/19q. Notably, 
1p/19q codeletion was acquired at recurrence and CDKN2A was deleted at second 
recurrence. These findings suggest insights into tumorigenesis: (1) gliomas with 
two distinct lineages might mix to produce ""oligoastrocytoma""; and (2) 1p/19q 
codeletion and CDKN2A deletion might be acquired during chemo-radiotherapy. 
Ultimately, astrocytic and oligodendroglial clones might co-exist 
developmentally or these two lineages might share a common cell-of-origin, with 
IDH1-R132H as the shared molecular feature."
847,"Copper causes significant damage to the integrity of many bacteria, mainly at 
the DNA level, through its redox states, as well as its reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) generating capacity at the cellular level. But whether these mechanisms 
also apply to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is unknown. In 
the present study, we have evaluated whether copper ions produce damage at the 
DNA level of MAP, either through their redox states or through ROS production. 
MAP-spiked PBS was first supplemented with different copper chelators (2) and 
ROS antioxidants (3), followed by treatment with copper ions at 942 ppm. MAP DNA 
integrity (qPCR, magnetic phage separation) was then evaluated. We found that 
bathocuproine (BCS), as a chelator, and D-mannitol, as an antioxidant of 
hydroxyl radicals, had a significant protective effect (P < 0.05) on DNA 
molecules, and that EDTA, as a chelator, and D-mannitol, as an antioxidant had a 
significant positive effect (P < 0.05) on the viability of this pathogen in 
contrast to the control and other chelators and anti-oxidants used. In light of 
the reported findings, it may be concluded that copper ions within MAP cells are 
directly related to MAP DNA damage."
848,"BACKGROUND: Performing selective esophagectomy for locally advanced squamous 
cell carcinoma may spare patients morbidity, but delayed surgery may infer 
higher risks. This study evaluated the impact of length of time between 
chemoradiation and esophagectomy on perioperative outcomes and long-term 
survival.
METHODS: The impact of surgical timing, stratified by surgery performed < 180 
and ≥ 180 days from starting radiation, on perioperative outcomes and survival 
in patients treated with chemoradiation and esophagectomy for cT1N + M0 and 
cT2-4, any N, M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the mid-distal esophagus in the 
National Cancer Database (2006-2016) was evaluated with logistic regression, 
Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional-hazards methods, and propensity-matched 
analysis.
RESULTS: Median time between starting radiation and esophagectomy in 1641 
patients was 93 (IQR 81-114) days. Most patients (96.8%, n = 1589) had surgery 
within 180 days of starting radiation, while 52 patients (3.2%) had delayed 
surgery. Black race and clinical T stage were associated with delayed surgery. 
Rates of pathologic upstaging, downstaging, complete response, and positive 
margins were not significantly different between the groups. Patients with 
delayed surgery had increased major morbidity as measured by a composite of 
length of hospital stay, readmission, and 30-day mortality [42.3% (22/52) vs 
22.3% (355/1589), p = 0.001]. However, delayed surgery was not associated with a 
significant difference in survival in both univariate [5-year survival 32.8% 
(95% CI 21.1-50.7) vs 47.3% (44.7-50.1), p = 0.19] and multivariable analysis 
[hazard ratio (HR) 1.23 (0.85-1.78), p = 0.26].
CONCLUSIONS: Delaying surgery longer than 180 days after starting chemoradiation 
for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is associated with worse perioperative 
outcomes but not long-term survival."
849,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that 
even at very low levels can cause cancer by increasing the activity of tumor 
cells and suppressing the immune system. There is also little information on 
OCPs and survival after diagnosis. The aim of this study was to monitor the 
concentration of OCPs in the blood serum of cancer patients and its relationship 
with their socio-demographic characteristics and ultimately that impact on 
survival time and hazard ratio (HR). This cross-sectional study included 89 
diagnosed patients with cancer in Isfahan, Iran. 12 types of OCPs were measured 
in serum by gas chromatography (7GC) with an electron capture detector and 
equipped with mass spectrometer (MS). Also, participants' questionnaire was 
completed to collect information. T-test, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests were used 
to evaluate the association between serum levels of OCPs and quantitative and 
qualitative information of patients. Survival analysis was also examined based 
on Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox model. The mean of total OCPs in 
patients' serum was calculated to be 1.82 ± 1.36 μg/L. Concentration of 2,4' DDE 
had a significant relationship with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (P < 0.05). In 
addition, gender revealed a significant correlation in estimating survival time 
(P < 0.05). Non-exposure to OCPs showed a positive effect on increasing the life 
expectancy of patients. Lindane and endosulfan increased the risk of death by 
16% and 37%, respectively, with insignificant P value (P > 0.05). The findings 
of the present study showed adverse effects of OCPs on patients' survival time 
and increased mortality of HR. Moreover, as the first research conducted in the 
study area, it is suggested management of environmental, individual and social 
factors that could be influenced the biological accumulation of OCPs in humans 
and cause health promotion."
850,"The study's objective was to ascertain the results of sub-chronic therapy of 
various diuretics on the ischemia/reperfusion dysfunction of the heart in 
hypertensive rats by a global ischemia in an isolated rat heart model. The 
research included 40 spontaneously hypertensive male rats (Wistar Kyoto strain, 
body mass 250 ± 30 g, 8 weeks old) grouped into four groups. The animals were 
treated for 4 weeks with 10 mg/kg of hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, or 
spironolactone per os. After a period of sub-chronic treatment, we analyzed 
hemodynamic measurements, echocardiography, and myocardial function according to 
the Langendorff retrograde perfusion method. The hearts were subjected to 20 min 
of global ischemia and then reperfused for 30 min (I20:R30). Cardiovascular 
parameters that depict the left ventricle functions were continuously monitored, 
while flowmetry was used to determine coronary flow values. Markers of oxidative 
stress were estimated from coronary venous effluent using spectrophotometry. All 
three examined diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone, indapamide) 
lowered the production of the majority of the detected prooxidants, reducing 
myocardial oxidative damage. The cardiological examination of heart function in 
vivo demonstrated that treatment with indapamide and spironolactone mitigates 
left ventricular hypertrophy but without significant lowering of blood pressure 
or increment in ejection fraction. Additionally, monitoring of cardiac function 
ex vivo indicated the cardiodepressant effect of spironolactone in spontaneously 
hypertensive rats."
851,"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a 
potentially curative therapy for malignant hematologic disorders. Novel 
anti-infection agents have successfully decreased the risk of fatal infections 
post-HSCT in recent years, but the relapse of primary disease and 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remain the major causes of death for transplant 
recipients, and significantly deteriorate the quality of life. Thus, it is 
crucial to maintain the immune homeostasis in transplant recipients and balance 
the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and GVHD.
METHODS: We reviewed the recently published literatures on immune checkpoint 
(IC) and targeted agents in relapse and GVHD after allogeneic HSCT RESULTS: 
Emerging data suggest that IC is an attractive target to modulate immune 
responses, and accumulating evidences of IC-targeted agents have been published 
for the treatment of malignancies and autoimmune disorders. The unique mechanism 
of IC-targeted agents, which affects the immune homeostasis of the transplant 
recipient by modulating alloreactivity, minimizes the risk of organ toxicity and 
immunosuppression associated with conventional therapy CONCLUSION: There is an 
increase in literature reporting the application of immune checkpoint-targeted 
agents in HSCT settings, and an overview will benefit further exploration in 
this field."
852,"Despite improvement of current treatment strategies and novel targeted drugs, 
relapse and treatment resistance largely determine the outcome for acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) patients. To identify the underlying molecular characteristics, 
numerous studies have been aimed to decipher the genomic- and transcriptomic 
landscape of AML. Nevertheless, further molecular changes allowing malignant 
cells to escape treatment remain to be elucidated. Mass spectrometry is a 
powerful tool enabling detailed insights into proteomic changes that could 
explain AML relapse and resistance. Here, we investigated AML samples from 47 
adult and 22 pediatric patients at serial time-points during disease progression 
using mass spectrometry-based in-depth proteomics. We show that the proteomic 
profile at relapse is enriched for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and subunits 
of the respiratory chain complex, indicative of reprogrammed energy metabolism 
from diagnosis to relapse. Further, higher levels of granzymes and lower levels 
of the anti-inflammatory protein CR1/CD35 suggest an inflammatory signature 
promoting disease progression. Finally, through a proteogenomic approach, we 
detected novel peptides, which present a promising repertoire in the search for 
biomarkers and tumor-specific druggable targets. Altogether, this study 
highlights the importance of proteomic studies in holistic approaches to improve 
treatment and survival of AML patients."
853,"Nuclear factor I-C (NFIC) belongs to a family of NFI transcription factors that 
binds to DNA through CAATT-boxes and are involved in cellular differentiation 
and stem cell maintenance. Here we show NFIC protein is significantly 
overexpressed in 69% of acute myeloid leukemia patients. Examination of the 
functional consequences of NFIC overexpression in HSPCs showed that this protein 
promoted monocytic differentiation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis further 
demonstrated that NFIC overexpressing monocytes had increased expression of 
growth and survival genes. In contrast, depletion of NFIC through shRNA 
decreased cell growth, increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML cell 
lines and AML patient blasts. Further, in AML cell lines (THP-1), bulk RNA 
sequencing of NFIC knockdown led to downregulation of genes involved in cell 
survival and oncogenic signaling pathways including mixed lineage leukemia-1 
(MLL-1). Lastly, we show that NFIC knockdown in an ex vivo mouse MLL::AF9 
pre-leukemic stem cell model, decreased their growth and colony formation and 
increased expression of myeloid differentiation markers Gr1 and Mac1. 
Collectively, our results suggest that NFIC is an important transcription factor 
in myeloid differentiation as well as AML cell survival and is a potential 
therapeutic target in AML."
854,"The corneal endothelium is a monolayer, which mediates solute and water flux 
across the posterior corneal surface. Alcaine's main component proparacaine is 
paramount in human corneal endothelium (HCE) cell regulation. This study 
explored the mechanism of alcaine in regulating HCE cells. HCE cell morphology 
under gradient concentrations was observed by an optical microscope. Cell 
proliferation and viability were detected by MTT assay to determine the half 
inhibitory concentration (IC 50). Cell apoptosis rate, HIF-1α mRNA expression, 
and HIF-1α, p/t-JNK and Caspase-3 protein levels were detected by flow 
cytometry, RT-qPCR, and Western blot. After treatment with alcaine at 
0.625-5 g/L concentration range for 24 h, HCE cells showed cytoplasmic 
vacuolation, cell shrinkage, separation from culture matrix, and eventual death. 
Alcaine treated-HCE cell proliferation was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. 
The IC 50 of alcaine was 1.26 g/L. After alcaine treatment, HCE cell apoptosis 
rate was promoted and HIF-1α levels in HCE cells were stimulated. Knockdown of 
HIF-1α partially annulled the effects of alcaine on inhibiting HCE cell 
proliferation and facilitating apoptosis. Alcaine might activate the 
JNK/caspase-3 pathway by increasing HIF-1α. The inhibition of the JNK/caspase-3 
pathway partially abrogated the effects of alcaine on inhibiting HCE cell 
proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Alcaine might affect HCE cell 
proliferation and apoptosis by upregulating HIF-1α and activating the 
JNK/caspase-3 pathway."
855,"BACKGROUND: Recently, molecular tumour boards (MTBs) have been integrated into 
the clinical routine. Since their benefit remains debated, we assessed MTB 
outcomes in the Comprehensive Cancer Center Ostbayern (CCCO) from 2019 to 2021.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 251 patients were included. Targeted sequencing 
was performed with PCR MSI-evaluation and immunohistochemistry for PD-L1, Her2, 
and mismatch repair enzymes. 125 treatment recommendations were given (49.8%). 
High-recommendation rates were achieved for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
(20/30, 66.7%) and gastric adenocarcinoma (10/16, 62.5%) as opposed to 
colorectal cancer (9/36, 25.0%) and pancreatic cancer (3/18, 16.7%). MTB 
therapies were administered in 47 (18.7%) patients, while 53 (21.1%) received 
alternative treatment regimens. Thus 37.6% of recommended MTB therapies were 
implemented (47/125 recommendations). The clinical benefit rate 
(complete + partial + mixed response + stable disease) was 50.0% for MTB and 
63.8% for alternative treatments. PFS2/1 ratios were 34.6% and 16.1%, 
respectively. Significantly improved PFS could be achieved for 
m1A-tier-evidence-based MTB therapies (median 6.30 months) compared to 
alternative treatments (median 2.83 months; P = 0.0278).
CONCLUSION: The CCCO MTB yielded a considerable recommendation rate, 
particularly in cholangiocarcinoma patients. The discrepancy between the 
low-recommendation rates in colorectal and pancreatic cancer suggests the 
necessity of a weighted prioritisation of entities. High-tier recommendations 
should be implemented predominantly."
856,"BACKGROUND: Targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from FFPE specimens is used 
clinically in cancer for its ability to estimate gene expression and to detect 
fusions. Using a cohort of NSCLC patients, we sought to determine whether 
targeted RNA-seq could be used to measure tumour mutational burden (TMB) and the 
expression of immune-cell-restricted genes from FFPE specimens and whether these 
could predict response to immune checkpoint blockade.
METHODS: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas LUAD dataset, we developed a method for 
determining TMB from tumour-only RNA-seq and showed a correlation with DNA 
sequencing derived TMB calculated from tumour/normal sample pairs (Spearman 
correlation = 0.79, 95% CI [0.73, 0.83]. We applied this method to targeted 
sequencing data from our patient cohort and validated these results against TMB 
estimates obtained using an orthogonal assay (Spearman correlation = 0.49, 95% 
CI [0.24, 0.68]).
RESULTS: We observed that the RNA measure of TMB was significantly higher in 
responders to immune blockade treatment (P = 0.028) and that it was predictive 
of response (AUC = 0.640 with 95% CI [0.493, 0.786]). By contrast, the 
expression of immune-cell-restricted genes was uncorrelated with patient 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: TMB calculated from targeted RNA sequencing has a similar diagnostic 
ability to TMB generated from targeted DNA sequencing."
857,"BACKGROUND: The TGF-β1 transcription factor SMAD3 is epigenetically repressed in 
tumour-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) from lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) but 
not adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients, which elicits a compensatory increase in 
SMAD2 that renders SCC-TAFs less fibrotic. Here we examined the effects of 
altered SMAD2/3 in fibroblast migration and its impact on the desmoplastic 
stroma formation in lung cancer.
METHODS: We used a microfluidic device to examine descriptors of early 
protrusions and subsequent migration in 3D collagen gels upon knocking down 
SMAD2 or SMAD3 by shRNA in control fibroblasts and TAFs.
RESULTS: High SMAD3 conditions as in shSMAD2 fibroblasts and ADC-TAFs exhibited 
a migratory advantage in terms of protrusions (fewer and longer) and migration 
(faster and more directional) selectively without TGF-β1 along with Erk1/2 
hyperactivation. This enhanced migration was abrogated by TGF-β1 as well as low 
glucose medium and the MEK inhibitor Trametinib. In contrast, high SMAD2 
fibroblasts were poorly responsive to TGF-β1, high glucose and Trametinib, 
exhibiting impaired migration in all conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The basal migration advantage of high SMAD3 fibroblasts provides a 
straightforward mechanism underlying the larger accumulation of TAFs previously 
reported in ADC compared to SCC. Moreover, our results encourage using MEK 
inhibitors in ADC-TAFs but not SCC-TAFs."
858,"Multiple heavy metal contamination is an increasingly common global problem. 
Heavy metals have the potential to disrupt microbially mediated biogeochemical 
cycling. However, systems-level studies on the effects of combinations of heavy 
metals on bacteria are lacking. For this study, we focused on the Oak Ridge 
Reservation (ORR; Oak Ridge, TN, USA) subsurface which is contaminated with 
several heavy metals and high concentrations of nitrate. Using a native Bacillus 
cereus isolate that represents a dominant species at this site, we assessed the 
combined impact of eight metal contaminants, all at site-relevant 
concentrations, on cell processes through an integrated multi-omics approach 
that included discovery proteomics, targeted metabolomics, and targeted 
gene-expression profiling. The combination of eight metals impacted cell 
physiology in a manner that could not have been predicted from summing 
phenotypic responses to the individual metals. Exposure to the metal mixture 
elicited a global iron starvation response not observed during individual metal 
exposures. This disruption of iron homeostasis resulted in decreased activity of 
the iron-cofactor-containing nitrate and nitrite reductases, both of which are 
important in biological nitrate removal at the site. We propose that the 
combinatorial effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple heavy metals is an 
underappreciated yet significant form of cell stress in the environment with the 
potential to disrupt global nutrient cycles and to impede bioremediation efforts 
at mixed waste sites. Our work underscores the need to shift from single- to 
multi-metal studies for assessing and predicting the impacts of complex 
contaminants on microbial systems."
859,"AIM: To evaluate the real-world usage pattern and factors associated with the 
effectiveness of regorafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC).
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data for 209 patients with mCRC 
treated with regorafenib as third or later line of therapy. TheKaplan-Meier 
method was used to draw the survival curves. Cox proportional hazard regression 
models were used to analyze the prognostic value for overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Of 209 patients, 156 (75%) were treated with regorafenib, and 53 (25%) 
were given regorafenib combined with programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors. 
About 182 (87%) patients had a dose record of regorafenib. The initial daily 
doses of regorafenib were 160, 120, 80, and 40 mg, accounting for 29%, 17%, 48%, 
and 6% of patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 11.3 months, and 
the median OS was 12.0 months (95% CI: 9.7-14.3). Patients treated with PD-1 
inhibitors plus regorafenib had a longer OS than the non-PD-1 group (13.5 vs. 
10.1 months, hazard ratio [HR] = .534, 95% CI: .325-.879; p = .014). A total of 
49 patients with microsatellite stable or mismatch repair-proficient genotype 
treated with PD-1 inhibitors plus regorafenib had a longer OS than the non-PD-1 
group (13.5 vs. 9.7 months; HR = .563, p = .027). The median OS of patients 
continuing treatment with regorafenib after progression (n = 19, with five 
patients receiving additional immunotherapy) was marginally longer than patients 
discontinuing regorafenib after progression (12.7 vs. 11.9 months, p = .425) 
observed in a smaller cohort.
CONCLUSION: In real-world practice, patients with mCRC in whom standard regimens 
had failed have a good survival benefit with regorafenib. Combination with PD-1 
inhibitor may further prolong survival of the patients."
860,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) show high efficiency in a small fraction of 
advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, personalized immune subtypes have not 
been developed for the prediction of ICI efficiency in GC. Herein, we identified 
Pan-Immune Activation Module (PIAM), a curated gene expression profile (GEP) 
representing the co-infiltration of multiple immune cell types in tumor 
microenvironment of GC, which was associated with high expression of 
immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. We also identified 
Pan-Immune Dysfunction Genes (PIDG), a conservative PIAM-derivated GEP 
indicating the dysfunction of immune cell cooperation, which was associated with 
upregulation of metastatic programs (extracellular matrix receptor interaction, 
TGF-β signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and calcium signaling) but 
downregulation of proliferative signalings (MYC targets, E2F targets, mTORC1 
signaling, and DNA replication and repair). Moreover, we developed 
'GSClassifier', an ensemble toolkit based on top scoring pairs and extreme 
gradient boosting, for population-based modeling and personalized identification 
of GEP subtypes. With PIAM and PIDG, we developed four Pan-immune Activation and 
Dysfunction (PAD) subtypes and a GSClassifier model 'PAD for individual' with 
high accuracy in predicting response to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in advance GC 
(AUC = 0.833). Intriguingly, PAD-II (PIAMhighPIDGlow) displayed the highest 
objective response rate (60.0%) compared with other subtypes (PAD-I, 
PIAMhighPIDGhigh, 0%; PAD-III, PIAMlowPIDGhigh, 0%; PAD-IV, PIAMlowPIDGlow, 
17.6%; P = 0.003), which was further validated in the metastatic urothelial 
cancer cohort treated with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) (P = 0.018). In all, we 
provided 'GSClassifier' as a refined computational framework for GEP-based 
stratification and PAD subtypes as a promising strategy for exploring ICI 
responders in GC. Metastatic pathways could be potential targets for GC patients 
with high immune infiltration but resistance to ICI therapy."
861,"Glioma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults with high 
morbidity and mortality. Rapid proliferation and diffuse migration are the main 
obstacles to successful glioma treatment. Xanthatin, a sesquiterpene lactone 
purified from Xanthium strumarium L., possesses a significant antitumor role in 
several malignant tumors. In this study, we report that xanthatin suppressed 
glioma cells proliferation and induced apoptosis in a time- and 
concentration-dependent manner, and was accompanied by autophagy inhibition 
displaying a significantly reduced LC3 punctate fluorescence and LC3II/I ratio, 
decreased level of Beclin 1, while increased accumulation of p62. Notably, 
treating glioma cells with xanthatin resulted in obvious activation of the 
PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, as indicated by increased mTOR and Akt 
phosphorylation, decreased ULK1 phosphorylation, which is important in 
modulating autophagy. Furthermore, xanthatin-mediated pro-apoptosis in glioma 
cells was significantly reversed by autophagy inducers (rapamycin or Torin1), or 
PI3K-mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. Taken together, these findings indicate that 
anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects of xanthatin in glioma are most 
likely by inhibiting autophagy via activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, 
suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy against glioma."
862,"Many roles of human platelets in health and disease are linked to their ability 
to transport and secrete a variety of small molecules and proteins carried in 
dense (δ-) and α-granules. Determination of granule number and content is 
important for diagnosis of platelet disorders and for studies of platelet 
structure, function, and development. We have optimized methods for detection 
and localization of platelet proteins via antibody and lectin staining, imaging 
via structured illumination laser fluorescence microscopy (SIM), and 
three-dimension (3D) image analysis. The methods were validated via comparison 
with published studies based on electron microscopy and high-resolution 
fluorescence microscopy. The α-granule cargo proteins thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), 
osteonectin (SPARC), fibrinogen (FGN), and Von Willebrand factor (VWF) were 
localized within the granule lumen, as was the proteoglycan serglycin (SRGN). 
Colocalization analysis indicates that staining with fluorescently labeled wheat 
germ agglutinin (WGA) allows detection of α-granules as effectively as 
immunostaining for cargo proteins, with the advantage of not requiring 
antibodies. RAB27B was observed to be concentrated at dense granules, allowing 
them to be counted via visual scoring and object analysis. We present a workflow 
for counting dense and α-granules via object analysis of 3D SIM images of 
platelets stained for RAB27B and with WGA.Abbreviation: SIM: structured 
illumination microscopy; WGA: wheat germ agglutinin; FGN: fibrinogen; TSP1:

863,"AIM: Progesterone resistance is an epigenetic factor that reduces endometrial 
receptivity and causes implantation failure in women with endometriosis. In 
addition, dysregulated miRNAs contribute to the underlying pathogenic mechanisms 
of endometriosis. This study aimed to determine the effect of miR-297 on the 
progesterone receptor (PR) expression and on insufficient decidualization of 
endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) within the eutopic endometria of infertile 
women with minimal or mild endometriosis.
METHODS: ESCs were isolated from infertile endometriosis and normal patients and 
were transfected with miR-297 mimic or miR-297 inhibitor or respective control. 
qRT-PCR and western blot were conducted to quantify the expression of miR-297 
and PR. The effect of miR-297 on ESCs decidualization was investigated by 
induced decidualization in vitro.
RESULTS: We observed an increase in miR-297 expression and a decrease in the 
expression of PR in the ESCs from endometriosis patients. Moreover, the 
expression of PR, most notably PRB, was found to be downregulated following 
transfection with miR-297 mimic and upregulated following treatment with miR-297 
inhibitor. In addition, overexpressed miR-297 inhibited the decidualization of 
ESCs in vitro. We further determined that miR-297 exerts direct regulatory 
effects on PR expression.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that miR-297 interferes with fertility by 
repressing the expression of PR and preventing efficient decidualization in 
eutopic endometria. Further, miR-297 directly contributes to progesterone 
resistance in minimal or mild cases of endometriosis. Thus, regulation of 
miR-297 may prove to be a promising therapeutic strategy for endometriosis."
864,"Despite immunotherapy emerging as a vital approach to improve cancer treatment, 
the activation of efficient immune responses is still hampered by 
immunosuppression, especially due to the low tumor immunogenicity. Immunogenic 
cell death (ICD) is a promising strategy to reshape the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) for achieving high immunogenicity. Various stimuli are able to effectively 
initiate their specific ICD by utilizing the corresponding ICD-inducer. However, 
the ICD-guided antitumor immune effects are usually impaired by various 
biological barriers and TME-associated immune resistance. Biomimetic active 
materials are being extensively explored as guided agents for ICD due to their 
unique advantages. In this review, two major strategies are systematically 
introduced that have been employed to exploit biomimetic active materials guided 
ICD for cancer immunotherapy, mainly including naive organism-derived nanoagents 
and engineered bioactive platforms. This review outlines the recent advances in 
the field at biomimetic active materials guided physiotherapy, chemotherapy, and 
biotherapy for ICD induction. The advances and challenges of biomimetic active 
materials guided ICD for cancer immunotherapy applications are further discussed 
in future clinical practice. This review provides an overview of the advances of 
biomimetic active materials for targeting immunoregulation and treatment and can 
contribute to the future of advanced antitumor combination therapy."
865,"Synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has emerged as a favorable therapeutic 
approach to fight cancer. However, design of an effective photothermal 
immunotherapy system to suppress tumor growth and simultaneously inhibit tumor 
metastases continues to be a challenge. Here a dual toll-like receptor agonists 
delivery system CPG@Au NRs/m-R848 for combined photothermal immunotherapy of 
melanoma is developed. CPG@Au NRs/m-R848 displays strong antitumor effects by 
promoting maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and reprogramming of M2 
macrophages into M1 phenotype. Moreover, immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by 
photothermal ablation of Au NRs could synergistically produce in situ 
vaccination effect with CPG ODN and R848, generating systemic and lasting 
antitumor immunity. It is further proved that CPG@Au NRs/m-R848 treatment 
inhibits tumor growth in bilateral B16F10 tumors model by eliciting CD8+ T cell 
response. Overall, this work suggests that this strategy hold great potential in 
tumor immunotherapy by regulating tumor-associated macrophage polarization, 
triggering DCs maturation and inducing ICD."
866,"The synthesized 11 artemisinin-isatin hybrids 5a-c and 6a-h tethered via 
ethylene linker were assessed for their in vitro antiproliferative activity 
against A549 and H1299 nonsmall-cell lung cancer cell lines as well as their 
cytotoxicity towards BEAS-2B human normal lung epithelial cells. The preliminary 
results showed that hybrids 5a-c and 6a-h did not show any cytotoxicity (IC50 : 
>100 µM) on BEAS-2B cells, and also possessed potential activity (IC50 : 
6.99-76.49 µM) against A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines. The representative 
hybrid 6c (IC50 : 6.99 and 7.57 µM) was far more potent than artemisinin (IC50 : 
>100 µM) and dihydroartemisinin (IC50 : >100 µM), and was slightly less active 
than doxorubicin (IC50 : 4.14 and 2.77 µM). Moreover, hybrid 6c also exhibited 
an excellent safety profile and good selectivity with SI values of >13.21. 
Therefore, hybrid 6c could serve as a promising candidate for further in vivo 
evaluations."
867,"Imaging of iron-based nanoparticles (NPs) remains challenging because of the 
presence of endogenous iron in tissues that is difficult to distinguish from 
exogenous iron originating from the NPs. Here, an analytical cascade for 
characterizing the biodistribution of biomedically relevant iron-based NPs from 
the organ scale to the cellular and subcellular scales is introduced. The 
biodistribution on an organ level is assessed by elemental analysis and 
quantification of magnetic iron by electron paramagnetic resonance, which 
allowed differentiation of exogenous and endogenous iron. Complementary to these 
bulk analysis techniques, correlative whole-slide optical and electron 
microscopy provided spatially resolved insight into the biodistribution of endo- 
and exogenous iron accumulation in macrophages, with single-cell and 
single-particle resolution, revealing coaccumulation of iron NPs with endogenous 
iron in splenic macrophages. Subsequent transmission electron microscopy 
revealed two types of morphologically distinct iron-containing structures 
(exogenous nanoparticles and endogenous ferritin) within membrane-bound vesicles 
in the cytoplasm, hinting at an attempt of splenic macrophages to extract and 
recycle iron from exogenous nanoparticles. Overall, this strategy enables the 
distinction of endo- and exogenous iron across scales (from cm to nm, based on 
the analysis of thousands of cells) and illustrates distribution on organ, cell, 
and organelle levels."
868,"INTRODUCTION: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard of care in inoperable 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, favoring concurrent (cCRT) over 
sequential CRT (seqCRT), with adjuvant immunotherapy in responders. Elderly and 
frail NSCLC patients have generally been excluded from trials in the past. In 
elderly patients however, the higher treatment related morbidity of cCRT, may 
outweigh the possible lower tumor control of seqCRT. For elderly patients with 
locally advanced NSCLC real-world data is essential to be able to balance 
treatment toxicity and treatment outcome. The aim of this study is to analyze 
acute toxicity and 3-month mortality of curative chemoradiation (CRT) in 
patients with stage III NSCLC and to analyze whether cCRT for elderly stage III 
NSCLC patients is safe.
METHODS: The Dutch Lung Cancer Audit-Radiotherapy (DLCA-R) is a national lung 
cancer audit that started in 2013 for patients treated with curative intent 
radiotherapy. All Dutch patients treated for stage III NSCLC between 2015 and 
2018 with seqCRT or cCRT for (primary or recurrent) stage III lung cancer are 
included in this population-based study. Information was collected on patient, 
tumor- and treatment characteristics and the incidence and severity of acute 
non-hematological toxicity (CTCAE-4 version 4.03) and mortality within 3 months 
after the end of radiotherapy. To evaluate the association between prognostic 
factors and outcome (acute toxicity and mortality within 3 months), an 
univariable and multivariable analysis was performed. The definition of cCRT 
was:radiotherapy started within 30 days after the start of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Out of all 20 Dutch departments of radiation oncology, 19 centers 
participated in the registry. A total of 2942 NSCLC stage III patients were 
treated with CRT. Of these 67.2% (n = 1977) were treated with cCRT (median age 
66 years) and 32.8% (n = 965) were treated with seqCRT (median age 69 years). 
Good performance status (WHO 0-1) was scored in 88.6% for patients treated with 
cCRT and in 71.0% in the patients treated with seqCRT. Acute nonhematological 
3-month toxicity (CTCAE grade ≥3 or radiation pneumonitis grade ≥2) was scored 
in 21.9% of the patients treated with cCRT and in 17.7% of the patients treated 
with seqCRT. The univariable analysis for acute toxicity showed significantly 
increased toxicity for cCRT (P = .008), WHO ≥2 (P = .006), and TNM IIIC 
(P = .031). The multivariable analysis for acute toxicity was significant for 
cCRT (P = .015), WHO ≥2 (P = .001) and TNM IIIC (P = .016). The univariable 
analysis for 3-month mortality showed significance for seqCRT (P = .025), WHO ≥2 
(P < .001), higher cumulative radiotherapy dose (P < .001), higher gross tumor 
volume total (P = .020) and male patients (p < .001). None of these variables 
reached significance in the multivariable analysis for 3-month mortality.
CONCLUSION: In this national lung cancer audit of inoperable NSCLC patients, 
3-month toxicity was significantly higher in patients treated with cCRT (21.9% 
vs. 17.7% for seqCRT) higher TNM stage IIIC, and poor performance (WHO≥2) 
patients.The 3-months mortality was not significantly different for tested 
parameters. Age was not a risk factor for acute toxicity, nor 3 months 
mortality."
869,"Exogenous polyamines are able to induce life span and improve glucose 
homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, the effects of exogenous 
polyamines on adipocyte differentiation and which polyamine transporters mediate 
them have not been elucidated yet. Here, we identified for the first time that 
exogenous polyamines can clearly stimulate adipocyte differentiation through 
polyamine transporters, solute carrier family 3 member A2 (SLC3A2) and SLC7A1. 
Exogenous polyamines markedly promote 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation by 
increasing the intracellular lipid accumulation and the expression of both 
adipogenic and lipogenic genes in a concentration-dependent manner. In 
particular, exogenous putrescine mainly regulates adipocyte differentiation in 
the early and intermediate stages. Moreover, we have assessed the expression of 
polyamine transporter genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. 
Interestingly, the putrescine-induced adipocyte differentiation was found to be 
significantly suppressed in response to a treatment with a polyamine transporter 
inhibitor (AMXT-1501). Furthermore, knockdown experiments using siRNA that 
specifically targeted SLC3A2 or SLC7A2, revealed that both SLC3A2 and SLC7A2 act 
as important transporters in the cellular importing of exogenous putrescine. 
Thus, the exogenous putrescine entering the adipocytes via cellular transporters 
is involved in adipogenesis through a modulation of both the mitotic clonal 
expansion and the expression of master transcription factors. Taken together, 
these results suggest that exogenous polyamines (such as putrescine) entering 
the adipocytes through polyamine transporters, can stimulate adipogenesis."
870,"Aging is a major risk factor for common neurodegenerative diseases. Although 
multiple molecular, cellular, structural, and functional changes occur in the 
brain during aging, the involvement of caveolin-2 (Cav-2) in brain ageing 
remains unknown. We investigated Cav-2 expression in brains of aged mice and its 
effects on endothelial cells. The human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs) showed decreased THP-1 adhesion and infiltration when treated with 
Cav-2 siRNA compared to control siRNA. In contrast, Cav-2 overexpression 
increased THP-1 adhesion and infiltration in HUVECs. Increased expression of 
Cav-2 and iba-1 was observed in brains of old mice. Moreover, there were fewer 
iba-1-positive cells in the brains of aged Cav-2 knockout (KO) mice than of 
wild-type aged mice. The levels of several chemokines were higher in brains of 
aged wild-type mice than in young wild-type mice; moreover, chemokine levels 
were significantly lower in brains of young mice as well as aged Cav-2 KO mice 
than in their wild-type counterparts. Expression of PECAM1 and VE-cadherin 
proteins increased in brains of old wild-type mice but was barely detected in 
brains of young wild-type and Cav-2 KO mice. Collectively, our results suggest 
that Cav-2 expression increases in the endothelial cells of aged brain, and 
promotes leukocyte infiltration and age-associated neuroinflammation."
871,"Liver cancer has a high prevalence, with majority of the cases presenting as 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognosis of metastatic HCC has hardly 
improved over the past decade, highlighting the necessity for liver cancer 
research. Studies have reported the ability of the KiSS1 gene to inhibit the 
growth or metastasis of liver cancer, but contradictory research results are 
also emerging. We, therefore, sought to investigate the effects of KiSS1 on 
growth and migration in human HCC cells. HepG2 human HCC cells were infected 
with lentivirus particles containing KiSS1. The overexpression of KiSS1 resulted 
in an increased proliferation rate of HCC cells. Quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction and immunoblotting revealed increased Akt activity, and downregulation 
of the G1/S phase cell cycle inhibitors. A significant increase in tumor 
spheroid formation with upregulation of β-catenin and CD133 was also observed. 
KiSS1 overexpression promoted the migratory, invasive ability, and metastatic 
capacity of the hepatocarcinoma cell line, and these effects were associated 
with changes in the expressions of epithelial mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)-related genes such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and slug. KiSS1 
overexpression also resulted in dramatically increased tumor growth in the 
xenograft mouse model, and upregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA) and Ki-67 in the HCC tumors. Furthermore, KiSS1 increased the angiogenic 
capacity by upregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) 
and CD31. Based on these observations, we infer that KiSS1 not only induces HCC 
proliferation, but also increases the metastatic potential by increasing the 
migratory ability and angiogenic capacity."
872,"Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have great 
potential in applications such as regenerative medicine, cardiac disease 
modeling, and in vitro drug evaluation. However, hPSC-CMs are immature, which 
limits their applications. During development, the maturation of CMs is 
accompanied by a decline in their proliferative capacity. This phenomenon 
suggests that regulating the cell cycle may facilitate the maturation of 
hPSC-CMs. Aurora kinases are essential kinases that regulate the cell cycle, the 
role of which is not well studied in hPSC-CM maturation. Here, we demonstrate 
that CYC116, an inhibitor of Aurora kinases, significantly promotes the 
maturation of CMs derived from both human embryonic stem cells (H1 and H9) and 
iPSCs (induced PSCs) (UC013), resulting in increased expression of genes related 
to cardiomyocyte function, better organization of the sarcomere, increased 
sarcomere length, increased number of mitochondria, and enhanced physiological 
function of the cells. In addition, a number of other Aurora kinase inhibitors 
have also been found to promote the maturation of hPSC-CMs. Our data suggest 
that blocking aurora kinase activity and regulating cell cycle progression may 
promote the maturation of hPSC-CMs."
873,"A structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2), nucleocapsid (N) protein is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase 
kinase (GSK)-3 on the serine/arginine (SR) rich motif located in disordered 
regions. Although phosphorylation by GSK-3β constitutes a critical event for 
viral replication, the molecular mechanism underlying N phosphorylation is not 
well understood. In this study, we found the putative alpha-helix L/FxxxL/AxxRL 
motif known as the GSK-3 interacting domain (GID), found in many endogenous 
GSK-3β binding proteins, such as Axins, FRATs, WWOX, and GSKIP. Indeed, N 
interacts with GSK-3β similarly to Axin, and Leu to Glu substitution of the GID 
abolished the interaction, with loss of N phosphorylation. The N phosphorylation 
is also required for its structural loading in a virus-like particle (VLP). 
Compared to other coronaviruses, N of Sarbecovirus lineage including bat RaTG13 
harbors a CDK1-primed phosphorylation site and Gly-rich linker for enhanced 
phosphorylation by GSK-3β. Furthermore, we found that the S202R mutant found in 
Delta and R203K/G204R mutant found in the Omicron variant allow increased 
abundance and hyper-phosphorylation of N. Our observations suggest that GID and 
mutations for increased phosphorylation in N may have contributed to the 
evolution of variants."
874,"Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a highly aggressive pediatric malignancy with 
no effective therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a target for the 
development of novel molecule-targeting therapeutic agents. In this study, we 
report the importance of the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and 
RUNX1-Baculoviral IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) Repeat-Containing 5 
(BIRC5/survivin) axis in the proliferation of MRT cells, as it can be used as an 
ideal target for anti-tumor strategies. The mechanism of this reaction can be 
explained by the interaction of RUNX1 with the RUNX1-binding DNA sequence 
located in the survivin promoter and its positive regulation. Specific knockdown 
of RUNX1 led to decreased expression of survivin, which subsequently suppressed 
the proliferation of MRT cells in vitro and in vivo. We also found that our 
novel RUNX inhibitor, Chb-M, which switches off RUNX1 using alkylating 
agent-conjugated pyrrole-imidazole polyamides designed to specifically bind to 
consensus RUNX-binding sequences (5'-TGTGGT-3'), inhibited survivin expression 
in vivo. Taken together, we identified a novel interaction between RUNX1 and 
survivin in MRT. Therefore the negative regulation of RUNX1 activity may be a 
novel strategy for MRT treatment."
875,"Taste sensation is the process of converting chemical identities in food into a 
neural code of the brain. Taste information is initially formed in the taste 
buds on the tongue, travels through the afferent gustatory nerves to the sensory 
ganglion neurons, and finally reaches the multiple taste centers of the brain. 
In the taste field, optical tools to observe cellular-level functions play a 
pivotal role in understanding how taste information is processed along a 
pathway. In this review, we introduce recent advances in the optical tools used 
to study the taste transduction pathways."
876,"Our current understanding of variation in mitochondrial performance is 
incomplete. The production of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation is dependent, in 
part, upon the structure of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Morphology of the 
inner membrane is crucial for the formation of the proton gradient across the 
inner membrane and, therefore, ATP synthesis. The inner mitochondrial membrane 
is dynamic, changing shape and surface area. These changes alter density (amount 
per volume) of the inner mitochondrial membrane within the confined space of the 
mitochondrion. Because the number of electron transport system proteins within 
the inner mitochondrial membrane changes with inner mitochondrial membrane area, 
a change in the amount of inner membrane alters the capacity for ATP production 
within the organelle. This review outlines the evidence that the association 
between ATP synthases, inner mitochondrial membrane density, and mitochondrial 
density (number of mitochondria per cell), impact ATP production by 
mitochondria. Further, we consider possible constraints on the capacity of 
mitochondria to produce ATP by increasing inner mitochondrial membrane density."
877,"Ethanol exposures have been reported to disrupt the development of the retina 
and optic nerve which can be considered as part of underlying mechanisms of 
visual pathway impairments. This study aims to investigate the cellular 
integrity of the retina and the expression of melatonin receptor (MTNR1A) in the 
retina when assaulted chronically and simultaneously by ethanol and 
acetaminophen. Animals were randomly grouped into five groups. Control (normal 
saline), Alcohol group (25% alcohol in 2% sucrose solution), Acetaminophen 
group, (100 mg/kg BW for 14 days), Acetaminophen + Alcohol group (25% alcohol in 
2% sucrose solution + 100 mg/kg BW of paracetamol). Withdrawal group (25% 
alcohol in 2% sucrose solution + 100 mg/kg BW of paracetamol). The body weight 
and rectal temperature of the animals were taking every 2 days and a post mortem 
study was conducted by quantitatively assessing the markers of oxidative stress. 
Melatonin level was quantified in the retina tissue and Immunohistochemistry was 
done via MTNR1A to study the expression of melatonin receptor type 1A in the 
retina. These results demonstrate that alcohol and acetaminophen significantly 
reduced the activity of retina rat melatonin (MTNR1A) levels, lowers the SOD and 
MDA activity. Expression of MTNR1A was reduced in the ganglionic cell layer of 
Alcohol and acetaminophen group as compared to the control and withdrawal group. 
It can be inferred that chronic simultaneous intake/consumption of alcohol and 
acetaminophen altered the melatonin level in the retina and this may implicate 
the circadian clock and melatonin in Wistar rat visual system."

879,"BACKGROUND: Herein, for the first time, we present a case with mixed invasive 
micropapillary and neuroendocrine mammary neoplasm.
CASE: The patient, a 65-year-old postmenopausal woman, had become aware of a 
tumor in her right breast 11 months prior to presentation at our hospital. The 
cut surface of the mastectomy specimen contained a well-circumscribed, 
multinodular, red-brown tumor, measuring 15x15x15 cm. Histopathologically, this 
solid cystic lesion consisted of medullary growth of cancer cells accompanied by 
a well-developed vascular network as well as conspicuous hemorrhage. Cancer cell 
nests of various sizes displayed an ""inside-out"" structure surrounded by empty 
spaces. Most cancer cells were polygonal, though a few were short 
fusiform-shaped, and possessed finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm and 
ovoid, fine-granular nuclei. Eighteen mitotic figures were observed in 10 
high-power fields. Macrometastases, up to 13x8 mm in size, with the same 
morphological features as the original tumor site, were identified in 3 of 15 
dissected right axillary nodes. Immunohistochemically, primary and metastatic 
cancer cells were diffusely positive for chromogranin A and the estrogen 
receptor (Allred's total score: 8) and focally reactive for synaptophysin and 
the progesterone receptor (total score: 5). HER2 and cytokeratin 5/6 were 
negative, and the MIB-1 labelling index was 36.2%. MUC1 and EMA lined the 
stroma-facing surfaces of the cell membranes, indicating reversed polarity.
CONCLUSION: Our current patient, who had an invasive breast carcinoma with 
concomitant neuroendocrine and micropapillary features, developed multiple nodal 
metastases in association with a large-diameter tumor showing a luminal B-like 
immuno-profile. Accordingly, meticulous clinical follow-up remains essential for 
this uncommon case."
880,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created 
a public health emergency globally. SARS-CoV-2 enters the human cell through the 
binding of the spike protein to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
receptor. Significant changes have been reported in the mutational landscape of 
SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein, subsequent to 
evolution of the pandemic. The present study examines the correlation between 
the binding affinity of mutated S-proteins and the rate of viral infectivity. 
For this, the binding affinity of SARS-CoV and variants of SARS-CoV-2 towards 
ACE2 was computationally determined. Subsequently, the RBD mutations were 
classified on the basis of the number of strains identified with respect to each 
mutation and the resulting variation in the binding affinity was computationally 
examined. The molecular docking studies indicated a significant correlation 
between the Z-Rank score of mutated S proteins and the rate of infectivity, 
suitable for predicting SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Accordingly, a 30-mer peptide 
was designed and the inhibitory properties were computationally analyzed. Single 
amino acid-wise mutation was performed subsequently to identify the peptide with 
the highest binding affinity. Molecular dynamics and free energy calculations 
were then performed to examine the stability of the peptide-protein complexes. 
Additionally, selected peptides were synthesized and screened using a 
colorimetric assay. Together, this study developed a model to predict the rate 
of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants and propose a potential peptide that can 
be used as an inhibitor for the viral entry to human.Communicated by Ramaswamy

881,"Lung cancer is a severe health problem that affects more men than women around 
the world. The goal of this study was to identify the biomarker hub genes for 
lung cancer in order to ascertain the biological pathway and protein- protein 
interaction networks. The microarray datasets GSE80796, GSE68571, GSE118370 and 
GSE43458 were retrieved from the GEO database and were analysed using GEO2R. 
STRING, Cytoscape, and cytoHubba were used to construct the PPI network and hub 
genes. GEPIA was used to obtain the overall survival and expression level in 
LUAD/LUSC and normal tissue. The MTT assay was used to examine antiproliferative 
activity. PI staining was used to determine the cell cycle arrest. qPCR was used 
to analyse gene expressions. The datasets revealed a total of 401 common DEGs, 
with 258 up-regulated genes and 143 down-regulated genes. Further, in-vitro 
study of gallic acid cytotoxic effect in human lung cancer cell line A549 
indicated that gallic acid dramatically suppressed cell growth in A549 cells. 
Gallic acid also, significantly promoted programmed cell death by halting cells 
in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, our study indicated that 
gallic acid is a promising natural STAT1 inhibitor as it hindered lung cancer 
progression by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis which can be employed to 
increase the therapeutic efficacy of existing lung cancer treatments and to 
improve overall patient survival.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
882,"Cardiovascular diseases have been the leading cause of death worldwide during 
the past several decades. Cell loss is the main problem that resulted in cardiac 
dysfunction and further mortality. Cell therapy aiming to replenish the lost 
cells is proposed to treat cardiovascular diseases especially ischemic heart 
diseases which lead to a big portion of cell loss. Due to the direct injection's 
low cell retention and survival ratio, cell therapy using biomaterials as cell 
carriers attracts more and more attention because of their promotion of cell 
delivery and maintenance at the aiming sites. In this review, we systematically 
summarized the three main factors involved in cell therapy for myocardial tissue 
regeneration: cell sources (somatic cells, stem cells and engineered cells), 
chemical components of cell carriers (natural materials, synthetic materials and 
electroactive materials), and categories of cell delivery materials (patches, 
microspheres, injectable hydrogels, nanofiber and microneedles, etc.). An 
introduction of the methods including magnetic 
resonance/radionuclide/photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging for tracking the 
behavior of transplanted cells in vivo is also included. Current challenges of 
biomaterials-based cell therapy and their future directions are provided to give 
both beginners and professionals a clear view of the development and future

883,"The metabolism of tomato fruits changes when plants experience drought stress. 
In this study, we investigated changes in microRNA abundance and detected 32 
miRNA (microRNA)s whose expression changes in fruit. The candidate target genes 
for each miRNA were predicted from the differentially expressed genes identified 
by transcriptome analysis at the same fruit maturation stage. The predicted 
targeted genes were related to cell wall metabolisms, response to pathogens, and 
plant hormone. Among these, we focused on cell-wall metabolism related genes and 
performed a dual luciferase assay to assess the targeting of their mRNAs by 
their predicted miRNA. As a result, sly-miR10532 and sly-miR7981e suppress the 
expression of mRNAs of galacturonosyltransferase-10 like encoding the main 
enzyme of pectin biosynthesis, while sly-miR171b-5p targets β-1,3-glucosidase 
mRNAs involved in glucan degradation. These results will allow the systematic 
characterization of miRNA and their target genes in tomato fruit under drought 
stress condition."
884,"Since the early 1970s, the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has 
undergone a major transformation. Initially based on only two drugs, an 
anthracycline and cytosine arabinoside, the aim of therapy was to achieve a 
haematological response allowing patients to recover and go home. Back in those 
early days, cure was not a realistic expectation. Treatment was analogous to a 
heart attack; upon recovery and a short respite, recurrence and death inevitably 
followed. Over the subsequent decades, slow but remarkable progress was made 
such that a subgroup of young adults could become long-term survivors. This 
astonishing feat was achieved initially without the use of new drugs. Supportive 
care played a major role with the widespread availability of platelet 
transfusions and improved antimicrobial therapy, particularly antifungal. No 
less important was the better use of existing drugs and the development of 
allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation. While initially the focus was on 
maximal tolerated therapy, an understanding of the immunologic role of 
allogeneic transplantation, better genetic characterization of the biology of 
the disease, advanced tools for detection of minimal disease as well as the 
recent development of new drugs changed the focus to a more refined approach 
targeting patients who are more likely to respond. Clearly, the historical 
paradigm where the term AML was generic and applicable to all patients requires 
a rethinking from the traditional therapeutic demarcations of therapy into 
phases of induction, consolidation and maintenance. These evolving new concepts 
and paradigm will be herein considered."
885,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal codominant hereditary 
illness marked by the heightened risk of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease and high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). FH 
patients can have homozygous or heterozygous variants. This condition has been 
linked to variations in the genes for the LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B, 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9), and LDLR adaptor protein 1. 
Drugs such as statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors are currently widely 
available, allowing for the theoretical normalization of plasma LDL-C levels 
mostly in patients with heterozygous FH. However, homozygous FH patients usually 
have a poor response to traditional lipid-lowering therapy and may have a poor 
prognosis at a young age. LDL apheresis and novel pharmacological therapies such 
as microsomal transfer protein inhibitors or anti-angiopoietin-like protein 3 
monoclonal antibodies are extremely expensive and unavailable in most regions of 
the world. Therefore, the unmet need persists for these patients. In this 
review, we discuss the numerous gene delivery, gene editing, and stem cell 
manipulation techniques used in this study to correct FH-causing LDLR gene 
variations in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Finally, we looked at a variety of 
studies that corrected genetic defects that caused FH using the ground-breaking 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats

886,"The status of lymph node involvement is a major component of the tumor, node, 
metastasis (TNM) staging system. The N categories for lung cancer have remained 
unchanged since the 4th edition of the TNM staging system, partly because of 
differences in nodal mapping nomenclature, partly because of insufficient 
details to verify possible alternative approaches for staging. In preparation 
for the rigorous analysis of the International Association for the Study of Lung 
Cancer (IASLC) database necessary for the 9th edition TNM staging system, 
members of the N-Descriptors Subcommittee of the IASLC Staging and Prognostic 
Factors Committee reviewed the evidence for alternative approaches to 
categorizing the extent of lymph node involvement with lung cancer which is 
currently based solely on the anatomic location of lymph node metastasis. We 
reviewed the literature focusing on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to 
stimulate dialogue and mutual understanding among subcommittee members engaged 
in developing the 9th edition TNM staging system for lung cancer, which has been 
proposed for adoption by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for 
International Cancer Control in 2024. The discussion of the range of possible 
revision options for the N categories, including the pros and cons of counting 
lymph nodes, lymph node stations or lymph node zones also provides transparency 
to the process, explaining why certain options may be discarded, others deferred 
for future consideration. Finally, we provide a preliminary discussion of the 
future directions that the N-Descriptors Subcommittee might consider for the 
10th edition and beyond."
887,"Genome-scale target identification promises to guide microbial cell factory 
engineering for higher-titer production of biomolecules such as recombinant 
proteins (r-protein), but challenges remain due to the need not only for 
comprehensive genotypic perturbation but also in conjunction with 
high-throughput phenotypic screening strategies. Here, we developed a 
CRISPRi-microfluidics screening platform to systematically identify crucial gene 
targets that can be engineered to enhance r-protein secretion in Corynebacterium 
glutamicum. We created a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library containing 46,549 
single-guide RNAs, where we aimed to unbiasedly target all genes for repression. 
Meanwhile, we developed a highly efficient droplet-based microfluidics system 
integrating the FlAsH-tetracysteine assay that enables screening of millions of 
strains to identify potential knockdowns conducive to nanobody VHH secretion. 
Among our highest-ranking candidates are a slew of previously unknown targets 
involved in transmembrane transport, amino-acid metabolism and redox regulation. 
Guided by these findings, we eventually constructed a hyperproducer for multiple 
proteins via combinatorial engineering of redox-response transcription factors. 
As the near-universal applicability of CRISPRi technology and the FlAsH-based 
screening platform, this procedure might be expanded to include a varied variety 
of microbial species and recombinant proteins."
888,"To provide for the globally increasing demand for proteinaceous food, microbial 
protein (MP) has the potential to become an alternative food or feed source. 
Phosphorus (P), on the other hand, is a critical raw material whose global 
reserves are declining. Growing microbial protein on recovered phosphorus, for 
instance, struvite obtained from wastewater treatment, is a promising MP route 
production that could supply protein-rich products while handling P scarcity. In 
this study, effect of MP media was explored with respect to struvite dissolution 
kinetics, and additionally different MP were characterized with struvite as sole 
P-source. Different operational parameters, including pH, temperature, contact 
surface area, and ion concentrations were tested, and struvite dissolution rates 
were observed between 0.32 and 4.7 g P/L/d and a solubility between 0.23 and 
2.22 g P-based struvite/L. Growth rates and protein production of the microalgae 
Chlorella vulgaris and Limnospira sp. (previously known as Arthrospira sp.), and 
the purple non‑sulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris on struvite were 
equal to or higher than growth on conventional potassium phosphate. For aerobic 
heterotrophic bacteria, two slow-growing communities showed decreased growth on 
struvite, while the growth was increased for a third fast-growing one. 
Furthermore, protein content on struvite was always comparable to the obtained 
when grow on standard media. Together with the low content in metals and 
micropollutants, these results demonstrate that struvite can be directly applied 
as an effective nutrient source to produce fast-growing MP, without any previous 
diluting step. Combining a high purity recovered product with an efficient way 
of producing protein results in a strong environmental improvement."
889,"The place cells and well-defined oscillatory population rhythms of the rodent 
hippocampus have served as a powerful model system in linking cells and circuits 
to memory function. While the initial three decades of place cell research 
primarily focused on the activity of neurons during exploration, the last 
twenty-five years have seen growing interest in the physiology of the 
hippocampus at rest. During slow-wave sleep and quiet wakefulness the 
hippocampus exhibits sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), short high-frequency, 
high-amplitude oscillations, that organize the reactivation or 'replay' of 
sequences of place cells, and interventions that disrupt SWRs impair learning. 
While the canonical model of SWRs generation have emphasized CA3 input to CA1 as 
the source of excitatory drive, recent work suggests there are multiple 
circuits, including the CA2 region, that can both influence, generate and 
organize SWRs, both from the oscillatory and information content perspectives in 
a task and state-dependent manner. This extended circuitry and its function must 
be considered for a true understanding of the role of the hippocampus in 
off-line processes such as planning and consolidation."
890,"Lysosomes are specialized organelles with an acidic pH that act as recycling 
hubs for intracellular and extracellular components. They harbour numerous 
different hydrolytic enzymes to degrade substrates like proteins, peptides, and 
glycolipids. Reduced catalytic activity of lysosomal enzymes can cause the 
accumulation of these substrates and loss of lysosomal integrity, resulting in 
lysosomal dysfunction and lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Post-mitotic 
cells, such as neurons, seem to be highly sensitive to damages induced by 
lysosomal dysfunction, thus LSDs often manifest with neurological symptoms. 
Interestingly, some LSDs and Parkinson's disease (PD) share common cellular 
pathomechanisms, suggesting convergence of aetiology of the two disease types. 
This is further underlined by genetic associations of several lysosomal genes 
involved in LSDs with PD. The increasing number of lysosome-associated genetic 
risk factors for PD makes it necessary to understand functions and interactions 
of lysosomal proteins/enzymes both in healthy and disease states, thereby 
holding the potential to identify new therapeutic targets. In this review, we 
highlight genetic and mechanistic interactions between the complex lysosomal 
network, LSDs and PD, and elaborate on methodical challenges in lysosomal 
research."
891,"Vaginal yolk sac tumours (vYST) are rare pediatric malignant tumours and the 
most common form of vaginal germ-cell tumours in children. They are almost 
exclusively found in females under 3 years of age. Treatment involves local 
excision either with or without chemotherapy. Herein, we describe a case of a 3 
year old girl with vaginal Yolk sac tumor, who underwent buccal mucosa 
vaginoplasty through an anterior sagittal transrectal approach (ASTRA), as an 
effective oncological procedure, with preservation of reproductive function."
892,"Sex steroid hormones play an important role in fetal development, brain 
functioning and neuronal protection. Growing evidence highlights the positive 
effects of these hormones against brain damage induced by neonatal 
hypoxia-ischemia (HI). This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to verify 
the efficacy of sex steroid hormones in preventing HI-induced brain damage in 
rodent models. The protocol was registered at PROSPERO and a total of 22 
articles were included. Moderate to large effects were observed in HI animals 
treated with sex steroid hormones in reducing cerebral infarction size and cell 
death, increasing neuronal survival, and mitigating neuroinflammatory responses 
and astrocyte reactivity. A small effect was evidenced for cognitive function, 
but no significant effect for motor function; moreover, a high degree of 
heterogeneity was observed. In summary, data suggest that sex steroid hormones, 
such as progesterone and 17β estradiol, improve morphological and cellular 
outcomes following neonatal HI. Further research is paramount to examine 
neurological function during HI recovery and standardization of methodological 
aspects is imperative to reduce the risk of spurious findings."
893,"Eph receptors, the largest known family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and ephrin 
ligands have been implicated in a variety of human cancers. The novel 
bidirectional signaling events initiated by binding of Eph receptors to their 
cognate ephrin ligands modulate many cellular processes such as proliferation, 
metastasis, angiogenesis, invasion, and apoptosis. The relationships between the 
abundance of a unique subset of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands with associated 
cellular processes indicate a key role of these molecules in tumorigenesis. The 
combinatorial expression of these molecules converges on MAP kinase and/or 
AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. The intracellular target proteins of the initial 
signal may, however, vary in some cancers. Furthermore, we have also described 
the commonality of up- and down-regulation of individual receptors and ligands 
in various cancers. The current state of research in Eph receptors illustrates 
MAP kinase and mTOR pathways as plausible targets for therapeutic interventions 
in various cancers."
894,"Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) involving astrocytes is 
important for proper CNS homeostasis. As determined in our previous studies, 
trafficking of the predominant astrocyte GJ protein, Connexin43 (Cx43), is 
disrupted in response to infection with a neurotropic murine β-coronavirus 
(MHV-A59). However, how host factors are involved in Cx43 trafficking and the 
infection response is not clear. Here, we show that Cx43 retention due to 
MHV-A59 infection was associated with increased ER stress and reduced expression 
of chaperone protein ERp29. Treatment of MHV-A59-infected astrocytes with the 
chemical chaperone 4-sodium phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) increased ERp29 expression, 
rescued Cx43 transport to the cell surface, increased GJIC, and reduced ER 
stress. We obtained similar results using an astrocytoma cell line (DBT) upon 
MHV-A59 infection. Critically, DBT cells transfected to express exogenous ERp29 
were resistant to MHV-A59 infection and showed increased Cx43-mediated GJIC. 
Treatment with Cx43 mimetic peptides inhibited GJIC and increased viral 
susceptibility, demonstrating a role for intercellular communication in reducing 
MHV-A59 infectivity. Taken together, these results support a therapeutically 
targetable ERp29-dependent mechanism where β-coronavirus infectivity is 
modulated by reducing ER stress and rescuing Cx43 trafficking and function."
895,"BACKGROUND: Comorbidities in severe asthma are common and contribute to disease 
burden. The severe asthma phenotype and treatment response can be impacted by 
comorbid conditions. Real-world data on the use of mepolizumab in severe 
eosinophilic asthma (SEA) in the presence of comorbidities is needed to inform 
clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of comorbid conditions on baseline 
phenotype in patients with SEA and assess the mepolizumab treatment effect by 
comorbidity status in SEA.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in the Australian Mepolizumab Registry (n=309) were 
classified into subgroups defined by the presence or absence of comorbidities, 
including nasal polyps, aspirin exacerbated airway disease, asthma-chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO), fungal sensitisation and 
obesity. Patient baseline characteristics were compared, and the impacts of 
comorbidity on phenotype, identified by differences in patient age and/or 
baseline biomarker levels and/or asthma severity, were assessed. The mepolizumab 
treatment effects on clinical and biological outcomes at 12 months were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Across comorbidity subgroups, mepolizumab reduced the rate of 
clinically significant exacerbations (range 47-77%), maintenance oral 
corticosteroid use (dose reduction 4.2-13.3 mg/day), and improved symptom 
control (Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 score 1.9-2.4 point reduction) and lung 
function (mean 3.4-9.3 post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory 
volume in 1s). Peripheral blood eosinophils were reduced (mean 480-780 
cells/μL). Comorbidities (nasal polyps, obesity, ACO and fungal sensitisation) 
modified the baseline phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Mepolizumab treatment is associated with comparable clinical 
improvements in in patients with SEA and comorbidities. Mepolizumab effectively 
minimizes the disease impact and corticosteroid burden in patients with SEA."
896,"Currently, there is a lack of treatments for retinal neurotrauma. To address 
this issue, this study uses an alpha7 nAChR agonist, PNU-282987, to determine it 
effects on functional activity in the retina shortly after a traumatic blast 
exposure. The objectives of this research include: 1) examination of the 
cellular and functional damage associated with ocular blast exposure, and 2) 
evaluation of structural and functional changes that occur post PNU-282987 
treatment. Significant ocular blast damage was induced in adult mice after 
exposure to a single blast of 35 psi to the left eye. Blast-exposed transgenic 
mice expressing tdTomato Müller glia were treated daily with eyedrops containing 
PNU-282987 for 4 weeks following the blast exposure. Antibody staining studies 
in these transgenic mice was conducted to examine lineage tracing and 
electroretinograms (ERGs) were obtained to examine functional changes. Blast 
exposure caused a significant loss of cells in all retinal layers after 4 weeks. 
Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated tdTomato-positive labeled 
photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells in blast-exposed mice treated with 
PNU-282987. ERG recordings were taken from control animals, from blast-damaged 
animals and from animals exposed to blast followed by 4 weeks of PNU-282987 
treatment. Scotopic ERG recordings from blast-exposed mice had significantly 
decreased amplitudes of a-wave, b-wave, oscillatory potentials and flicker 
frequencies, which were prevented after PNU-282987 treatment. In photopic 
experiments, the PhNR response was reduced significantly after blast exposure 
but the decrease was prevented after treatment with PNU-282987. These are the 
first experiments that demonstrate preservation of retinal function after blast 
exposure using an alpha7 nAChR agonist."
897,"To investigate the response to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a 
double-stranded RNA Toll-like receptor 3 agonist that mimics viral infection, in 
the barrier function of two established human telomerase reverse 
transcriptase-immortalized cell lines, termed HCLE for the human corneal-limbal 
epithelial line and HCjE for the human conjunctival-epithelial line. In this 
study, HCLE and HCjE cells were used to evaluate the underlying mechanism of 
epithelial-cell barrier function regulation. Briefly, HCLE and HCjE cells were 
first cultured on 12-well Transwell® (Corning®) filter-plates, and reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and 
immunohistochemical examinations were then performed to assess tight junction 
(TJ)-related protein expression and cellular distribution. Next, the barrier 
function of the cells was measured via transepithelial electrical resistance 
(TEER) and paracellular molecular flux. The cells were then stimulated with 
poly(I:C) and the TEER and TJ-related protein expressions were analyzed. Similar 
to that in in vivo epithelium, the expression of claudin (CLDN) subtypes CLDN-1, 
-4, and -7 was observed in the HCLE and HCjE cells, and the barrier function in 
the HCLE cells was tighter than that in the HCjE cells. Post stimulation with 
poly(I:C), TEER of the HCLE and HCjE cells increased in a dose- and 
time-dependent manner, the production of TJ-related protein mRNA and CLDN-4 
protein were elevated, and the barrier function of the HCLE and HCjE cells 
increased, thus possibly indicating that the increased barrier function is a 
defense mechanism against viral infection."
898,"Background / Objective: C-C-chemokine receptors (CCRs) are expressed on a 
variety of immune cells and play an important role in many immune processes, 
particularly leukocyte migration. Comprehensive preclinical research 
demonstrated CCR2/CCR5-dependent pathways as pivotal for the pathophysiology of 
severe COVID-19. Here we report human data on use of a chemokine receptor 
inhibitor in patients with COVID-19.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interim results of a 2:1 randomised, placebo-controlled, 
investigator-initiated trial on the CCR2/CCR5-inhibitor Cenicriviroc (CVC) 150 
mg BID orally for 28 days in hospitalised patients with moderate to severe 
COVID-19 are reported. The primary endpoint is the subject's responder status 
defined by achieving grade 1 or 2 on the 7-point ordinal scale of clinical 
improvement on day 15.
RESULTS: Of the 30 patients randomised, 18 were assigned to receive CVC and 12 
placebo. Efficient CCR2- and CCR5 inhibition was demonstrated through CCL2 and 
CCL4 elevation in CVC-treated patients (485% and 80% increase on day 3 compared 
to baseline, respectively). In the mITT population, 82.4% of patients (14/17) in 
the CVC group met the primary endpoint, as did 91.7% (11/12) in the 
placebo-group (OR 0.5, 95%, CI 0.04-3.41). One patient treated with CVC died of 
progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the remaining had a 
favourable outcome. Treatment with CVC was overall well tolerated, with most 
adverse events (AEs) being grade I or II and resolving spontaneously.
CONCLUSION: Our interim analysis provides proof-of-concept data on CVC for 
COVID-19 patients as intervention to inhibit CCR2/CCR5. Further studies are 
warranted to assess its clinical efficacy."
899,"Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and leading cause 
of infant mortality, yet molecular mechanisms explaining CHD remain mostly 
unknown. Sequencing studies are identifying CHD candidate genes at a brisk rate 
including MINK1, a serine/threonine kinase. However, a plausible molecular 
mechanism connecting CHD and MINK1 is unknown. Here, we reveal that mink1 is 
required for proper heart development due to its role in left-right patterning. 
Mink1 regulates canonical Wnt signaling to define the cell fates of the Spemann 
Organizer and the Left-Right Organizer, a ciliated structure that breaks 
bilateral symmetry in the vertebrate embryo. To identify Mink1 targets, we 
applied an unbiased proteomics approach and identified the high mobility group 
architectural transcription factor, Hmga2. We report that Hmga2 is necessary and 
sufficient for regulating Spemann's Organizer. Indeed, we demonstrate that Hmga2 
can induce Spemann Organizer cell fates even when β-catenin, a critical effector 
of the Wnt signaling pathway, is depleted. In summary, we discover a 
transcription factor, Hmga2, downstream of Mink1 that is critical for the 
regulation of Spemann's Organizer, as well as the LRO, defining a plausible 
mechanism for CHD."
900,"A phytochemical investigation of the fruits of Citrullus colocynthis resulted in 
the isolation of 21 structurally diverse cucurbitane triterpenoids, including 9 
previously undescribed ones, colocynins A-I (1-9). Their absolute configurations 
were elucidated by means of quantum chemical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) 
calculations, CD exciton chirality method, and single-crystal X-ray 
crystallography. Colocynins A-C (1-3) represent the first examples of 
nonanorcucurbitane-type triterpenoids. An anti-acetylcholinesterase activity 
assay showed that 6, 10, 13, 18, and 20 exhibited inhibitory activities, with 
IC50 values ranging from 5.0 to 21.7 μM. In addition, 18 and 21 showed 
significant cytotoxicity against PACA, A431, and HepG2 cells, with IC50 values 
ranging from 0.042 to 0.60 and 3.6-14.4 μM, respectively."
901,"Twelve undescribed and 13 known eudesmane-type sesquiterpenoids were obtained 
from Artemisia leucophylla, and structurally elucidated based on comprehensive 
analyses of spectral data, including HRESIMS, IR, 1D and 2D NMR, and ECD 
calculation. The absolute configuration of compound 1 was determined by a single 
X-ray single crystal diffraction. Chemically, compounds 1-5 featured 
unprecedented 1,2-seco-1-nor-eudesmane-type skeleton with a cis-fused 6/5 
bicyclic system. Antihepatoma evaluation against three human hepatoma cell lines 
(HepG2, Huh7, and SK-Hep-1) for all compounds demonstrated that compound 7 
displayed the most active cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 35.1, 35.0, and 32.7

902,"OBJECTIVE: Methamphetamine (METH) exposure is commonly believed to result in 
cognitive impairment. Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonists reportedly have 
potential applications for treating cognitive impairment accompanied by various 
neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of 
H3R blockade by Thioperamide (THIO) on METH-induced cognitive impairment and the 
underlying mechanism.
METHODS: In Experiment 1, C57BL/6 mice received daily injections of saline or 
5 mg/kg METH for 5 consecutive days. The Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and 
Morris water maze (MWM) tasks were used to assess cognitive functions of mice. 
H3R protein expression and apoptosis were subsequently measured in the 
hippocampus. In Experiment 2, HT22 cells were first treated with ddH2O or 3 mM 
METH. The cell survival rate and H3R protein level were subsequently assessed. 
In Experiment 3, the animals were first treated with saline or 20 mg/kg THIO for 
7 days, followed by co-administration of either saline or 5 mg/kg METH for an 
additional 5 days. The remaining experiments were carried out in the same manner 
as Experiment 1. In Experiment 4, HT22 cells were pretreated with either ddH2O 
or 5 mM THIO for 2 h, followed by ddH2O or 3 mM METH treatment for an additional 
12 h. The remaining experiments were carried out in the same manner as 
Experiment 2. In Experiment 5, the changes in MEK1/2, p-MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and 
p-ERK1/2 protein levels were examined in the hippocampus of all mice from 
Experiment 3 and HT22 cells from Experiment 4.
RESULTS: METH-treated mice showed significantly worsened NOR and MWM 
performance, along with markably hippocampal apoptosis. A significantly lower 
cell survival rate was observed in METH-treated HT22 cells. Increased levels of 
H3R protein were found in both METH-treated mice and HT22 cells. THIO 
significantly improved METH-induced cognitive impairment in mice and toxicity in 
HT22 cells. METH significantly increased the level of p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 
proteins in the hippocampus of mice and HT22 cells, which was reversed by THIO 
pretreatment.
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that H3R blockade by THIO yields a 
neuroprotective effect against METH-induced cognitive impairment in mice and 
toxicity in HT22 cells via the raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway."
903,"OBJECTIVES: Although cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening for sex chromosome 
abnormalities (SCAs) is increasingly used in clinical practice, its diagnostic 
accuracy and clinical utility remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review 
and meta-analysis is to determine the performance of cfDNA in the detection of 
SCAs.
DATA SOURCES: Medline/Pubmed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from 
inception to January 2022 for articles relating to cfDNA screening for SCAs.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original articles, randomized control trials, 
conference abstracts, cohort and case-control studies, and case-series with more 
than ten cases with diagnostic confirmation were considered for inclusion.
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Quality assessment of each included 
publication was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool. The positive predictive value 
(PPV) was calculated as the proportion of true positive cases among those who 
tested positive and underwent diagnostic testing. Sensitivity and specificity 
were pooled, and a summary Receiver-Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve was 
produced using bivariate models including studies that had diagnostic 
confirmation for high- and low-risk women.
RESULTS: The search identified 7,553 results. Of these, 380 proceeded to the 
full-text screening, of which 94 articles were included in the meta-analysis 
with a total of 1,531,240 women tested. All studies reported a confirmatory 
genetic test. The pooled PPV was 49.4% (95% CI 45.8-53.1). The pooled PPV was 
32.0% (95% CI 27-37.3%) for monosomy X, 67.6% (95% CI 62.5-72.5%) for XXY, 57.5% 
(95% CI 51.7-63.1%) for XXX, and 70.9% (95% CI 63.9-77.1%) for XYY. The pooled 
sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA for SCAs were 94.1% (95% CI 90.8-96.3%) and 
99.5% (95% CI 99.0-99.7%), respectively, with an area under the summary ROC 
curve of 0.934 (95% CI 0.907-0.989).
CONCLUSIONS: While the sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA for SCAs are high, 
the PPV is approximately 50%. The PPV is higher for SCAs with a supernumerary Y 
chromosome, and lower for monosomy X. Clinicians should inform couples about 
these findings when offering cfDNA for SCAs."
904,"BACKGROUND: Technological advances in analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal 
serum have allowed expanded prenatal screening possibilities for fetal 
aneuploidies. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the assay is 
partly dependent on the amount of cell-free DNA present in the maternal 
circulation. Thus, it is important to understand what fetal and maternal factors 
influence the level of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation. Maternal 
heparin use has been associated with an increase in non-reportable cell-free DNA 
results due to a low fetal fraction, in some, but not all, previous studies. In 
addition, there are likely additional factors that affect cell-free DNA that 
remain uncharacterized OBJECTIVE: To determine if heparins, low-dose aspirin, 
and maternal clinical factors affect the rate of non-reportable cell-free DNA 
testing results.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed using pregnant people 
receiving cell-free fetal DNA testing from Jan 1 2014 - Jun 30 2018. Data were 
collected on patient demographics, medical comorbidities, medication use, and 
cell-free DNA test results. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed 
to determine which factors were independently associated with the rate of 
non-reportable results.
RESULTS: From an original sample of 1,117 pregnant people, 743 met inclusion 
criteria. Maternal weight (OR 1.02), heparin use (OR 12.06), aspirin use (OR 
4.70), chronic hypertension (OR 5.26), pre-gestational diabetes (OR 2.46), and 
autoimmune disease (OR 3.59) were significantly associated with increased rate 
of non-reportable results in the univariate analysis. The association was also 
present for maternal weight (OR 1.02), heparin use (OR 21.87),and aspirin use 
(OR 2.85) in the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The previously seen association between maternal heparin use and an 
increase in non-reportable cell-free DNA results was confirmed. There also 
appears to be an increase in non-reportable results in pregnant people taking 
low dose aspirin, which has not been previously described. Providers should 
consider the impact of these medications when counseling patients on prenatal 
genetic screening options."
905,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex niche enveloping a tumor formed by 
extracellular matrix, blood vessels, immune cells, and fibroblasts constantly 
interacting with cancer cells. Although TME is increasingly recognized as a 
major player in cancer initiation and progression in many tumor types, its 
involvement in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) pathogenesis is currently unknown. 
Here, we provide a molecular and functional characterization of 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major TME component, in MCC 
patient-derived xenografts. We show that subcutaneous co-injection of 
patient-derived CAFs and human MCC MKL-1 cells into SCID mice significantly 
promotes tumor growth and metastasis. These fast-growing xenografts are 
characterized by areas densely populated with human CAFs, mainly localized 
around blood vessels. We here provide evidence that the growth-promoting 
activity of MCC-derived CAFs is mediated by the APA/AngII-III/AT1R axis, with 
the expression of aminopeptidase A (APA) in CAFs being a triggering event. 
Altogether, our findings point to APA as a potential marker for MCC prognostic 
stratification and as a candidate for therapeutic intervention."
906,"Leishmaniasis is an enigmatic disease that has very restricted options for 
chemotherapy and none for prophylaxis. As a result, deriving therapeutic 
principles for curing the disease has been a major objective in Leishmania 
research for a long time. Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that lives within 
macrophages by subverting or switching cell signaling to the pathways that 
ensure its intracellular survival. Therefore, three groups of molecules aimed at 
blocking or eliminating the parasite, at least, in principle, include blockers 
of macrophage receptor- Leishmania ligand interaction, macrophage-activating 
small molecules, peptides and cytokines, and signaling inhibitors or activators. 
Macrophages also act as an antigen-presenting cell, presenting antigen to the 
antigen-specific T cells to induce activation and differentiation of the 
effector T cell subsets that either execute or suppress anti-leishmanial 
functions. Three groups of therapeutic principles targeting this sphere of 
Leishmania-macrophage interaction include antibodies that block pro-leishmanial 
response of T cells, ligands that activate anti-leishmanial T cells and the 
antigens for therapeutic vaccines. Besides these, prophylactic vaccines have 
been in clinical trials but none has succeeded so far. Herein, we have attempted 
to encompass all these principles and compose a comprehensive review to analyze 
the feasibility and adoptability of different therapeutics for leishmaniasis."
907,"INTRODUCTION: Although electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have attracted much 
attention due to their claimed harm-reduction effects compared with conventional 
cigarettes, the adverse effects of e-cigarette aerosol exposure on human health 
are still unclear. In this work we compared the cytotoxic effects of combustion 
cigarettes with four commercially available flavored electronic cigarettes and 
their main components on ten cell lines. Cell injury mechanism of e-cigarette 
aerosol and combustible cigarette smoke was also explored using cellular models.
METHODS: Eleven kinds of e-cigarettes aerosol condensates (ECSCs) and cigarette 
smoke constituent's condensates (CSC) were collected by Cambridge filter pad, 
and the nicotine contents were determined by UPLC to provide an equivalent 
nicotine dosage. The CCK-8 assay was used to measure the cell viability 
differences between ECSC and CSC. Based on RNA-seq results, we compared the 
effects of ECSC and CSC on various cell injury pathways. Oxidative stress and 
inflammatory responses were further tested by Western Blot, immunofluorescence, 
and qRT-PCR assays.
RESULTS: CSC was found to be more cytotoxic than flavored ECSC and their main 
components, and BEAS-2B cell line was the most sensitive cells by comparing the 
IC50 value. With prolonged exposure duration and higher doses, ECSC began to 
exhibit cytotoxicity at and above 72 µg/mL. The IC50 values of ECSC were 16-fold 
higher than that of CSC. Transcriptome analyses indicated that cell 
injury-related processes were enriched after the treatment of CSC. CSC could 
significantly induce more oxidative stress and inflammatory signals than ECSC.
CONCLUSION: ECSCs and their components induced significantly less cytotoxicity 
than CSC under the laboratory exposure conditions, and CSC caused much severe 
cell injuries. Our study adds to the body of scientific evidence for a more 
comprehensive safety evaluation of e-cigarette products as compared to 
cigarettes."

910,"AIM: To determine Streptococcus agalactiae genes responsible for causing 
neonatal meningitis.
BACKGROUND: Streptococcus agalactiae strain 2603 V/R is causative agent of 
neonatal meningitis, maternal infection and sepsis in young children. World 
health organisation reported high burden of new born death caused by this 
bacterium. Streptococcus agalactiae colonizing epithelial cells of vagina and 
endothelial cells have high resistance to available antibiotic drugs which makes 
it essential to determine new drug targets.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the genome of selected strain with the non-pathogenic 
strains of streptococcus and identify the virulent and antibiotic resistant 
genes for adaptation in host environment.
METHOD: The whole genome of human pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae strain 
2603 V/R was analysed and compared with Streptococcus dysgalactiae strains using 
visualization and annotation tools. Genomic islands, mobile genetic elements, 
virulent and resistant genes were studied.
RESULTS: Genetically pathogenic strain is most similar to Streptococcus 
dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain NCTC 7136. Comparative analysis revealed 
the importance of capsular polysaccharides and surface proteins responsible for 
avoiding immune system attachment to host epithelial cells and virulent 
behaviour. High number of genes coding for antibiotics resistance may provide a 
competitive advantage for survival of pathogenic Streptococcus agalactiae strain 
2603 V/R in its niche.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparative analysis of pathogenic strain Streptococcus 
agalactiae with non-pathogenic strains of Streptococcus dysgalactiae provided 
new insights in pathogenicity that could aid in recognization for new regions 
and genes for development of new drug development strategies considering 
presence of high number of resistance genes."
911,"Baicalein is a plant-derived compound, it has widespread attention among 
biomedical researchers due to its biocompatibility and efficient biological 
activities. But it has non-solubility in physiological conditions and short 
bioavailability in the clinical process. The Discovery of a stimuli-based drug 
delivery system (DDS) is a perfect strategy to improve the bioactivity of 
baicalin in post-caesarean section wound care. We prepared a 
baicalein-encapsulated pH-responsive DDS with a zeolite imidazole framework-8 
(ZIF-8) as a carrier. We investigated the material characteristics of DDS in 
terms of crystal structure, surface area morphology, particle size, FTIR, 
UV-vis, Powder XRD, and BET analysis techniques. The in vitro cytotoxicity, 
biocompatibility, and cell proliferation properties of BA@ZIF-8 were assessed 
against human fibroblast L929 cells. In vitro studies showed that BA@ZIF-8 
nanocomposite significantly enhanced the biocompatibility against L929 cells 
after 72 h post-exposure. The pH-responsive drug release kinetics shows 
excellent baicalein release under acidic conditions and without unwanted drug 
release in physiological conditions. Wound scratch assay results revealed, that 
BA@ZIF-8 nanocomposite-treated cells exhibit the fastest cell proliferation and 
migration process in a very short period. In the antibacterial activity study, 
nanocomposite exposed dose depended on inhibition against wound infectious 
pathogens. The overall study signifies that BA@ZIF-8 nano-DDSs are effective and 
suitable DDS for stimuli-based post-caesarean section wound care."

-methyladenosine methylation-related proteins that can also exert its role in a 
methylation-independent manner. This study aims to explore the function of 
KIAA1429 in infantile hemangiomas. qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunostaining 
were performed to verify the expression of KIAA1429. The endothelial and 
fibroblast-like phenotype of hemangioma endothelial cells were detected after 
KIAA1429 knockdown and overexpression. The Stemness properties of hemangioma 
endothelial cells and the underlying mechanism of KIAA1429 in hemangiomas were 
also investigated. Nude mouse models of infantile hemangiomas were conducted to 
ascertain the effects of KIAA1429 in vivo. The results showed that KIAA1429 was 
highly expressed in infantile hemangiomas, particularly in involuting 
hemangiomas. In vitro experiments confirmed that KIAA1429 inhibited the 
endothelial phenotype, enhanced the differentiation ability, and promoted the 
fibroblast-like phenotype of hemangioma endothelial cells by inducing 
endothelial cells transition to facultative stem cells. However, the effect of 
KIAA1429 on the potential target was shown to be independent of N6 
-methyladenosine methylation modification. Mouse models further revealed that 
KIAA1429 could inhibit the proliferation and promote the regression of 
hemangiomas. In conclusion, this study found that KIAA1429 played an important 
role in the regression of infantile hemangiomas by enhancing the stemness of 
hemangioma endothelial cells and could be a potential treatment target for 
infantile hemangiomas."
913,"In 2018, a disease characterized by splenic hemorrhage and necrosis killed ducks 
in a duck farm in Guangxi province, China. A duck reovirus strain was isolated 
from the tissues of the dead ducks by inoculating duck embryos and BHK-21 cells. 
Electron microscopy of the cultured the isolate showed that the viral particles 
were nearly round in shape and approximately 70 nm in diameter, and they were 
designated DRV-GL18. Sequence analysis showed that the GL18 strain viral genome 
was 23,419 nt in length and had 10 dsRNA segments. Phylogenetic analysis of cDNA 
amplicons of segments encoding the protein σC which are outer capsid proteins 
showed that the isolate belongs to the branch of the epidemic strains of duck 
reovirus. The Recombination Detection Program (RDP) and SimPlot program analyses 
suggested potential genetic recombination events in the M2 segments. 
Pathogenicity experiments revealed that GL18 produced severe hemorrhaging in 
livers and necrosis in the spleen of infected SPF ducklings. A death rate of 50% 
in the experimental ducklings was calculated during the first 7 d, and the rest 
of the ducklings were observed to undergo spleen necrosis. These data suggested 
that GL18 is a duck reovirus isolate with severer pathogenicity, and it could be 
a candidate for development of vaccine. This is the first reported isolation of 
duck reovirus from mature ducks."
914,"The insulin-induced genes (INSIG1 and INSIG2) have been demonstrated to play a 
vital role in regulating lipid metabolism in mammals, however the function and 
regulation mechanism of them remains unknown in poultry. In this study, firstly 
the phylogenetic trees of INSIGs among various species were constructed and 
their subcellular locations were mapped in chicken LMH. Then the spatiotemporal 
expression profiles, over-expression and knockdown assays of chicken INSIGs were 
conducted. Furthermore, conservation of potential miRNA binding sites in INSIGs 
among species were analyzed, and the miRNA biological function and regulatory 
role were verified. The results showed that chicken INSIGs located in cellular 
endoplasmic reticulum, and were originated from the common ancestors of their 
mammalian counterparts. The INSIGs were widely expressed in all detected 
tissues, and their expression levels in the liver of chicken at 30 wk were 
significantly higher than that at 20 wk (P < 0.01). Over-expression of INSIGs 
led no significant increase in mRNA abundance of lipid metabolism-related genes 
and the contents of triacylglycerol (TG) and cholesterol (TC) in LMH cells. 
Knockdown of INSIG1 led to the decreased expressions of ACSL1, MTTP-L, ApoB, 
ApoVLDLII genes and TG, TC contents (P < 0.05). Knockdown of INSIG2 could 
significantly decrease the contents of TG and TC, and expressions of key genes 
related to the lipid metabolism (P < 0.05). Moreover, INSIG1 was directly 
targeted by both miR-130b-3p and miR-218-5p, and INSIG2 was directly targeted by 
miR-130b-3p. MiR-130b-3p mimic and miR-218-5p mimic treatment could significant 
decrease the mRNA and protein levels of INSIGs, mRNA levels of genes related to 
lipid metabolism, and the contents of TG and TC in LMH cells. The inhibition of 
miR-130b-3p and miR-218-5p on TG and TC contents could be restored by the 
overexpression of INSIGs, respectively. No significant alteration in expressions 
of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBPs) and SREBP 
cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) were observed when INSIGs were 
over-expressed. SCAP was down-regulated when INSIG1 was knocked down, while 
SREBP1 was down-regulated when INSIG2 was knocked down. Taken together, these 
results highlight the role of INSIG1 and INSIG2 in lipid metabolism and their 
regulatory mechanism in chicken."
915,"We model the dielectrophoretic response of E. coli bacterial cells and red blood 
cells, upon exposure to an electric field. We model the separation, capture, and 
release mechanisms under flow conditions in a microfluidic channel and show 
under which conditions efficient separation of different cell types occur. The 
modelling work is aimed to guide the separation electrode architecture and 
design for experimental validation of the model. The dielectrophoretic force is 
affected both by the geometry of the electrodes (the gradient of the electric 
field), the Re{CM(ω)} factor, and the permittivity of the medium ϵm. Our 
modelling makes testable predictions and shows that designing the electrode 
structure to ensure structure periodicity with spacing between consecutive traps 
smaller than the length of the depletion zone ensures efficient capture and 
separation. Such electrode system has higher capture and separation efficiency 
than systems with the established circular electrode architecture. The 
simulated, modelled microfluidic design allows for the separated bacteria, 
concentrated by dedicated dielectrophoretic regions, to be subsequently detected 
using label-free functionalized nanowire sensors. The experimental validation of 
the modelling work presented here and the validation of the theoretical design 
constraints of the Fluid-Screen electrode architecture is presented in the 
companion paper in the same issue (Weber MU et al. 2022 Fluid-Screen

916,"Aggregated α-synuclein, a major constituent of Lewy bodies plays a crucial role 
in the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies (SPs) such as Parkinson's disease 
(PD). PD is affected by the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, and 
recently both active and passive immunotherapies targeted against α-synuclein 
are being trialed as potential novel treatment strategies. Specifically, 
dendritic cell-based vaccines have shown to be an effective treatment for SPs in 
animal models. Here, we report on the development of adoptive cellular therapy 
(ACT) for SP and demonstrate that adoptive transfer of pre-activated T-cells 
generated from immunized mice can improve survival and behavior, reduce brain 
microstructural impairment via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and decrease 
α-synuclein pathology burden in a peripherally induced preclinical SP model 
(M83) when administered prior to disease onset. This study provides preclinical 
evidence for ACT as a potential immunotherapy for LBD, PD and other related SPs, 
and future work will provide necessary understanding of the mechanisms of its 
action."
917,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current understanding of histone post-translational 
modifications (histone modifications) across immune cell types in patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during remission and flare is limited. The 
study aimed to quantify histone modifications at a single-cell resolution in IBD 
patients during remission and flare and how they differ compared to healthy 
controls.
METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 94 subjects (83 IBD patients and 
11 healthy controls). IBD patients had either UC (n=38) or CD (n=45) in clinical 
remission or flare. We used epigenetic profiling by time-of-flight (EpiTOF) to 
investigate changes in histone modifications within peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells from IBD patients.
RESULTS: We discovered substantial heterogeneity in histone modifications across 
multiple immune cell types in IBD patients. They had a higher proportion of less 
differentiated CD34 + hematopoietic progenitors, and a subset of CD56 bright NK 
cells and γδ T cells characterized by distinct histone modifications associated 
with the gene transcription. The subset of CD56 bright NK cells had increased 
several histone acetylations. An epigenetically defined subset of NK was 
associated with higher levels of CRP in peripheral blood. CD14+ monocytes from 
IBD patients had significantly decreased cleaved H3T22, suggesting they were 
epigenetically primed for macrophage differentiation.
CONCLUSION: We describe the first systems-level quantification of histone 
modifications across immune cells from IBD patients at a single-cell resolution 
revealing the increased epigenetic heterogeneity that is not possible with 
traditional ChIP-seq profiling. Our data open new directions in investigating 
the association between histone modifications and IBD pathology using other 
epigenomic tools."
918,"BACKGROUND: An unmet need remains for improved management in perianal 
fistulising Crohn's disease (pCD). Recently, local administration of 
adipose-derived cells has shown promising results.
AIMS: To assess the safety and feasibility of injection of stromal vascular 
fraction (SVF) with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in patients with pCD.
METHODS: Patients ≥ 18 years with pCD were included and underwent fistula 
curettage, SVF with PRP injection, and closure of the internal opening. The 
primary endpoint was safety at 12 months. The secondary outcomes were complete 
radiological healing at 3 months (absence of fluid-containing tracts on MRI) and 
partial and complete clinical response at 3 and 12 months (closure of ≥1, 
respectively, all treated external opening(s)).
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included (35 [IQR 25-40] years; 14 [56%] 
female); median CD duration 4 [IQR 2-8] years. Twenty-four (95%) patients had 
previously undergone fistula surgery. No adverse events were encountered at 
lipoharvesting sites. Two (8%) patients were readmitted to hospital and six 
(24%) underwent unplanned re-interventions. Post-operative MRI (n = 24) showed 
complete radiological healing in nine (37.5%) patients. Partial clinical 
response was present in 48% (12/25) at 3 months and in 68% (17/25) at 12 months, 
and complete clinical closure in five (20%) patients at 3 months and in 10 (40%) 
patients at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: Injection with autologous SVF with PRP is feasible and safe in 
patients with treatment-refractory pCD. Early complete radiological healing was 
observed in more than one-third of patients, and clinical response in two-thirds 
of patients at 12 months."
919,"BACKGROUND: The complex wound healing process involves activating and 
synchronizing intracellular, intercellular, and extracellular components. 
Adipose tissue is attracting attention to promote wound healing. Within 
subcutaneous adipose tissue, stromal vascular cells and their subsets release 
growth factors and cytokines critical for neovascularization and wound repair.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated human placental collagen/adipose-derived stem 
cells (ADSCs) hydrogel for wound healing in rats.
METHODS: In this study, ADSCs were harvested, cultured, and mixed with placental 
collagen. Twelve rats were used, and their backs were excised three times each. 
Group one received collagen/ADSCs, group two collagen, and group three 
non-filled (control) excisions. The healing processes were assessed by 
histological analysis, taking photographs, and calculating the percentage of 
wound contraction in mentioned times.
RESULTS: Histopathological analysis revealed that the content of fibroblasts, 
follicles of the hair, and angiogenesis in group one was significantly more than 
in other groups. Group one had a significant result compared with the collagen 
and control groups. In group one, significant wound healing and wound 
contraction were observed with 52% and 80% wound contraction at 7 and 14 days, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Collagen/ADSCs can be considered a suitable candidate hydrogel in 
wound healing with a high potential for enhancing wound repairing."
920,"The actions of the immune system are finely tuned, involving complex 
communication and coordination between diverse immune and non-immune cells 
across the tissues of the body. A healthy immune system requires a precise 
balance between immunity and tolerance. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have long 
been appreciated as one of the master regulators of this balance; their 
importance is underscored by the autoimmunity that develops in mice and humans 
when Tregs are missing or dysfunctional. In addition to the immunoregulatory 
roles of Tregs in suppressing autoimmunity and inflammation via control of 
adaptive and innate immune responses, several non-immune modulatory functions of 
Tregs have been identified in recent years. In this review, we have highlighted 
the growing literature on the action of Tregs in metabolism, stem cell 
maintenance, tissue repair, and angiogenesis. Alongside Tregs' immune 
suppressive role, these non-suppressive activities comprise a key function of 
Tregs in regulating health and disease. As Tregs receive increasing attention as 
therapeutic targets, understanding their non-canonical functions may become an 
important feature of Treg-directed interventions."
921,"Pathogen effectors can suppress various plant immune responses, suggesting that 
they have multiple targets in the host. To understand the mechanisms underlying 
plasma membrane-associated and effector-mediated immunity, we performed 
Phytophthora capsici  RxLR cell death Inducer Suppressing Immune System (CRISIS) 
screening. In Nicotiana benthamiana, the cell death induced by the RxLR effector 
CRISIS2 is inhibited by the irreversible plasma membrane H +-ATPase (PMA) 
activator fusicoccin. Biochemical and gene silencing analyses revealed that 
CRISIS2 physically and functionally associates with PMAs and induces host cell 
death independent of immune receptors. CRISIS2 induces apoplastic alkalization 
by suppressing PMA activity via its association with the C-terminal regulatory 
domain of PMA. In planta expression of CRISIS2 significantly enhanced the 
virulence of P. capsici, whereas host-induced gene silencing of CRISIS2 
compromised disease symptom and biomass of P. capsici. Our study identified a 
novel RxLR effector playing multiple roles in the suppression of plant defense 
and induction of cell death to support the pathogen hemibiotrophic life cycle in 
the host plant."
922,"A 5-year-old spayed female American Staffordshire was referred for weakness, 
reluctance to move and distension of the abdomen. Three weeks before, the dog 
underwent surgery for excision of a nodular mass suspected to be a 
non-epitheliotropic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (NE-CTCL). Computed tomography 
revealed heterogeneous enhancing mesenteric masses and nodular lesions of soft 
tissue density, and infiltration of the abdominal muscular wall. Moreover, a 
pattern of diffuse muscle nodules in the skeletal muscles was visible, with 
lesions showing homogenous, heterogeneous or ring enhancement. Necrosis was 
histologically observed and these lesions were infiltrated by CD3-positive and 
CD20-, CD79a- and Iba1-negative neoplastic lymphocytes. On the basis of the 
immunopathological features metastatic NE-CTCL was suspected. Skeletal muscle 
metastasis has been rarely reported in small animals and this case report 
further confirms that this possibility should be considered in dogs with 
lymphoma."
923,"Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is becoming a promising radiation treatment 
technique dealing with tumors due to its cellular targeting specificity. In this 
article, based on the biocompatible chitosan oligosaccharide (COS), we designed 
a boron delivery system using carborane (CB) as a boron drug with cRGD peptide 
modification and paclitaxel (PTX) loaded in the hydrophobic core. The 
nanoparticles (cRGD-COS-CB/PTX) realized the boron delivery into tumor sites 
with an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and an active targeting 
effect achieved by the cRGD-integrin interaction on the surface of tumor cells. 
The uniform spherical nanoparticles can be selectively taken by hepatoma cells 
rather than normal hepatocytes. In vivo experiments showed that the 
nanoparticles had a targeting effect on tumor sites in both subcutaneous and 
orthotopic tumor models, which was an encouraging result for radiotherapy for 
liver cancer. To sum up, the nanoparticles we produced proved to be promising 
dual-functionalized nanoparticles for radiotherapy and chemotherapy."
924,"Invadopodia formation is regulated by Rho GTPases. However, the molecular 
mechanisms that control Rho GTPase signaling at invadopodia remain poorly 
understood. Here, we have identified ARHGAP17, a Cdc42-specific RhoGAP, as a key 
regulator of invadopodia in breast cancer cells and characterized a novel 
ARHGAP17-mediated signaling pathway that controls the spatiotemporal activity of 
Cdc42 during invadopodia turnover. Our results show that during invadopodia 
assembly, ARHGAP17 localizes to the invadopodia ring and restricts the activity 
of Cdc42 to the invadopodia core, where it promotes invadopodia growth. 
Invadopodia disassembly starts when ARHGAP17 translocates from the invadopodia 
ring to the core, in a process that is mediated by its interaction with the 
Cdc42 effector CIP4. Once at the core, ARHGAP17 inactivates Cdc42 to promote 
invadopodia disassembly. Our results in invadopodia provide new insights into 
the coordinated transition between the activation and inactivation of Rho 
GTPases."
925,"BACKGROUND: Bintrafusp alfa is a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein 
composed of the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta receptor 
II (a TGF-β ""trap"") fused to a human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody 
blocking programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). We report the efficacy and 
safety in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that progressed 
following anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this expansion cohort of NCT02517398-a global, 
open-label, phase I trial-adults with advanced NSCLC that progressed following 
chemotherapy and was primary refractory or had acquired resistance to 
anti-PD-(L)1 treatment received intravenous bintrafusp alfa 1200 mg every 2 
weeks until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or trial withdrawal. 
The primary endpoint was best overall response (by Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors version 1.1 adjudicated by independent review committee); 
secondary endpoints included safety.
RESULTS: Eighty-three eligible patients (62 [74.7%] treated with ≥3 prior 
therapies) received bintrafusp alfa. Four patients (3 primary refractory, 1 
acquired resistant) had confirmed partial responses (objective response rate, 
4.8%; 95% CI, 1.3%-11.9%), and 9 had stable disease. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression 
was not associated with response. Nineteen patients (22.9%) experienced grade ≥3 
treatment-related adverse events, most commonly asthenia (3 [3.6%]) and fatigue, 
eczema, and pruritus (2 each [2.4%]). One patient had grade 4 amylase increased. 
One patient died during treatment for pneumonia before initiation of bintrafusp 
alfa.
CONCLUSION: Although the primary endpoint was not met, bintrafusp alfa showed 
some clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily 
pretreated NSCLC, including prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Tumor responses occurred 
irrespective of whether disease was primary refractory or had acquired 
resistance to prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy."
926,"Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are functionally poised, tissue-resident 
lymphocytes that respond rapidly to damage and infection at mucosal barrier 
sites. ILC2 reside within complex microenvironments where they are subject to 
cues from both the diet and invading pathogens-including helminths. Emerging 
evidence suggests ILC2 are acutely sensitive not only to canonical activating 
signals but also perturbations in nutrient availability. In the context of 
helminth infection, we identify amino acid availability as a nutritional cue in 
regulating ILC2 responses. ILC2 are found to be uniquely preprimed to import 
amino acids via the large neutral amino acid transporters Slc7a5 and Slc7a8. 
Cell-intrinsic deletion of these transporters individually impaired ILC2 
expansion, while concurrent loss of both transporters markedly impaired the 
proliferative and cytokine-producing capacity of ILC2. Mechanistically, amino 
acid uptake determined the magnitude of ILC2 responses in part via tuning of 
mTOR. These findings implicate essential amino acids as a metabolic requisite 
for optimal ILC2 responses within mucosal barrier tissues."
927,"Functional recovery after incomplete spinal cord injury depends on the effective 
rewiring of neuronal circuits. Here, we show that selective chemogenetic 
activation of either corticospinal projection neurons or intraspinal relay 
neurons alone led to anatomically restricted plasticity and little functional 
recovery. In contrast, coordinated stimulation of both supraspinal centers and 
spinal relay stations resulted in marked and circuit-specific enhancement of 
neuronal rewiring, shortened EMG latencies, and improved locomotor recovery."
928,"INTRODUCTION: B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) is a proliferation of 
hematopoietic precursor cells characterized by the expression of various B-cell 
antigens. Expression of T cell antigens has rarely been reported in B-ALL. We 
report the second case CD5+ (Cluster of differentiation 5) B-ALL associated with 
Philadelphia chromosome (Phi+).
OBSERVATION: A 38-year old male presented with anorexia and generalized weakness 
for the last ten days. Hemogram revealed bicytopenia and hyperleukocytosis made 
of 93% difficult to classify cells. A diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
was suspected. An immunophenotyping on peripheral blood was performed. The panel 
for B- cell lineage chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD) was used. The 
dim expression of CD45 and the lack of surface immunoglobuline helped to exclude 
a CD5 expressing mature B cell neoplasm. Then, the diagnosis of ALL was 
confirmed by ALL panels. Karyotype showed a Phi+. Thus, a diagnosis of B-ALL 
with aberrant expression of CD5 and Phi+ was established. The patient received 
chemotherapy according to the modified group for research on adult acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia philadelphia positive 2005 protocol (GRAAPH 2005). A 
complete remission at the end of induction was obtained. The patient received 
consolidation and then, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patient is 
in complete hematological remission till the date of submission of this report.
CONCLUSION: Aberrant expression of CD5 associated with Phi+ has rarely been 
reported in B cell lineage ALL and having a poor prognosis. Pathologists and 
clinicians should be aware of this entity to avoid confusion with other tumors."

932,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic impact of immune-related adverse events during immune 
checkpoint inhibitor-based combination therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma 
remains unclear, especially in terms of differences between regimens.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to clarify the prognostic impact of immune-related adverse 
events in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma receiving immune 
checkpoint inhibitor dual combination therapy (IO-IO) or immune checkpoint 
inhibitor plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor combination therapy (IO-TKI).
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the data of 148 patients who received 
immune checkpoint inhibitor-based combination therapy as first-line therapy. 
Patients were divided into two groups based on regimens, namely IO-IO and 
IO-TKI. The associations between immune-related adverse event development and 
outcomes, such as progression-free survival, overall survival, and objective 
response rate, were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: In the IO-IO and IO-TKI groups, 67 of 91 (74%) and 31 of 57 (54%) 
patients, respectively, experienced at least one immune-related adverse event 
and the rate was significantly higher in the IO-IO group (p = 0.0204), where 
immune-related adverse events development was significantly associated with 
longer progression-free survival (p < 0.0001) and overall survival (p = 0.0102), 
and a higher objective response rate (p = 0.0028). A multivariate analysis 
revealed immune-related adverse event development as an independent factor for 
longer progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.25; p < 0.0001) and overall 
survival (hazard ratio, 0.42; p = 0.0287). There were no significant 
associations between immune-related adverse events and progression-free 
survival, overall survival, or objective response rate in the IO-TKI group.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of immune-related adverse events was positively 
associated with the outcome of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma 
treated with IO-IO combination therapy; no such correlation was observed for 
IO-TKI combination therapy."
933,"The acoustic force spectroscopy (AFS) tool was recently introduced as a novel 
tool for probing mechanical properties of biomolecules, expanding the 
application of sound waves to high-throughput quantification of the mechanical

piconewton to nanonewton range, tens to hundreds of cells functionalized by 
attached microspheres can simultaneously be stretched and tracked in real-time 
with sub millisecond time response. Since its first application, several studies 
have demonstrated the potential and versatility of the AFS for high-throughput 
measurements of force-induced molecular mechanisms, revealing insight into 
cellular biomechanics and mechanobiology at the molecular level. In this

retinal neurodegeneration. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 
association between retinal neurodegeneration and the best-corrected visual 
acuity (BCVA) decline in patients with CKD.
METHODS: Post hoc analysis of two prospective studies. Patients with CKD 
stage ≥ 3 were enrolled. Macular thickness, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber 
layer (pRNFL) thickness, and macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness were 
measured by optical coherence tomography. Eyes were classified into three 
groups: Group 1, no GCC defect; Group 2, GCC defect confined to parafoveal area; 
and Group 3, GCC defects extending beyond the parafoveal area. Each group was 
matched for age, sex, axial length, lens status, and cataract grading.
RESULTS: A total of 120 eyes (40 eyes in each group) from 120 patients (age 
63.0 ± 10.3 years) were included. The logMAR BCVA was 0.076 ± 0.101, 
0.100 ± 0.127, and 0.196 ± 0.191 in Group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Group 3, 
but not Group 2, had a significantly worse BCVA than Group 1. In simple linear 
regression, parafoveal inner retinal thickness, pRNFL thickness, presence of 
pRNFL defect, GCC thickness, GCC global loss volume, GCC focal loss volume, and 
GCC defect extending beyond parafoveal area were associated with BCVA. Central 
subfield retinal thickness (CRT), parafoveal full retinal thickness, and 
parafoveal outer retinal thickness were not associated with BCVA. In backward 
stepwise linear regression, age and GCC defects extending beyond the parafoveal 
area were factors associated with BCVA. Moreover, GCC defect extending beyond 
parafoveal area was connected with worse BCVA in both phakic and pseudophakic 
subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: GCC defect extending beyond parafoveal area could be an independent 
biomarker associated with decreased BCVA in patients with CKD. However, macular 
thinning measured by CRT or parafoveal full retinal thickness might have low 
discriminative power in determining BCVA."
937,"Tremelimumab (tremelimumab-actl; IMJUDO®), a cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated 
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody, is being developed by AstraZeneca, under 
license from Pfizer, for the treatment of a range of malignant tumours. 
Tremelimumab was approved in the USA in October 2022 in combination with 
durvalumab for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
carcinoma (uHCC). In addition, tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy was approved in the USA in November 2022 for the 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) 
with no sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor mutation or anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase genomic tumour aberrations. In December 2022, tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab received a Positive Opinion from the EU Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the first line treatment of adults with 
advanced or unresectable HCC. Tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab is 
under regulatory review for these indications in Japan and in other countries 
worldwide. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of 
tremelimumab leading to this first approval."
938,"In spine surgery, allogenic bone grafts are often required to ensure bone 
fusion, however, the main concern regarding their use is the infection risk: 
therefore, an intraoperative swab for culture test is performed. The 
cost-effectiveness of these swabs and their influence on the patients' 
postoperative course have often been questioned. This study aims at determining 
whether positive spine allograft culture results are predictive of an increased 
risk of surgical site infection and whether they influence the surgeon's choices 
in postoperative management. The records of 340 patients who received allogenic 
bone graft during spinal fusion surgery in our institution were reviewed, for a 
total of 677 allografts. Each graft was swabbed intraoperatively. All patients 
were followed clinically for postoperative complications. Infection was 
diagnosed based on clinical data, blood tests and radiographic images, all 
assessed by an infectious disease specialist. Only 4 of the 677 allografts used 
(0.6%) resulted positive at the intraoperative swab culture. Three cultures were 
positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis and one culture for S. warneri. No 
clinical infection occurred in any of these patients. Twenty-eight of the 340 
patients (8.2%) developed an infection, but none of them had a positive 
intraoperative swab culture. The most common microbiologic pathogen isolated 
from this cohort was S. aureus. According to our series, intraoperative swab 
culture results were not predictive for higher risk of infection and did not 
affect the clinical behavior of the surgeons in postoperative management."
939,"Accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is central to the pathogenesis of 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies suggest that α-syn pathology may 
originate from the olfactory bulb (OB) or gut in response to an unknown pathogen 
and later progress to the different brain regions. Aging is viewed as the utmost 
threat to PD development. Therefore, studies depicting the role of age in α-syn 
accumulation and its progression in PD are important. In the present study, we 
gave intranasal rotenone microemulsion for 6 weeks in 12-month-old female BALB/c 
mice and found olfactory dysfunction after 4 and 6 weeks of rotenone 
administration. Interestingly, motor impairment was observed only after 6 weeks. 
The animals were sacrificed after 6 weeks to perform western blotting and 
immunohistochemical studies to detect α-syn pathology, neuroinflammation and 
neurodegeneration. We found α-syn accumulation in OB, striatum, substantia nigra 
(SN) and cortex. Importantly, we found significant glial cell activation and 
neurodegeneration in all the analysed regions which were absent in our previous 
published studies with 3 months old mice even after they were exposed to 
rotenone for 9 weeks indicating age is a crucial factor for α-syn induced 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. We also observed increased iron 
accumulation in SN of rotenone-exposed aged mice. Moreover, inflammaging was 
observed in OB and striatum of 12-month-old BALB/c mice as compared to 
3-month-old BALB/c mice. In conclusion, there is a difference in sensitivity 
between adult and aged mice in the development and progression of α-syn 
pathology and subsequent neurodegeneration, for which inflammaging might be the 
crucial probable mechanism."
940,"This trial aimed to determine the possible therapeutic and immunomodulatory 
effects of vitamin D3 in patients with knee OA. In this open-label clinical 
trial, symptoms were assessed over 3 months in patients with primary knee OA 
receiving oral vitamin D3 4000 IU/day. Clinical response was evaluated at 
baseline and 3 months using WOMAC subscores and VAS. Serum levels of cytokines 
IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-13, IL-17, IL-33, IL-4, and IL-10 were determined by ELISA 
method. Eighty patients with knee OA were included. All 80 completed the study; 
the median 25(OH)D3 level was 23.1 ng/ml at baseline and increased by 12.3 ng/ml 
after treatment. Vitamin D3 after 3 months of supplementation induced a 
significant reduction in VAS pain and WOMAC subscores. Using OMERACT-OARSI 
criteria, 86.7% of patients treated with vitamin D3 responded to treatment. At 
the end of 3 months, systemic values of IL-1β (p < 0.01), IL-23 (p < 0.01), and 
IL-33 (p < 0.01) were significantly increased, values of TNF-α (p < 0.01), IL-13 
(p < 0.01), and IL-17 (p < 0.01) were significantly decreased, while value of 
IL-4 was not significantly changed. No adverse events were detected. Treatment 
with vitamin D is associated with improvement in pain, as well as stiffness and 
physical function. Vitamin D supplementation increased systemic values of IL-33. 
Our results indicate that vitamin D3 supplementation may be used as a novel 
therapeutic in knee OA. Future studies are needed to investigate a potential 
role of IL-33 in the pathogenesis of knee OA."
941,"CD8 + T cells undergo rapid expansion followed by contraction and the 
development of memory cells after their receptors are activated. The development 
of immunological memory following acute infection is a complex phenomenon that 
involves several molecular, transcriptional, and metabolic mechanisms. As memory 
cells confer long-term protection and respond to secondary stimulation with 
strong effector function, understanding the mechanisms that influence their 
development is of great importance. Orphan nuclear receptors, NR4As, are 
immediate early genes that function as transcription factors and bind with the 
NBRE region of chromatin. Interestingly, the NBRE region of activated CD8 + T 
cells is highly accessible at the same time the expression of NR4As is induced. 
This suggests a potential role of NR4As in the early events post T cell 
activation that determines cell fate decisions. In this review, we will discuss 
the influence of NR4As on the differentiation of CD8 + T cells during the immune 
response to acute infection and the development of immunological memory. We will 
also discuss the signals, transcription factors, and metabolic mechanisms that 
control cell fate decisions. HIGHLIGHTS: Memory CD8 + T cells are an essential 
subset that mediates long-term protection after pathogen encounters. Some 
specific environmental cues, transcriptional factors, and metabolic pathways 
regulate the differentiation of CD8 + T cells and the development of memory 
cells. Orphan nuclear receptor NR4As are early genes that act as transcription 
factors and are highly expressed post-T cell receptor activation. NR4As 
influence the effector function and differentiation of CD8 + T cells and also 
control the development of immunological memory following acute infection."
942,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a major health problem affecting a large proportion 
of the general population. Testosterone also plays a key role in sexual 
dysfunction. In this study, we found that testosterone can inhibit cavernous 
fibrosis by affecting the expression of miR-22-3p, providing a new basis for 
research and treatment of ED. Old and young rats were used to study the effects 
of testosterone on cavernous fibrosis. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson's 
staining were used to observe the cavernous tissue. A luciferase assay was used 
to analyze the relationship between the miR-22-3p, TGFβR1, and Galectin-1 
signaling pathways. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were used to detect the 
proliferation and apoptosis rates of cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CSMCs) 
following testosterone intervention. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed 
to examine the positive rate of caspase 3 and Ki67. IF was used to analyze the 
expression of collagen IV, MMP2, and α-SMA. The levels of GnRH, tT, LH, and 
F-TESTO in old rats increased after testosterone intervention. miR-22-3p 
inhibits the expression of TGFβR1 and Galectin-1. The protein expression of 
TGFβR1, Galectin-1, SMAD2, and p-SMAD2 was reduced by testosterone. The 
expression levels of α-SMA, collagen I, collagen IV, FN, and MMP2 in the 
cavernous tissues of old rats treated with testosterone were significantly 
reduced. The levels of caspase 3 and collagen IV decreased, and the levels of 
MMP2, Ki67, and α-SMA increased. Testosterone and miR-22-3p inhibit CSMC 
apoptosis and promote cell proliferation. Testosterone promoted the expression 
of miR-22-3p to interfere with the expression of the cavernous TGFβR1 and 
Galectin-1 signaling pathways. Testosterone can reduce cavernous fibrosis during 
the treatment of functional ED."
943,"UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) metabolizes a number of endogenous and 
exogenous substrates. Renal cells express high amounts of UGT; however, the 
significance of UGT in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unknown. 
In this study, we profile the mRNA expression of UGT subtypes (UGT1A6, UGT1A9, 
and UGT2B7) and their genetic variants in the kidney tissue of 125 Japanese 
patients with RCC (Okayama University Hospital, Japan). In addition, we 
elucidate the association between the UGT variants and UGT mRNA expression 
levels and clinical outcomes in these patients. The three representative genetic 
variants, namely, UGT1A6 541A > G, UGT1A9 i399C > T, and UGT2B7-161C > T, were 
genotyped, and their mRNA expression levels in each tissue were determined. We 
found that the mRNA expression of the three UGTs (UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7) 
are significantly downregulated in RCC tissues. Moreover, in patients with RCC, 
the UGT2B7-161C > T variant and high UGT2B7 mRNA expression are significantly 
correlated with preferable cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival 
(OS), respectively. As such, the UGT2B7-161C > T variant and UGT2B7 mRNA 
expression level were identified as significant independent prognostic factors 
of CSS and CSS/OS, respectively. Taken together, these findings indicate that 
UGT2B7 has a role in RCC progression and may, therefore, represent a potential 
prognostic biomarker for patients with RCC."
944,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) through mechanisms that remain incompletely 
characterized. Similar to AD, TBI models present with cellular metabolic 
alterations and modulated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). 
Specifically, AD and TBI tissues display increases in amyloid-β as well as its 
precursor, the APP C-terminal fragment of 99 a.a. (C99). Our recent data in cell 
models of AD indicate that C99, due to its affinity for cholesterol, induces the 
formation of transient lipid raft domains in the ER known as 
mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (""MAM"" domains). 
The formation of these domains recruits and activates specific lipid metabolic 
enzymes that regulate cellular cholesterol trafficking and sphingolipid 
turnover. Increased C99 levels in AD cell models promote MAM formation and 
significantly modulate cellular lipid homeostasis. Here, these phenotypes were 
recapitulated in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in adult 
mice. Specifically, the injured cortex and hippocampus displayed significant 
increases in C99 and MAM activity, as measured by phospholipid synthesis, 
sphingomyelinase activity and cholesterol turnover. In addition, our cell 
type-specific lipidomics analyses revealed significant changes in microglial 
lipid composition that are consistent with the observed alterations in 
MAM-resident enzymes. Altogether, we propose that alterations in the regulation 
of MAM and relevant lipid metabolic pathways could contribute to the 
epidemiological connection between TBI and AD."
945,"Although the handling and exploitation of cyanobacteria is associated with some 
challenges, these phototrophic bacteria offer great opportunities for innovative 
biotechnological processes. This chapter covers versatile aspects of working 
with cyanobacteria, starting with up-to-date in silico and in vitro screening 
methods for bioactive substances. Subsequently, common conservation techniques 
and vitality/viability estimation methods are compared and supplemented by own 
data regarding the non-invasive vitality evaluation via pulse amplitude 
modulated fluorometry. Moreover, novel findings about the influence the state of 
the pre-cultures have on main cultures are presented. The following sub-chapters 
deal with different photobioreactor-designs, with special regard to biofilm 
photobioreactors, as well as with heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation 
modes. The latter topic provides information from literature on successfully 
enhanced cyanobacterial production processes, augmented by own data."
946,"Alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) are a group of isoenzymes, situated on the external 
layer of the cell membrane; they catalyze the hydrolysis of organic phosphate 
esters present in the extracellular space. Zinc and magnesium are significant 
co-factors for the biological activity of these enzymes. Although ALPs are 
available in various body tissues and have distinct physiochemical properties, 
they are true isoenzymes since they catalyze a similar reaction. In the liver, 
ALP is cytosolic and present in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocytes. 
ALPs are available in placenta, ileal mucosa, kidney, bone, and liver. However, 
most of the ALPs in serum (over 80%) are delivered from liver and bone and in 
more modest quantities from the intestines. Despite the fact that alkaline 
phosphatases are found in numerous tissues all through the body, their exact 
physiological function remains largely unknown."
947,"Mycosis Fungoides (MF) makes up the most of the cutaneous lymphomas. As a 
malignant disease, the greatest diagnostical challenge is to timely 
differentiate MF from inflammatory diseases. Contemporary computational methods 
successfully identify cell nuclei in histological specimens. Deep learning 
methods are especially favored for such tasks. A deep learning model was used to 
detect nuclei Hematoxylin-Eosin(H-E) stained micrographs. Nuclear properties are 
extracted after detection. A multi-layer perceptron classifier is used to detect 
lymphocytes specifically among the detected nuclei. The comparisons for each 
property between MF and non-MF were carried out using statistical tests the 
results are compared with the findings in the literature to provide a 
descriptive analysis as well. Random forest classifier method is used to build a 
model to classify MF and non-MF lymphocytes. 10 nuclear properties were 
statistically significantly different between MF and non-MF specimens. MF nuclei 
were smaller, darker and more heterogenous. Lymphocyte detection algorithm had 
an average 90.5% prediction power and MF detection algorithm had an average 
94.2% prediction power. This project aims to fill the gap between computational 
advancement and medical practice. The models could make MF diagnoses easier, 
more accurate and earlier. The results also challenge the manually examined and 
defined nuclear properties of MF with the help of data abundance and computer 
objectivity."
948,"Poly-hydroxy-butyrate (PHB) bioplastic resin can be made directly from 
atmospheric CO2 using cyanobacteria. However, higher PHB productivities are 
required before large-scale production is economically viable. Random 
mutagenesis offers a way to create new production strains with increased PHB 
yields and increased biomass densities without complex technical manipulation 
associated with genetically modified organisms. This study used staining with 
lipid fluorescent dye (BODIPY 493/593) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting 
(FACS) to select high lipid content mutants and followed this with a well plate 
growth screen. Thirteen mutants were selected for flask cultivation and two 
strains produced significantly higher PHB yields (29% and 26% higher than wild 
type), biomass accumulation (36% and 33% higher than wild type) and volumetric 
PHB density (75% and 67% higher than wild type). The maximum PHB yielding strain 
(% dcw) was 12.0%, which was 43% higher than the wild type (8.3% in this study). 
The highest volumetric PHB density was 18.8 mg PHB/L compared to 10.7 mg PHB/L 
by the wild type. To develop cyanobacterial strain with higher PHB 
productivities, the combination of random chemical mutagenesis and FACS holds 
great potential to promote cyanobacteria bioplastic production becoming 
economically viable."
949,"Accurate measurement of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) copy 
number variation (CNV) is very important for guiding the tumor target therapy in 
breast cancer. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a sensitive and an absolute quantitative 
method, which can be used to detect HER2 CNV. Three HER2 exon-specific digital 
PCR assays along with three new reference genes assays (homo sapiens 
ribonuclease P RNA component H1 (RPPH1), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), 
and chromosome 1 open reading frame 43 (C1ORF43), on different chromosomes) were 
established and validated by using standard reference material, 8 different cell 
lines and 110 clinical Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. DPCR 
can achieve precise quantification of HER2 CNV by calculating the ratio of 
HER2/reference gene. The positive and negative coincidence rates were 98% 
(53/54) and 95% (53/56), respectively, compared with fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) diagnostic result 110 of FFPE samples. The common reference 
gene CEP17 used for FISH diagnostic was not suitable as single reference gene 
for HER2 CNV measurements by dPCR. The best practice of HER2 CNV determination 
by dPCR is to conduct the three duplex assays of H1 (HER2 exon 4) with the 
proposed three new reference genes, with a positive cut-off value of 
H1/RPPH1 ≥ 2.0 or H1/averaged reference gene ≥ 2.0. The proposed dPCR method in 
our study can accurately provide absolute copy number of HER2 and reference gene 
on an alternative chromosome, thus avoiding false negative caused by polysomy of 
chromosome 17. The improved molecular typing and diagnosis of breast cancer will 
better guide clinical medication."
950,"Local re-occurrence of cancer in patients with solid tumors is currently the 
most common reason for failure of treatment strategies. This fact indicates that 
prevailing approaches for tumor resection can cure only 50% of patients. A major 
cause of failure in tumor resection is off-target drug cytotoxicity and lack of 
sensitivity in tumor detection methods. These disadvantages are addressed with 
the development of targeted therapy and diagnostics, which significantly aid 
treatment strategies. Targeted diagnostics exploit properties of tumor cells 
that show significant up-regulation of tumor biomarkers. These biomarkers are 
targeted by a homing ligand attached to a fluorophore for visual inspection 
during surgery. However, these approaches suffer from disadvantages like high 
autofluorescence from background tissues, tissue absorption, and scattering, 
resulting in decreased image sensitivity and resolution. The use of 
near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores to overcome these drawbacks has generated 
unprecedented interest among researchers. The NIR window lies within the range 
of 650 to 1,700 nm, which results in reduced absorption and scattering by the 
tissues, thereby providing deeper tissue penetration and reduced 
autofluorescence. NIR fluorophores can be designed to target tumor biomarkers 
such as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) or folate receptors found 
over-expressed on cancer tissues. These targeted fluorophores consist of 
small-molecule ligands conjugated with NIR dyes that bind with high specificity 
to PSMA and folic acid receptors. In this protocol, we have extensively 
described the methodology for the synthesis of targeted NIR agents for PSMA 
(DUPA-NIR bioconjugate) and folic acid (folate-NIR bioconjugate), along with 
detailed steps for preclinical evaluation. Procedures to calculate the binding 
affinity to cancer cells in vitro are described, along with uptake and 
biodistribution in different mice models in vivo. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

951,"The heart relies predominantly on the use of fatty acids to derive energy. 
Metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes pose a 
major risk factor for the development of heart failure. Dysregulation of lipid 
metabolism observed in these diseases manifests as cardiac lipotoxicity, and is 
associated with cardiac dysfunction. The alarming rise in the incidence of these 
metabolic disorders warrants the need for tools to investigate the underlying 
molecular mechanisms. In this article, we describe a confocal microscopy-based 
approach to monitor fatty acid uptake and lipid accumulation in vitro, in 
neonatal murine cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells. The protocol for assessment of 
fatty acid uptake relies on the use of BODIPY FL C 12™ to study the kinetics of 
fatty acid uptake via real-time imaging of fatty acid uptake in live cells. 
Importantly, it circumvents the need for radioactive labeling of fatty acids to 
evaluate their uptake. Similarly, the protocol for assessment of lipid 
accumulation relies on the use of BODIPY™ 493/503 to stain the cytosolic neutral 
lipid population in fixed cells. We couple these confocal microscopy-based 
approaches with fluorescence intensity analysis using FIJI to quantify fatty 
acid uptake and lipid accumulation in vitro. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic

952,"OBJECTIVE: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease mediated by 
antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The thymus plays a primary 
role in AChR-MG and is characterized by a type I interferon (IFN) signature 
linked to IFN-β. We investigated if AChR-MG was characterized by an IFN-I 
signature in the blood, and further investigated the chronic thymic IFN-I 
signature.
METHODS: Serum levels of IFN-β and IFN-α subtypes, and mRNA expression for IFN-I 
subtypes and IFN-stimulated genes in PBMCs were analyzed. The contribution of 
endogenous nucleic acids in thymic expression of IFN-I subtypes was investigated 
in human thymic epithelial cell cultures and the mouse thymus. By 
immunohistochemistry, thymic CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages were analyzed in 
AChR-MG. To investigate the impact of a decrease in thymic macrophages, mice 
were treated with an anti-CSF1R antibody.
RESULTS: No IFN-I signature was observed in the periphery emphasizing that the 
IFN-I signature is restricted to the MG thymus. Molecules mimicking endogenous 
dsDNA signalization (Poly(dA:dT) and 2'3'-cGAMP), or dexamethasone-induced 
necrotic thymocytes increased IFN-β and α-AChR expression by thymic epithelial 
cells, and in the mouse thymus. A significant decrease in thymic macrophages was 
demonstrated in AChR-MG. In mice, a decrease in thymic macrophages led to an 
increase of necrotic thymocytes associated with IFN-β and α-AChR expression.
INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the decrease of thymic macrophages in 
AChR-MG impairs the elimination of apoptotic thymocytes favoring the release of 
endogenous nucleic acids from necrotic thymocytes. In this inflammatory context, 
thymic epithelial cells may overexpress IFN-β, which specifically induces 
α-AChR, resulting in self-sensitization and thymic changes leading to AChR-MG.

953,"Functional membrane proteins in the plasma membrane are suggested to have 
specific membrane environments that play important roles to maintain and 
regulate their function. However, the local membrane environments of membrane 
proteins remain largely unexplored due to the lack of available techniques. We 
have developed a method to probe the local membrane environment surrounding 
membrane proteins in the plasma membrane by covalently tethering a 
solvatochromic, environment-sensitive dye, Nile Red, to a GPI-anchored protein 
and the insulin receptor through a flexible linker. The fluidity of the membrane 
environment of the GPI-anchored protein depended upon the saturation of the acyl 
chains of the lipid anchor. The local environment of the insulin receptor was 
distinct from the average plasma membrane fluidity and was quite dynamic and 
heterogeneous. Upon addition of insulin, the local membrane environment 
surrounding the receptor specifically increased in fluidity in an insulin 
receptor-kinase dependent manner and on the distance between the dye and the 
receptor."
954,"BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Various types of stress initially induce a state of 
cardiac hypertrophy (CH) in the heart. But, persistent escalation of cardiac 
stress leads to progression from an adaptive physiological to a maladaptive 
pathological state. So, elucidating molecular mechanisms that can attenuate CH 
is imperative in developing cardiac therapies. Previously, we showed that 
Prohibitin1 (PHB1) has a protective role in CH-induced oxidative stress. 
Nevertheless, it is unclear how PHB1, a mitochondrial protein, has a protective 
role in CH. Therefore, we hypothesized that PHB1 maintains mitochondrial quality 
in CH. To test this hypothesis, we used Isoproterenol (ISO) to induce CH in H9C2 
cells overexpressing PHB1 and elucidated mitochondrial quality control pathways.
RESULTS: We found that overexpressing PHB1 attenuates ISO-induced CH and 
restores mitochondrial morphology in H9C2 cells. In addition, PHB1 blocks the 
pro-hypertrophic IGF1R/AKT pathway and restores the mitochondrial membrane 
polarization in ISO-treated cells. We observed that overexpressing PHB1 promotes 
mitochondrial biogenesis, improves mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and 
triggers mitophagy.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that PHB1 maintains mitochondrial quality in ISO-induced 
CH in H9C2 cells."
955,"The advent of modern quantitative protein mass spectrometry techniques around 
the turn of the 21st century has contributed to a revolution in biology referred 
to as ""systems biology"". These methods allow identification and quantification 
of thousands of proteins in a biological specimen, as well as detection and 
quantification of post-translational protein modifications including 
phosphorylation. Here, we discuss these methodologies and show how they can be 
applied to understand the effects of the peptide hormone vasopressin to regulate 
the molecular water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2). The emerging picture provides a 
detailed framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in water 
balance disorders. Abstract figure legend Various quantitative protein mass 
spectrometry have been used to study the mechanisms of vasopressin induced AQP2 
protein expression. SILAC is a technology using isotopes (C-13 and N-15) to 
label arginine and lysine in cell culture that allows mass spectrometry to 
distinguish control and treatment samples. The quantification is done by 
measuring the relative intensity of the light and heavy peptides that 
corresponded to the relative abundance of the parent protein in the samples. 
Dynamic SILAC is designed to quantify protein half-lives and translation rates 
by switching normal media to heavy isotopes containing media and trace the 
changes of intensity in the light and heavy peptides. TMT is a set of isotopic 
tags with the same molecular weight that can label peptides directly. The 
advantages of the TMT technology is multiplexing and can be applied to any 
sample types without pre-incubation with heavy isotope culture media. 
Multiplexing of TMT quantification is essential for study time-responsive 
phosphoproteomics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
956,"Hyperinflammation characterized by elevated proinflammatory cytokines known as 
""cytokine storms"" is the major cause of high severity and mortality seen in 
COVID-19 patients. The pathology behind the cytokine storms is currently 
unknown. Increased HMGB1 levels in serum/plasma of COVID-19 patients were 
reported by many studies, which positively correlated with the level of 
proinflammatory cytokines. Dead cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection might 
release a large amount of HMGB1 and RNA of SARS-CoV-2 into extracellular space. 
HMGB1 is a well-known inflammatory mediator. Additionally, extracellular HMGB1 
might interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA because of its high capability to bind with a 
wide variety of molecules including nucleic acids and could trigger massive 
proinflammatory immune responses. This review aimed to critically explore the 
many possible pathways by which HMGB1-SARS-CoV-2 RNA complexes mediate 
proinflammatory responses in COVID-19. The contribution of these pathways to 
impair host immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to a cytokine 
storm was also evaluated. Moreover, since blocking of the HMGB1-SARS-CoV-2 RNA 
interaction might have therapeutic value, some of HMGB1 antagonists have been 
reviewed. The HMGB1- SARS-CoV-2 RNA complexes might trigger endocytosis via RAGE 
which is linked to lysosomal rupture, PRRs activation and pyroptotic death. High 
levels of the proinflammatory cytokines produced might suppress many immune 
cells leading to uncontrolled viral infection and cell damage with more HMGB1 
released. Altogether these mechanisms might initiate a proinflammatory cycle 
leading to a cytokine storm. HMGB1 antagonists could be considered to give 
benefit in alleviating cytokine storms and serve as a potential candidate for 
COVID-19 therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

10% of M-PTLD. No large multi-institutional pediatric-specific reports on 
treatment and outcome are available.
METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective review of solid organ recipients 
diagnosed with EBV(-)M-PTLD aged ≤21 years between 2001 and 2020 in 12 centers 
in the United States and United Kingdom was performed, including demographics, 
staging, treatment, and outcomes data.
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were identified with EBV(-)M-PTLD. Twenty-three 
(63.9%) were male. Median age (range) at transplantation, diagnosis of 
EBV(-)M-PTLD, and interval from transplant to PTLD were 2.2 years (0.1-17), 14 
years (3.0-20), and 8.5 years (0.6-18.3), respectively. Kidney (n = 17 [47.2%]) 
and heart (n = 13 [36.1%]) were the most commonly transplanted organs. Most were 
Murphy stage III (n = 25 [69.4%]). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 22/34 
(64.7%) and ≥2 times upper limit of normal in 11/34 (32.4%). Pathological 
diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 31 [86.1%]) and 
B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 5 [13.9%]). Of 
nine different regimens used, the most common were: pediatric mature 
B-NHL-specific regimen (n = 13 [36.1%]) and low-dose cyclophosphamide, 
prednisone, and rituximab (n = 9 [25%]). Median follow-up from diagnosis was 3.0 
years (0.3-11.0 years). Three-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall 
survival (OS) were 64.8% and 79.9%, respectively. Of the seven deaths, six were 
from progressive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: EFS and OS were comparable to pediatric EBV(+) PTLD, but inferior 
to mature B-NHL in immunocompetent pediatric patients. The wide range of 
therapeutic regimens used directs our work toward developing an active 
multi-institutional registry to design prospective studies.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Pediatric Epstein-Barr virus-negative monomorphic post 
solid organ transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV(-)M-PTLD) have 
comparable outcomes to EBV(+) PTLD, but are inferior to diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma in immunocompetent pediatric patients. The variety of treatment 
regimens used highlights the need to develop a pediatric PTLD registry to 
prospectively evaluate outcomes. The impact of treatment regimen on relapse risk 
could not be assessed because of small numbers. In the intensive pediatric 
B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma chemoimmunotherapy group, 11 of 13 patients remain alive 
in complete remission after 0.6 to 11 years."
958,"1 PURPOSE: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have become promising biomarkers for 
cancer management. Particularly, the molecular cargo such as proteins carried by 
EVs are similar to their cells of origin, providing important information that 
can be used for cancer diagnostics, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. 
However, to date, molecular analysis on EVs is still challenging, limited by the 
availability of efficient analytical technologies, largely due to the small size 
of EVs. In this work, we developed a computational workflow for in-silico 
identification of potential EV protein markers from genomics and proteomics 
databases, and applied it for the discovery of osteosarcoma (OS) EV protein 
markers. 2 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Both mRNA and protein data were computed and 
compared from publicly accessible databases, and top markers with high 
differential expression levels were selected. 3 RESULTS: Thirty nine markers 
were identified overexpressed and seven found to be downregulated. These 
identified markers have been found to be associated with OS on different aspects 
in literature, demonstrating the usability of this workflow. 4 CONCLUSIONS AND 
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This work provides a list of potential EV protein markers 
that are either overexpressed or downregulated in OS for further experimental 
validation for improved clinical management of OS. This article is protected by

959,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), which is caused by a novel 
Bunyavirus, has gradually become a threatening infectious disease in rural areas 
of Asia. Studies have identified a severe cytokine storm and impaired humoral 
immune response in SFTS. However, the cellular immune response to SFTS virus 
(SFTSV) infection remains largely unknown. Here we report that SFTS patients had 
a cytokine storm accompanied by high levels of chemokines. CD8+ T cells in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of SFTS patients exhibited a more activated 
phenotype and enhanced the antiviral responses. They increased the expression of 
CD69 and CD25, secreted a higher level of IFN-γ and granzyme, and had a stronger 
proliferative ability than in healthy controls. In convalescent SFTS patients, 
the expression of CD69 and CD25 on CD8+ T cells was reduced. In addition, we 
found the ratio and cellularity of CD14+ CD16+ intermediate monocytes were 
increased in peripheral blood of SFTS patients. Both the expression of C-X-C 
motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) on CD14+ CD16+ intermediate monocytes and the 
expression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) on CD8+ T cells increased 
dramatically in SFTS patients. Our studies reveal a potential pathway that CD8+ 
T cells rapidly activate and are mostly recruited by intermediate monocytes 
through CXCL10 in SFTSV infection. Our results may be of clinical relevance for 
further treatment and discharge instructions in SFTSV infections."
960,"Spermatogenesis is a complex process that includes spermatogonia self-renewal, 
spermatocyte meiosis and spermatozoa assembly. Recent studies have revealed that 
WD40-repeat domain-containing (WDR) proteins play important roles in 
spermatocyte division, spermatozoa flagella assembly and head shaping. In this 
study, we investigated the expression pattern of WDR87 and found that it was 
highly expressed in the testis of both humans and mice. Immunofluorescence 
staining revealed that mouse WDR87 was distributed in the perinuclear cytoplasm 
of primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids. In the 
spermiogenesis stage, with extension of the nucleus, WDR87 migrated to the 
manchette and finally localized to the middle piece of the spermatozoa tail. 
Furthermore, we identified a cilia- and flagella-associated protein, CFAP47, 
which interacted with WDR87 in the flagellar midpiece of the spermatozoa, 
suggesting that WDR87 may be associated with multiple morphological 
abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF). Subsequently, we screened gene mutations 
in seven MMAF individuals and found two novel mutations in CFAP47 (c.706G>A, 
Val236Met; c.1337C>T, Thr446Met) in one case. Immunoblotting and 
immunofluorescence revealed that CFAP47 was dramatically reduced in spermatozoa 
from the CFAP47-mutated man. Meanwhile, the expression of WDR87 was also 
significantly decreased, and weak signals were detected adjacent to the 
spermatozoa nuclei, indicating that CFAP47 was necessary for WDR87 
transportation during spermatozoa flagella biogenesis. These data indicate that 
WDR87 is located in the middle piece of the sperm tail and interacts with CFAP47 
to form a complex which is involved in spermatozoa tail assembly."
961,"MOTIVATION: We present a multi-sequence generalization of Variational 
Information Bottleneck (VIB) (Alemi et al., 2016) and call the resulting model 
Attentive Variational Information Bottleneck (AVIB). Our AVIB model leverages 
multi-head self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) to implicitly approximate a 
posterior distribution over latent encodings conditioned on multiple input 
sequences. We apply AVIB to a fundamental immuno-oncology problem: predicting 
the interactions between T cell receptors (TCRs) and peptides.
RESULTS: Experimental results on various datasets show that AVIB significantly 
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for TCR-peptide interaction prediction. 
Additionally, we show that the latent posterior distribution learned by AVIB is 
particularly effective for the unsupervised detection of out-of-distribution 
(OOD) amino acid sequences.

962,"MOTIVATION: Recent experimental evidence has shown that some long noncoding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) contain small open reading frames (sORFs) that are translated into 
functional micropeptides, suggesting that these lncRNAs are misannotated as 
noncoding. Current methods to detect misannotated lncRNAs rely on 
ribosome-profiling (Ribo-Seq) and mass-spectrometry experiments, which are 
cell-type dependent and expensive.
RESULTS: Here, we propose a computational method to identify possible 
misannotated lncRNAs from sequence information alone. Our approach first builds 
deep learning models to discriminate coding and non-coding transcripts and 
leverages these models' training dynamics to identify misannotated lncRNAs-i.e. 
lncRNAs with coding potential. The set of misannotated lncRNAs we identified 
significantly overlap with experimentally validated ones and closely resemble 
coding protein sequences as evidenced by significant BLAST hits. Our analysis on 
a subset of misannotated lncRNA candidates also shows that some ORFs they 
contain yield high confidence folded structures as predicted by AlphaFold2. This 
methodology offers promising potential for assisting experimental efforts in 
characterizing the hidden proteome encoded by misannotated lncRNAs and for 
curating better datasets for building coding potential predictors.

963,"Recent experimental evidence from our and other laboratories has strongly 
indicated that glutor, a piperazine-2-one derivative, which is a pan-GLUT 
inhibitor, displays a promising antineoplastic action by hampering glucose 
uptake owing to its ability to inhibit GLUT1 and GLUT3, which are overexpressed 
in neoplastic cells. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of the inhibiting 
action of glutor has remained elusive. Thus, for optimal utilization of the 
antineoplastic potential of glutor, it is essential to decipher the precise 
mechanism(s) of its interaction with GLUTs. Therefore, the present investigation 
was carried out to understand the molecular mechanism(s) of the binding of 
glutor to GLUT1 and GLUT3 in silico. This study suggests that glutor can 
effectively bind to GLUTs at the reported binding site. Moreover, the docking of 
glutor to GLUT was stabilised by several contacts between these two partners as 
shown by the 200 ns long molecular dynamic simulation carried out using Gromacs, 
indicating the formation of a stable complex. Moreover, glutor was found to 
possess all characteristics conducive to its drug-likeness. Hence, these 
observations suggest that glutor has the potential to be used in antineoplastic 
therapeutic applications.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
964,"Ion channels play an important role for regulation of the exocrine and the 
endocrine pancreas. This review focuses on the Ca2+-regulated K+ channel KCa3.1, 
encoded by the KCNN4 gene, which is present in both parts of the pancreas. In 
the islets of Langerhans, KCa3.1 channels are involved in the regulation of 
membrane potential oscillations characterizing nutrient-stimulated islet 
activity. Channel upregulation is induced by gluco- or lipotoxic conditions and 
might contribute to micro-inflammation and impaired insulin release in type 2 
diabetes mellitus as well as to diabetes-associated renal and vascular 
complications. In the exocrine pancreas KCa3.1 channels are expressed in acinar 
and ductal cells. They are thought to play a role for anion secretion during 
digestion but their physiological role has not been fully elucidated yet. 
Pancreatic carcinoma, especially pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is 
associated with drastic overexpression of KCa3.1. For pharmacological targeting 
of KCa3.1 channels, we are discussing the possible benefits KCa3.1 channel 
inhibitors might provide in the context of diabetes mellitus and pancreatic 
cancer, respectively. We are also giving a perspective for the use of a 
fluorescently labeled derivative of the KCa3.1 blocker senicapoc as a tool to 
monitor channel distribution in pancreatic tissue. In summary, modulating KCa3.1 
channel activity is a useful strategy for exo-and endocrine pancreatic disease 
but further studies are needed to evaluate its clinical suitability."
965,"OBJECTIVES: Pathological lymph node metastases are often observed in patients 
with clinical N0 lung cancer. Identifying preoperative predictors of occult 
hilar nodal metastasis is important in determining the surgical procedure in 
patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer. This study aimed to 
determine the frequency and predictors of occult hilar nodal metastasis by 
tumour location in these patients.
METHODS: Between April 2007 and May 2019, data of patients who underwent 
lobectomy or segmentectomy for clinical stage I pure-solid non-small cell lung 
cancer were retrospectively reviewed. The ratio of the distance from the 
pulmonary hilum to the proximal side of the tumour to the distance from the 
pulmonary hilum to the visceral pleural surface through the centre of the 
tumour, named ""distance ratio,"" was calculated. The relationship of the distance 
ratio with clinicopathological findings and prognosis was discussed.
RESULTS: A total of 357 patients were enrolled. Occult hilar nodal metastasis 
frequency was 14.6%. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether the 
distance ratio was ≤0.67 (central-type) or > 0.67 (peripheral-type). The 
frequency of occult hilar nodal metastasis was significantly higher in the 
distance ratio ≤0.67 group (21.5% vs 7.4%; P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis 
revealed that distance ratio was the only independent preoperative predictor of 
occult hilar nodal metastasis (odds ratio, 3.63; 95% confidence interval, 
1.83-7.18; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of occult hilar nodal metastasis was significantly 
higher in peripheral-type lung cancer; therefore, tumour location was the most 
important preoperative predictor of occult hilar nodal metastasis."
966,"The structural, composition, and molecular interaction of silver integrated zinc 
oxide (20 wt.% Ag/ZnO) were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy 
dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) 
spectrum. The XRD analysis showed the polycrystalline of small crystallite size, 
whereas the EDX spectrum confirmed the purity of the nanocomposite. The FTIR 
spectrum indicated the presence of Ag-Zn-O stretching vibration at 1034 cm-1. 
SEM and TEM images identified the surface morphology and particle size, 
indicating that Ag/ZnO of nanorods linked with spherical-like shapes. The 
nanorods of an average length of  ∼ 110 nm and an average diameter of  ∼ 10 nm. 
The optical characteristics showed a direct transition of electrons through an 
energy gap in the 3.30 eV-3.60 eV. The tested nanocomposite exhibited potent 
cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells with an IC50 value of 0.26 µg/ml with cell 
growth inhibition by 97.3% at the highest concentration compared to Doxorubicin 
(IC50=6.72 µg/ml). It significantly stimulated total apoptotic breast cancer 
cell death by 51-fold (32.16% compared to 0.63 for the control), arresting the 
cell progression at the G1 phase. For further validation of apoptotic activity, 
the tested Ag/ZnO-NP upregulated the proapoptotic genes and down-regulated the 
anti-apoptotic gene. Moreover, a molecular docking study highlighted the binding 
disposition of the nanocomposite as Bcl-2 inhibitors. Additionally, Ag/ZnO-NP 
exhibited potent antimicrobial activity. Hence, the synthesized nanocomposite 
can serve as an antimicrobial and cytotoxic agent through apoptosis-induction 
and could be developed as a biologically active nanocomposite.Communicated by

967,"BACKGROUND: Bioresorbable materials are compounds that decompose in 
physiological medium both in vitro and in vivo and are used as an alternative to 
temporary implant in injured tissues. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
morphology and cytochemistry of cells grown on fibrous poly(ε-caprolactone) 
(PCL) scaffolds, and to measure cell metabolism parameters by biochemical 
analysis of the conditioned culture medium from cells grown on the scaffolds.
METHODS: Fibrous PCL scaffolds were used under the following conditions: 
unaligned fibers (NA), fibers aligned at 150 rpm (A150), and fibers aligned at 
300 rpm (A300). Vero cells were cultured on these scaffolds for 24h, 48h and 
72h. Samples were analyzed by SEM, MicroCT, cytochemistry and culture medium 
biochemistry.
RESULTS: The results of cytochemical analysis shown cells were confluent and 
well spread on the culture plate, while cells grown on the polymeric scaffold, 
exhibited an elongated morphology. In the biochemical analyses, no significant 
differences were observed in the expression of alkaline phosphatase or in the 
levels of cholesterol or total protein in the culture medium. The different 
materials do not seem to promote changes in the expression or metabolism of 
these molecules. Only glucose was markedly reduced in the culture medium of 
cells grown on either aligned or unaligned scaffolds for 48h or 72h. This 
finding indicates intense energy requirements of cells grown on these scaffolds.
CONCLUSION: PCL fibers showed a great capacity to support cell growth. These 
data reinforce the interpretation that cells grow satisfactorily on PCL 
scaffolds."
968,"SUMMARY: Adult-onset nesidioblastosis is a rare complication of Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass surgery and may occur months to years after the initial surgical 
procedure. It is manifested by a hyperinsulinemic, hypoglycemic state. The 
annual incidence of adult-onset hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is believed to be 
less than 0.1 in 1 000 000 with a mean age of onset of 47 years (1). Here, we 
describe a patient who presented with worsening hypoglycemic symptoms for 1 year 
prior to presentation that eventually progressed to hypoglycemic seizures. The 
onset of this hypoglycemia was 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. A 
full neurological evaluation, which included an EEG, head CT, and MRI, was 
performed to rule out epilepsy and other seizure-related disorders. After 
hypoglycemia was confirmed, extensive laboratory studies were obtained to 
elucidate the cause of the hypoglycemia and differentiate nesidioblastosis from 
insulinoma. Once the diagnosis of nesidioblastosis was established, a sub-total 
pancreatectomy was performed, and the patient was discharged and placed on 
acarbose, a competitive reversible inhibitor of pancreatic α-amylase and 
intestinal brush border α-glucosidases which slows carbohydrate absorption. The 
lack of information and understanding of nesidioblastosis due to its rarity 
makes any knowledge of this rare but important surgical complication essential. 
As incidence of obesity increases, the number of gastric bypasses being 
performed increases with it, and understanding this disease process will be 
essential for the primary care provider. This is the primary reason for the 
writing of this publication.
LEARNING POINTS: Nesidioblastosis is a persistent hyperinsulinemic, hypoglycemic 
state, mostly seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, with symptoms 
occurring postprandially. The incidence is 0.1-0.3% of all post Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass patients. The key diagnostic clue to identifying nesidioblastosis 
is a positive selective arterial calcium stimulation test, showing a diffuse 
pattern of increased basal hepatic venous insulin concentration, whereas 
insulinomas would show focal increases. Pathological specimen of pancreas will 
show diffuse hypertrophy of beta cells. Management includes acarbose and total 
or subtotal pancreatectomy, which can be curative. With the prevalence of 
obesity increasing and more patients turning to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, more 
patients may be at risk of this potential surgical complication."
969,"Articular cartilage (AC) plays an unquestionable role in joint movements but 
unfortunately the healing capacity is restricted due to its avascular and 
acellular nature. While cartilage tissue engineering has been lifesaving, it is 
very challenging to remodel the complex cartilage composition and architecture 
with gradient physio-mechanical properties vital to proper tissue functions. To 
address these issues, a better understanding of the intrinsic AC properties and 
how cells respond to stimuli from the external microenvironment must be better 
understood. This is essential in order to take one step closer to producing 
functional cartilaginous constructs for clinical use. Recently, biopolymers have 
aroused much attention due to their versatility, processability, and flexibility 
because the properties can be tailored to match the requirements of AC. This 
review highlights polymeric scaffolds developed in the past decade for 
reconstruction of zonal AC layers including the superficial zone, middle zone, 
and deep zone by means of exogenous stimuli such as physical, mechanical and 
biological/chemical signals. The mimicked properties are reviewed in terms of 
the biochemical composition and organization, cell fate (morphology, 
orientation, and differentiation), as well as mechanical properties and finally, 
the challenges and potential ways to tackle them are discussed. This article is

970,"Most human tissue injuries lead to the formation of a fibrous scar and result in 
the loss of functional tissue. One adult tissue that exhibits a more 
regenerative response to injury with minimal scarring is the oral mucosa. We 
generated a microarray gene expression dataset to examine the response to injury 
from human palate and skin excisional biopsies spanning the first seven days 
after wounding. Differential expression analyses were performed in each tissue 
to identify genes overexpressed or underexpressed over time compared to baseline 
unwounded tissue. To attribute biological processes of interest to these gene 
expression changes, gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify core gene 
sets that are enriched over the time-course of the wound healing process with 
respect to unwounded tissue. This analysis identified gene sets uniquely 
enriched in either palate or skin wounds and gene sets that are enriched in both 
tissues in at least one time point after injury. Finally, a cell type enrichment 
analysis was performed to better understand the cell type distribution in these 
tissues and how it changes over the time course of wound healing. This work 
provides a source of human wound gene expression data that includes two tissue 
types with distinct regenerative and scarring phenotypes. This article is

971,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from any tumor tissue could contribute to 
metastasis and resistance to cancer treatments. In this study, we performed 
single-cell next-generation sequencing of CTCs and evaluated usefulness for 
characterizing tumor biology and mechanisms of metastasis in neuroblastomas 
(NB). We aimed to isolate CTCs from ten patients with NB at diagnosis before any 
treatments and four patients at relapse. GD2+ , CD90+ , CD45- , CD235a- , and 
DAPI- cells were isolated as neuroblastoma CTCs using fluorescence-activated 
cell sorting. In five patients with advanced stages (M stage), DNA and RNA 
sequencing of CTCs at single-cell level were performed. NB CTCs were isolated 
from eight of the ten patients at diagnosis and three of the four patients at 
relapse. More CTCs could be isolated from patients with advanced stages. In one 
patient, ALK mutation (p.F1174L), was identified in both tumor tissue and a CTC. 
In patients with MYCN amplification, this gene was amplified in 12 of 13 CTCs. 
Using single-cell RNA sequencing, angiogenesis- and cell cycle-related genes 
together with CCND1, TUBA1A genes were found to be upregulated in CTCs. In one 
patient, CTCs were divided into two subgroups showing different gene expression 
profiles. In one subgroup, cell cycle- and proliferation-related genes were 
differentially upregulated than the other. In conclusion, next-generation 
sequencing of CTCs at single-cell level might help to characterize tumor biology 
and mechanisms of metastasis in NB."
972,"BACKGROUND: The application of curcumin (CUR) in food industry is limited by its 
instability, hydrophobicity and low bioavailability. Yeast cell protein (YCP) is 
a by-product of spent brewer's yeast, which has the potential to deliver 
bioactive substances. However, the environmental stress such as pH, salt and 
heat treatment restricted its application in food industry. Maillard reaction as 
a non-enzymatic browning reaction can improve protein stability under 
environmental stress.
RESULTS: The CUR was successfully encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of 
YCP/GYCP and enhanced by hydrogen bonding, resulting in static fluorescence 
quenching of YCP/GYCP. The average diameter and dispersibility of GYPC-CUR 
nanocomplex have significantly improved after glucose glycation (121.40 nm vs 
139.70 nm). Moreover, the encapsulation capacity of CUR was not influenced by 
glucose glycation. The oxidative stability and bioaccessibility of CUR in 
nanocomplexes were increased compared with free CUR, especially complexed with 
GYCP conjugates.
CONCLUSION: Steric hindrance provided by glucose conjugation improved the 
enviriomental stability, oxidative activity and bioaccessibility of CUR in 
nanocomplexes. Thus, glucose-glycated YCP has potential application as a 
delivery carrier for hydrophobic compound in functional foods. This article is

973,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease affecting women, caused by 
somatic mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, and driven by estrogen. Similar to 
many cancers, it is metastatic, primarily to the lung. Despite its monogenetic 
nature, like many cancers, LAM is a heterogeneous disease. The cellular 
constituents of LAM are very diverse, including mesenchymal, epithelial, 
endothelial and immune cells. LAM is characterized by dysregulation of many cell 
signaling pathways, distinct populations of LAM cells, and a rich 
microenvironment, in which the immune system appears to play an important role. 
This review delineates the heterogeneity of LAM and focuses on the metastatic 
features of LAM, the deregulated signaling mechanisms and the tumor 
microenvironment. Understanding the tumor-host interaction in LAM may provide 
insights into development of new therapeutic strategies, which could be 
combinatorial or superlative to Sirolimus, the current FDA-approved treatment."
974,"Obesity is a major risk factor for developing various health problems, including 
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Although controversial, accumulation of 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and notably an increase in mitochondrial reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) production, was proposed as a key contributor leading to 
obesity-induced insulin resistance. Here, our goal was to investigate whether 
Parkin overexpression, a key regulator of the removal of dysfunctional 
mitochondria through mitophagy, could confer protection against obesity-induced 
mitochondrial dysfunction. To this end, intramuscular injections of 
adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were performed to overexpress Parkin in limb 
muscle of 6-month-old mice fed a control diet (CD) or a high fat diet (HFD) for 
12 weeks. An AAV expressing GFP was used as control. HFD increased fat mass, 
altered glycemia and resulted in insulin resistance. Parkin overexpression 
resulted in an increase in muscle mass in both CD and HFD mice. In CD mice, 
Parkin overexpression increased maximal mitochondrial respiration and lowered 
H2O2 emission. HFD increased mitochondrial respiration and, surprisingly, also 
lowered H2O2 emission. Parkin overexpression did not significantly impact 
mitochondrial function in HFD mice. Taken altogether, our results indicate that 
Parkin overexpression positively impacts muscle and mitochondrial health under 
basal conditions and challenge the notion that intrinsic mitochondrial 
dysfunction is involved in the development of insulin resistance caused by high 
fat feeding."
975,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has become one of the leading causes of 
cancer-related deaths across the world. A lack of durable responses to 
standard-of-care chemotherapies renders its treatment particularly challenging 
and largely contributes to the devastating outcome. Gemcitabine, a pyrimidine 
antimetabolite, is a cornerstone in PDA treatment. Given the importance of 
gemcitabine in PDA therapy, extensive efforts are focusing on exploring 
mechanisms by which cancer cells evade gemcitabine cytotoxicity, but strategies 
to overcome them have not been translated into patient care. Here, we will 
introduce the standard treatment paradigm for PDA patients, highlight mechanisms 
of gemcitabine action, elucidate gemcitabine resistance mechanisms, and discuss 
promising strategies to circumvent them."
976,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a classical hormonal system involved in a 
myriad of cardiovascular functions. This system is composed of many different 
peptides that act in the heart through different receptors. One of the most 
important of these peptides is Angiotensin II, which in pathological conditions 
triggers a set of actions that lead to heart failure. On the other hand, another 
RAS peptide, Angiotensin-(1-7) is well known to develop powerful therapeutic 
effects in many forms of cardiac diseases. In the last decade, two new 
components of RAS were described, the heptapeptide Alamandine and its receptor, 
the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member D (MrgD). Since then, great 
effort was made to characterize their physiological and pathological function in 
the heart. In this review, we summarize the latest insights about the actions of 
Alamandine/MrgD axis in the heart, with particular emphasis in the 
cardiomyocyte. More specifically, we focused on their anti-hypertrophic and 
contractility effects, and the related molecular events activated in the 
cardiomyocyte."
977,"Recently, there has been increased recognition of the importance of sex as a 
biological factor affecting disease and health. Many preclinical studies have 
suggested that males may experience a less favorable outcome in response to 
sepsis than females. The underlying mechanisms for these differences are still 
largely unknown but are thought to be related to the beneficial effects of 
estrogen. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive role of testosterone is also 
thought to contribute to the sex-dependent differences that are present in 
clinical sepsis. There are still significant knowledge gaps in this field. This 
mini-review will provide a brief overview of sex-dependent variables in relation 
to sepsis and the cardiovascular system. Preclinical animal models for sepsis 
research will also be discussed. The intent of this mini-review is to inspire 
interest for future considerations of sex related variables in sepsis that 
should be addressed to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
in sepsis-induced cardiovascular dysfunction for identification of therapeutic 
targets and improved sepsis management and treatment."
978,"In vitro models provide an important platform for the investigation of cellular 
growth and atrophy to inform, or extend mechanistic insights from, logistically 
challenging in vivo trials. While these models allow for the identification of 
candidate mechanistic pathways, many models involve supraphysiological dosages, 
non-physiological conditions, or experimental changes relating to individual 
proteins or receptors, all of which limit translation to human trials. To 
overcome these drawbacks, the use of ex vivo human plasma and serum has been 
used in cellular models to investigate changes in myotube hypertrophy, cellular 
protein synthesis, anabolic and catabolic markers in response to differing age, 
disease states, and nutrient status. However, there are currently no concurrent 
guidelines outlining the optimal methodology for this model. This review 
discusses the key methodological considerations surrounding the use of ex 
vivoplasma and serum, with a focus in application to skeletal muscle cell lines 
(i.e., C2C12, L6 and LHCN-M2) and human primary skeletal muscle cells (HSMC) as 
a means to investigate molecular signaling in models of atrophy and hypertrophy, 
alongside future directions."
979,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is among the most frequent diseases of the musculoskeletal 
system. Degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) is a hallmark of OA. 
During the degradation process intact/full-length proteins as well as 
proteolytic fragments are released which then might induce different downstream 
responses via diverse receptors, therefore leading to different biological 
consequences. Collagen type II and the proteoglycan aggrecan are the most 
abundant components of the cartilage ECM. However, over the last decades, a 
large number of minor components have been identified and for some of those a 
role in the manifold processes associated with OA has already been demonstrated. 
To date, there is still no therapy able to halt or cure OA. A better 
understanding of the matrikine landscape occurring with or even preceding 
obvious degenerative changes in joint tissues is needed and might help to 
identify molecules that could serve as biomarkers, druggable targets, or even be 
blueprints for DMOADs. For this narrative review, we screened PubMed for 
relevant literature in English language and summarized the current knowledge 
regarding the function of selected ECM molecules and the derived matrikines in 
the context of cartilage and OA."
980,"BACKGROUND: Eltrombopag has an off-label indication for haematopoietic cell 
transplantation in patients experiencing delayed thrombocyte recovery and/or 
thrombocytopaenia.
AIMS: To present our centre's experience of using this agent not only for post- 
haematopoietic cell transplantation thrombocytopaenia but also for poor graft 
functioning in the post-haematopoietic cell transplantation setting.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Thirty-nine patients who had persistent cytopaenia following 
haematopoietic cell transplantation and treated with eltrombopag at our centre 
between October 2011 and December 2021 were retrospectively identified. During 
this period, 9 (23.1%) and 30 (76.9%) patients who underwent allogeneic 
transplantations, respectively, received eltrombopag.
RESULTS: The female-to-male ratio was 12:27, and the median transplant age was 
49 (18-70) years. Eight (20.5%) patients had isolated thrombocytopaenia, 19 
(49.4%) had bi-lineage cytopaenia and 12 (30.1%) had pancytopaenia. Patients 
received a median of 50 mg/day (25-150 mg/day) of eltrombopagfor a median 
duration of 82 (24-386) days. Nine (23.1%) patients had autologous 
haematopoietic cell transplantation, and 30 (76.9%) had allogeneic 
haematopoietic cell transplantation (14 unrelated, 9 sibling and 7 
haploidentical). The median donor age was 32 (20-67) years. The median follow-up 
was 16.4 (1.8-84.3) months. The median pre-treatment platelet count was 11x109/l 
(1-23), which increased to 41x109/l (6-150). The median platelet count increment 
was 29.5x109/l (p = 0.001). The pre-treatment median neutrophil count was 
1.19x109/l (0.39-5.1), which increased to 2.35 x109/l (0.1-5.33) (p = 0.05), and 
the pre-treatment median haemoglobin was 8.3 (6.2-14) g/dl, which increased to 
10 (6.2-14) g/dl (p = 0.001) with eltrombopag. No eltrombopag-related 
hepatotoxicity occurred; however, 1 (2.6%) patient failed to continue treatment 
because of two consecutive episodes of deep venous thrombosis. Six (15.4%) 
patients were unresponsive to eltrombopag and dependent on blood product 
transfusions. After a median time of 82 days, 61.5% of the patients discontinued 
eltrombopag successfully.
CONCLUSION: The results confirmed that eltrombopag could provide a rapid, 
sustained response in patients with poor graft functioning after haematopoietic 
cell transplantation. This finding is essential given the high rate of 
non-relapse mortality caused by poor graft functioning after haematopoietic cell 
transplantation."
981,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal 
mucosa affecting the quality of life of patients. SRY-box transcription factor 
11 (SOX11) was reported to play important roles in inflammatory responses, but 
its role in AR is poorly understood.
AIMS: To explore the role of SOX11 in the development of allergic rhinitis.
STUDY DESIGN: Cell culture and animal study.
METHODS: An in vivo murine allergic rhinitis model was established using 
ovalbumin treatment in female mice. Interleukin-13-stimulated human nasal mucosa 
epithelial cells were used for in vitro studies. Expression levels of SOX11, 
epithelial-derived cytokines, and mucin were determined in both modesls.
RESULTS: SOX11 was highly expressed in allergic rhinitis mice. Allergy symptoms, 
serum ovalbumin-specific IgE, histamine, eosinophils, goblet cells, and type 2 
cytokine secretion were increased in ovalbumin-treated mice. Furthermore, 
allergic rhinitis mice exhibited overproduction of epithelial-derived cytokines 
(thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interleukin-25, interleukin-33), C-C motif 
chemokine ligand 26 (CCL26), and mucin 5 AC (MUC5AC). Silencing SOX11 alleviated 
the behavioral symptoms and upregulation of epithelial-derived cytokines, CCL26, 
and MUC5AC. In human nasal mucosa epithelial cells, interleukin-13 enhanced 
SOX11 expression in a time-dependent manner, and signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 6 (STAT6) was involved in the interleukin-13-mediated 
expression of SOX11 by regulating transcription. Knockdown of SOX11 reduced 
epithelial-derived cytokine expression and MUC5AC levels in 
interleukin-13-treated human nasal mucosa epithelial cells.
CONCLUSION: SOX11 plays a critical role in allergic rhinitis development by 
regulating epithelial-derived cytokines and might be a new therapeutic target 
for allergic rhinitis."
982,"Sepsis is a severe life-threatening and rapidly developing disease that causes 
millions of deaths annually worldwide. Researchers have made tremendous efforts 
to elucidate the pathophysiology of sepsis using various animal models; the 
mouse model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) is widely 
used in laboratories. The three technical aspects that affect the severity and 
replicability of the CLP model are the percentage of cecum ligated, the size of 
the needle used for cecal puncture, and the volume of feces squeezed into the 
abdominal cavity. The rapid and specific diagnosis of sepsis is a crucial factor 
that affects the outcome. The gold standard for sepsis diagnosis is microbial 
culture; however, this process is time-consuming and sometimes inaccurate. The 
detection of sepsis-specific biomarkers is fast, but the existing biomarkers are 
unsatisfactory due to a short half-life, non-specificity, and insufficient 
sensitivity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a reliable biomarker of 
sepsis in the early stages. Previous publications suggest that excessive 
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) occur in sepsis. Citrullinated histone H3 
(CitH3), as a NET component, is elevated both in septic animals and patients, 
and the presence of CitH3 is a reliable diagnostic biomarker of sepsis. The 
present study aimed to describe a standardized mouse model of CLP-induced sepsis 
and establish a reliable blood biomarker of sepsis. Our work may contribute to 
the early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis in the future."
983,"Aging is a complex process characterized by progressive physiological changes 
resulting from both environmental and genetic contributions. Lipids are crucial 
in constituting structural components of cell membranes, storing energy, and as 
signaling molecules. Regulation of lipid metabolism and signaling is essential 
to activate distinct longevity pathways. The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is 
an excellent and powerful organism to dissect the contribution of lipid 
metabolism and signaling in longevity regulation. Multiple research studies have 
described how diet supplementation of specific lipid molecules can extend C. 
elegans lifespan; however, minor differences in the supplementation conditions 
can cause reproducibility issues among scientists in different labs. Here, two 
detailed supplementation methods for C. elegans are reported employing lipid 
supplementation either with bacteria seeded on plates or bacterial suspension in 
liquid culture. Also provided herein are the details to perform lifespan assays 
with lifelong lipid supplementation and qRT-PCR analysis using a whole worm 
lysate or dissected tissues derived from a few worms. Using a combination of 
longitudinal studies and transcriptional investigations upon lipid 
supplementation, the feeding assays provide dependable approaches to dissect how 
lipids influence longevity and healthy aging. This methodology can also be 
adapted for various nutritional screening approaches to assess changes in a 
subset of transcripts using either a small number of dissected tissues or a few 
animals."
984,"As a principal ingredient of vaccines, adjuvants can directly induce or enhance 
the powerful, widespread, innate, and adaptive immune responses associated with 
antigens. Ophiopogonin D (OP-D), a purified component extracted from the plant 
Ophiopogon japonicus, has been found to be useful as a vaccine adjuvant. The 
problems of the low solubility and toxicity of OP-D can be effectively overcome 
by using a low-energy emulsification method to prepare nanoemulsion ophiopogonin 
D (NOD). In this article, a series of in vitro protocols for cellular activity 
evaluation are examined. The cytotoxic effects of L929 were determined using a 
cell counting kit-8 assay. Then, the secreted cytokine levels and corresponding 
immune cell numbers after the stimulation and culture of splenocytes from 
immunized mice were detected by ELISA and ELISpot methods. In addition, the 
antigen uptake ability in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), which 
were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and matured after incubation with GM-CSF plus 
IL-4, was observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (CLSM). Importantly, 
macrophage activation was confirmed by measuring the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) cytokines by ELISA kits after coculturing 
peritoneal macrophages (PMs) from blank mice with the adjuvant for 24 h. It is 
hoped that this protocol will provide other researchers with direct and 
effective experimental approaches to evaluate the cellular response efficacies 
of novel vaccine adjuvants."
985,"Increased urbanization has decreased children's access to various natural 
outdoor environments. To counteract this deficiency in early life experiences, 
we designed four temporary waterslides, each tailored to different city-side 
park conditions. The waterslides were simple to construct, with frames built 
from easy-to-attain resources such as bamboo rods from a local forest and simple 
pipes and joints overlaid by a tarp. Plywood boards, cardboard, and a tarp were 
used to create a pool at the foot of the slides, which were placed on existing 
slopes or stairs in each park. Water was continually released down the slide 
during each 1-2 h event. At each park event, children gathered spontaneously to 
use the slides and interact socially. No serious accidents occurred during the 
waterslide trials. To understand how the children used each waterslide, the 
activity at the waterslides was recorded by video. The minute of the highest 
activity level at the waterslide was quantitatively analyzed to determine the 
lines of flow surrounding the waterslide and the mean and maximum speeds 
attained while using the waterslide."
986,"The role of RNA structure in virtually any biological process has become 
increasingly evident, especially in the past decade. However, classical 
approaches to solving RNA structure, such as RNA crystallography or cryo-EM, 
have failed to keep up with the rapidly evolving field and the need for 
high-throughput solutions. Mutational profiling with sequencing using dimethyl 
sulfate (DMS) MaPseq is a sequencing-based approach to infer the RNA structure 
from a base's reactivity with DMS. DMS methylates the N1 nitrogen in adenosines 
and the N3 in cytosines at their Watson-Crick face when the base is unpaired. 
Reverse-transcribing the modified RNA with the thermostable group II intron 
reverse transcriptase (TGIRT-III) leads to the methylated bases being 
incorporated as mutations into the cDNA. When sequencing the resulting cDNA and 
mapping it back to a reference transcript, the relative mutation rates for each 
base are indicative of the base's ""status"" as paired or unpaired. Even though 
DMS reactivities have a high signal-to-noise ratio both in vitro and in cells, 
this method is sensitive to bias in the handling procedures. To reduce this 
bias, this paper provides a protocol for RNA treatment with DMS in cells and 
with in vitro transcribed RNA."
987,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare condition that results from the 
dissemination of a mucinous primary tumor and the resultant accumulation of 
mucin-secreting tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity. PMP can arise from various 
types of cancers, including appendiceal, ovarian, and colorectal, though 
appendiceal neoplasms are by far the most common etiology. PMP is challenging to 
study due to its (1) rarity, (2) limited murine models, and (3) mucinous, 
acellular histology. The method presented here allows real-time visualization 
and interrogation of these tumor types using patient-derived ex vivo organotypic 
slices in a preparation where the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains intact. 
In this protocol, we first describe the preparation of tumor slices using a 
vibratome and subsequent long-term culture. Second, we describe confocal imaging 
of tumor slices and how to monitor functional readouts of viability, calcium 
imaging, and local proliferation. In short, slices are loaded with imaging dyes 
and are placed in an imaging chamber that can be mounted onto a confocal 
microscope. Time-lapse videos and confocal images are used to assess the initial 
viability and cellular functionality. This procedure also explores translational 
cellular movement, and paracrine signaling interactions in the TME. Lastly, we 
describe a dissociation protocol for tumor slices to be used for flow cytometry 
analysis. Quantitative flow cytometry analysis can be used for bench-to-bedside 
therapeutic testing to determine changes occurring within the immune landscape 
and epithelial cell content."
988,"Potassium chloride cotransporters 2 (KCC2) is a member of the solute carrier 
family 12 (SLC12) of cation-chloride-cotransporters (CCCs), found exclusively in 
the neuron and is essential for the proper functioning of Cl- homeostasis and 
consequently functional GABAergic inhibition. Failure in proper regulation of 
KCC2 is deleterious and has been associated with the prevalence of several 
neurological diseases, including epilepsy. There has been considerable progress 
with regard to understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of KCC2, 
accredited to the development of techniques that enable researchers to study its 
functions and activities; either via direct (assessing kinase regulatory sites 
phosphorylation) or indirect (observing and monitoring GABA activity) 
investigations. Here, the protocol highlights how to investigate KCC2 
phosphorylation at kinase regulatory sites - Thr906 and Thr1007- using western 
blotting technique. There are other classic methods used to directly measure 
KCC2 activity, such as rubidium ion and thallium ion uptake assay. Further 
techniques such as patch-clamp-electrophysiology are used to measure GABA 
activity; hence, indirectly reflecting activated and/or inactivated KCC2 as 
informed by the assessment of intracellular chloride ion homeostasis. A few of 
these additional techniques will be briefly discussed in this manuscript."
989,"One of the challenges in retina research is studying the cross-talk between 
different retinal cells such as retinal neurons, glial cells, and vascular 
cells. Isolating, culturing, and sustaining retinal neurons in vitro have 
technical and biological limitations. Culturing retinal explants may overcome 
these limitations and offer a unique ex vivo model to study the cross-talk 
between various retinal cells with well-controlled biochemical parameters and 
independent of the vascular system. Moreover, retinal explants are an effective 
screening tool for studying novel pharmacological interventions in various 
retinal vascular and neurodegenerative diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. 
Here, we describe a detailed protocol for retinal explants' isolation and 
culture for an extended period. The manuscript also presents some of the 
technical problems during this procedure that may affect the desired outcomes 
and reproducibility of the retinal explant culture. The immunostaining of the 
retinal vessels, glial cells, and neurons demonstrated intact retinal 
capillaries and neuroglial cells after 2 weeks from the beginning of the retinal 
explant culture. This establishes retinal explants as a reliable tool for 
studying changes in the retinal vasculature and neuroglial cells under 
conditions that mimic retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy."
990,"There are still a limited number of primary interventions for prevention of 
breast cancer. For women at a high risk of developing breast cancer, the most 
effective intervention is prophylactic mastectomy. This is a drastic surgical 
procedure in which the mammary epithelial cells that can give rise to breast 
cancer are completely removed along with the surrounding tissue. The goal of 
this protocol is to demonstrate the feasibility of a minimally invasive 
intraductal procedure that could become a new primary intervention for breast 
cancer prevention. This local procedure would preferentially ablate mammary 
epithelial cells before they can become malignant. Intraductal methods to 
deliver solutions directly to these epithelial cells in rodent models of breast 
cancer have been developed at Michigan State University and elsewhere. The rat 
mammary gland consists of a single ductal tree that has a simpler and more 
linear architecture compared to the human breast. However, chemically induced 
rat models of breast cancer offer valuable tools for proof-of-concept studies of 
new preventive interventions and scalability from mouse models to humans. Here, 
a procedure for intraductal delivery of an ethanol-based ablative solution 
containing tantalum oxide nanoparticles as X-ray contrast agent and ethyl 
cellulose as gelling agent into the rat mammary ductal tree is described. 
Delivery of aqueous reagents (e.g., cytotoxic compounds, siRNAs, AdCre) by 
intraductal injection has been described previously in mouse and rat models. 
This protocol description emphasizes methodological changes and steps that 
pertain uniquely to delivering an ablative solution, formulation consideration 
to minimize local and systemic side effects of the ablative solution, and X-ray 
imaging for in vivo assessment of ductal tree filling. Fluoroscopy and micro-CT 
techniques enable to determine the success of ablative solution delivery and the 
extent of ductal tree filling thanks to compatibility with the 
tantalum-containing contrast agent."
991,"The emergence of granular hydrogel scaffolds (GHS), fabricated via assembling 
hydrogel microparticles (HMPs), has enabled microporous scaffold formation in 
situ. Unlike conventional bulk hydrogels, interconnected microscale pores in GHS 
facilitate degradation-independent cell infiltration as well as oxygen, 
nutrient, and cellular byproduct transfer. Methacryloyl-modified gelatin 
(GelMA), a (photo)chemically crosslinkable, protein-based biopolymer containing 
cell adhesive and biodegradable moieties, has widely been used as a 
cell-responsive/instructive biomaterial. Converting bulk GelMA to GHS may open a 
plethora of opportunities for tissue engineering and regeneration. In this 
article, we demonstrate the procedures of high-throughput GelMA microgel 
fabrication, conversion to resuspendable dry microgels (micro-aerogels), GHS 
formation via the chemical assembly of microgels, and granular bioink 
fabrication for extrusion bioprinting. We show how a sequential physicochemical 
treatment via cooling and photocrosslinking enables the formation of 
mechanically robust GHS. When light is inaccessible (e.g., during deep tissue 
injection), individually crosslinked GelMA HMPs may be bioorthogonally assembled 
via enzymatic crosslinking using transglutaminases. Finally, three-dimensional 
(3D) bioprinting of microporous GHS at low HMP packing density is demonstrated 
via the interfacial self-assembly of heterogeneously charged nanoparticles."
992,"The liver is a complex and heterogenous tissue responsible for carrying out many 
critical physiological functions, such as the maintenance of energy homeostasis 
and the metabolism of xenobiotics, among others. These tasks are performed 
through tight coordination between hepatic parenchymal and non-parenchymal 
cells. Additionally, various metabolic activities are confined to specific areas 
of the hepatic lobule-a phenomenon called liver zonation. Recent advances in 
single-cell sequencing technologies have empowered researchers to investigate 
tissue heterogeneity at a single-cell resolution. In many complex tissues, 
including the liver, harsh enzymatic and/or mechanical dissociation protocols 
can negatively affect the viability or the quality of the single-cell 
suspensions needed to comprehensively characterize this organ in health and 
disease. This paper describes a robust and reproducible protocol for isolating 
nuclei from frozen, archived liver tissues. This method yields high-quality 
nuclei that are compatible with downstream, single-cell omics approaches, 
including single-nucleus RNA-seq, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin 
with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), as well as multimodal omics (joint 
RNA-seq and ATAC-seq). This method has been successfully used for the isolation 
of nuclei from healthy and diseased human, mouse, and non-human primate frozen 
liver samples. This approach allows the unbiased isolation of all the major cell 
types in the liver and, therefore, offers a robust methodology for studying the 
liver at the single-cell resolution."
993,"Single-cell proteomics analysis requires sensitive, quantitatively accurate, 
widely accessible, and robust methods. To meet these requirements, the 
Single-Cell ProtEomics (SCoPE2) protocol was developed as a second-generation 
method for quantifying hundreds to thousands of proteins from limited samples, 
down to the level of a single cell. Experiments using this method have achieved 
quantifying over 3,000 proteins across 1,500 single mammalian cells (500-1,000 
proteins per cell) in 10 days of mass spectrometer instrument time. SCoPE2 
leverages a freeze-heat cycle for cell lysis, obviating the need for clean-up of 
single cells and consequently reducing sample losses, while expediting sample 
preparation and simplifying its automation. Additionally, the method uses an 
isobaric carrier, which aids protein identification and reduces sample losses. 
This video protocol provides detailed guidance to enable the adoption of 
automated single-cell protein analysis using only equipment and reagents that 
are widely accessible. We demonstrate critical steps in the procedure of 
preparing single cells for proteomic analysis, from harvesting up to injection 
to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. 
Additionally, viewers are guided through the principles of experimental design 
with the isobaric carrier, quality control for both isobaric carrier and 
single-cell preparations, and representative results with a discussion of 
limitations of the approach."
994,"Pluripotent stem cells can generate complex tissue organoids that are useful for 
in vitro disease modeling studies and for developing regenerative therapies. 
This protocol describes a simpler, robust, and stepwise method of generating 
retinal organoids in a hybrid culture system consisting of adherent monolayer 
cultures during the first 4 weeks of retinal differentiation till the emergence 
of distinct, self-organized eye field primordial clusters (EFPs). Further, the 
doughnut-shaped, circular, and translucent neuro-retinal islands within each EFP 
are manually picked and cultured under suspension using non-adherent culture 
dishes in a retinal differentiation medium for 1-2 weeks to generate 
multilayered 3D optic cups (OC-1M). These immature retinal organoids contain 
PAX6+ and ChX10+ proliferating, multipotent retinal precursors. The precursor 
cells are linearly self-assembled within the organoids and appear as distinct 
radial striations. At 4 weeks after suspension culture, the retinal progenitors 
undergo post-mitotic arrest and lineage differentiation to form mature retinal 
organoids (OC-2M). The photoreceptor lineage committed precursors develop within 
the outermost layers of retinal organoids. These CRX+ and RCVRN+ photoreceptor 
cells morphologically mature to display inner segment-like extensions. This 
method can be adopted for generating retinal organoids using human embryonic 
stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). All steps and 
procedures are clearly explained and demonstrated to ensure replicability and 
for wider applications in basic science and translational research."
995,"Neurodegenerative disorders are common and heterogeneous in terms of their 
symptoms and cellular affectation, making their study complicated due to the 
lack of proper animal models that fully mimic human diseases and the poor 
availability of post-mortem human brain tissue. Adult human nervous tissue 
culture offers the possibility to study different aspects of neurological 
disorders. Molecular, cellular, and biochemical mechanisms could be easily 
addressed in this system, as well as testing and validating drugs or different 
treatments, such as cell-based therapies. This method combines long-term 
organotypic cultures of the adult human cortex, obtained from epileptic patients 
undergoing resective surgery, and ex vivo intracortical transplantation of 
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical progenitors. This method will 
allow the study of cell survival, neuronal differentiation, the formation of 
synaptic inputs and outputs, and the electrophysiological properties of 
human-derived cells after transplantation into intact adult human cortical 
tissue. This approach is an important step prior to the development of a 3D 
human disease modeling platform that will bring basic research closer to the 
clinical translation of stem cell-based therapies for patients with different 
neurological disorders and allow the development of new tools for reconstructing 
damaged neural circuits."
996,"Bones have a significant regenerative capacity. However, fracture healing is a 
complex process, and depending on the severity of the lesions and the age and 
overall health status of the patient, failures can occur, leading to delayed 
union or nonunion. Due to the increasing number of fractures resulting from 
high-energy trauma and aging, the development of innovative therapeutic 
strategies to improve bone repair based on the combination of 
skeletal/mesenchymal stem/stromal cells and biomimetic biomaterials is urgently 
needed. To this end, the use of reliable animal models is fundamental to better 
understanding the key cellular and molecular mechanisms that determine the 
healing outcomes. Of all the models, the mouse is the preferred research model 
because it offers a wide variety of transgenic strains and reagents for 
experimental analysis. However, the establishment of fractures in mice may be 
technically challenging due to their small size. Therefore, this article aims to 
demonstrate the procedures for the surgical establishment of a diaphyseal femur 
fracture in mice, which is stabilized with an intramedullary wire and resembles 
the most common bone repair process, through cartilaginous callus formation."
997,"Skeletal muscle harbors distinct populations of adult stem cells that contribute 
to the homeostasis and repair of the tissue. Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) 
have the ability to make new muscle, whereas fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) 
contribute to stromal supporting tissues and have the ability to make 
fibroblasts and adipocytes. Both MuSCs and FAPs reside in a state of prolonged 
reversible cell cycle exit, called quiescence. The quiescent state is key to 
their function. Quiescent stem cells are commonly purified from multiple muscle 
tissues pooled together in a single sample. However, recent studies have 
revealed distinct differences in the molecular profiles and quiescence depth of 
MuSCs isolated from different muscles. The present protocol describes the 
isolation and study of MuSCs and FAPs from individual skeletal muscles and 
presents strategies to perform molecular analysis of stem cell activation. It 
details how to isolate and digest muscles of different developmental origin, 
thicknesses, and functions, such as the diaphragm, triceps, gracilis, tibialis 
anterior (TA), gastrocnemius (GA), soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and 
the masseter muscles. MuSCs and FAPs are purified by fluorescence-activated cell 
sorting (FACS) and analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and 
5-ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay."
998,"BACKGROUND: Methylene blue (MB) is used endoscopically to demarcate tumors and 
as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, there are few in 
vivo studies about its toxicity in healthy stomach tissue. We performed 
sequential in vitro and in vivo analyses of MB-induced phototoxicity.
METHODS: We performed in vitro experiments using the AGS human gastric cancer 
cell line treated with light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation (3.6 J/cm2) and 
MB. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP 
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. In vivo toxicity was evaluated in the stomach 
of beagles using the same dose of fiber-optic LED via gastroscopy, after 
spraying 0.1% and 0.5% MB solutions. Stomach tissue was also evaluated using the 
TUNEL assay.
RESULTS: In vitro, increased concentrations of MB led to higher TUNEL scores. 
However, cell viability was significantly lower after MB plus LED irradiation 
than after treatment with MB alone (P < 0.001). In vivo, the TUNEL score was 
highest immediately after treatment with 0.1% or 0.5% MB plus light irradiation, 
and the score was significantly higher in the LED illumination plus MB group 
than in the control group (P < 0.05). The elevated TUNEL score was maintained 
for 3 days in the MB plus light irradiation group but returned to normal levels 
on day 10.
CONCLUSIONS: : Endoscopic light application with MB 0.5% concentration to the 
stomach may be regarded as a safe procedure despite some DNA injuries in the 
early period."
999,"Molecular hydrogen (H2) is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent; however, 
the molecular mechanisms underlying its biological effects are largely unknown. 
Similar to other gaseous molecules such as inhalation anesthetics, H2 is more 
soluble in lipids than in water. A recent study demonstrated that H2 reduces 
radical polymerization-induced cellular damage by suppressing fatty acid 
peroxidation and membrane permeability. Thus, we sought to examine the effects 
of short exposure to H2 on lipid composition and associated physiological 
changes in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We analyzed cells by liquid 
chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry to define changes in lipid 
components. Lipid class analysis of cells exposed to H2 for 1 hour revealed 
transient increases in glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylethanolamine, 
phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin. Metabolomic analysis also showed that H2 
exposure for 1 hour transiently suppressed overall energy metabolism accompanied 
by a decrease in glutathione. We further observed alterations to endosomal 
morphology by staining with specific antibodies. Endosomal transport of cholera 
toxin B to recycling endosomes localized around the Golgi body was delayed in 
H2-exposed cells. We speculate that H2-induced modification of lipid composition 
depresses energy production and endosomal transport concomitant with enhancement 
of oxidative stress, which transiently stimulates stress response pathways to 
protect cells."
1000,"Intestinal bacteria can be classified into ""beneficial bacteria"" and ""harmful 
bacteria."" However, it is difficult to explain the mechanisms that make 
""beneficial bacteria"" truly beneficial to human health. This issue can be 
addressed by focusing on hydrogen-producing bacteria in the intestines. Although 
it is widely known that molecular hydrogen can react with hydroxyl radicals, 
generated in the mitochondria, to protect cells from oxidative stress, the 
beneficial effects of hydrogen are not fully pervasive because it is not 
generally thought to be metabolized in vivo. In recent years, it has become 
clear that there is a close relationship between the amount of hydrogen produced 
by intestinal bacteria and various diseases, and this report discusses this 
relationship."
1001,"Activating V600E in v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) is a 
common driver mutation in cancers of multiple tissue origins, including melanoma 
and glioma. BRAFV600E has also been implicated in neurodegeneration. The present 
study aims to characterize BRAFV600E during cell death and proliferation of 
three major cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, and 
microglia. Multiple primary cultures (primary cortical mixed culture) and cell 
lines of glial cells (BV2) and neurons (SH-SY5Y) were employed. BRAFV600E and 
BRAFWT expression was mediated by lentivirus or retrovirus. Blockage of 
downstream effectors (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and JNK1/2) were 
achieved by siRNA. In astrocytes and microglia, BRAFV600E induces cell 
proliferation, and the proliferative effect in microglia is mediated by 
activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, but not c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase. Conditioned medium from BRAFV600E-expressing microglia induced neuronal 
death. In neuronal cells, BRAFV600E directly induces neuronal death, through 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase. We 
further show that BRAF-related genes are enriched in pathways in patients with 
Parkinson's disease. Our study identifies distinct consequences mediated by 
distinct downstream effectors in dividing glial cells and in neurons following 
the same BRAF mutational activation and a causal link between BRAF-activated 
microglia and neuronal cell death that does not require physical proximity. It 
provides insight into a possibly important role of BRAF in neurodegeneration as 
a result of either dysregulated BRAF in neurons or its impact on glial cells."
1002,"The retinal ganglion cells of the optic nerve have a limited capacity for 
self-repair after injury. Valproate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor and 
multitarget drug, which has been demonstrated to protect retinal neurons. In 
this study, we established rat models of optic nerve-crush injury and injected 
valproate into the vitreous cavity immediately after modeling. We evaluated 
changes in the ultrastructure morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum of retinal 
ganglion cells over time via transmission electron microscope. 
Immunohistochemistry and western blot assay revealed that valproate upregulated 
the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker glucose-regulated 
protein 78 and downregulated the expression of transcription factor C/EBP 
homologous protein, phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, 
and caspase-12 in the endoplasmic reticulum of retinal ganglion cells. These 
findings suggest that valproate reduces apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells in 
the rat after optic nerve-crush injury by attenuating phosphorylated eukaryotic 
translation initiation factor 2α-C/EBP homologous protein signaling and 
caspase-12 activation during endoplasmic reticulum stress. These findings 
represent a newly discovered mechanism that regulates how valproate protects 
neurons."
1003,"Studies have shown that phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten 
(PTEN) participates in the regulation of cochlear hair cell survival. 
Bisperoxovanadium protects against neurodegeneration by inhibiting PTEN 
expression. However, whether bisperoxovanadium can protect against noise-induced 
hearing loss and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we 
established a mouse model of noise-induced hearing loss by exposure to 105 dB 
sound for 2 hours. We found that PTEN expression was increased in the organ of 
Corti, including outer hair cells, inner hair cells, and lateral wall tissues. 
Intraperitoneal administration of bisperoxovanadium decreased the auditory 
threshold and the loss of cochlear hair cells and inner hair cell ribbons. In 
addition, noise exposure decreased p-PI3K and p-Akt levels. Bisperoxovanadium 
preconditioning or PTEN knockdown upregulated the activity of PI3K-Akt. 
Bisperoxovanadium also prevented H2O2-induced hair cell death by reducing 
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation in cochlear explants. These 
findings suggest that bisperoxovanadium reduces noise-induced hearing injury and 
reduces cochlear hair cell loss."
1004,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a vital role in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 
However, their expression and function in Schwann cells in individuals with 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy remain poorly understood. Here, we performed 
protein profiling and circRNA sequencing of sural nerves in patients with 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy and controls. Protein profiling revealed 265 
differentially expressed proteins in the diabetic peripheral neuropathy group. 
Gene Ontology indicated that differentially expressed proteins were mainly 
enriched in myelination and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. A real-time 
polymerase chain reaction assay performed to validate the circRNA sequencing 
results yielded 11 differentially expressed circRNAs. circ_0002538 was markedly 
downregulated in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Further in vitro 
experiments showed that overexpression of circ_0002538 promoted the migration of 
Schwann cells by upregulating plasmolipin (PLLP) expression. Moreover, 
overexpression of circ_0002538 in the sciatic nerve in a streptozotocin-induced 
mouse model of diabetic peripheral neuropathy alleviated demyelination and 
improved sciatic nerve function. The results of a mechanistic experiment showed 
that circ_0002538 promotes PLLP expression by sponging miR-138-5p, while a lack 
of circ_0002538 led to a PLLP deficiency that further suppressed Schwann cell 
migration. These findings suggest that the circ_0002538/miR-138-5p/PLLP axis can 
promote the migration of Schwann cells in diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
patients, improving myelin sheath structure and nerve function. Thus, this axis 
is a potential target for therapeutic treatment of diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy."
1005,"Neurotrophic factors, particularly nerve growth factor, enhance neuronal 
regeneration. However, the in vivo applications of nerve growth factor are 
largely limited by its intrinsic disadvantages, such as its short biological 
half-life, its contribution to pain response, and its inability to cross the 
blood-brain barrier. Considering that let-7 (human miRNA) targets and regulates 
nerve growth factor, and that let-7 is a core regulator in peripheral nerve 
regeneration, we evaluated the possibilities of let-7 application in nerve 
repair. In this study, anti-let-7a was identified as the most suitable let-7 
family molecule by analyses of endogenous expression and regulatory 
relationship, and functional screening. Let-7a antagomir demonstrated biosafety 
based on the results of in vivo safety assessments and it entered into the main 
cell types of the sciatic nerve, including Schwann cells, fibroblasts and 
macrophages. Use of hydrogel effectively achieved controlled, localized, and 
sustained delivery of let-7a antagomir. Finally, let-7a antagomir was integrated 
into chitosan conduit to construct a chitosan-hydrogel scaffold 
tissue-engineered nerve graft, which promoted nerve regeneration and functional 
recovery in a rat model of sciatic nerve transection. Our study provides an 
experimental basis for potential in vivo application of let-7a."
1006,"Studies have found that the phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 expression can 
be related to stroke, but it remains unclear whether changes in phosphatase 
actin regulatory factor 1 expression also play a role in traumatic brain injury. 
In this study we found that, in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury induced 
by controlled cortical impact, phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 expression 
is increased in endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. When we 
overexpressed phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 by injection an 
adeno-associated virus vector into the contused area in the traumatic brain 
injury mice, the water content of the brain tissue increased. However, when 
phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 was knocked down, the water content 
decreased. We also found that inhibiting phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 
expression regulated the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway, decreased 
blood-brain barrier permeability, reduced aquaporin 4 and intercellular adhesion 
molecule 1 expression, inhibited neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis, 
thereby improving neurological function. The findings from this study indicate 
that phosphatase actin regulatory factor 1 may be a potential therapeutic target 
for traumatic brain injury."
1007,"Retinal ganglion cell apoptotic death is the main pathological characteristic of 
glaucoma, which is the leading cause of irreversible blindness. Disruption of 
Ca2+ homeostasis plays an important role in glaucoma. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channel 
blockers have been shown to improve vision in patients with glaucoma. However, 
whether and how voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are involved in retinal ganglion 
cell apoptotic death are largely unknown. In this study, we found that total 
Ca2+ current densities in retinal ganglion cells were reduced in a rat model of 
chronic ocular hypertension experimental glaucoma, as determined by whole-cell 
patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings. Further analysis showed that L-type 
Ca2+ currents were downregulated while T-type Ca2+ currents were upregulated at 
the later stage of glaucoma. Western blot assay and immunofluorescence 
experiments confirmed that expression of the CaV1.2 subunit of L-type Ca2+ 
channels was reduced and expression of the CaV3.3 subunit of T-type Ca2+ 
channels was increased in retinas of the chronic ocular hypertension model. 
Soluble tumor necrosis factor-α, an important inflammatory factor, inhibited the 
L-type Ca2+ current of isolated retinal ganglion cells from control rats and 
enhanced the T-type Ca2+ current. These changes were blocked by the tumor 
necrosis factor-α inhibitor XPro1595, indicating that both types of Ca2+ 
currents may be mediated by soluble tumor necrosis factor-α. The intracellular 
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway 
and nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway mediate the effects of tumor 
necrosis factor-α. TUNEL assays revealed that mibefradil, a T-type calcium 
channel blocker, reduced the number of apoptotic retinal ganglion cells in the 
rat model of chronic ocular hypertension. These results suggest that T-type Ca2+ 
channels are involved in disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis and apoptosis of retinal 
ganglion cells in glaucoma, and application of T-type Ca2+ channel blockers, 
especially a specific CaV3.3 blocker, may be a potential strategy for the 
treatment of glaucoma."
1008,"The neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells offers a new strategy for 
the treatment of neurological disorders. Thus, there is a need to identify a 
noninvasive and sensitive in vivo imaging approach for real-time monitoring of 
transplanted stem cells. Our previous study confirmed that magnetic resonance 
imaging, with a focus on the ferritin heavy chain 1 reporter gene, could track 
the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells that 
had been transduced with lentivirus carrying the ferritin heavy chain 1 reporter 
gene. However, we could not determine whether or when bone marrow mesenchymal 
stem cells had undergone neuronal differentiation based on changes in the 
magnetic resonance imaging signal. To solve this problem, we identified a 
neuron-specific enolase that can be differentially expressed before and after 
neuronal differentiation in stem cells. In this study, we successfully 
constructed a lentivirus carrying the neuron-specific enolase promoter and 
expressing the ferritin heavy chain 1 reporter gene; we used this lentivirus to 
transduce bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Cellular and animal studies showed 
that the neuron-specific enolase promoter effectively drove the expression of 
ferritin heavy chain 1 after neuronal differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal 
stem cells; this led to intracellular accumulation of iron and corresponding 
changes in the magnetic resonance imaging signal. In summary, we established an 
innovative magnetic resonance imaging approach focused on the induction of 
reporter gene expression by a neuron-specific promoter. This imaging method can 
be used to noninvasively and sensitively detect neuronal differentiation in stem 
cells, which may be useful in stem cell-based therapies."
1009,"Treatment with metformin can lead to the recovery of pleiotropic biological 
activities after spinal cord injury. However, its effect on spinal cord injury 
in aged mice remains unclear. Considering the essential role of angiogenesis 
during the regeneration process, we hypothesized that metformin activates the 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/endothelial nitric oxide 
synthase pathway in endothelial cells, thereby promoting microvascular 
regeneration in aged mice after spinal cord injury. In this study, we 
established young and aged mouse models of contusive spinal cord injury using a 
modified Allen method. We found that aging hindered the recovery of neurological 
function and the formation of blood vessels in the spinal cord. Treatment with 
metformin promoted spinal cord microvascular endothelial cell migration and 
blood vessel formation in vitro. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of 
metformin in an in vivo model promoted endothelial cell proliferation and 
increased the density of new blood vessels in the spinal cord, thereby improving 
neurological function. The role of metformin was reversed by compound C, an 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase inhibitor, both in vivo and in 
vitro, suggesting that the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein 
kinase/endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway likely regulates 
metformin-mediated angiogenesis after spinal cord injury. These findings suggest 
that metformin promotes vascular regeneration in the injured spinal cord by 
activating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/endothelial 
nitric oxide synthase pathway, thereby improving the neurological function of 
aged mice after spinal cord injury."
1010,"Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death which is considered an oxidative 
iron-dependent process. The lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 
prevents the iron (Fe2+)-dependent formation of toxic lipid reactive oxygen 
species. While emerging evidence indicates that inhibition of glutathione 
peroxidase 4 as a hallmark of ferroptosis in many cancer cell lines, the 
involvement of this biochemical pathway in neuronal death remains largely 
unclear. Here, we investigate, first whether the ferroptosis key players are 
involved in the neuronal cell death induced by erastin. The second objective was 
to examine whether there is a cross talk between ferroptosis and autophagy. The 
third main was to address neuron response to erastin, with a special focus on 
ferritin and nuclear receptor coactivator 4-mediated ferritinophagy. To test 
this in neurons, erastin (0.5-8 µM) was applied to hippocampal HT22 neurons for 
16 hours. In addition, cells were cultured with the autophagy inhibitor, 
3-methyladenin (10 mM) and/or ferroptosis inhibitors, ferrostatin 1 (10-20 µM) 
or deferoxamine (10-200 µM) before exposure to erastin. In this study, we 
demonstrated by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis, that erastin 
downregulates dramatically the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4, the 
sodium-independent cystine-glutamate antiporter and nuclear receptor coactivator 
4. The protein levels of ferritin and mitochondrial ferritin in HT22 hippocampal 
neurons did not remarkably change following erastin treatment. In addition, we 
demonstrated that not only the ferroptosis inhibitor, ferrostatin1/deferoxamine 
abrogated the ferroptotic cell death induced by erastin in hippocampal HT22 
neurons, but also the potent autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenin. We conclude 
that (1) erastin-induced ferroptosis in hippocampal HT22 neurons, despite 
reduced nuclear receptor coactivator 4 levels, (2) that either nuclear receptor 
coactivator 4-mediated ferritinophagy does not occur or is of secondary 
importance in this model, (3) that ferroptosis seems to share some features of 
the autophagic cell death process."
1011,"Emodin, a substance extracted from herbs such as rhubarb, has a protective 
effect on the central nervous system. However, the potential therapeutic effect 
of emodin in the context of multiple sclerosis remains unknown. In this study, a 
rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was established by immune 
induction to simulate multiple sclerosis, and the rats were intraperitoneally 
injected with emodin (20 mg/kg/d) from the day of immune induction until they 
were sacrificed. In this model, the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor 
family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the microglia 
exacerbated neuroinflammation, playing an important role in the development of 
multiple sclerosis. In addition, silent information regulator of transcription 1 
(SIRT1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1α) 
was found to inhibit activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and SIRT1 activation 
reduced disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. 
Furthermore, treatment with emodin decreased body weight loss and 
neurobehavioral deficits, alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration and 
demyelination, reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, inhibited 
microglial aggregation and activation, decreased the levels of NLRP3 signaling 
pathway molecules, and increased the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1α. These 
findings suggest that emodin improves the symptoms of experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis, possibly through regulating the SIRT1/PGC-1α/NLRP3 signaling 
pathway and inhibiting microglial inflammation. These findings provide 
experimental evidence for treatment of multiple sclerosis with emodin, enlarging 
the scope of clinical application for emodin."
1012,"Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G is down-regulated in the spinal cord of 
the Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur (TG) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model. However, 
most studies have only examined heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G 
expression in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model and heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G effects in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis such 
as in apoptosis are unknown. In this study, we studied the potential mechanism 
of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G in neuronal death in the spinal cord 
of TG and wild-type mice and examined the mechanism by which heterogenous 
nuclear ribonucleoprotein G induces apoptosis. Heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G in spinal cord was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and 
western blotting, and cell proliferation and proteins (TAR DNA binding protein 
43, superoxide dismutase 1, and Bax) were detected by the Cell Counting Kit-8 
and western blot analysis in heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G 
siRNA-transfected PC12 cells. We analyzed heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
G distribution in spinal cord in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model at 
various time points and the expressions of apoptosis and proliferation-related 
proteins. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G was mainly localized in 
neurons. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice were examined at three stages: 
preonset (60-70 days), onset (90-100 days) and progression (120-130 days). The 
number of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G-positive cells was 
significantly higher in the anterior horn of the lumbar spinal cord segment of 
TG mice at the preonset stage than that of control group but lower than that of 
the control group at the onset stage. The number of heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G-positive cells in both central canal and surrounding gray 
matter of the whole spinal cord of TG mice at the onset stage was significantly 
lower than that in the control group, whereas that of the lumbar spinal cord 
segment of TG mice was significantly higher than that in the control group at 
preonset stage and significantly lower than that in the control group at the 
progression stage. The numbers of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
G-positive cells in the posterior horn of cervical and thoracic segments of TG 
mice at preonset and progression stages were significantly lower than those in 
the control group. The expression of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G in 
the cervical spinal cord segment of TG mice was significantly higher than that 
in the control group at the preonset stage but significantly lower at the 
progression stage. The expression of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G in 
the thoracic spinal cord segment of TG mice was significantly increased at the 
preonset stage, significantly decreased at the onset stage, and significantly 
increased at the progression stage compared with the control group. heterogenous 
nuclear ribonucleoprotein G expression in the lumbar spinal cord segment of TG 
mice was significantly lower than that of the control group at the progression 
stage. After heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G gene silencing, PC12 cell 
survival was lower than that of control cells. Both TAR DNA binding protein 43 
and Bax expressions were significantly increased in heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G-silenced cells compared with control cells. Our study 
suggests that abnormal distribution and expression of heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G might play a protective effect in amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis development via preventing neuronal death by reducing abnormal TAR DNA 
binding protein 43 generation in the spinal cord."
1013,"The adult cortex has long been regarded as non-neurogenic. Whether injury can 
induce neurogenesis in the adult cortex is still controversial. Here, we report 
that focal ischemia stimulates a transient wave of local neurogenesis. Using 
5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling, we demonstrated a rapid generation of 
doublecortin-positive neuroblasts that died quickly in mouse cerebral cortex 
following ischemia. Nestin-CreER-based cell ablation and fate mapping showed a 
small contribution of neuroblasts by subventricular zone neural stem cells. 
Using a mini-photothrombotic ischemia mouse model and retrovirus expressing 
green fluorescent protein labeling, we observed maturation of locally generated 
new neurons. Furthermore, fate tracing analyses using PDGFRα-, GFAP-, and 
Sox2-CreER mice showed a transient wave of neuroblast generation in mild 
ischemic cortex and identified that Sox2-positive astrocytes were the major 
neurogenic cells in adult cortex. In addition, a similar upregulation of Sox2 
and appearance of neuroblasts were observed in the focal ischemic cortex of 
Macaca mulatta. Our findings demonstrated a transient neurogenic response of 
Sox2-positive astrocytes in ischemic cortex, which suggests the possibility of 
inducing neuronal regeneration by amplifying this intrinsic response in the 
future."
1014,"CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 can inhibit ferroptosis, which has been associated 
with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, in individuals with head and neck cancer. 
Therefore, CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 may be implicated in cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury. To validate this hypothesis in the present study, 
we established mouse models of occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and HT22 
cell models of oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation to mimic cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo and in vitro, respectively. We found 
remarkably decreased CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 expression in the mouse brain 
tissue and HT22 cells. When we used adeno-associated virus and plasmid to 
up-regulate CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 expression in the brain tissue and HT22 
cell models separately, mouse neurological dysfunction was greatly improved; the 
cerebral infarct volume was reduced; the survival rate of HT22 cells was 
increased; HT22 cell injury was alleviated; the expression of 
ferroptosis-related glutathione peroxidase 4, cystine-glutamate antiporter, and 
glutathione was increased; the levels of malondialdehyde, iron ions, and the 
expression of transferrin receptor 1 were decreased; and the expression of 
nuclear-factor E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 was increased. Inhibition of 
CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 upregulation via the nuclear-factor E2-related factor 
2 inhibitor ML385 in oxygen-glucose deprived and reoxygenated HT22 cells blocked 
the neuroprotective effects of CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 up-regulation and the 
activation of the nuclear-factor E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 pathway. 
Our data indicate that the up-regulation of CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 can 
attenuate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, thus providing theoretical 
support from the perspectives of cytology and experimental zoology for the use 
of this protein as a therapeutic target in patients with cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury."
1015,"Post-traumatic spinal cord remodeling includes both degenerating and 
regenerating processes, which affect the potency of the functional recovery 
after spinal cord injury (SCI). Gene therapy for spinal cord injury is proposed 
as a promising therapeutic strategy to induce positive changes in remodeling of 
the affected neural tissue. In our previous studies for delivering the 
therapeutic genes at the site of spinal cord injury, we developed a new approach 
using an autologous leucoconcentrate transduced ex vivo with chimeric 
adenoviruses (Ad5/35) carrying recombinant cDNA. In the present study, the 
efficacy of the intravenous infusion of an autologous genetically-enriched 
leucoconcentrate simultaneously producing recombinant vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and 
neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was evaluated with regard to the molecular 
and cellular changes in remodeling of the spinal cord tissue at the site of 
damage in a model of mini-pigs with moderate spinal cord injury. Experimental 
animals were randomly divided into two groups of 4 pigs each: the therapeutic 
(infused with the leucoconcentrate simultaneously transduced with a combination 
of the three chimeric adenoviral vectors Ad5/35-VEGF165, Ad5/35-GDNF, and 
Ad5/35-NCAM1) and control groups (infused with intact leucoconcentrate). The 
morphometric and immunofluorescence analysis of the spinal cord regeneration in 
the rostral and caudal segments according to the epicenter of the injury in the 
treated animals compared to the control mini-pigs showed: (1) higher sparing of 
the grey matter and increased survivability of the spinal cord cells (lower 
number of Caspase-3-positive cells and decreased expression of Hsp27); (2) 
recovery of synaptophysin expression; (3) prevention of astrogliosis (lower area 
of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes and ionized calcium 
binding adaptor molecule 1-positive microglial cells); (4) higher growth rates 
of regenerating βIII-tubulin-positive axons accompanied by a higher number of 
oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2-positive oligodendroglial cells in the 
lateral corticospinal tract region. These results revealed the efficacy of 
intravenous infusion of the autologous genetically-enriched leucoconcentrate 
producing recombinant VEGF, GDNF, and NCAM in the acute phase of spinal cord 
injury on the positive changes in the post-traumatic remodeling nervous tissue 
at the site of direct injury. Our data provide a solid platform for a new ex 
vivo gene therapy for spinal cord injury and will facilitate further translation 
of regenerative therapies in clinical neurology."
1016,"Alteration of the outer retina leads to various diseases such as age-related 
macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa characterized by decreased visual 
acuity and ultimately blindness. Despite intensive research in the field of 
retinal disorders, there is currently no curative treatment. Several therapeutic 
approaches such as cell-based replacement and gene therapies are currently in 
development. In the context of cell-based therapies, different cell sources such 
as embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, or multipotent stem 
cells can be used for transplantation. In the vast majority of human clinical 
trials, retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptors are the cell types 
considered for replacement cell therapies. In this review, we summarize the 
progress made in stem cell therapies ranging from the pre-clinical studies to 
clinical trials for retinal disease."
1017,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition characterized by damage to 
the spinal cord resulting in loss of function, mobility, and sensation with no 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved cure. Enolase, a multifunctional 
glycolytic enzyme upregulated after SCI, promotes pro- and anti-inflammatory 
events and regulates functional recovery in SCI. Enolase is normally expressed 
in the cytosol, but the expression is upregulated at the cell surface following 
cellular injury, promoting glial cell activation and signal transduction pathway 
activation. SCI-induced microglia activation triggers pro-inflammatory mediators 
at the injury site, activating other immune cells and metabolic events, i.e., 
Rho-associated kinase, contributing to the neuroinflammation found in SCI. 
Enolase surface expression also activates cathepsin X, resulting in cleavage of 
the C-terminal end of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and non-neuronal enolase 
(NNE). Fully functional enolase is necessary as NSE/NNE C-terminal proteins 
activate many neurotrophic processes, i.e., the plasminogen activation system, 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/protein kinase B, and 
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Studies 
here suggest an enolase inhibitor, ENOblock, attenuates the activation of 
Rho-associated kinase, which may decrease glial cell activation and promote 
functional recovery following SCI. Also, ENOblock inhibits cathepsin X, which 
may help prevent the cleavage of the neurotrophic C-terminal protein allowing 
full plasminogen activation and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 
3-kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. The combined NSE/cathepsin X 
inhibition may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing 
neuroinflammation/degeneration and promoting neural cell regeneration and 
recovery following SCI. The role of cell membrane-expressed enolase and 
associated metabolic events should be investigated to determine if the same 
strategies can be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, this 
review discusses the importance of enolase activation and inhibition as a 
potential therapeutic target following SCI to promote neuronal survival and 
regeneration."
1018,"Parkinson's disease is the most common movement disorder, affecting about 1% of 
the population over the age of 60 years. Parkinson's disease is characterized 
clinically by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability, 
as a result of the progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. In 
addition to this neuronal cell loss, Parkinson's disease is characterized by the 
accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, 
composed primarily of the protein α-synuclein. Although it was first described 
almost 200 years ago, there are no disease-modifying drugs to treat patients 
with Parkinson's disease. In addition to conventional therapies, 
non-pharmacological treatment strategies are under investigation in patients and 
animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. Among such strategies, 
environmental enrichment, comprising physical exercise, cognitive stimulus, and 
social interactions, has been assessed in preclinical models of Parkinson's 
disease. Environmental enrichment can cause structural and functional changes in 
the brain and promote neurogenesis and dendritic growth by modifying gene 
expression, enhancing the expression of neurotrophic factors and modulating 
neurotransmission. In this review article, we focus on the current knowledge 
about the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental enrichment 
neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease, highlighting its influence on the 
dopaminergic, cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic systems, as well as the 
involvement of neurotrophic factors. We describe experimental pre-clinical data 
showing how environmental enrichment can act as a modulator in a neurochemical 
and behavioral context in different animal models of Parkinson's disease, 
highlighting the potential of environmental enrichment as an additional strategy 
in the management and prevention of this complex disease."
1019,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (CMT) constitute a group of common but highly 
heterogeneous, non-syndromic genetic disorders affecting predominantly the 
peripheral nervous system. CMT type 1A (CMT1A) is the most frequent type and 
accounts for almost ~50% of all diagnosed CMT cases. CMT1A results from the 
duplication of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Overexpression of 
PMP22 protein overloads the protein folding apparatus in Schwann cells and 
activates the unfolded protein response. This leads to Schwann cell apoptosis, 
dys- and de- myelination and secondary axonal degeneration, ultimately causing 
neurological disabilities. During the last decades, several different gene 
therapies have been developed to treat CMT1A. Almost all of them remain at the 
pre-clinical stage using CMT1A animal models overexpressing PMP22. The 
therapeutic goal is to achieve gene silencing, directly or indirectly, thereby 
reversing the CMT1A genetic mechanism allowing the recovery of myelination and 
prevention of axonal loss. As promising treatments are rapidly emerging, 
treatment-responsive and clinically relevant biomarkers are becoming necessary. 
These biomarkers and sensitive clinical evaluation tools will facilitate the 
design and successful completion of future clinical trials for CMT1A."
1020,"Epilepsy is synonymous with individuals suffering repeated ""fits"" or seizures. 
The seizures are triggered by bursts of abnormal neuronal activity, across 
either the cerebral cortex and/or the hippocampus. In addition, the seizure 
sites are characterized by considerable neuronal death. Although the factors 
that generate this abnormal activity and death are not entirely clear, recent 
evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role. Current 
treatment options include drug therapy, which aims to suppress the abnormal 
neuronal activity, or surgical intervention, which involves the removal of the 
brain region generating the seizure activity. However, ~30% of patients are 
unresponsive to the drugs, while the surgery option is invasive and has a 
morbidity risk. Hence, there is a need for the development of an effective 
non-pharmacological and non-invasive treatment for this disorder, one that has 
few side effects. In this review, we consider the effectiveness of a potential 
new treatment for epilepsy, known as photobiomodulation, the use of red to 
near-infrared light on body tissues. Recent studies in animal models have shown 
that photobiomodulation reduces seizure-like activity and improves neuronal 
survival. Further, it has an excellent safety record, with little or no evidence 
of side effects, and it is non-invasive. Taken all together, this treatment 
appears to be an ideal treatment option for patients suffering from epilepsy, 
which is certainly worthy of further consideration."
1021,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder caused by the pathological 
hyper-synchronization of neuronal discharges. The fundamental research of 
epilepsy mechanisms and the targets of drug design options for its treatment 
have focused on neurons. However, approximately 30% of patients suffering from 
epilepsy show resistance to standard anti-epileptic chemotherapeutic agents 
while the symptoms of the remaining 70% of patients can be alleviated but not 
completely removed by the current medications. Thus, new strategies for the 
treatment of epilepsy are in urgent demand. Over the past decades, with the 
increase in knowledge on the role of glia in the genesis and development of 
epilepsy, glial cells are receiving renewed attention. In a normal brain, glial 
cells maintain neuronal health and in partnership with neurons regulate 
virtually every aspect of brain function. In epilepsy, however, the supportive 
roles of glial cells are compromised, and their interaction with neurons is 
altered, which disrupts brain function. In this review, we will focus on the 
role of glia-related processes in epileptogenesis and their contribution to 
abnormal neuronal activity, with the major focus on the dysfunction of 
astroglial potassium channels, water channels, gap junctions, glutamate 
transporters, purinergic signaling, synaptogenesis, on the roles of microglial 
inflammatory cytokines, microglia-astrocyte interactions in epilepsy, and on the 
oligodendroglial potassium channels and myelin abnormalities in the epileptic 
brain. These recent findings suggest that glia should be considered as the 
promising next-generation targets for designing anti-epileptic drugs that may 
improve epilepsy and drug-resistant epilepsy."
1022,"As the average age of the world population increases, more people will face 
debilitating aging-associated conditions, including dementia and stroke. Not 
only does the incidence of these conditions increase with age, but the recovery 
afterward is often worse in older patients. Researchers and health professionals 
must unveil and understand the factors behind age-associated diseases to develop 
a therapy for older patients. Aging causes profound changes in the immune system 
including the activation of microglia in the brain. Activated microglia promote 
T lymphocyte transmigration leading to an increase in neuroinflammation, white 
matter damage, and cognitive impairment in both older humans and rodents. The 
presence of T and B lymphocytes is observed in the aged brain and correlates 
with worse stroke outcomes. Preclinical strategies in stroke target either 
microglia or the lymphocytes or the communications between them to promote 
functional recovery in aged subjects. In this review, we examine the role of the 
microglia and T and B lymphocytes in aging and how they contribute to cognitive 
impairment. Additionally, we provide an important update on the contribution of 
these cells and their interactions in preclinical aged stroke."
1023,"Data-independent acquisition (DIA) of tandem mass spectrometry spectra has 
emerged as a promising technology to improve coverage and quantification of 
proteins in complex mixtures. The success of DIA experiments is dependent on the 
quality of spectral libraries used for data base searching. Frequently, these 
libraries need to be generated by labor and time intensive data dependent 
acquisition (DDA) experiments. Recently, several algorithms have been published 
that allow the generation of theoretical libraries by an efficient prediction of 
retention time and intensity of the fragment ions. Sequential windowed 
acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) 
is a DIA method that can be applied at an unprecedented speed, but the 
fragmentation spectra suffer from a lower quality than data acquired on Orbitrap 
instruments. To reliably generate theoretical libraries that can be used in 
SWATH experiments, we developed deep-learning for SWATH analysis (dpSWATH), to 
improve the sensitivity and specificity of data generated by Q-TOF mass 
spectrometers. The theoretical library built by dpSWATH allowed us to increase 
the identification rate of proteins compared to traditional or library-free 
methods. Based on our analysis we conclude that dpSWATH is a superior prediction 
framework for SWATH-MS measurements than other algorithms based on Orbitrap 
data. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1024,"Helminths are large multicellular parasites responsible for widespread chronic 
disease in humans and animals. Intestinal helminths live in close proximity with 
the host gut microbiota and mucosal immune network, resulting in reciprocal 
interactions that closely influence the course of infections. Diet composition 
may strongly regulate gut microbiota composition and intestinal immune function 
and therefore may play a key role in modulating anti-helminth immune responses. 
Characterizing the multitude of interactions that exist between different 
dietary components (e.g. dietary fibers), immune cells, and the microbiota, may 
shed new light on regulation of helminth-specific immunity. This review focuses 
on our current knowledge of how metabolism of dietary components shapes immune 
response during helminth infection, and how we may potentially harness this 
information to design new therapeutics to manage parasitic infections and 
associated diseases. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Drought reduces plant productivity, especially in the 
susceptible species Brassica napus. Water stress, mimicked by applications of 
10% polyethylene glycol (PEG), elevates nitric oxide (NO) in root cells after a 
few hours contributing to the degradation of the root apical meristems (RAMs), 
the function of which relies on auxin and brassinosteroids (BRs). Phytoglobins 
(Pgbs) are effective NO scavengers induced by the stress. This work examines the 
effects of BnPgb1 dysregulation in dehydrating B. napus roots, and the 
spatiotemporal relationship between Pgb1 and activities of auxin and BRs in the 
regulation of the RAM.
METHODS: B. napus lines over-expressing [BnPgb1(S)] or down-regulating 
[BnPgb1(RNAi)] BnPgb1 were exposed to polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced water 
stress. The localization of BnPgb1, NO, auxin and PIN1 were analyzed during the 
first 48h, while the expression level of biosynthetic auxin and BR genes was 
measured during the first 24h. Pharmacological treatments were conducted to 
assess the requirement of auxin and BR in dehydrating roots.
KEY RESULTS: During the stress, BnPgb1 protein accumulated preferentially in the 
peripheral domains of the root elongation zone, exposing the meristem to NO, 
which inhibits polar auxin transport (PAT), likely by interfering with PIN1 
localization and the synthesis of auxin. Diminished auxin at the root tip 
depressed the synthesis of BR and caused the degradation of the RAMs. The 
strength of BnPgb1 signal in the elongation zone was increased in BnPgb1(S) 
roots, where NO was confined to the most apical cells. Consequently, PAT and 
auxin synthesis were retained, and the definition of RAMs was maintained. The 
auxin preservation of the RAM required BRs, although BRs alone was not 
sufficient to fully rescue drought-damaged RAMs in auxin depleted environments.
CONCLUSIONS: The tissue-specific localization of BnPgb1 and NO are determinant 
for B. napus root response to water stress. A model is proposed where auxin and 
BRs act as downstream components of BnPgb1 signalling in the preservation of 
RAMs in dehydrating roots."
1026,"Wound healing is a complex and error-prone process. Wound healing in adults 
often leads to the formation of scars, a type of fibrotic tissue that lacks skin 
appendages. Hypertrophic scars and keloids can also form when the wound-healing 
process goes wrong. Leptin (Lep) and leptin receptors (LepRs) have recently been 
shown to affect multiple stages of wound healing. This effect, however, is 
paradoxical for scarless wound healing. On the one hand, Lep exerts 
pro-inflammatory and profibrotic effects; on the other hand, Lep can regulate 
hair follicle growth. This paper summarises the role of Lep and LepRs on cells 
in different stages of wound healing, briefly introduces the process of wound 
healing and Lep and LepRs, and examines the possibility of promoting scarless 
wound healing through spatiotemporal, systemic, and local regulation of Lep 
levels and the binding of Lep and LepRs."
1027,"Our previous study demonstrated altered glucose metabolism and enhanced 
phosphorylation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in keloid fibroblasts (KFb) under 
hypoxic conditions. However, whether the PI3K/AKT pathway influences KFb cell 
function by regulating glucose metabolism under hypoxic conditions remains 
unclear. Here, we show that when PI3K/AKT pathway was inactivated with LY294002, 
the protein expression of glycolytic enzymes decreased, while the amount of 
mitochondria and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) increased. The key 
parameters of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) markedly diminished, and 
those of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) significantly increased after inhibition 
of the PI3K/AKT pathway. When the PI3K/AKT pathway was suppressed, the levels of 
ROS and mitochondrial ROS were significantly increased. Meanwhile, cell 
proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited, and apoptosis was 
increased when the PI3K/AKT pathway was blocked. Additionally, cell 
proliferation was compromised when KFb were treated with both SC79 (an activator 
of the PI3K/AKT pathway) and 2-DG (an inhibitor of glycolysis), compared to the 
SC79 group. Moreover, a positive feedback mechanism was demonstrated between the 
PI3K/AKT pathway and HIF-1α. Our data collectively demonstrated that the 
PI3K/AKT pathway promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in KFb under 
hypoxia by regulating glycolysis, indicating that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway 
could be a therapeutic target for keloids. This article is protected by

1028,"The enzymatic cascades for ubiquitin transfer regulate key cellular processes 
and are the intense focus of drug development for treating cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. E1 is at the apex of the UB transfer cascade, and 
molecules inhibiting E1 have shown promising activities against cancer cell 
proliferation. Compared to small molecules, peptidomimetics have emerged as 
powerful tools to disrupt the protein-protein interactions (PPI) with less drug 
resistance and high stability in the cell. Herein, we harnessed the 
D-sulfono-γ-AA peptide to mimic the N-terminal helix of E2 and thereby inhibit 
E1-E2 interaction. Two stapled peptidomimetics, M1-S1 and M1-S2, were identified 
as effective inhibitors to block UB transfer from E1 to E2, as shown by in vitro 
and cellular assays. Our work suggested that PPIs with the N-terminal helix of 
E2 at the E1-E2 and E2-E3 interfaces could be a promising target for designing 
inhibitors against protein ubiquitination pathways in the cell."
1029,"The immune response is crucial for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) 
progression, with the participation of proinflammatory cells and cytokines, 
inducing lung injury and loss of respiratory function. CLEC5A expression on 
monocytes can be triggered by viral and bacterial infections, leading to poor 
outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 is able to induce neutrophil activation by CLEC5A and 
Toll-like receptor 2, leading to an aggressive inflammatory cascade, but little 
information is known about the molecular interactions between CLEC5A and 
SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Here, we aimed to explore how CLEC5A expression could be 
affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection using immunological tools with in vitro, in 
vivo and in silico assays. The findings revealed that high levels of CLEC5A 
expression were found in monocytes from severe COVID-19 patients in comparison 
with mild COVID-19 and unexposed subjects, but not in vaccinated subjects who 
developed mild COVID-19. In hamsters, we detected CLEC5A gene expression during 
3-15 days of Omicron strain viral challenge. Our results also showed that CLEC5A 
can interact with SARS-CoV-2, promoting inflammatory cytokine production, 
probably through an interaction with the receptor binding domain in the 
N-acetylglucosamine binding site (NAG-601). The high expression of CLEC5A and 
high levels of proinflammatory cytokine production were reduced in vitro by a 
human CLEC5A monoclonal antibody. Finally, CLEC5A was triggered by spike 
glycoprotein, suggesting its involvement in COVID-19 progression; therapy with a 
monoclonal antibody could be a good strategy for COVID-19 treatment, but 
vaccines are still the best option to avoid hospitalization/deaths. This article

1030,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the immunogenicity to SARS-CoV-2 and 
evasive subvariants BA.4/5 in people living with HIV (PLWH) following a third 
booster shot of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 318 PLWH and 241 healthy 
controls (HC) using SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays. Vaccine-induced immunological 
responses were compared before and after the third dose.
RESULTS: Serum levels of IgG anti-RBD and inhibition rate of NAb were 
significantly elevated at the ""post-third dose"" sampling time compared with the 
pre-third dose in PLWH, but were relatively decreased relative to those of HCs. 
Induced humoral and cellular responses attenuated over time after triple-dose 
vaccination. The neutralizing capacity against BA.4/5 was also intensified but 
remained below the positive inhibition threshold. Seropositivity of 
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in PLWH was prominently lower than that in HC. We 
also identified age, CD4 cell counts, time after the last vaccination, and WHO 
staging type of PLWH as independent factors associated with the seropositivity 
of antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: PLWH receiving booster shot of inactivated vaccines generate higher 
antibody responses than the second dose, but lower than that in HCs. Decreased 
anti-BA.4/5 responses than that of WT impede the protective effect of the third 
dose on Omicron prevalence. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1031,"Background In 2012, the number of people infected with HTLV-1 was estimated to 
be 10 million worldwide. Prevalence varies according to geographic location, 
ethnic factors, sex, age, populations exposed to risk factors, income, and 
education, reaching countries with the worst socioeconomic scenarios. There is a 
need to determine the current global prevalence of HTLV-1 and examine its 
association with countries' human development index (HDI) to provide data for 
global health policy. Methods Systematic review with meta-analysis according to 
PRISMA 2020 recommendations. It was registered at PROSPERO, CRD42021223146. 
Prevalence or cross-sectional studies of HTLV-1 infection with at least 100 
participants, screening, and confirmatory serologic testing were included. 
Studies with incomplete or unavailable results or with duplicate information 
were excluded. Data were selected by two independent investigators and analyzed 
using R software, a metapackage that generated the forest plots (95% CI). 
Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic, and funnel plot asymmetry was 
assessed using Egger's test. Countries were compared using an HDI cutoff ≥ 0.8. 
Methodological quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. 
Results The overall prevalence of HTLV-1 infection was 0.91% (95%CI: 0.80-1.02, 
p < 0.0001) and was higher in low HDI countries [1.18% (95%CI: 1.03-1.34)] than 
in high HDI countries [0.41% (95%CI: 0.27-0.57)]. Prevalence varied according to 
the populations studied: it was higher in the general population [1.65% (95%CI: 
1.08-2.34)] compared to pregnant women [0.34% (95%CI: 0.17-0.57)] and blood 
donors [0.04% (95%CI: 0.01-0.08)]. Consistently, prevalence for each population 
group was higher in low HDI countries than in high HDI countries. Conclusion The 
worldwide prevalence of HTLV-1 infection is highly heterogeneous, with a global 
prevalence of 0.91%. In high HDI countries, the observed prevalence is 
approximately three times lower than in low HDI countries. In the general 
population, the observed prevalence is about five times higher than in pregnant 
women and forty-one times higher than in blood donors."
1032,"The current understanding of skin aging is that senescent fibroblasts accumulate 
within the dermis and subcutaneous fat to cause abnormal tissue remodeling and 
extracellular matrix dysfunction, triggering a senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP). A novel therapeutic approach to prevent skin aging is to 
specifically eliminate senescent dermal fibroblasts; this requires the 
identification of specific protein markers for senescent cells. Apolipoprotein D 
(ApoD) is involved in lipid metabolism and antioxidant responses and is 
abundantly expressed in tissues affected by age-related diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. However, its behavior and role in skin 
aging remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether ApoD functions as a 
marker of aging using human dermal fibroblast aging models. In cellular 
senescence models induced via replicative aging and ionizing radiation exposure, 
ApoD expression was upregulated at the gene and protein levels and correlated 
with senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the decreased uptake of 
the proliferation marker BrdU, which was concomitant with the upregulation of 
SASP genes. Furthermore, ApoD-positive cells were found to be more abundant in 
the aging human dermis using fluorescence flow cytometry. These results suggest 
that ApoD is a potential clinical marker for identifying aging dermal 
fibroblasts."
1033,"One form of early life stress, prenatal exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs), 
confers a higher risk of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders in later 
life. Increasingly, the importance of microglia in these disorders is 
recognized. Studies on GCs exposure during microglial development have been 
limited, and there are few, if any, human studies. We established an in vitro 
model of ELS by continuous pre-exposure of human iPS-microglia to GCs during 
primitive hematopoiesis (the critical stage of iPS-microglial differentiation) 
and then examined how this exposure affected the microglial phenotype as they 
differentiated and matured to microglia, using RNA-seq analyses and functional 
assays. The iPS-microglia predominantly expressed glucocorticoid receptors over 
mineralocorticoid receptors, and in particular, the GR-α splice variant. Chronic 
GCs exposure during primitive hematopoiesis was able to recapitulate in vivo ELS 
effects. Thus, pre-exposure to prolonged GCs resulted in increased type I 
interferon signaling, the presence of Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-positive (cGAS) 
micronuclei, cellular senescence and reduced proliferation in the matured 
iPS-microglia. The findings from this in vitro ELS model have ramifications for 
the responses of microglia in the pathogenesis of GC- mediated ELS-associated 
disorders such as schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and 
autism spectrum disorder."
1034,"Immunophenotyping using high dimensional flow cytometry is a central component 
of human immune system multi-omic studies. We present four high parameter flow 
cytometry panels for deep immunophenotyping of human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC). This set of four 25+ color panels include 64 cell 
surface markers to resolve broad immune compartment populations, as well as 
activation and memory of specific T, B, natural killer (NK), and myeloid 
lineages. Common lineage bridging markers are integrated into each panel to 
allow for inter-panel quality control through major lineage frequency 
verification. These panels were developed using a five laser BD Symphony A5 
conventional cytometer and successfully transferred to a five laser Cytek Aurora 
spectral cytometer capable of acquiring the panels. Nine representative PBMC 
samples were stained with the four phenotyping panels and acquired on both 
instruments to evaluate population frequency and visual staining patterns for 
gating between the systems. Both instruments produced comparable high quality 
flow cytometry data and supported our decision to acquire samples on the 
spectral cytometer moving forward. This modular set of panels and instrument 
performance metrics provide guidelines for designing flow cytometry experiments 
suitable for longitudinal or cross-sectional immune profiling. This article is

1035,"Bisphenol (BP) compounds are important environmental pollutants and endocrine 
disruptors. BPs are capable of inducing DNA/chromosome breaks (clastogenesis, 
involved in carcinogenesis), which requires activation by human CYP1A1. We 
hypothesized that combined BPs and extended (from the standard two-cell cycle) 
exposure may enhance their genotoxicity via modulating CYP enzymes. In this 
study, individual and combined BPA/BPF/BPS/BPAF and a human hepatoma (HepG2) 
cell line were used for testing several genotoxicity end points. Exposing for a 
two-cell cycle period (48 h), each BP alone (0.625-10 μM) was negative in the 
micronucleus test, while micronucleus was formed under three- (72 h) and 
four-cell cycle (96 h) exposure; BP combinations further elevated the potency 
(with nanomolar thresholds). Immunofluorescence analysis of the centromere with 
formed micronucleus indicated that 48 h exposure produced centromere-negative 
micronucleus and phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) (evidencing 
clastogenesis), while extended (72 and 96 h) exposure formed centromere-positive 
micronucleus and phosphorylated histone H3 (p-H3) (indicating chromosome loss, 
i.e., aneugenesis); moreover, 1-aminotriabenzotriazole (CYP inhibitor) 
selectively blocked the formation of centromere-negative micronucleus and 
γ-H2AX, without affecting that of centromere-positive micronucleus and p-H3. 
This study suggests that the genotoxicity of BPs is potentiated by combined and 
extended exposure, the latter being specific for aneuploidy formation, a CYP 
activity-independent effect."
1036,"Transporting tissues and organs from the site of donation to the patient in 
need, while maintaining viability, is a limiting factor in transplantation 
medicine. One way in which the supply chain of organs for transplantation can be 
improved is to discover novel approaches and technologies that preserve the 
health of organs outside of the body. The dominant technologies that are 
currently in use in the supply chain for biological materials maintain tissue 
temperatures ranging from a controlled room temperature (+25 °C to +15 °C) to 
cryogenic (-120 °C to -196 °C) temperatures (reviewed in Criswell et al. Stem 
Cells Transl Med. 2022). However, there are many cells and tissues, as well as 
all major organs, that respond less robustly to preservation attempts, 
particularly when there is a need for transport over long distances that require 
more time. In this perspective article, we will highlight the current challenges 
and advances in biopreservation aimed at ""freezing biological time,"" and discuss 
the future directions and requirements needed in the field."
1037,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a ""late-onset"" primary 
immunodeficiency characterized by variable manifestations and genetic 
heterogeneity. A monogenic cause of CVID has been reported in 10% of patients. 
In this study, we identified two novel pathogenic variants implicated in 
monogenic CVID by whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis: a heterozygous nuclear 
factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) p.G686fs mutation and a homozygous inducible T-cell 
co-stimulator (ICOS) p.L96Sfs mutation. The predicted crystal models indicated 
premature truncation of the two mutated proteins. Both variants were 
demonstrated as loss-of-function mutations and were associated with overlapped 
manifestations of respiratory fungal infection and splenomegaly. We further 
performed a detailed assessment of immunologic phenotypes and impaired 
lymphocyte functions in patients. Moreover, we discovered an association between 
monoclonal T-large granular lymphocyte proliferation and ICOS-deficient CVID for 
the first time. These observations lead to a new perspective on the underlying 
genetic heterogeneity of CVID."
1038,"The overexpression of membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) on 
tumour cells helps them survive complement attacks by suppressing 
antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Consequently, mCRP 
overexpression limits monoclonal antibody drug immune efficacy. CD55, an mCRP, 
plays an important role in inhibiting antibody-mediated CDC. However, the 
mechanisms regulating CD55 expression in tumour cells remain unclear. Here, the 
aim was to explore CD55-targeting miRNAs. We previously constructed an in vitro 
model comprising cancer cell lines expressing α-gal and serum containing natural 
antibodies against α-gal and complement. This was used to simulate 
antibody-mediated CDC in colon cancer cells. We screened microRNAs that directly 
target CD55 using LoVo and Ls-174T colon cell lines, which express CD55 at low 
and high levels, respectively. miR-132-3p expression was dramatically lower in 
Ls-174T cells than in LoVo cells. miR-132-3p overexpression or inhibition 
transcriptionally regulated CD55 expression by specifically targeting its mRNA 
3'-untranslated regions. Further, miR-132-3p modulation regulated colon cancer 
cell sensitivity to antibody-mediated CDC through C5a release and C5b-9 
deposition. Moreover, miR-132-3p expression was significantly reduced, whereas 
CD55 expression was increased, in colon cancer tissues compared to levels in 
adjacent normal tissues. CD55 protein levels were negatively correlated with 
miR-132-3p expression in colon cancer tissues. Our results indicate that 
miR-132-3p regulates colon cancer cell sensitivity to antibody-mediated CDC by 
directly targeting CD55. In addition, incubating the LoVo human tumour cell 
line, stably transfected with the xenoantigen α-gal, with human serum containing 
natural antibodies comprises a stable and cheap in vitro model to explore the 
mechanisms underlying antibody-mediated CDC."
1039,"Chronic wounds, ie, non-healing ulcers, have a prevalence of ~1% in the general 
population. Chronic wounds strongly affect the quality of life and generate 
considerable medical costs. A fraction of chronic wounds will heal within months 
of appropriate treatment; however, a significant fraction of patients will 
develop therapy-refractory chronic wounds, leading to chronic pain, infection, 
and amputation. Given the paucity of therapeutic options for refractory wounds, 
cell therapy and in particular the use of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) 
has emerged as a promising concept. ASC can be used as autologous or allogeneic 
cells. They can be delivered in suspension or in 3D cultures within scaffolds. 
ASC can be used without further processing (stromal vascular fraction of the 
adipose tissue) or can be expanded in vitro. ASC-derived non-cellular 
components, such as conditioned media or exosomes, have also been investigated. 
Many in vitro and preclinical studies in animals have demonstrated the ASC 
efficacy on wounds. ASC efficiency appears to occurs mainly through their 
regenerative secretome. Hitherto, the majority of clinical trials focused mainly 
on safety issues. However more recently, a small number of randomized, 
well-controlled trials provided first convincing evidences for a clinical 
efficacy of ASC-based chronic wound therapies in humans. This brief review 
summarizes the current knowledge on the mechanism of action, delivery and 
efficacy of ASC in chronic wound therapy. It also discusses the scientific and 
pharmaceutical challenges to be solved before ASC-based wound therapy enters 
clinical reality."
1040,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin B12 is involved in biochemical metabolic pathways. B12 
deficiency is common in childhood when the need for the vitamin increases and 
growth and development occur. Various hematological, neurological, psychiatric, 
and gastrointestinal disorders are observed in its deficiency. In addition, B12 
deficiency is associated with oxidative stress and DNA damage.
AIM: Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate oxidative stress, 
thiol/disulfide homeostasis, and DNA damage pre and post-treatment in children 
diagnosed with B12 deficiency.
METHODS: A total of 40 children with B12 deficiency were included in the study 
after the consent form was approved. Blood was drawn from children pre and 
post-treatment. Hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and red blood cells (RBC) 
were measured by autoanalyzer; total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant 
status (TOS), total thiol (TT), and native thiol (NT) were measured by the 
photometric method, and DNA damage was analyzed by the comet assay method. 
Oxidative stress index (OSI) and disulfide (DIS) values were calculated.
RESULTS: As a result of the experiments, HGB, HCT, and RBC increased with 
treatment. While TAS, TT, and NT as antioxidant parameters increased; TOS, OSI, 
and DIS decreased with treatment compared to pretreatment. DNA damage was also 
found to decrease with treatment. Additionally, these data were statistically 
significant (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: It was found that oxidative stress and DNA damage decreased with 
oral B12 treatment in children with B12 deficiency, and clinical parameters were 
also improved."
1041,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common malignancy worldwide. Human immune 
deficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein 3 (HIVEP3) was verified to play 
a vital role in types of cancers. However, the functional role of HIVEP3 in AML 
was rarely reported. In this study, CCK-8, colony formation assay, flow 
cytometry, and Trans-well chamber experiments were applied for detecting cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion in AML cells. The expression of proteins 
related to TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway was determined by western blot. Our data 
showed that the expression level of HIVEP3 was closely related to the risk 
classification and prognosis of AML patients. Moreover, HIVEP3 was highly 
expressed in AML patients and cells. Knockdown of HIVEP3 significantly repressed 
cell proliferation invasion, and enhanced cell apoptosis in HL-60 and THP-1 
cells. In addition, HIVEP3 donwreglation could inhibit the TGF-β/Smad signaling 
pathway. TGF-β overexpression could reverse the inhibition effects of HIVEP3 
knockdown on AML development and the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. These 
findings indicated that HIVEP3 contributed to the progression of AML via 
regulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and had a prognostic value for AML."
1042,"Pulmonary blastomas are exceptionally rare tumors. These tumors behave 
aggressively, with a propensity to metastasize to the brain and mediastinum. A 
definitive diagnosis of pulmonary blastoma is challenging to obtain on 
cytomorphology alone. However, in a known case of primary pulmonary blastoma, 
any newly developing lesion at any anatomical site should be carefully evaluated 
for metastasis. We herein describe a case of a 59-year-old female who presented 
with a scalp lesion. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was done from the scalp 
swelling. Cytomorphology supplemented with immunocytochemistry on cell block 
confirmed the diagnosis of a metastatic pulmonary blastoma."
1043,"Phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of macrophages is clearly a critical 
component of their effective functions in innate and adaptive immunity. This 
investigation hypothesized that altered profiles of gene expression in gingival 
tissues in health, disease and resolution would reflect changes in macrophage 
phenotypes occurring in these tissues. The study used a nonhuman primate model 
to evaluate gene expression profiles as footprints of macrophage variation using 
a longitudinal experimental model of ligature-induced periodontitis in animals 
from 3-23 years of age to identify aging effects on the gingival environment. 
Significant differences were observed in distribution of expressed gene levels 
for M0, M1 and M2 macrophages in healthy tissues with the younger animals 
showing the least expression. M0 gene expression increased with disease in all 
but the aged group, while M1 was increased in adult and young animals, and M2 in 
all age groups, as early as disease initiation (within 0.5 months). Numerous 
histocompatibility genes were increased with disease, except in the aged 
samples. An array of cytokines/chemokines representing both M1 and M2 cells were 
increased with disease showing substantial increases with disease initiation 
(eg. IL1A, CXCL8, CCL19, CCL2, CCL18), although the aged tissues showed a more 
limited magnitude of change across these macrophage genes. The analytics of 
macrophage genes at sites of gingival health, disease and resolution 
demonstrated distinct profiles of host response interactions that may help model 
the disease mechanisms occurring with the formation of a periodontal lesion."
1044,"Myocardial regeneration is identified as a concept at histological level. The 
core content is to increase the number of cardiomyocytes (CMs), so as to 
maintain the steady state of CMs under pathological or physiological conditions 
and ensure the normal cardiac function. In this review, we discussed the 
relevant factors involved in the regeneration of CMs, generalized in mice, large 
mammals and human. During different development stages of mammalian hearts, CMs 
showed several controlling and growth modes on the physiological or pathological 
state: mitosis, hypertrophy, nuclear polyploidy and multinucleation, amitosis 
and etc. We also discussed the mechanisms of specific microRNAs implicated in 
the cardiac development, as well as disease-induced apoptosis in CMs and the 
process of re-entering cell cycle after injury. It is hoped that this review 
will contribute to a deeper understanding of therapeutic approaches for 
myocardial regeneration after injury."
1045,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a member of the Cyclooxygenase family, initiates the 
biosynthesis of prostanoids that regulates various cellular functions. Our pilot 
attempt revealed that administration of etoricoxib, an inhibitor specific for 
COX-2, induces abnormal looping in the chicken heart. The present study attempts 
to reveal the mechanistic details of etoricoxibinduced abnormal cardiac looping. 
The activity of COX-2 was inhibited by administering 3.5 μg of etoricoxib into 
the air cell of the egg on day zero of incubation. The gene and protein 
expression patterns of the major mediators of heart development were then 
analyzed on day 2 (HH12) and day 3 (HH20). Reduction in the COX-2 activity 
deranged the expressions of upstream regulators of organogenesis like Wnt11, 
BMP4 and SHH in the embryos exposed to etoricoxib. The observed expression 
shifts in the downstream regulators of myocardial patterning (MYOCD, HAND2, 
GATA4, GATA5 and GATA6) in the treated embryos corroborate the above results. In 
addition, the reduction in COX-2 activity hampered the cardiomyocyte 
proliferation with a concomitant increase in the rate of apoptosis. In 
conclusion, the collective effect of altered expression of signaling molecules 
of myocardial patterning and compromised cardiomyocyte turnover rate could be 
the reason behind the looping defects observed in the heart of 
etoricoxib-treated chick embryos."
1046,"BACKGROUND: Protamine administration post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can 
potentially cause hemodynamic instability. Histamine released from mast cells is 
believed to be responsible for hypotension after protamine administration. The 
aim of this study was to examine the effects of pretreatment with H1 and H2 
antihistamines on changes in systemic arterial pressure following protamine 
administration.
METHODS: This study was a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 
conducted at a university hospital. Forty adult patients undergoing elective 
coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) or single valve surgery were included. The 
patients were randomly allocated (20 patients in each group) to receive a single 
dose of combined chlorpheniramine 10 mg and ranitidine 50 mg or normal saline 
intravenously immediately after separation from CPB prior to protamine 
administration. Trajectory changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean 
arterial pressure (MAP), and vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) from baseline 
until 35 minutes following protamine administration (24-time points) were 
compared between the two groups. Serial serum tryptase levels were also obtained 
at baseline, 30 and 60 minutes after protamine was given.
RESULTS: Forty patients were included in the analysis. Demographic and baseline 
blood pressure were similar between the two groups. At 30 minutes after 
protamine administration, there were no significant differences in both crude 
SBP [mean difference: -7.1 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.1 to 15.3 
mmHg, P=0.09] and SBP after adjustment for the European System for Cardiac 
Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE II), CPB time, and VIS (mean difference: 
-3.9 mmHg, 95% CI, -11.9 to 4.0 mmHg, P=0.33). There were also no significant 
differences in crude MAP (mean difference: -2.1 mmHg, 95% CI, -6.9 to 2.7 mmHg, 
P=0.39) and adjusted MAP (mean difference: -0.7 mmHg, -5.9 to 4.4 mmHg, P=0.78) 
between the two groups. None of the patients in both groups had a significant 
increase in serum tryptase from baseline. No differences in median serum 
tryptase levels at baseline, 30 and 60 minutes were demonstrated between the two 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with H1 and H2 antihistamines does not attenuate blood 
pressure responses to protamine administration in patients after CPB. Mechanisms 
other than histamine release from mast cells might be responsible for 
protamine-induced cardiovascular changes.

1047,"INTRODUCTION: Late-gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance (LGE-MRI) imaging 
is increasingly used in management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) patients. Here, 
we assess the usefulness of LGE-MRI-based fibrosis quantification to predict 
arrhythmia recurrence in patients undergoing cryoballoon ablation. Our secondary 
goal was to compare two widely used fibrosis quantification methods.
METHODS: In 102 AF patients undergoing LGE-MRI and cryoballoon ablation (mean 
age 62 years; 64% male; 59% paroxysmal AFib), atrial fibrosis was quantified 
using the pixel intensity histogram (PIH) and image intensity ratio (IIR) 
methods. PIH segmentations were completed by a third-party provider as part of 
the standard of care at our hospital; IIR segmentations of the same scans were 
carried out in our lab using a commercially available software package. Fibrosis 
burdens and spatial distributions for the two methods were compared. Patients 
were followed prospectively for recurrent arrhythmia following ablation.
RESULTS: Average PIH fibrosis was 15.6±5.8% of the left atrial (LA) volume. 
Depending on threshold (IIRthr ), the average IIR fibrosis (% of LA wall surface 
area) ranged from 5.0±7.2% (IIRthr =1.2) to 37.4±10.9% (IIRthr =0.97). An IIRthr 
of 1.03 demonstrated the greatest agreement between the methods, but spatial 
overlap of fibrotic areas delineated by the two methods was modest (Sorenson 
Dice coefficient: 0.49). 42 patients (41.2%) had recurrent arrhythmia. PIH 
fibrosis successfully predicted recurrence (HR 1.07; p=0.02) over a follow up 
period of 362±149 days; regardless of IIRthr , IIR fibrosis did not predict 
recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: PIH-based volumetric assessment of atrial fibrosis was modestly 
predictive of arrhythmia recurrence following cryoballoon ablation in this 
cohort. IIR-based fibrosis was not predictive of recurrence for any of the 
IIRthr values tested, and the overlap in designated areas of fibrosis between 
the PIH and IIR methods was modest. Caution must therefore be exercised when 
interpreting LA fibrosis from LGE-MRI, since the values and spatial pattern are 
methodology-dependent. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1048,"Some conventional sanitizers and antibiotics used in food industry may be of 
concerns due to generation of toxic byproducts, impact on the environment, and 
the emergence of antibiotic resistance bacteria. Bio-based antimicrobials can be 
an alternative to conventional sanitizers since they are produced from renewable 
resources, and the bacterial resistance to these compounds is of less concern 
than those of currently used antibiotics. Among the bio-based antimicrobial 
compounds, those produced via either fermentation or chemical synthesis by 
covalently or electrovalently attaching specific moieties to the fatty acid have 
drawn attention in recent years. Disaccharide, arginine, vitamin B1, and 
phenolics are linked to fatty acids resulting in the production of sophorolipid, 
lauric arginate ethyl ester, thiamin dilauryl sulfate, and phenolic 
branched-chain fatty acid, respectively, all of which are reported to exhibit 
antimicrobial activity by targeting the cell membrane of the bacteria. Also, 
studies that applied these compounds as food preservatives by combining them 
with other compounds or treatments have been reviewed regarding extending the 
shelf life and inactivating foodborne pathogens of foods and food products. In 
addition, the phenolic branched-chain fatty acids, which are relatively new 
compounds compared to the others, are highlighted in this review."
1049,"BACKGROUND: A drawback in the treatment of chronic Chagas disease (American 
trypanosomiasis) is the long time required to achieve complete loss of 
serological reactivity, the standard for determining treatment efficacy.
METHODS: Antibody-secreting and memory B cells specific for Trypanosoma cruzi 
and their degree of differentiation were evaluated in adult and pediatric 
subjects with chronic Chagas disease prior to and after etiological treatment.
RESULTS: Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibody-secreting cells disappeared from 
the circulation in benznidazole or nifurtimox-treated subjects with declining 
parasite-specific antibody levels posttreatment, whereas B cells in most 
subjects with unaltered antibody levels were low prior to treatment and did not 
change after treatment. The timing of the decay in parasite-specific 
antibody-secreting B cells was similar to that in parasite-specific antibodies 
as measured by a Luminex-based assay, but preceded the decay in antibody levels 
detected by conventional serology. The phenotype of total B cells returned to a 
non-infection profile after successful treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: T. cruzi-specific antibodies in the circulation of chronically T. 
cruzi-infected subjects likely derive from both antigen-driven plasmablasts, 
that disappear following successful treatment, and long-lived plasma cells that 
persist and account for the low frequency and long course to complete 
seronegative conversion in successfully treated subjects."
1050,"Thioredoxin-like protein 1 (TXNL1), one of the thioredoxin superfamily known as 
redox-regulator, plays an essential in maintaining cell survival via various 
antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. It is well known that relationship 
between ischemia and oxidative stress, however, the role of TXNL1 protein in 
ischemic damage has not been fully investigated. In the present study, we aimed 
to determine the protective role of TXNL1 against on ischemic injury in vitro 
and in vivo using cell permeable Tat-TXNL1 fusion protein. Transduced Tat-TXNL1 
inhibited ROS production and cell death in H2O2-exposed hippocampal neuronal 
(HT-22) cells and modulated MAPKs and Akt activation, and pro-apoptotic protein 
expression levels in the cells. In an ischemia animal model, Tat-TXNL1 markedly 
decreased hippocampal neuronal cell death and the activation of astrocytes and 
microglia. These findings indicate that cell permeable Tat-TXNL1 protects 
against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo ischemic animal model. Therefore, 
we suggest Tat-TXNL1 can be a potential therapeutic protein for ischemic injury."
1051,"Cohesin is a ring-shaped protein complex that comprises the SMC1, SMC3, and 
α-kleisin proteins, STAG1/2/3 subunits, and auxiliary factors. Cohesin 
participates in chromatin remodeling, chromosome segregation, DNA replication, 
and gene expression regulation during the cell cycle. Mitosis-specific α-kleisin 
factor RAD21 and meiosis-specific α-kleisin factor REC8 are expressed in 
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to maintain pluripotency. Here, we demonstrated that 
RAD21 and REC8 were involved in maintaining genomic stability and modulating 
chromatin modification in murine ESCs. When the kleisin subunits were depleted, 
DNA repair genes were downregulated, thereby reducing cell viability and causing 
replication protein A (RPA) accumulation. This finding suggested that the repair 
of exposed single-stranded DNA was inefficient. Furthermore, the depletion of 
kleisin subunits induced DNA hypermethylation by upregulating DNA methylation 
proteins. Thus, we proposed that the cohesin complex plays two distinct roles in 
chromatin remodeling and genomic integrity to ensure the maintenance of 
pluripotency in ESCs."
1052,"OBJECTIVE: The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test is standard screening test that 
detects cervical lesions and cancers. In this multicentric study, we performed a 
retrospective analysis of cytologic results associated with atypical glandular 
cells-not otherwise specified (AGC-NOS).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Pap smear tests resulted as ""atypical 
glandular cells-not otherwise specified"". A total of 254 women who underwent 
colposcopy due to a Pap smear result of AGC-NOS were included the study between 
2003 and 2021. The ages, Pap smear results, HPV results if any, colposcopic 
biopsy results, endocervical and endometrial pathology results and management of 
these patients were analayzed.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-four patients with AGC-NOS Pap smear result were 
included in the study. A total of 70 (27.6%) patients had cervical and 
endometrial premalignant or malignant lesions. Malignancy was observed in 17 
(6.7%) patients (endometrium; n: 11 (4.3%) and cervix; n: 6 (2.4%)). Isolated 
premalign or malign lesions of cervix and endometrium were detected in 57 
(22.4%) and 12 (4.7%) patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with AGC-NOS should undergo a careful evaluation 
with all its clinicopathological features. Because the cancer of the cervix and 
endometrium is not rare in patients diagnosed with AGC-NOS, colposcopic 
examination with endocervical sampling should be a priority based on a 
cervicovaginal smear. Endometrial sampling is also required according to the 
patient's clinic, age and examination characteristics."
1053,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (AECOPD) are heterogeneous in aetiology and accelerate disease 
progression. Here, we aimed to investigate the association of fractional exhaled 
nitric oxide (FeNO) and its variability with AECOPD of different aetiology.
METHODS: FeNO was determined in 2157 visits (1697 stable, 133 AECOPD and 327 
follow-up) of 421 COPD patients from the PREVENT study, an 
investigator-initiated, longitudinal and interventional study, who were on daily 
treatment with inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting β2-agonists.
RESULTS: Longitudinal measurements of FeNO revealed an intra-subject variability 
of FeNO that was significantly higher in exacerbators compared to 
non-exacerbators (p < 0.001) and positively associated with the number of 
AECOPD. As FeNO variability increased, the probability of patients to remain 
AECOPD-free decreased. In patients included in the highest FeNO variability 
quartile (≥15.0 ppb) the probability to remain free of AECOPD was only 35% as 
compared to 80% for patients included in the lowest FeNO variability quartile 
(0.50-4.39 ppb). The change of FeNO from the last stable visit to AECOPD was 
positively associated with the probability of viral infections and this 
association was stronger in current smokers than ex-smokers. In contrast, the 
change in FeNO from the last stable visit to an AECOPD visit was inversely 
associated with the probability of bacterial infections in ex-smokers but not in 
current smokers.
CONCLUSION: FeNO variability was associated with the risk and aetiology of 
AECOPD differentially in current and ex-smokers."
1054,"Today, cancer is one of the main health-related challenges, and in the meantime, 
breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women, with an 
alarming number of incidences and deaths every year. For this reason, the 
discovery of novel and more effective approaches for the diagnosis, treatment, 
and monitoring of the disease are very important. In this regard, scientists are 
looking for diagnostic molecules to achieve the above-mentioned goals with 
higher accuracy and specificity. RNA interference (RNAi) is a posttranslational 
regulatory process mediated by microRNA intervention and small interfering RNAs. 
After transcription and edition, these two noncoding RNAs are integrated and 
activated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and AGO2 to connect the 
target mRNA by their complementary sequence and suppress their translation, thus 
reducing the expression of their target genes. These two RNAi categories show 
different patterns in different BC types and stages compared to healthy cells, 
and hence, these molecules have high diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic 
potentials. This article aims to review the RNAi pathway and diagnostic and 
therapeutic potentials with a special focus on BC."
1055,"As the central cellular player in fibrogenesis, activated hepatic stellate cells 
(aHSCs) are the major target of antifibrotic nanomedicines. Based on our finding 
that activated HSCs increase the expression of folate receptor alpha (FRα), we 
tried to apply folic acid (FA) decoration to generate an active drug-targeting 
at aHSCs and suppress hepato-fibrogenesis. FA-conjugated poly(ethylene 
glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) copolymers (PEG-PCL) were synthesized and 
self-assembled into the spherical micelles that owned a uniform size 
distribution averaging at 60 nm, excellent hemo- and cyto-compatibility, and 
pH-sensitive stability. These FA-modified micelles were preferentially ingested 
by aHSCs as expected and accumulated more in acutely CCl4 injured mouse livers 
compared to nondecorated counterparts. Such an aHSC targetability facilitated 
the loaded medicinal camptothecin (CPT) to achieve a greater therapeutic 
efficacy and inhibition of MF phenotypic genes in aHSCs. Encouragingly, though 
free CPT and nontargeting CPT micelles produced negligible curative outcomes, 
FA-decorated CPT micelles yielded effectively remedial effects in chronically 
CCl4-induced fibrotic mice, as represented by a significant shrinkage of aHSC 
population, suppression of fibrogenesis, and recovery of liver structure and 
function, clearly indicating the success of the folate decoration-supported 
aHSC-targeted strategy for antifibrotic nanomedicines in fibrosis resolution."
1056,"Lipid transfer between organelles requires proteins that shield the hydrophobic 
portions of lipids as they cross the cytoplasm. In the last decade a new 
structural form of lipid transfer protein (LTP) has been found: long hydrophobic 
grooves made of beta-sheet that bridge between organelles at membrane contact 
sites. Eukaryotes have five families of bridge-like LTPs: VPS13, ATG2, SHIP164, 
Hobbit and Tweek. These are unified into a single superfamily through their 
bridges being composed of just one domain, called the repeating beta groove 
(RBG) domain, which builds into rod shaped multimers with a hydrophobic-lined 
groove and hydrophilic exterior. Here, sequences and predicted structures of the 
RBG superfamily were analyzed in depth. Phylogenetics showed that the last 
eukaryotic common ancestor contained all five RBG proteins, with duplicated 
VPS13s. The current set of long RBG protein appears to have arisen in even 
earlier ancestors from shorter forms with 4 RBG domains. The extreme ends of 
most RBG proteins have amphipathic helices that might be an adaptation for 
direct or indirect bilayer interaction, although this has yet to be tested. The 
one exception to this is the C-terminus of SHIP164, which instead has a 
coiled-coil. Finally, the exterior surfaces of the RBG bridges are shown to have 
conserved residues along most of their length, indicating sites for partner 
interactions almost all of which are unknown. These findings can inform future 
cell biological and biochemical experiments."
1057,"Since 2019, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly 
worldwide, posing an unignorable threat to the global economy and human health. 
It is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a 
single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacoronavirus. This virus is highly 
infectious and relies on its angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-receptor to enter 
cells. With the increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, the 
difficulty of diagnosis due to the lack of global healthcare resources becomes 
increasingly apparent. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis models with 
high generalisability can effectively alleviate this pressure. Hyperparameter 
tuning is essential in training such models and significantly impacts their 
final performance and training speed. However, traditional hyperparameter tuning 
methods are usually time-consuming and unstable. To solve this issue, we 
introduce Particle Swarm Optimisation to build a PSO-guided Self-Tuning 
Convolution Neural Network (PSTCNN), allowing the model to tune hyperparameters 
automatically. Therefore, the proposed approach can reduce human involvement. 
Also, the optimisation algorithm can select the combination of hyperparameters 
in a targeted manner, thus stably achieving a solution closer to the global 
optimum. Experimentally, the PSTCNN can obtain quite excellent results, with a 
sensitivity of 93.65%±1.86%, a specificity of 94.32%±2.07%, a precision of 
94.30%±2.04%, an accuracy of 93.99%±1.78%, an F1-score of 93.97%±1.78%, Matthews 
Correlation Coefficient of 87.99%±3.56%, and Fowlkes-Mallows Index of 
93.97%±1.78%. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional methods, 
hyperparameter tuning of the model using an optimisation algorithm is faster and 
more effective."
1058,"The definition of autoimmune neutropenias (AIN) has been based on the 
demonstration of autoantibodies directed to various epitopes on blood 
neutrophils. However, this definition is probably too limited and excludes 
neutropenias (NPs) with a negative autoantibody test but with other phenomena 
that indicate an underlying autoimmune process. Examples of such AINs may be 
complete or incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases 
where NP is common but patients may not fulfill formal diagnostic criteria for a 
rheumatic disease. Recently, various inherited immune-dysregulation syndromes, 
such as those related to variants in, for example, TACI, BAFFR, ACKR1/DARC, 
LRBA, CTLA 4 genes, with dysregulated B- and T-lymphocyte functions, have been 
associated with concomitant AINs. Cellular immune mechanisms may also play a 
prominent role in the development of NP, in the presence or not of 
autoantibodies, in cases of large granular lymphocyte syndromes of T- and 
NK-cell types or in chronic idiopathic NP, particularly in adults with T-cell 
clonal populations. The course of AIN may differ according to age, being 
transient and rather uncomplicated in children, and chronic with treatment 
requirement in adolescents and adults. This review discusses current knowledge 
of AINs, including diagnostic procedures, treatments, and prognosis."
1059,"Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with heterogeneous 
clinical course. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remains the only 
curative therapy, but its morbidity and mortality require careful candidate 
selection. Therefore, accurate disease risk prognostication is critical for 
treatment decision-making. We obtained registry data from patients diagnosed 
with MF in 60 Spanish institutions (N = 1386). These were randomly divided into 
a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). A machine learning (ML) technique 
(random forest) was used to model overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free 
survival (LFS) in the training set, and the results were validated in the test 
set. We derived the AIPSS-MF (Artificial Intelligence Prognostic Scoring System 
for Myelofibrosis) model, which was based on 8 clinical variables at diagnosis 
and achieved high accuracy in predicting OS (training set c-index, 0.750; test 
set c-index, 0.744) and LFS (training set c-index, 0.697; test set c-index, 
0.703). No improvement was obtained with the inclusion of MPN driver mutations 
in the model. We were unable to adequately assess the potential benefit of 
including adverse cytogenetics or high-risk mutations due to the lack of these 
data in many patients. AIPSS-MF was superior to the IPSS regardless of MF 
subtype and age range and outperformed the MYSEC-PM in patients with secondary 
MF. In conclusion, we have developed a prediction model based exclusively on 
clinical variables that provides individualized prognostic estimates in patients 
with primary and secondary MF. The use of AIPSS-MF in combination with 
predictive models that incorporate genetic information may improve disease risk 
stratification."
1060,"Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous 
disease with poor clinical outcome. Our previous work had demonstrated that 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analyses were feasible in ENKTL, and dynamic 
tracing of ctDNA could be used to monitor the disease status. However, the 
prognostic value of ctDNA in ENKTL has not been fully investigated. Patients 
with newly diagnosed ENKTL from February 2017 to December 2021 (n = 70) were 
enrolled. The pretreatment ctDNA concentration (hGE/mL) was measured. The 
prognostic value of ctDNA, international prognostic index (IPI), Korean 
prognostic index (KPI), PINK-E, and the combination of PINK-E and ctDNA 
(PINK-EC) were investigated in our cohort. The IPI and PINK-E risk categories 
had a significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) between the low-risk and intermediate-risk groups. The KPI risk 
category had a difference in PFS and OS between the intermediate-risk and 
high-risk groups. Furthermore, integrating ctDNA into the PINK-E model could 
overcome the shortcomings of other prognostic models, which could significantly 
distinguish the different-risk groups. Overall, our results demonstrated that 
PINK-EC showed a superior prognostic prediction value and stability compared 
with IPI, KPI, and PINK-E. The integration of molecular features of the tumor 
into classic risk categories might better characterize a high-risk group where 
novel treatment approaches are most needed."
1061,"PURPOSE: In vivo, the circadian clock drives 24-h rhythms in human physiology. 
Isolated cells in vitro retain a functional clockwork but lack necessary timing 
cues resulting in the rapid loss of tissue-level circadian rhythms. This study 
tests the hypothesis that repeated daily mechanical stimulation acts as a timing 
cue for the circadian clockwork. The delineation and integration of circadian 
timing cues into predictive in vitro model systems, including organ-on-a-chip 
(OOAC) devices, represent a novel concept that introduces a key component of in 
vivo physiology into predictive in vitro model systems.
METHODS: Quiescent bovine chondrocytes were entrained for 3 days by daily 12-h 
bouts of cyclic biaxial tensile strain (10%, 0.33 Hz, Flexcell) before sampling 
during free-running conditions. The core clock protein, BMAL-1, was quantified 
from normalised Western Blot signal intensity and the temporal oscillations 
characterised by Cosinor linear fit with 24-h period.
RESULTS: Following entrainment, the cell-autonomous oscillations of the 
molecular clock protein, BMAL-1, exhibited circadian (24 h) periodicity 
(p < 0.001) which aligned to the diurnal mechanical stimuli. A 6-h phase shift 
in the mechanical entrainment protocol resulted in an equivalent shift of the 
circadian clockwork. Thus, repeated daily mechanical stimuli synchronised 
circadian rhythmicity of chondrocytes in vitro.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that daily mechanical stimulation can act as 
a timing cue that is sufficient to entrain the peripheral circadian clock in 
vitro. This discovery may be exploited to induce and sustain circadian 
physiology within into predictive in vitro model systems, including OOAC 
systems. Integration of the circadian clock within these systems will enhance 
their potential to accurately recapitulate human diurnal physiology and hence 
augment their predictive value as drug testing platforms and as realistic models 
of human (patho)physiology.

1063,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness 
worldwide. Early to intermediate AMD is characterized by the accumulation of 
lipid- and protein-rich drusen. Late stages of the disease are characterized by 
the development of choroidal neovascularization, termed ""exudative"" or 
""neovascular AMD,"" or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell and photoreceptor 
death, termed ""geographic atrophy"" (GA) in advanced nonexudative AMD. Although 
we have effective treatments for exudative AMD in the form of anti-VEGF agents, 
they have no role for patients with GA. Neuroprotection strategies have emerged 
as a possible way to slow photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss in patients 
with GA. These approaches include reduction of oxidative stress, modulation of 
the visual cycle, reduction of toxic molecules, inhibition of pathologic protein 
activity, prevention of cellular apoptosis or programmed necrosis (necroptosis), 
inhibition of inflammation, direct activation of neurotrophic factors, delivery 
of umbilical tissue-derived cells, and RPE replacement. Despite active 
investigation in this area and significant promise based on preclinical studies, 
many clinical studies have not yielded successful results. We discuss selected 
past and current neuroprotection trials for AMD, highlight the lessons learned 
from these past studies, and discuss our perspective regarding remaining 
questions that must be answered before neuroprotection can be successfully 
applied in the field of AMD research."
1064,"This research work focuses on the fabrication and study of a series of 
nanocomposites consisting of two types of hydroxyapatite (HA), obtained by

bioglass. The microstructure and chemical, mechanical, and biological properties 
as functions of three factors, namely (i) the type of hydroxyapatite, (ii) glass 
content, and (iii) sintering temperature, were investigated. It was found that 
all of these factors affect the final composition and microstructure, 
especially, porosity, which shows significantly lower values for HAP-based 
composites than for HAG-based ones and higher values for higher glass content. 
This, in turn, has an impact on the microhardness, which exhibits a strong 
correlation with porosity, as well as on the mineralization capability and cell 
viability due to the different dissolution rate."
1065,"INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease, resulting due to 
host immune response against subgingival biofilm. Most conventional treatment 
protocols aim to control the subgingival biofilm by mechanical means, such as 
dental scaling and root planning, and frequently accompanied by antibacterial 
co-adjuvant therapies, including antibiotics, antiseptics, or probiotics. Local 
drug delivery facilitates administration of a lower dose of the drug to the 
target site, but at higher concentration, thereby reducing systemic adverse 
effects and toxicity. The present systematic review was conducted with the aim 
of identifying and reporting nanoparticle based periodontal drug delivery 
systems, with a specific focus on current trends and future perspectives in this 
field.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Comprehensive literature search, restricted to published 
reports in English language between January 2000 and February 2022, was done 
electronically and manually. Search queries were addressed to the following 
electronic databases including, PubMed (MEDLINE), Science Direct (Elsevier), 
Cochrane Library, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) and Scholar (Google). 
Database search returned 780 results which were screened based on title, author 
names and publication dates, to identify 13 studies fulfilling the review 
criteria.
RESULTS: Data from the 13 included studies were reviewed and tabulated, 
elaborating the type of nanoparticle used, drug delivered and 
tissues/cells/subcellular components targeted by periodontal drug delivery. 
While majority of the studies were conducted in vitro, there were 3 in vivo 
studies and 3 clinical studies. Using nanotechnology for drug delivery resulted 
in better inhibition of bacterial growth, inflammatory modulation favoring 
resolution of periodontitis and capability for early tissue regeneration.
CONCLUSION: Recent developments in nanotechnology have enabled targeted local 
delivery of drugs and anti-inflammatory biomolecules, in synergy with 
nanoparticles, towards periodontal pathogens, inflammatory cells and periodontal

through nanoparticle based local drug delivery drugs is highly recommended."
1066,"Tongue metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are rare, with 90% of malignant 
lesions in the oral cavity consisting of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). There 
are a number of subtypes of SCC which need to be considered as well as rarer 
pathology and even benign conditions. The case involves a 63-year-old gentleman 
with an incidental finding of pulmonary metastasis from a RCC of the left 
kidney, and he concurrently had a RCC deposit on the dorsum of the tongue, which 
was diagnosed after biopsy. Treatment modalities of surgical excision, 
radiotherapy and systemic therapy are considered, but with such a poor prognosis 
with disseminated disease, options are limited. Treatment should include 
multidisciplinary team input, with a focus on reducing disease morbidity."
1067,"A 39-year-old male presented with deep venous thrombosis in the right lower 
limb. He had been experiencing increasing abdominal girth over several years, 
but this went undetected at the initial examination. Eighteen months later, a 
computed tomography was conducted, showing a huge retroperitoneal cyst (25 × 23 
× 16 cm) lifting the right external iliac vessels. Complete surgical excision of 
the cyst was performed. The cyst was unilocular and contained 5 l of clear 
fluid. Histopathology examination found a thin cyst wall consisting of fibrous 
stromal tissue with a single-layer epithelium lining. Immunohistochemical 
staining revealed positivity for endothelial cell markers, CD31 and CD34, but 
negativity for the lymphatic marker podoplanin (D2-40), corresponding to a 
vascular origin, likely a venous malformation."

1070,"BACKGROUND: In most regions, cancer ranks the second most frequent cause of 
death following cardiovascular disorders.
AIM: In this article, we review the various aspects of glycolysis with a focus 
on types of MCTs and the importance of lactate in cancer cells.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Metabolic changes are one of the first and most 
important alterations in cancer cells. Cancer cells use different pathways to 
survive, energy generation, growth, and proliferation compared to normal cells. 
The increase in glycolysis, which produces substances such as lactate and 
pyruvate, has an important role in metastases and invasion of cancer cells. Two 
important cellular proteins that play a role in the production and transport of 
lactate include lactate dehydrogenase and monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). 
These molecules by their various isoforms and different tissue distribution help 
to escape the immune system and expansion of cancer cells under different 
conditions."
1071,"Hookworm infection is caused by the blood-feeding hookworm gastrointestinal 
nematodes. Its harmful effects include anemia and retarded growth and are common 
in the tropics. A current control method involves the mass drug administration 
of synthetic drugs, mainly albendazole and mebendazole. There are however 
concerns of low efficacy and drug resistance due to their repeated and excessive 
use. Although, Necator americanus glutathione S-transferase 3 (Na-GST-3) is a 
notable target, using natural product libraries for computational elucidation of 
promising leads is underexploited. This study sought to use pharmacoinformatics 
techniques to identify compounds of natural origins with the potential to be 
further optimized as promising inhibitors. A compendium of 3182 African natural 
products together with five known helminth GST inhibitors including Cibacron 
blue was screened against the active sites of the Na-GST-3 structure (PDB ID: 
3W8S). The hit compounds were profiled to ascertain the mechanisms of binding, 
anthelmintic bioactivity, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. The 
AutoDock Vina docking protocol was validated by obtaining 0.731 as the area 
under the curve calculated via the receiver operating characteristics curve. 
Four compounds comprising ZINC85999636, ZINC35418176, ZINC14825190, and 
Dammarane Triterpene13 were identified as potential lead compounds with binding 
energies less than -9.0 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the selected compounds formed key 
intermolecular interactions with critical residues Tyr95, Gly13 and Ala14. 
Notably, ZINC85999636, ZINC14825190, and dammarane triterpene13 were predicted 
as anthelmintics, whilst all the four molecules shared structural similarities 
with known inhibitors. Molecular modelling showed that the compounds had 
reasonably good binding free energies. More so, they had high binding affinities 
when screened against other variants of the Na-GST, namely Na-GST-1 and 
Na-GST-2. Ligand quality assessment using ligand efficiency dependent 
lipophilicity, ligand efficiency, ligand efficiency scale and fit quality scale 
showed the molecules are worthy candidates for further optimization. The 
inhibitory potentials of the molecules warrant in vitro studies to evaluate 
their effect on the heme regulation mechanisms."
1072,"Sr3YCo4O10.5+δ (314-SYCO), with an unusual ordered structure and a high Curie 
temperature (Tc ≈ 335 K), is attracting increasing attention. Herein, to improve 
the electrical performance of 314-SYCO, Cu-doped Sr3YCo4-x Cu x O10.5+δ (x = 
0-0.8) ceramics were prepared using a solid-state reaction method. Systematic 
research was conducted on both the ordered phase transformation and the effects 
of Cu doping on the microstructure, electrical transport characteristics, and 
magnetic properties. For x = 0-0.4, the (103) and (215) planes were observed and 
combined with Rietveld refinement results for the X-ray diffraction data, 
confirming the formation of ordered tetragonal Sr3YCo4-x Cu x O10.5+δ . This 
phase was formed with a mass gain of ∼0.8% and heat released at ∼1,042°C. With 
increasing Cu content, the concentration of hole carriers also increased, 
leading to a substantial reduction in electrical resistivity. The electrical 
resistivity decreased by 92-99% at 300 K. The polycrystalline materials have 
semiconducting behaviour with a three-dimensional Mott variable-range hopping 
mechanism. For the magnetic properties, a Hopkinson peak was observed at 319 K, 
and the Tc was approximately 321 K for x = 0. The magnetisation and Tc decreased 
with increasing Cu content, and a G-type antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic 
phase transition occurred due to the spin state change for some Co3+ ions from 
high/intermediate spin to low/intermediate spin. These results lay the 
groundwork for refinement of the sintering procedure and doping parameters to 
enhance the performance of 314-SYCO in the context of current applications such 
as microwave absorbers and solid oxide fuel cell cathodes."

1077,"The skeletal muscle research field generally accepts that nuclei in skeletal 
muscle fibers (ie, myonuclei) are post-mitotic and unable to proliferate. 
Because our deuterium oxide (D2O) labeling studies showed DNA synthesis in 
skeletal muscle tissue, we hypothesized that resident myonuclei can replicate in 
vivo. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model that temporally labeled 
myonuclei with GFP followed by D2O labeling during normal cage activity, 
functional overload, and with satellite cell ablation. During normal cage 
activity, we observed deuterium enrichment into myonuclear DNA in 7 out of 7 
plantaris (PLA), 6 out of 6 tibialis anterior (TA), 5 out of 7 gastrocnemius 
(GAST), and 7 out of 7 quadriceps (QUAD). The average fractional synthesis rates 
(FSR) of DNA in myonuclei were: 0.0202 ± 0.0093 in PLA, 0.0239 ± 0.0040 in TA, 
0.0076 ± 0. 0058 in GAST, and 0.0138 ± 0.0039 in QUAD, while there was no 
replication in myonuclei from EDL. These FSR values were largely reproduced in 
the overload and satellite cell ablation conditions, although there were higher 
synthesis rates in the overloaded PLA muscle. We further provided evidence that 
myonuclear replication is through endoreplication, which results in polyploidy. 
These novel findings contradict the dogma that skeletal muscle nuclei are 
post-mitotic and open potential avenues to harness the intrinsic replicative 
ability of myonuclei for muscle maintenance and growth."

intracellular proteins previously considered undruggable. This technology 
utilizes the ubiquitin-proteasome system in cells to specifically degrade target 
proteins, thereby offering significant advantages over conventional 
small-molecule inhibitors of the enzymatic function. Preclinical and preliminary 
clinical trials of PROTAC-based compounds (degraders) are presented. The review 
considers the general principles of the design of degraders. Advances and 
challenges of the PROTAC technology are discussed."
1079,"Self-organized microvascular networks (MVNs) have become key to the development 
of many microphysiological models. However, the self-organizing nature of this 
process combined with variations between types or batches of endothelial cells 
(ECs) often lead to inconsistency or failure to form functional MVNs. Since 
interstitial flow (IF) has been reported to play a beneficial role in 
angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and 3D capillary morphogenesis, we systematically 
investigated the role IF plays during neovessel formation in a customized single 
channel microfluidic chip for which IF has been fully characterized. Compared to 
static conditions, MVNs formed under IF have higher vessel density and diameters 
and greater network perfusability. Through a series of inhibitory experiments, 
we demonstrated that IF treatment improves vasculogenesis by ECs through 
upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). We then successfully 
implemented a novel strategy involving the interplay between IF and MMP-2 
inhibitor to regulate morphological parameters of the self-organized MVNs, with 
vascular permeability and perfusability well maintained. The revealed mechanism 
and proposed methodology were further validated with a brain MVN model. Our 
findings and methods have the potential to be widely utilized to boost the 
development of various organotypic MVNs and could be incorporated into related 
bioengineering applications where perfusable vasculature is desired."
1080,"The process of domestication has led to dramatic differences in behavioral 
traits between domestic dogs and gray wolves. Whole-genome research found that a 
class of putative positively selected genes were related to various aspects of 
learning and memory, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression. In 
this study, we constructed a single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of the dog 
hippocampus to illustrate its cell types, cell lineage and molecular features. 
Using the transcriptomes of 105 057 nuclei from the hippocampus of a Beagle dog, 
we identified 26 cell clusters and a putative trajectory of oligodendrocyte 
development. Comparative analysis revealed a significant convergence between dog 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and putative positively selected genes 
(PSGs). Forty putative PSGs were DEGs in glutamatergic neurons, especially in 
Cluster 14, which is related to the regulation of nervous system development. In 
summary, this study provides a blueprint to understand the cellular mechanism of 
dog domestication."
1081,"BACKGROUND: About 5 to 10 percent of the population in developed countries are 
affected by autoimmune diseases. One of the most important autoimmune disease 
with high prevalence rate is Multiple sclerosis in which there is currently no 
definitive cure for it, and most medications such as interferons are used only 
to limit the disease. The present study aims to investigate the effect of using 
Asparagus Officinalis fractions in an immune system mediated model of multiple 
sclerosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fractionation was performed by maceration using n-hexane, 
chloroform, chloroform-methanol (9: 1), n-Butanol and methanol solvents from 
aerial parts of Asparagus Officinalis. Thin layer chromatography, NMR and 
phenolic component measurement were done and two fractions were selected for 
checking in MS induced in vivo model.
RESULTS: It was observed that chloroform-methanolic and N-Butanol fractions had 
higher content of saponin in comparison of other extracts. Also, it was showed 
that the methanolic and n-Butanol extracts contains the highestportion of 
glycosylic steroid saponins in comparison to other fractions. Regarding 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) score, Butanolic and methanolic 
fractions with doses higher that 100mg/kg showed a potent supportive effects as 
long as locomotor activity protection even in lower dose in comparison to 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) group.
CONCLUSION: Considering the proved different effects of saponin compounds on the 
immune system we observed that those fractions altered the circulatory 
peripheral blood cells and also remit the clinical signs after EAE induction 
along with enhanced myelin sheath content in the median region of corpus 
callusom. It could be inferred that this fractions are promising candidates for 
further investigation as dose-dependent immune system regulating compounds in 
multiple sclerosis patients."
1082,"TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) is a ubiquitous environmental 
toxicant and a notable teratogenic agent for cleft palate (CP), a common 
congenital structural malformation that can result from abnormalities during 
palatal shelf connection and/or fusion. The development of the palate requires 
precise coordination between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. Exosomes are 
vesicles secreted by cells and participate in organ development by transferring 
various bioactive molecules between cells and regulating cell proliferation, 
migration, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); these 
vesicles represent a new method of intercellular communication. To explore how 
TCDD could influence palatal cell behaviors and communication, we treated 
mesenchymal cells with TCDD, collected the exosomes secreted by the cells, 
assessed the 2 types of palatal cells, and then observed the effects of 
TCDD-induced exosomes. We found that the effects of TCDD-induced exosomes were 
equal to those of TCDD. Thus, TCDD might change the genetic materials of palatal 
cells and exosomes to cause dysregulated gene expression from parental cells, 
affect cellular information communicators, and induce abnormal cellular 
behaviors that could lead to CP."
1083,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary fibrosis is considered to be an irreversible lung injury, 
which can be caused by paraquat (PQ) poisoning. MiRNAs have been demonstrated 
crucial roles in pulmonary fibrosis caused by numerous approaches including PQ 
induction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and the 
underlying mechanism of miR-215 in PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
METHODS: The cell and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis were established 
through PQ intervention. Cell viability was performed to test by MTT assay. 
Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect COL1A1 expression and its location. 
The relationships among E2F1, miR-215-5p, and BMPR2 were validated by dual 
luciferase reporter gene assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA-binding 
protein immunoprecipitation. Lung morphology was evaluated by hematoxylin and 
eosin staining.
RESULTS: MiR-215-5p was upregulated in PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vitro 
and in vivo. MiR-215-5p silencing relieved PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis 
progression by enhancing cell viability and reducing the expression of 
fibrosis-related markers (COL1A1, COL3A1, and α-SMA). Mechanistically, 
miR-215-5p directly targeted BMRP2. BMPR2 knockdown abolished the suppressive 
effects of miR-215-5p knockdown on PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, 
E2F1 interacted with miR-215-5p promoter and positively regulated miR-215-5p 
expression. E2F1 downregulation reduced miR-215-5p level and promoted BMPR2 
level via regulating TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, and then suppressed PQ-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis, whereas these effects were compromised by miR-215-5p 
sufficiency.
CONCLUSION: MiR-215-5p was activated by E2F1 to repress BMPR2 expression and 
activate TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, which aggravated PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis 
progression. Targeting the E2F1/miR-215-5p/BMPR2 axis might be a new approach to 
alleviate PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis."
1084,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to nanoparticles became inevitable in our daily life due to 
their huge industrial uses. Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) are one of the 
most frequently utilized metal nanoparticles in numerous applications. Crocin 
(CRO) is a major active constituent in saffron having anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant potentials.
OBJECTIVES: We designed this study to explore the probable defensive role of CRO 
against CuONPs-induced rat hepatic damage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Therefore, 24 adult rats were randomly distributed into 4 
equal groups as negative control, CRO, CuONPs, and co-treated CuONPs with CRO 
groups. All treatments were administered for 14 days. The hepatotoxic effect of 
CuONPs was evaluated by estimation of hepatic alanine aminotransferase and 
aspartate aminotransferase enzymes, hepatic oxidative malondialdehyde and 
antioxidant glutathione reduced, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers (tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1-beta, and nuclear factor kappa B), and 
expression of the apoptotic BAX in hepatic tissues; in addition, 
histopathological examination of the hepatic tissues was conducted.
RESULTS: We found that concurrent CRO supplement to CuONPs-treated rats 
significantly averted functional and structural rat hepatic damage as documented 
by decreased hepatic enzymes activities, restored hepatic oxidant/antioxidant 
balance, decreased serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers, reversed 
BAX-mediated apoptotic cell death in hepatic tissues along with repair of 
CuONPs-induced massive hepatic structural and ultrastructural alterations.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that combined CRO supplement to CuONPs-treated rats 
improved hepatic function and structure by, at least in part, antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic mechanisms."
1085,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common malignant subtype of lung cancer 
with high mortality. Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural molecule that regulates 
mitochondrial metabolism. Here, we explored the effect of RSV on NSCLC cell 
mitophagy and paclitaxel (PTX) resistance. LncRNA ZFAS1, miR-150-5p, and 
PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) expressions in NSCLC cells were analyzed 
by RT-qPCR. Levels of PINK1, Parkin and autophagy related molecules LC3I and 
LC3II were assessed by western blot. Mitophagy was demonstrated by transmission 
electron microscopy. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-150-5p directly 
interacted with ZFAS1 or PINK1. MTT was performed to test the IC50 of NSCLC 
cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured with CCK-8, EdU, and TUNEL 
assays. A549/PTX cells exhibited a higher mitophagy activity, and 
chemoresistance, whereas RSV suppressed PTX resistance and mitophagy in NSCLC 
cells. Furthermore, ZFAS1 was found to be a downstream effector of RSV in NSCLC 
cells. We next found ZFAS1 directly interacted with miR-150-5p and regulated the 
expression of a key mitophagy regulator PINK1. In addition, RSV modulated PTX 
resistance and mitophagy in NSCLC via ZFAS1/miR-150-5p/PINK1 axis. We validate 
that RSV influences mitophagy and PTX resistance in NSCLC via ZFAS1/miR-150-5p 
mediated PINK1/Parkin pathway. Combining these 2 drugs may be a new option of 
NSCLC therapy."
1086,"Background: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the 
treatment protocols are continuously updated, based on the evidence gathered all 
around the world and reported to the World Health Organization. Like many other 
emerging infectious diseases, using convalescent plasma from those recovered 
from the disease was a preliminary treatment approach that showed partial 
effectiveness for severe COVID-19 patients. Besides, blood filtration 
strategies, such as hemoperfusion and plasmapheresis, are employed to lessen the 
load of inflammatory molecules. However, few studies compared their effects to 
conclude which treatment might be more efficacious for COVID-19 patients. We 
compared the effects of plasmapheresis or plasma exchange, convalescent plasma 
therapy, and hemoperfusion on O2 saturation and inflammatory factors in COVID-19 
patients. Methods: In this retrospective study, 50 COVID-19 patients received 
standard treatments based the international guidelines. Patients were divided 
into 4 groups: hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, plasma therapy, and control. The 
control group received only the standard treatments. The mortality rate, O2 
saturation, and laboratory factors were compared between the 4 groups. Results: 
We found a significant decrease in the C-reactive protein level following 
hemoperfusion (32.75 ± 23.76 vs 13 ± 7.54 mg/dL; p = 0.032) but not 
plasmapheresis and plasma therapy. Besides, serum levels of lactate 
dehydrogenase (p = 0.327, 0.136, 0.550, for hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and 
plasma therapy, respectively) and other inflammatory molecules did not 
significantly change following treatments. There is also no significant 
difference in the mortality rate between the treatment groups (p = 0.353). 
Conclusion: It seems that hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and plasma therapy did 
not have considerable effects on decreasing the inflammation and mortality rate 
compared with standard treatment."

1088,"Objective: Worldwide, preeclampsia (PE) is a multifactorial disorder reported in 
2-5% of pregnancies, which increases mortality during pregnancy. In general, 
10-15% of maternal deaths are directly related to PE and eclampsia. One of the 
susceptibility genes for PE is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expressed by most 
immune cells. TNF-α is a protein involved in various biological processes, 
including proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the expression of inflammatory 
genes. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of TNF-α single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -308G/A (rs1800629) and their relationship with 
TNF-α in PE patients. Materials and methods: The SNP was genotyped in 90 cases 
and 90 controls. Whole blood was collected from women with PE and normal 
pregnancy in EDTA containing tubes, and DNA extraction was performed from their 
blood lymphocytes according to a standard phenol-chloroform procedure. Then, DNA 
was genotyped by real-time PCR and the polymorphism was detected by TaqMan 
assay. Serum levels of TNF-α protein were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent (ELISA) assay. Results: TNF-α levels in women with PE were 
significantly higher than in healthy ones (p<0.001). We did not observe any 
correlation between allelic outbreak (p=0.3) and TNF-α-308G/A polymorphism 
(p=0.7) with the incidence of PE. Conclusion: Although TNF-α-308G/A gene 
polymorphism does not appear to affect susceptibility to PE, an increased level 
of serum TNF-α can be used as a predictor for PE during pregnancy. We recommend 
that more research be conducted on possible factors related to the incidence of 
PE."

1093,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of maternal body mass index (BMI) on the 
morphokinetics of embryo development as monitored by a time-lapse system.
DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles from 
September 2016 to January 2019.
SETTING: Academic IVF practice.
PATIENTS: Patients <age 38 years undergoing IVF with their own gametes.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was to compare embryo division 
timings between morbidly obese, obese, overweight, and normal-weight patients. A 
multilevel mixed effects model was performed to investigate the relationships 
between BMI categories and embryo division timings. Log or square transformation 
were used to improve fit.
RESULTS: A total of 366 patients met inclusion criteria, yielding 4,475 embryos: 
1,948 embryos from 162 normal-weight women (BMI 18.5-24.9), 1,242 embryos from 
96 overweight women (BMI 25.0-29.9), 1,119 embryos from 91 obese women (BMI 
30.0-39.9), and 166 embryos from 17 morbidly obese women (BMI ≥40). There were 
no differences in age, Antimüllerian hormone, or IVF cycle outcomes among the 
different BMI categories. When comparing embryo division timings based on BMI, 
controlling for covariates, embryos from obese patients had a shorter time to 
division to 2 cell embryo (T2) than normal-weight patients. When analyzing BMI 
as a continuous variable, there was no significant relationship between BMI and 
embryo division timing.
CONCLUSIONS: Early embryo divisions were accelerated in only certain categories 
of obesity. This suggests a more complex mechanism for the effect of obesity on 
embryo development that may not be perceptible through the assessment of cell 
division timing events."
1094,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of crash and associated factors among 
commercial motorcyclists in Owo, Ondo State, Nigeria.
METHODS: This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data was collected 
by using pre-tested structured questionnaires administered to commercial 
motorcyclists. Collected information was socio-demographic characteristics of 
the respondents, riding experience, formal training, possession of valid 
drivers' licence, motorcycle ownership status, mobile phone usage, history of 
crash in the previous one year, riding hours per day, helmet use, carrying more 
than one passenger, riding against traffic and daily income.
RESULTS: The study were enrolled 502 individuals with a mean age of 31.5±8.7. 
The ratio of men to women was 250:1. All respondents who admitted to engage in 
the study had at least one risky behaviour in the past (95.4% admitted to 
transporting one passenger more than the legal) and 56.6% admit to a prior 
history of traffic offences. The crashes' predictive factors include respondent 
age, cell phone use while riding, prior traffic offences, carrying more than one 
pillion rider, use of stimulants such as kolanut and bitter kola, alcohol drink 
riding, and admission of fault in the prior of crashes.
CONCLUSION: Commercial motorcyclists in Owo, Ondo State Nigeria engaged in risky 
behaviours that raised their likelihood of being involved in crashes. The 
objectives of public enlightenment and driver education at these behaviours 
could help to reduce the occurrence of crashes among them."
1095,"BACKGROUND: Skin wound healing depends on the progress of different but 
overlapping stages of healing, including hemostasis, inflammatory, proliferative 
and remodeling. Failure of these stages to occur in a timely and gradual manner 
may result in non-healing pathological wounds. Macrophages and neutrophils have 
been shown to play an essential role in the inflammatory responses of wound 
tissue, and their active plasticity allows them to modulate tissue damage and 
repair functions. The ability of macrophages and neutrophils to regulate the 
occurrence and resolution of inflammatory processes is essential for the 
treatment of pathological wound healing.
METHODS: Mice were categorized into negative control, streptozotocin, 
streptozotocin + puerarin and puerarin groups. The traditional Chinese medicine 
extract puerarin was selected to treat different groups of mice with a 
full-thickness skin defect wound. Cells of the RAW264.7 cell line were 
stimulated under different puerarin conditions. Then, real time quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blot, immunofluorescence and other 
assays were carried out to explore the effect of puerarin on wound healing and 
its molecular mechanism.
RESULTS: Animal experiments found that the wound healing of diabetic mice 
treated with puerarin was significantly accelerated, and histological analysis 
found that puerarin treatment markedly decreased the infiltration of macrophages 
and neutrophils in wound tissue. Through western blot, RT-qPCR and 
immunofluorescence experiments, it was observed that puerarin treatment 
remarkably inhibited nuclear factor kinase B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, downregulated the expression of 
inflammatory cytokines and induced the M2 polarization of macrophages. At the 
cellular level, we also observed that puerarin improved M2 macrophage 
polarization and inhibited inflammatory pathway activation in a high-glucose 
culture.
CONCLUSION: Puerarin has a significant therapeutic effect on wound healing in 
diabetic mice. The therapeutic effect is achieved by regulating macrophage 
polarization through suppressing NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades."
1096,"BACKGROUND: Oral administration of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid®) 
has shown promise in the treatment of COVID-19. Paxlovid's active antiviral 
component nirmatrelvir is co-formulated with ritonavir, a strong cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 3A4 inhibitor. Many oral targeted therapies indicated for lung cancer are 
known substrates of CYP 3A4 and concurrent use with Paxlovid may lead to 
potential drug-drug interactions (DDI). The purpose of this review is to 
evaluate the potential DDI between targeted therapies and supportive care for 
lung cancer and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir.
METHODS: A PubMed and FDA drug database search was conducted to identify 
pharmacokinetic data on oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) used in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both FDA approved and those in development. Metabolism 
pathways for various TKI are extracted, as well as the impact of TKI area under 
the curves and maximum concentration by strong CYP 3A4 inducers and inhibitors 
are summarized. The most common toxicities and supportive care medications for 
the TKI were identified.
RESULTS: Among EGFR inhibitors and exon-20 insertion inhibitors, afatinib is 
least likely to be affected by CYP 3A4, followed by dacomitinib and osimertinib. 
Among ALK inhibitors, alectinib is the least susceptible to CYP 3A4. ROS1 
inhibitors are affected by CYP 3A4 inhibition with the exception of criztonib. 
Among MET inhibitors, capmatinib is substantially affected by CYP 3A4 
inhibition. Drug exposure of RET inhibitors is expected to increase with CYP 3A4 
inhibition, with selpercatinib being the least affected. Certain supportive care 
medications for lung cancer TKI may have significant DDI.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical impact of the DDI between lung cancer TKI and 
ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir vary largely based on the susceptibility of CYP 
3A4 inhibition caused by the antiviral. Close monitoring and medication 
adjustments (i.e., dose changes or alternative COVD-19 therapy) can be employed 
to overcome DDI to ensure patient safety."

limited stability of allicin restricts its applications in tissue engineering. 
Additionally, the detailed effects of allicin in bone health are yet to be 
explored. Our work reports on the fabrication of a novel allicin-loaded 
hydroxyapatite drug delivery system with enhanced biological properties. The 
fabricated system shows excellent antibacterial efficiency against S. aureus 
after 36 h of bacterial interaction with a sample. The allicin release kinetics 
are enhanced with polycaprolactone (PCL). The obtained results after 20 days of 
drug release study indicate that PCL coating leads to an increase in cumulative 
allicin release from ~ 35% to 70% at a physiological pH of 7.4. These scaffolds 
maintain stability during the whole period of drug release. Cytocompatibility of 
tested compositions with osteoblasts indicates enhanced cell viability and good 
filopodial attachment on the sample surface at day 7. These allicin-loaded 
antibacterial and cytocompatible scaffolds can find applications as localized 
delivery vehicles for bone tissue engineering."
1098,"To investigate the impact of mono- and di-β-galactose moieties in tumor uptake 
and photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy, HPPH 
[3-(1'-hexyloxy)ethyl-3-devinylpyropheophorobide-a], the meso pyropheophorbide-a 
[3-ethyl-3-devinyl-pyropheophorbide-a], and the corresponding 20-benzoic acid 
analogs were used as starting materials. Reaction of the intermediates 
containing one or two carboxylic acid functionalities with 1-aminogalactose 
afforded the desired 172- or 20(4')- mono- and 172, 20(4')-di galactose 
conjugated photosensitizers (PSs) with and without a carboxylic acid group. The 
overall lipophilicity caused by the presence of galactose in combination with 
either an ethyl or (1'-hexyloxy)ethyl side chain at position-3 of the macrocycle 
made a significant difference in in vitro uptake by tumor cells and 
photoreaction upon light exposure. Interestingly, among the PSs investigated, 
compared to HPPH 1 the carbohydrate conjugates 2 and 11 in which β-galactose 
moieties are conjugated at positions 172 and 20(4') of meso-pyro pheophorbide-a 
showed similar in vitro efficacy in FaDu cell lines, but in SCID mice bearing 
FaDu tumors (head & neck) Ps 11 gave significantly improved long-term tumor 
cure."
1099,"OBJECTIVE: Venous thromboembolism is a disease that encompasses both deep vein 
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Recent investigations have shown that 
receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), a protein known for its role in 
the programmed form of cell death necroptosis, may play a role in thrombosis. 
Specifically, RIPK3 has been shown to promote platelet activation in arterial 
thrombosis and mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), a protein 
downstream of RIPK3 in the necroptosis pathway, has been shown to promote 
neutrophil extracellular trap formation in deep vein thrombosis. This 
investigation sought to comprehensively investigate the role of RIPK3 in deep 
vein thrombogenesis.
METHODS: The inferior vena cava ligation and stenosis models of deep vein 
thrombosis were used in C57BL/6J, RIPK3 wild-type (Ripk3 +/+ ) and 
RIPK3-deficient (Ripk3 -/- ) mice. Downstream tissue analyses included 
measurement of thrombus weight and histological and Western blot analysis of 
tissues for markers of necroptosis and cell death. A subset of C57BL/6J mice 
were treated with a RIPK3 inhibitor to determine the effect on venous 
thrombosis.
RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice showed significant increases in thrombus weight from 6 to 
48 hours. During the same time frame, RIPK3 progressively accumulated in the 
vein wall (a 35-fold increase from 0 to 48 hours). RIPK3 was present in the 
thrombus; however, it decreased with time. Although present in the thrombus, 
MLKL was nearly undetectable in the vein wall by Western blot at any timepoint. 
Immunostaining confirmed the high accumulation of RIPK3 in the vein wall, 
primarily colocalized to endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Phosphorylated 
MLKL, the active form of MLKL and executioner of necroptotic cell death, was 
detectable by immunostaining in the thrombus, but was present at low to 
undetectable levels in the vein wall. Propidium iodide and terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining revealed a high 
burden of necrotic and apoptotic cells within the thrombus at 48 hours, but a 
relatively lower burden within the vein wall. Despite robust accumulation of 
RIPK3 within the vessel wall and the thrombus, knockout and inhibition of RIPK3 
failed to impact thrombus incident or weight at 48 hours after inferior vena 
cava ligation. Neutrophil extracellular trap burden did not differ between Ripk3 
+/+ and Ripk3 -/- mice.
CONCLUSIONS: In mice, the vein wall responded to deep vein thrombosis induction 
with elevation of RIPK3 without showing markers of necroptosis and apoptosis. 
Studies using genetic or pharmacological inhibition of RIPK3 suggest that this 
cell death mediator may not have a major role in the acute phase of venous 
thrombogenesis. Further investigation is needed to determine if RIPK3 plays a 
potentially non-necroptotic role within the vein wall during later stages of 
thrombus resolution and vein wall remodeling."

1101,"The glutamine transporter ASCT2 is highly overexpressed in cancer cells. Block 
of glutamine uptake by ASCT2 is a potential strategy to inhibit growth of cancer 
cells. However, pharmacology of the ASCT2 binding site is not well established. 
In this work, we report the computational docking to the binding site, and the 
synthesis of a new class of ASCT2 inhibitors based on the novel 
L-hydroxyhomoserine scaffold. While these compounds inhibit the ASCT2 leak anion 
conductance, as expected for competitive inhibitors, they did not block leak 
conductance in glutamate transporters (EAAT1-3 and EAAT5). They were also 
ineffective with respect to subtype ASCT1, which has >57% amino acid sequence 
similarity to ASCT2. Molecular docking studies agree very well with the 
experimental results and suggest specific polar interactions in the ASCT2 
binding site. Our findings add to the repertoire of ASCT2 inhibitors and will 
aid in further studies of ASCT2 pharmacology."
1102,"BACKGROUND: High-grade gliomas (HGG) with BRAFV600E mutation represent a unique 
subset of central nervous system tumors. Targeted therapies including BRAF and 
MEK inhibitors are now being explored as possible new treatment options.
METHODS: We report an 18-year-old female with a grade 3 pleomorphic 
xanthoastrocytoma treated upfront with dabrafenib and trametinib. We also 
conducted a systematic literature review of patients with HGG and BRAFV600E 
mutations treated with BRAF inhibitors.
RESULTS: Despite local recurrences resected surgically, the patient has been on 
dabrafenib and trametinib for more than 54 months. Thirty-two patients with HGG 
and BRAFV600E mutations treated with BRAF inhibitors were retrieved through our 
systematic review of the literature. Only 1 young patient with an anaplastic 
ganglioglioma was treated upfront with a BRAF inhibitor with a curative intent. 
Best response reported with radiation therapy and systemic therapy was a stable 
disease (SD) for 18 patients (56.3%) and progressive disease (PD) for 9 patients 
(28.1%). Responses to treatment regimens that included BRAF inhibitors were 
reported in 31 patients and included 4 complete responses (12.9%), 23 partial 
responses (74.2%), 2 SDs (6.5%), and 2 PDs (6.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our patient had durable disease control with dabrafenib and 
trametinib. Given favorable responses reported in patients with HGG treated with 
BRAF inhibitors, we believe that upfront targeted therapy is a possible 
treatment approach that should be studied in the context of a clinical trial."
1103,"Cancer patients often want information from ""peers"" with the same diagnosis or

potential harms of written peer support, we gathered multiple forms of 
stakeholder feedback to inform the website's ethical approach, personalization, 
design, function, and content: a Community Advisory Board; a longitudinal study 
of patients' written peer support needs and motivations; focus groups; 
semi-structured interviews; and usability testing. Findings provide a rich 
foundation for website development."
1104,"Bone pain typically occurs immediately following skeletal damage with mechanical 
distortion or rupture of nociceptive fibres. The pain mechanism is also 
associated with chronic pain conditions where the healing process is impaired. 
Any load impacting on the area of the fractured bone will stimulate the 
nociceptive response, necessitating rapid clinical intervention to relieve pain 
associated with the bone damage and appropriate mitigation of any processes 
involved with the loss of bone mass, muscle, and mobility and to prevent death. 
The following review has examined the mechanisms of pain associated with trauma 
or cancer-related skeletal damage focusing on new approaches for the development 
of innovative therapeutic interventions. In particular, the review highlights 
tissue engineering approaches that offer considerable promise in the application 
of functional biomimetic fabrication of bone and nerve tissues. The strategic 
combination of bone and nerve tissue engineered models provides significant 
potential to develop a new class of in vitro platforms, capable of replacing in 
vivo models and testing the safety and efficacy of novel drug treatments aimed 
at the resolution of bone-associated pain. To date, the field of bone pain 
research has centred on animal models, with a paucity of data correlating to the 
human physiological response. This review explores the evident gap in pain drug 
development research and suggests a step change in approach to harness tissue 
engineering technologies to recapitulate the complex pathophysiological 
environment of the damaged bone tissue enabling evaluation of the associated 
pain-mimicking mechanism with significant therapeutic potential therein for 
improved patient quality of life.
GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: Rationale underlying novel drug testing platform 
development. Pain detected by the central nervous system and following bone 
fracture cannot be treated or exclusively alleviated using standardised methods. 
The pain mechanism and specificity/efficacy of pain reduction drugs remain 
poorly understood. In vivo and ex vivo models are not yet able to recapitulate 
the various pain events associated with skeletal damage. In vitro models are 
currently limited by their inability to fully mimic the complex physiological 
mechanisms at play between nervous and skeletal tissue and any disruption in 
pathological states. Robust innovative tissue engineering models are needed to 
better understand pain events and to investigate therapeutic regimes."
1105,"Bone health is determined by factors including bone metabolism or remodeling. 
Wnt-10b alters osteoblastogenesis through pre-osteoblast proliferation and 
differentiation and osteoblast apoptosis rate, which collectively lead to the 
increase of bone density. To model this, we adapted a previously published model 
of bone remodeling. The resulting model for the bone compartment includes 
differential equations for active osteoclasts, pre-osteoblasts, osteoblasts, 
osteocytes, and the amount of bone present at the remodeling site. Our 
alterations to the original model consist of extending it past a single 
remodeling cycle and implementing a direct relationship to Wnt-10b. Four new 
parameters were estimated and validated using normalized data from mice. The 
model connects Wnt-10b to bone metabolism and predicts the change in trabecular 
bone volume caused by a change in Wnt-10b input. We find that this model 
predicts the expected increase in pre-osteoblasts and osteoblasts while also 
pointing to a decrease in osteoclasts when Wnt-10b is increased."
1106,"The myocardium is a mechanically active tissue typified by anisotropy of the 
resident cells [cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts (cFBs)] and the 
extracellular matrix (ECM). Upon ischemic injury, the anisotropic tissue is 
replaced by disorganized scar tissue, resulting in loss of coordinated 
contraction. Efforts to re-establish tissue anisotropy in the injured myocardium 
are hampered by a lack of understanding of how CM and/or cFB structural 
organization is affected by the two major physical cues inherent in the 
myocardium: ECM organization and cyclic mechanical strain. Herein, we 
investigate the singular and combined effect of ECM (dis)organization and cyclic 
strain in a two-dimensional human in vitro co-culture model of the myocardial 
microenvironment. We show that (an)isotropic ECM protein patterning can guide 
the orientation of CMs and cFBs, both in mono- and co-culture. Subsequent 
application of uniaxial cyclic strain-mimicking the local anisotropic 
deformation of beating myocardium-causes no effect when applied parallel to the 
anisotropic ECM. However, when cultured on isotropic substrates, cFBs, but not 
CMs, orient away from the direction of cyclic uniaxial strain (strain 
avoidance). In contrast, CMs show strain avoidance via active remodeling of 
their sarcomeres only when co-cultured with at least 30% cFBs. Paracrine 
signaling or N-cadherin-mediated communication between CMs and cFBs was no 
contributing factor. Our findings suggest that the mechanoresponsive cFBs 
provide structural guidance for CM orientation and elongation. Our study, 
therefore, highlights a synergistic mechanobiological interplay between CMs and 
cFBs in shaping tissue organization, which is of relevance for regenerating 
functionally organized myocardium."
1107,"Living cells have become ideal therapeutic agents for cancer treatment owing to 
their innate activities, such as efficient tumor targeting and delivery, easy 
engineering, immunomodulatory properties, and fewer adverse effects. However, 
cell agents are often fragile to rigorous tumor microenvironment (TME) and 
limited by inadequate therapeutic responses, leading to unwanted treatment 
efficacy. Cell nanomodification, particularly the cell surface-nanoengineering 
has emerged as reliable and efficient strategy that not only combines cell 
activity properties with nanomaterials but also endows them with extra novel 
functions, enabling to achieve remarkable treatment results. In this review, we 
systematically introduce two major strategies have been adopted to develop cell 
surface engineering with nanomaterials, mainly including living cell 
nano-backpacks and cell membrane-mimicking nanoparticles (NPs). Based on various 
functional NPs and cell types, we focus on reviewing the cell-surface 
nanoengineering for targeted drug delivery, immune microenvironment regulation, 
and precisely antitumor therapy. The advances and challenges of cell 
surface-nanoengineered antitumor agents for cancer therapy applications are 
further discussed in future clinical practice. This review provides an overview 
of the advances in cell surface-engineering for targeting immunoregulation and 
treatment and could contribute to the future of advanced cell-based antitumor

1108,"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver injury (ALI) causes hepatocyte 
cell death, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Oridonin (Ori), a covalent 
NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitor, ameliorates APAP-induced ALI through an unclear 
molecular mechanism. This study found that Ori decreased hepatic cytochrome P450 
2E1 level and increased glutathione content to prevent APAP metabolism, and then 
reduced the necrotic area, improved liver function, and inhibited APAP-induced 
proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Ori also decreased activating 
transcription factor 4 (ATF4) protein levels and increased peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) to reduce APAP-induced 
endoplasmic reticulum stress activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. 
Furthermore, western blot and luciferase assay found that ATF4 inhibited 
transcription in the PGC-1α promoter -507 to -495 region to reduce PGC-1α 
levels, while ATF4 knockdown neutralized the hepatoprotective effect of Ori. 
Molecular docking showed that Ori bound to ATF4's amino acid residue glutamate 
302 through 6, 7, and 18 hydroxyl bands. Our findings demonstrated that Ori 
prevented metabolic activation of APAP and further inhibited the ATF4/PGC-1α 
pathway to alleviate APAP overdose-induced hepatic toxicity, which illuminated 
its potential therapeutic effects on ALI."
1109,"INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of rare forms of α-thalassemia requires laborious 
genetic analyses. Accurate sample selection for such evaluation is therefore 
essential. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the predictive 
power of red blood cell parameters to detect rare forms of α-thalassemia 
(substudy 1), and to explore the frequency of rare versus common forms of 
α-thalassemia in our sample population (substudy 2).
METHODS: In substudy 1, we reviewed all blood samples selected for extended 
α-hemoglobinopathy evaluation at our laboratory during 2011-2020 (n = 1217), 
which included DNA sequencing and/or copy number variation analysis. We assessed 
α-thalassemia positive samples at different levels of mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin (MCH) alone and in combination with results for red blood cell count 
(RBC) or red cell distribution width (RDW). In substudy 2, we examined the 
distribution of α-thalassemia genotypes for all samples submitted to a 
first-tier hemoglobinopathy evaluation at our laboratory during 2014-2020 
(n = 6495).
RESULTS: In substudy 1, both RBC and RDW added predictive value in detecting 
rare forms of α-thalassemia in samples from adults and children. In adult 
samples with MCH ≤ 23 pg, the presence of erythrocytosis increased the detection 
rate from 27% to 74% as compared to non-erythrocytosis, while normal RDW 
increased the detection rate from 36% to 86% as compared to elevated RDW. In 
substudy 2, rare forms of α-thalassemia were detected in 12% of α-thalassemia 
positive samples.
CONCLUSION: Initial assessment of MCH, RBC, and RDW provided valuable predictive 
information about the presence of rare forms of α-thalassemia during 
hemoglobinopathy evaluation."
1110,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most common 
malignancy in the Caucasian population. A minority of cases are inoperable at 
presentation, recur or develop metastatic disease with a historical 5-year 
overall survival of ~10%. Treatment options in this setting are generally 
palliative. Immunotherapy has emerged as a new paradigm in managing these 
patients.
METHODS: Patients presenting to Sydney West Cancer Network with locally advanced 
or metastatic CSCC treated with the anti-PD1 agent cemiplimab were identified. 
Response to treatment was objectively assessed based on RECIST1.1 or PERCIST 
criteria. Primary end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end 
points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), therapy 
toxicity, and predictors of treatment response.
RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified with a median age of 76 (range 
56-94) and 4 immunosuppressed. The longest follow up duration was 28 months. 
ORR, complete response (CR), and partial response (PR) were 68% (13/19), 53% 
(10/19), and 16% (3/19), respectively. Median PFS was 12 months (95% CI 9-14) 
whilst median OS was not reached by end of study. Responders (CR or PR) had 
significantly superior OS compared to those with no response (P < 0.01). A 
primary site of head and neck cancer was significantly associated with ORR 
(P = 0.04). A single patient experienced Grade 3 toxicity with the rest being 
Grades 0-1.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the clinical efficacy of cemiplimab in patients 
with advanced CSCC with many experiencing a durable response and an acceptable 
adverse effect profile."
1111,"BACKGROUND: Horses with non-strangulating intestinal infarction (NSII) are often 
misdiagnosed with idiopathic peritonitis or acute colitis. Early diagnosis is 
essential to ensure early surgical intervention and improve survival.
METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from horses admitted to the University of 
Copenhagen Large Animal Teaching Hospital with NSII, idiopathic peritonitis or 
acute colitis between 2009 and 2018 were used for univariate comparisons and a 
multivariable logistic regression model for prediction of NSII.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-one horses were included. A multivariable model 
for the prediction of NSII included gastric reflux (more than 5 L) (odds ratio 
[OR] 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-36.2), abnormal findings palpated per 
rectum (intestinal dilatations/impactions [OR 4.43; 95% CI 1.43-13.38], colon 
displacements [OR 23.16; 95% CI 5.26-101.97] or intestinal mass [OR 179.7; 95% 
CI 23.5-1375.5]), white blood cell count (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.1-1.4), packed cell 
volume (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-0.9), age (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.0) and heart rate (OR 
1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.1). The model had a low false positive rate (5%), but a high 
false negative rate (50%).
LIMITATIONS: Due to the retrospective nature of the study, sample collection was 
inconsistent, resulting in missing values.
CONCLUSION: The model had some capability in predicting NSII. However, the high 
risk of false negatives means that exploratory laparotomy should be considered 
in horses with peritonitis of unknown aetiology in areas where Strongylus 
vulgaris is prevalent and occurrence of idiopathic peritonitis is low."
1112,"PURPOSE: Delirium presents a significant healthcare burden. It complicates 
post-operative care in up to 50% of cardiac surgical patients with worse 
outcomes, longer hospital stays and higher cost of care. Moreover, the nature of 
delirium following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) remains 
unclear, the underlying pathobiology is poorly understood, status quo diagnostic 
methods are subjective, and diagnostic biomarkers are currently lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To identify diagnostic biomarkers of delirium and for insights into 
possible neuronal pathomechanisms.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Comparative proteomic analyses were performed on plasma 
samples from a nested matched cohort of patients who underwent cardiac surgery. 
Validation by targeted proteomics was performed in an independent set of 
samples. Biomarkers were assessed for biological functions and diagnostic 
accuracy.
RESULTS: 47% of subjects demonstrated delirium. Of 3803 proteins identified from 
patient samples by multiplexed quantitative proteomics, 16 were identified as 
signatures of exposure to CPB, and 11 biomarkers distinguished delirium cases 
from non-cases (AuROC = 93%). Notable among these biomarkers are C-reactive 
protein, serum amyloid A-1 and cathepsin-B.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The interplay of systemic and central 
inflammatory markers sheds new light on delirium pathogenesis. This work 
suggests that accurate identification of cases may be achievable using panels of 
biomarkers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1113,"Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitors have been clinically 
developed to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but their application is 
limited by the possibility of drug resistance, which is reportedly associated 
with the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Meanwhile, homoharringtonine 
(HHT), a classic antileukemia drug, possibly inhibits the WNT/β-catenin pathway. 
In this study, we attempted to combine a novel BRD4 inhibitor (ACC010) and HHT 
to explore their synergistic lethal effects in treating AML. Here, we found that 
co-treatment with ACC010 and HHT synergistically inhibited cell proliferation, 
induced apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 
3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-positive AML cells in vitro, and 
significantly inhibiting AML progression in vivo. Mechanistically, ACC010 and 
HHT cooperatively downregulated MYC and inhibited FLT3 activation. Further, when 
HHT was added, ACC010-resistant cells demonstrated a good synergy. We also 
extended our study to the mouse BaF3 cell line with FLT3-inhibitor-resistant 
FLT3-ITD/tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations and AML cells without FLT3-ITD. 
Collectively, our results suggested that the combination treatment of ACC010 and 
HHT might be a promising strategy for AML patients, especially those carrying 
FLT3-ITD."
1114,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are functional RNAs in the development and metabolism 
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therein, this paper particularly 
elucidated the circRNA SEC61 subunit alpha isoform 1 (circSEC61A1) in NSCLC has 
not been fully elucidated. Clinical analysis of circSEC61A1 expression was 
performed on specimens collected from 51 patients with primary NSCLC, together 
with patients' survival. Cell experiments were performed after interfering with 
circSEC61A1, microRNA (miR)-513a-5p, and peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (PEX5) 
expression, respectively, and cell malignant phenotypes and aerobic glycolysis 
were evaluated, as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related 
markers and Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Xenografts experiments studied the 
performance of circSEC61A1 in vivo. The downstream molecules of circSEC61A1 were 
searched. Our data demonstrated that circSEC61A1 was upregulated in NSCLC 
patients, showing an association with poorer survival outcomes. In cell 
experiments, circSEC61A1 overexpression promoted NSCLC malignant phenotypes, 
glycolysis, EMT, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, whereas circSEC61A1 
underexpression did the opposite. Knockdown of circSEC61A1 limited tumor growth 
and metastasis. Furthermore, circSEC61A1 could regulate PEX5 expression through 
competitive absorption of miR-513a-5p. Generally, circSEC61A1 is a potential 
biomarker for NSCLC, and circSEC61A1 serves tumor-promoting action in the 
progression of NSCLC."
1115,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke, the cause of death and disability worldwide, is 
closely related to oxidative stress damage. Chrysanthemum has profound 
antiantioxidant activity. We aimed to verify whether Chrysanthemum morifolium 
extract (CME) influences brain injury in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury 
(CR/RI) model.
METHODS: In vitro, rat hippocampal H19-7 neurons were pretreated with CME, CR/RI 
was simulated with oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). The cell 
viability, apoptosis, lactate dehydrogenase release, reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) generation, malonaldehyde (MDA) content and superoxide dismutase（SOD） 
activity were detected. In vivo, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model 
rats were pre-administered with CME, and then behavioral test, 
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE), terminal 
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL), ROS 
immunofluorescence, MDA and SOD activity were tested. Furthermore, Keap1/Nrf2 
signaling of CME in CI/RI was investigated.
RESULTS: In OGD/R induced in H19-7 cells, CME increased OGD/R-induced cell 
viability and reduced cell apoptosis, which was reversed by siNrf2 transfection 
. In MCAO rats, CME improved the neurological deficits and alleviated brain 
injury. However, co-treatment with MLK385 counteracted these neuroprotective 
effects of CME on MCAO rats.
CONCLUSION: CME could significantly reduce oxidative stress and nerve injury in 
vitro and in vivo models of CI/RI by regulating the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway."
1116,"Cancer is a major threat to human health today. Although the existing anticancer 
treatments have effectively improved the prognosis of some patients, there are 
still other patients who cannot benefit from these well-established strategies. 
Reprogramming of lipid metabolism is one of the typical features of cancers. 
Recent studies have revealed that key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism may 
be effective anticancer therapeutic targets, but the development of therapeutic 
lipid metabolism targets is still insufficient. ECHS1 (enoyl-CoA hydratase, 
short chain 1) is a key enzyme mediating the hydration process of mitochondrial 
fatty acid β-oxidation and has been observed to be abnormally expressed in a 
variety of cancers. Therefore, with ECHS1 and cancer as the main keywords, we 
searched the relevant studies of ECHS1 in the field of cancer in Pubmed, 
summarized the research status and functions of ECHS1 in different cancer 
contexts, and explored its potential regulatory mechanisms, with a view to 
finding new therapeutic targets for anti-metabolic therapy. By reviewing and 
summarizing the retrieved literatures, we found that ECHS1 regulates malignant 
biological behaviors such as cell proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, 
autophagy, and drug resistance by remodeling lipid metabolism and regulating 
intercellular oncogenic signaling pathways. Not only that, ECHS1 exhibits early 
diagnostic and prognostic value in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and 
small-molecule inhibitors that regulate ECHS1 also show therapeutic significance 
in preclinical studies. Taken together, we propose that ECHS1 has the potential 
to serve as a therapeutic target of lipid metabolism."

1129,"OBJECTIVE: To screen transcription factor genes related to the prognosis of 
adult patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with sepsis and ten healthy individuals admitted 
for RNA-seq. Differential factors were enriched by four transcription factor 
databases, and survival analysis was adopted for core factors. Then, target 
genes were submitted to STRING to constitute the PPI network. Single-cell 
technology was used to localize cell lines. Finally, a transcription-target gene 
regulation network was constituted.
RESULTS: A total of 4,224 DEGs were obtained between sepsis and NC groups. PPI 
results showed that FOXO3, NFKB1, SPI1, STAT5A, and PPARA were located in the 
center of the network. Target genes were related to cytokine-mediated signaling 
pathway and transcription regulator activity, etc. SPI1 was mainly located in 
monocyte cell lines, while FOXO3, PPARA, SP1, STAT3, and USF1 were expressed in 
monocyte cell lines, NK-T cell lines, and B cell lines. Compared with those in 
the control group, FOXO3, SP1, SPI1, STAT3, and USF1 were highly expressed in 
the sepsis group, while PPARA had low expression.
CONCLUSION: Transcription factors such as FOXO3, PPARA, SP1, SPI1, STAT3, and 
USF1 are correlated with the prognosis of sepsis patients and thus may have a 
potential research value.Clinical Trial Registration: The clinical trial 
registration number is ChiCTR1900021261."
1130,"The factor Q10 is used in neuroscience to adjust reaction rates of 
voltage-activated membrane conductances to different temperatures and is widely 
assumed to be constant. By performing an analysis of published data of the 
reaction rates of sodium, potassium, and calcium membrane conductances we 
demonstrate: 1) Q10 is temperature dependent; 2) this relationship is similar 
across conductances; and 3) there is a strong effect at low temperatures (< 15 
°C). We show that Macro-Molecular Rate Theory (MMRT) explains this temperature 
dependency. MMRT predicts the existence of optimal temperatures at which 
reaction rates decrease as temperature increases, a phenomenon that we also 
found in the published data sets. We tested the consequences of using MMRT 
adjusted reaction rates in the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the squid's giant axon. 
The MMRT adjusted model reproduces the temperature dependence of the rising and 
falling times of the action potential. Furthermore, the model also reproduces 
these properties for different squid species that live in different climates. In 
a second example, we compare spiking patterns of biophysical models based on 
human pyramidal neurons from the Allen Cell Types database at room and 
physiological temperatures. The original models, calibrated at 34 °C, failed to 
generate realistic spikes at room temperature in more than half of the tested 
models, while the MMRT produces realistic spiking in all conditions. In another 
example, we show that using the MMRT correction in hippocampal pyramidal cell 
models results in 100 % differences in voltage responses. Finally, we show that 
the shape of the Q10 function results in systematic errors in predicting 
reaction rates. We propose that the optimal temperature could be a 
thermodynamical barrier to avoid over excitation in neurons. While this study is 
centered in membrane conductances, our results have important consequences for 
all biochemical reactions involved in cell signaling."
1131,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated whether sublobar resection (sub-L) is 
non-inferior to lobectomy (L) for stage I (T1-T2aN0M0) small cell lung cancer 
(SCLC) regarding long-term overall survival (OS).
METHODS: Clinicopathological and prognostic data of patients with stage I 
(pT1-T2aN0M0) SCLC were retrieved. Kaplan-Meier curves and Breslow tests were 
performed for the assessment of OS. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was 
used to mediate the inherent bias of retrospective researches.
RESULTS: A total of 188 patients with stage I SCLC were included in this study 
after PSM. For resected stage I SCLC, surgery plus adjuvant therapy was related 
to a better OS compared with surgery only (p = 0.016). For resected stage I 
SCLC, no matter adjuvant therapy was performed or not, no significant difference 
was observed in long-term OS between the L and sub-L groups (p = 0.181). Further 
subgroup analysis demonstrated that the OS disadvantage of sub-L over L was not 
statistically significant for stage I SCLC patients underwent surgery only 
(p = 0.653), but also for the patients underwent surgery plus adjuvant therapy 
(p = 0.069). Moreover, in the subgroup analyses according to TNM stage (IA and 
IB), sex (male and female), and age (≥70 and <70 years), OS did not differ 
between the L and sub-L groups except in female patients (p = 0.008). 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that adjuvant therapy was 
positively associated with OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery plus adjuvant therapy confers a better survival benefit 
than surgery only for stage I SCLC patients. However, as far as the range of 
surgical resection is concerned, sublobar resection may be non-inferior to 
lobectomy regarding OS. Our study could conduce to the development of optimal 
therapeutic strategies for stage I SCLC patients. Further validation is 
warranted in larger retrospective and prospective cohort studies."
1132,"Vaccination and natural infection both elicit potent humoral responses that 
provide protection from subsequent infections. The immune-history of an 
individual following such exposures is in part encoded by antibodies. While 
there are multiple immunoassays for measuring antibody responses, the majority 
of these methods measure responses to a single antigen. A commonly used method 
for measuring antibody responses is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) - a semi-quantitative assay that is simple to perform in research and 
clinical settings. Here, we present FLU-LISA (fluorescence-linked immunosorbent 
assay) - a novel antigen microarray based assay for rapid high-throughput 
antibody profiling. The assay can be used for profiling IgG, IgA and IgM 
responses to multiple antigens simultaneously, requiring minimal amounts of 
sample and antigens. Using several influenza and SARS-CoV-2 antigen microarrays, 
we demonstrated the specificity and sensitivity of our novel assay and compared 
it to the traditional ELISA, using samples from mice, chickens and humans. We 
also showed that our assay can be readily used with dried blood spots, which can 
be collected from humans and wild birds. The FLU-LISA can be readily used to 
profile hundreds of samples against dozens of antigens in a single day, and 
therefore offers an attractive alternative to the traditional ELISA."
1133,"Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have poor prognoses and low overall 
survival (OS) rates owing to its heterogeneity and the complexity of its tumour 
microenvironment (TME). N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a key role 
in the initiation and progression of haematopoietic malignancies. However, the 
underlying function of m6A regulators in AML remains elusive. This study 
thoroughly analysed the m6A modification features of 177 AML patients based on 
22 m6A regulators. Utilizing unsupervised clustering, we determined three 
distinct m6A modification patterns related to different biological functions, 
TME cell-infiltrating characteristics and clinical outcomes. Additionally, a 
risk score was constructed based on six m6A regulators-associated prognostic 
signatures and was validated as an independent and valuable prognostic factor 
for AML. Patients with a low-risk score exhibited better survival than those 
with a high-risk score. Many m6A regulators were aberrantly expressed in AML, 
among which METTL14, YTHDC2, ZC3H13 and RBM15 were observed to be associated 
with the OS of AML. In addition, these four m6A regulators were found to be 
noticeably related to the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments. Finally, 
we verified the expression levels of these four m6A regulators in AML and 
healthy samples and three groups of AML patients with different risk categories. 
Collectively, our study indicates that the m6A modification pattern is involved 
in TME immune-infiltrating characteristics and prognosis in AML. A better 
understanding of the m6A modification pattern will help enhance our knowledge of 
the molecular mechanisms of AML and develop potential prognosis prediction 
indicators and more effective immunotherapeutic strategies."
1134,"BACKGROUND: Enrichment of urinary exfoliated tumor cells (UETCs) is a 
noninvasive way of bladder cancer diagnosis, but the lack of specific capture 
and identification of tumor cells from the urine remains a limitation that 
impedes the development of liquid biopsy.
METHODS: The CytoBot® 2000, a novel circulating cell isolation and enrichment 
platform, was used for UETCs isolation after comprehensive optimization. The 
commercial cell lines of bladder cancer were used in spiking assay for cell 
recovery test. The flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining assays were 
performed for expression validation of capture target and identification 
markers. The performance of optimized platform was validated by 159 clinical 
samples and analyzed using receiver operator characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The chip that had a pore diameter of 15*20 μm could reduce the 
background residues while maintaining a higher cell recovery rate. We found that 
the cell capture ability of chip significantly improved after anti-EpCam 
antibody encapsulation, but not with T4L6FM1. In identification system 
optimization, the spiking assay and validation of clinical sample showed that 
the performance of CK20 and DBC-1 were better that pan-CK in tumor cell 
identification, in addition, the staining quality is more legible with CK20.
CONCLUSION: The optimized capture chip is more specific for UETCs isolation. 
CK20 and DBC-1 are both sensitive biomarkers of UETCs in bladder cancer 
diagnosis. The performance of this optimized platform is excellent in clinical 
test that improves the accuracy of urine cell testing and provides a new 
alternative for the clinical application of BLCA liquid biopsy assessment."
1135,"BACKGROUND: Although early detection is critical, diagnosing vitreoretinal 
lymphoma (VRL) remains difficult. We sought to assess the potential diagnostic 
value of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in VRL.
METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records and pre-treatment SD-OCT images of 
biopsy-confirmed VRL and uveitis patients, with primary involvement of the 
sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the outer retina, including acute 
syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis (ASPPC), chronic stage sympathetic 
ophthalmitis (SO), and idiopathic multifocal choroiditis (MFC).
RESULTS: We included 45 eyes of 45 VRL patients and 40 eyes of 40 uveitis 
patients (17 ASPPC eyes, eight chronic SO eyes, and 15 MFC eyes). On SD-OCT, 
lymphoma cell infiltration was observed in various retinal layers, most commonly 
in the sub-RPE (80%) and sub-retinal space (62%). Highly sensitive features for 
VRL as compared to uveitis included vitreous cells (93%), focal hyper-reflective 
sub-retinal infiltration (51%), and diffuse RPE elevations (56%). The features 
strongly specific for VRL included preretinal deposits (92.5%), intra-retinal 
infiltration (except the incomplete vertical hyper-reflective type, 100%), 
banded hyper-reflective sub-retinal infiltration (90%), and confluent RPE 
detachments (100%). We identified an approach to VRL diagnosis based on these 
SD-OCT findings: 1) two highly sensitive features plus one strongly specific 
feature; or 2) one highly sensitive feature plus two strongly specific features, 
demonstrated a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 95% for VRL.
CONCLUSION: SD-OCT may enable the detection of detailed lymphoma infiltration 
characteristics and provide significant supplemental value for VRL diagnosis, 
particularly when combining highly sensitive and specific VRL-associated SD-OCT 
features. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1136,"Antigen-specific T cells are central to the adaptive immune response against T. 
cruzi infection and underpin the efficacy of on-going vaccine strategies. In 
this context, the present study focuses on T cell assays that define the 
parasite-specificity on the basis of upregulation of TCR stimulation-induced 
surface markers (AIM). For this purpose, we tested different dual marker 
combinations (OX40, CD25, CD40L, CD137, CD69, PD-L1, CD11a, CD49d, HLA-DR, CD38) 
to reliably identify activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations from PBMCs of 
chronic Chagas disease patients (CCD) after 12 or 24 h of stimulation with T. 
cruzi lysate. Results demonstrated that AIM assays combining the expression of 
OX40, CD25, CD40L, CD137, CD69 and/or PD-L1 surface markers are efficient at 
detecting T. cruzi-specific CD4+ T cells in CCD patients, in comparison to 
non-infected donors, after both stimulation times. For CD8+ T cells, only 
PD-L1/OX40 after 24 h of antigen exposure resulted to be useful to track a 
parasite-specific response. We also demonstrated that the agnostic activation is 
mediated by different T. cruzi strains, such as Dm28c, CL Brener or Sylvio. 
Additionally, we successfully used this approach to identify the phenotype of 
activated T lymphocytes based on the expression of CD45RA and CCR7. Overall, our 
results show that different combinations of AIM markers represent an effective 
and simple tool for the detection of T. cruzi-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

1137,"Accumulation of incompletely folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
leads to ER stress, activates ER protein degradation pathways, and upregulates 
genes involved in protein folding. This process is known as the unfolded protein 
response (UPR). The role of ER protein folding in plant responses to nutrient 
deficiencies is unclear. We analyzed Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants 
affected in ER protein quality control and established that both CALNEXIN (CNX) 
genes function in the primary root's response to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. CNX1 
and CNX2 are homologous ER lectins promoting protein folding of N-glycosylated 
proteins via the recognition of the GlcMan9GlcNAc2 glycan. Growth of cnx1-1 and 
cnx2-2 single mutants was similar to that of the wild type under high and low Pi 
conditions, but the cnx1-1 cnx2-2 double mutant showed decreased primary root 
growth under low Pi conditions due to reduced meristematic cell division. This 
phenotype was specific to Pi deficiency; the double mutant responded normally to 
osmotic and salt stress. Expression of CNX2 mutated in amino acids involved in 
binding the GlcMan9GlcNAc2 glycan failed to complement the cnx1-1 cnx2-2 mutant. 
The root growth phenotype was Fe dependent and was associated with root 
apoplastic Fe accumulation. Two genes involved in Fe-dependent inhibition of 
primary root growth under Pi deficiency, the ferroxidase LOW PHOSPHATE 1 (LPR1) 
and P5-type ATPase PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE 2 (PDR2) were epistatic to 
CNX1/CNX2. Overexpressing PDR2 failed to complement the cnx1-1 cnx2-2 root 
phenotype. The cnx1-1 cnx2-2 mutant showed no evidence of UPR activation, 
indicating a limited effect on ER protein folding. CNX might process a set of 
N-glycosylated proteins specifically involved in the response to Pi deficiency."
1138,"N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) is the most abundant nucleotide modification observed 
in eukaryotic mRNA. Changes in m 6 A levels in transcriptome are tightly 
correlated to expression levels of m 6 A methyltransferases and demethylases. 
Abnormal expression levels of methyltransferases and demethylases are observed 
in various diseases and health conditions such as cancer, male infertility, and 
obesity. This research explores the efficacy of m 6 A-modified RNA as an 
anticancer drug target. We discovered a 12-mer peptide that binds specifically 
to m6A-modified RNA using phage display experiments. Our fluorescence-based 
assays illustrate the selected peptide binds to methylated RNA with lower 
micromolar affinity and inhibit the binding of protein FTO, a demethylase enzyme 
specific to m 6 A modification. When cancer cell lines were treated with mtp1, 
it led to an increase in m 6 A levels and a decrease in cell viability. Hence 
our results illustrate the potential of mtp1 to be developed as a drug for 
cancer."
1139,"There are an estimated 500,000 patients treated with full-thickness wounds in 
the United States every year. Fire-related burn injuries are among the most 
common and devastating types of wounds that require advanced clinical treatment. 
Autologous split-thickness skin grafting is the clinical gold standard for the 
treatment of large burn wounds. However, skin grafting has several limitations, 
particularly in large burn wounds, where there may be a limited area of 
non-wounded skin to use for grafting. Non-cellular dermal substitutes have been 
developed but have their own challenges; they are expensive to produce, may 
require immunosuppression depending on design and allogenic cell inclusion. 
There is a need for more advanced treatments for devastating burns and wounds. 
This manuscript provides a brief overview of some recent advances in wound care, 
including the use of advanced biomaterials, cell-based therapies for wound 
healing, biological skin substitutes, biological scaffolds, spray on skin and 
skin bioprinting. Finally, we provide insight into the future of wound care and 
technological areas that need to be addressed to support the development and 
incorporation of these technologies."
1140,"Tissue engineering solutions for skin have been developed over the last few 
decades with a focus initially on a two-layered structure with epithelial and 
dermal repair. An essential element of skin restoration is a source of cells 
capable of differentiating into the appropriate phenotype. The need to repair 
areas of skin when traditional techniques were not adequate addressed led to 
cell based therapies being developed initially as a laboratory-based tissue 
expansion opportunity, both as sheets of cultured epithelial autograft and in 
composite laboratory-based skin substitutes. The time to availability of the 
cell-based therapies has been solved in a number of ways, from using allograft 
cell-based solutions to the use of point of care skin cell harvesting for 
immediate clinical use. More recently pluripotential cells have been explored 
providing a readily available source of cells and cells which can express the 
broad range of phenotypes seen in the mature skin construct. The lessons learnt 
from the use of cell based techniques has driven the exploration of the use of 
3D printing technology, with controlled accurate placement of the cells within a 
specific printed construct to optimise the phenotypic expression and tissue 
generation."
1141,"Lung carcinoma is the primary reason for cancer-associated mortality, and it 
exhibits the highest mortality and incidence in developed and developing 
countries. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC are the 2 main types of 
lung cancer, with NSCLC contributing to 85% of all lung carcinoma cases. 
Conventional treatment mainly involves surgery, chemoradiotherapy, and 
immunotherapy, but has a dismal prognosis for many patients. Therefore, 
identifying an effective adjuvant therapy is urgent. Historically, traditional 
herbal medicine has been an essential part of complementary and alternative 
medicine, due to its numerous targets, few side effects and substantial 
therapeutic benefits. In China and other East Asian countries, traditional 
herbal medicine is increasingly popular, and is highly accepted by patients as a 
clinical adjuvant therapy. Numerous studies have reported that herbal extracts 
and prescription medications are effective at combating tumors. It emphasizes 
that, by mainly regulating the P13K/AKT signaling pathway, the Wnt signaling 
pathway, and the NF-κB signaling pathway, herbal medicine induces apoptosis and 
inhibits the proliferation and migration of tumor cells. The present review 
discusses the anti-NSCLC mechanisms of herbal medicines and provides options for 
future adjuvant therapy in patients with NSCLC."
1142,"Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is the third epidemic osteoporosis following 
postmenopausal and senileosteoporosis. According to one study, salidroside made 
ovariectomized rats' bones strong. Salidroside's potential for treating 
glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis remains unproven. This study aimed to 
investigate the protective effect and mechanism of salidroside on 
dexamethasone-induced osteogenic differentiation and bone formation in MC3T3-E1 
cells and zebrafish. The study proved that salindroside had no harmful impact on 
MC3T3E1 cells. Salidroside significantly relieved dexamethasone-induced 
inhibition of ALP (alkaline phosphatase) activity and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 
cells, and promoted osteogenic differentiation of cells. Salidroside increased 
the expression of osteopontin (OPN), runt-related transcription factor 2 
(Runx2), osterix (Osx), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) proteins and 
promoted the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in MC3T3-E1 cells treated with 
dexamethasone. In addition, the effect of salidroside in relieving 
dexamethasone-induced inhibition of osteogenic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells 
can be blocked by TGF-β receptor type I/II inhibitor (LY2109761). At the same 
time, we found that salidroside significantly alleviated the inhibition of 
dexamethasone-induced bone formation in zebrafish and promoted the 
mineralization of zebrafish skulls. LY2109761 reversed the protective impact of 
salidroside on dexamethasone-mediated bone impairment in zebrafish. These 
findings suggested that salidroside alleviated dexamethasone-induced inhibition 
of osteogenic differentiation and bone formation via TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling 
pathway."
1143,"BACKGROUND: During home treatment with antibiotics, patients' laboratory results 
of total white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophil counts and C-reactive 
protein (CRP) are drawn and monitored at the hospital. The aim of the study was 
to examine the feasibility and analytical accuracy of hospitalized patients 
18 years or older self-testing using two point-of-care tests (POCT).
METHODS: The pilot study included 41 hospitalized patients. A subjective 
judgment of the patients' ability to conduct the self-testing was made along 
with a comparison of the POCT measurements of WBC, neutrophil counts and CRP 
with standard laboratory measurements. Correlation between the POCTs and 
laboratorial values was assessed by coefficient of determination and the level 
of agreement between the means was assessed by Bland Altman test.
RESULTS: Of the 38 patients conducting self-testing, 78% were men and the mean 
age was 61.8 years. 28 patients (73.7%) successfully performed self-testing on 
the first try while, 10 (26.3%) 'HemoCue WBC DIFF' measurements showed an error 
code. All the patients successfully performed the 'QuickRead go CRP' self-test. 
Comparison of the 'HemoCue WBC DIFF' results with the laboratory results of WBC 
and neutrophil counts showed good agreement. On the other hand, 'QuickRead go 
CRP' results showed a small but significant systematic disagreement compared to 
the laboratory results.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the POCTs can be used by some patients and 
factors influencing the patient participation included psychological and 
physical limitations. Both POCTs appeared to have an acceptable clinical level 
of accuracy."
1144,"BACKGROUND: Telomere dysfunction has been reported to be directly involved in 
carcinogenesis owing to chromosomal instability and immortalization; however, 
the clinicopathological significance of telomeres remains controversial. We have 
shown that telomere shortening occurs in normal-appeared duct cells at the 
initiation and then progresses during the progression of pancreatic cancer. In 
this study, we determined the clinicopathological and prognostic value of 
telomere length (TL) in cancer progression.
METHODS: TL in both cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was 
analyzed by high throughput quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) using a previously reported cohort comprising 1,434 cases of 
adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenosquamous carcinoma 
(ASC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which are 
known cancers with a significantly low incidence of alternative lengthening of 
telomeres. Cases were divided into two groups as follows: longer and shorter 
telomeres, according to the median TL of cancer cells and CAFs. The statistical 
significance of TL in cancer cells and CAFs on clinicopathological 
characteristics and prognosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: There was a close association between TL in cancer cells and CAFs. 
Longer telomeres in cancer cells and CAFs were associated with aggressive 
features such as advanced stage, high mitosis score and nuclear score, poorly 
differentiated cancer, and desmoplastic stroma in ADC. Furthermore, a longer TL 
was an independent prognostic factor for ADC, SCC and RCC.
CONCLUSION: Longer telomeres are associated with worse prognosis in ADC, SCC and 
RCC. Thus, TL is a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of aggressive cancers with 
poor prognoses."
1145,"Aging-associated microbial dysbiosis exacerbates various disorders and 
dysfunctions, and is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the 
elderly, but the underlying cause of this aging-related syndrome is confusing. 
SIRT6 knockout (SIRT6 KO) mice undergo premature aging and succumb to death by 
4 weeks, and are therefore useful as a premature aging research model. Here, 
fecal microbiota transplantation from SIRT6 KO mice into wild-type (WT) mice 
phenocopies the gut dysbiosis and premature aging observed in SIRT6 KO mice. 
Conversely, an expanded lifespan was observed in SIRT6 KO mice when transplanted 
with microbiota from WT mice. Antibiotic cocktail treatment attenuated 
inflammation and cell senescence in KO mice, directly suggesting that gut 
dysbiosis contributes to the premature aging of SIRT6 KO mice. Increased 
Enterobacteriaceae translocation, driven by the overgrowth of Escherichia coli, 
is the likely mechanism for the premature aging effects of microbiome 
dysregulation, which could be reversed by a high-fat diet. Our results provide a 
mechanism for the causal link between gut dysbiosis and aging, and support a 
beneficial effect of a high-fat diet for correcting gut dysbiosis and 
alleviating premature aging. This study provides a rationale for the integration 
of microbiome-based high-fat diets into therapeutic interventions against 
aging-associated diseases."
1146,"Prochlorococcus play a crucial role in the ocean's biogeochemical cycling, but 
it remains controversial how they will respond to global warming. Here we 
assessed the response to temperature (22-30°C) of the growth dynamics and gene 
expression profiles of a Red Sea Prochlorococcus strain (RSP50) in a non-axenic 
culture. Both the specific growth rate (0.55 - 0.80 d-1 ) and cell size (0.04 to 
0.07 μm3 ) of Prochlorococcus increased significantly with temperature. The 
primary production released extracellularly ranged from 20 to 34%, with 
humic-like fluorescent compounds increasing up to 5-fold as Prochlorococcus 
reached its maximum abundance. At 30°C, genes involved in carbon fixation such 
as CsoS2 and CsoS3 and photosynthetic electron transport including PTOX were 
downregulated, suggesting a cellular homeostasis and energy saving mechanism 
response. In contrast, PTOX was found upregulated at 22 and 24°C. Similar 
results were found for transaldolase, related to carbon metabolism, and citrate 
synthase, an important enzyme in the TCA cycle. Our data suggest that in spite 
of the currently warm temperatures of the Red Sea, Prochlorococcus can modulate 
its gene expression profiles to permit growth at temperatures lower than its 
optimum temperature (28°C) but is unable to cope with temperatures exceeding 
30°C. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1147,"Five-FU is a potent chemotherapeutic agent for suppressing endothelial cell 
growth. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of local 
peritumor injection of 5-FU for patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) for 
the prevention of anemia. Between January 2020 and January 2022, patients aged 
18 years or older with AGC and moderate anemia were included. A total of 200 mg 
of 5-FU was injected per session at ten points of the lesion (20 mg at each 
point) every 7 days for 4 to 12 weeks. Patients received a blood test for 
toxicity at every cycle. From one of these patients, endoscopic biopsy specimens 
were taken from gastric cancer before and after injecting 5-FU for 
immunostaining. A total of five AGC patients participated in this study. For 
most patients, hemoglobin levels were maintained without transfusions during 
5-FU injection, and expression levels of thrombospondin-1 was increased after 
injection compared to those before injection. Blood test results during 5-FU 
injection showed no significant change in serum glutamic oxalacetic 
transaminase/glutamic pyruvic transaminase, total bilirubin, or creatinine 
level. The results of this study showed the possibility of local peritumor 5-FU 
injection as a treatment for relieving anemia of patients with gastric cancer."
1148,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontal ligament progenitor cells (PDL cells) 
isolated from patients with inflammatory periodontitis have impaired 
regenerative capacity, but it is unknown whether this capacity can be recovered 
upon treatment and stabilization of the periodontal condition. The study aimed 
to investigate the expression of surface markers and the proliferation and 
osteogenic potential of PDL cells isolated from patients with treated stable 
periodontitis (S-PDL cells), periodontally healthy individuals (H-PDL cells), 
and patients with inflammatory periodontitis (I-PDL cells).
METHODS: H-PDL, I-PDL, and S-PDL cells were isolated from the extracted teeth of 
individuals who (1) were periodontally healthy, (2) had inflammatory 
periodontitis, and (3) had treated stable periodontitis, respectively. The 
expression levels of surface markers and the proliferative and osteogenic 
capacities of the PDL cells were assessed.
RESULTS: PDL cells derived from all three sources exhibited mesenchymal stem 
cell (MSC) characteristics. They were positive for MSC-related markers and 
negative for a hematopoiesis-related marker. However, S-PDL cells had higher 
proliferation rates, higher expression levels of osteogenic markers, higher 
alkaline phosphatase activity, and more calcium nodules than I-PDL cells. But 
all of these parameters remained lower in S-PDL cells than in H-PDL cells.
CONCLUSIONS: S-PDL cells proliferated faster and had greater osteogenic 
potential than I-PDL cells, although these values remained lower than those in 
H-PDL cells."
1149,"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) ranks second in mortality among all malignant 
diseases worldwide. However, the cause and molecular mechanism underlying 
gastric cancer are not clear. Here, we used integrated bioinformatics to 
identify possible key genes and reveal the pathogenesis and prognosis of gastric 
cancer.
METHODS: The gene expression profiles of GSE118916, GSE79973, and GSE29272 were 
available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between GC and normal gastric tissues were screened by R 
software and Venn diagram software. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment of DEGs was 
performed using the DAVID database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
was established by STRING and visualized using Cytoscape software. Then the 
influence of hub genes on expression and survival was assessed using TCGA 
database.
RESULTS: A total of 83 DEGs were found in the three datasets, including 41 
up-regulated genes and 42 down-regulated genes. These DEGs were mainly enriched 
in extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion. The enriched pathways 
obtained in the KEGG pathway analysis were extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor 
interaction and focal adhesion. A PPI network of DEGs was analyzed using the 
Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) app of Cytoscape. Four genes were considered 
hub genes, including COL5A1, FBN1, SPARC, and LUM. Among them, LUM was found to 
have a significantly worse prognosis based on TCGA database.
CONCLUSIONS: We screened DEGs associated with GC by integrated bioinformatics 
analysis and found one potential biomarker that may be involved in the progress 
of GC. This hub gene may serve as a guide for further molecular biological 
experiments."
1150,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of malignant tumor-related deaths worldwide. 
The presence of tumor-initiating cells in lung cancer leads to tumor recurrence, 
metastasis, and resistance to conventional treatment. Cleavage and 
polyadenylation specificity factor 4 (CPSF4) activation in tumor cells 
contributes to the poor prognosis of lung cancer. However, the precise 
biological functions and molecular mechanisms of CPSF4 in the regulation of 
tumor-initiating cells remain unclear. We demonstrated that CPSF4 promotes 
tumor-initiating phenotype and confers chemoresistance to paclitaxel both in 
vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we showed that CPSF4 binds to the promoters 
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2) and 
activated their transcription. In addition, we showed that 
CPSF4/VEGF/NRP2-mediated tumor-initiating phenotype and chemoresistance through 
TAZ induction. Furthermore, analysis of clinical data revealed that lung cancer 
patients with high CPSF4 expression exhibit high expression levels of VEGF, 
NRP2, and TAZ and that expression of these proteins are positively correlated 
with poor prognosis. Importantly, selective inhibition of VEGF, NRP2, or TAZ 
markedly suppressed CPSF4-mediated tumor-initiating phenotype and 
chemoresistance. Our findings reveal the mechanism of CPSF4 modulating 
tumor-initiating phenotype and chemoresistance in lung cancer and indicate that 
the CPSF4-VEGF-NRP2-TAZ signaling pathway may be a prognosis marker and 
therapeutic target in lung cancer."
1151,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which is characterised 
mostly by loss of dopaminergic nerve cells throughout the nigral area mainly as 
a consequence of oxidative stress. Muscle stiffness, disorganised bodily 
responses, disturbed sleep, weariness, amnesia, and voice impairment are all 
symptoms of dopaminergic neuron degeneration and existing symptomatic treatments 
are important to arrest additional neuronal death. Some cannabinoids have 
recently been demonstrated as robust antioxidants that might protect the nerve 
cells from degeneration even when cannabinoid receptors are not triggered. 
Cannabinoids are likely to have property to slow or presumably cease the steady 
deterioration of the brain's dopaminergic systems, a condition for which there 
is now no treatment. The use of cannabinoids in combination with currently 
available drugs has the potential to introduce a radically new paradigm for 
treatment of Parkinson's disease, making it immensely useful in the treatment of 
such a debilitating illness."
1152,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the alterations in the immune phenotypes and 
explore the potential relevance to pathogenesis in IgG4-RD.
METHODS: Forty-two IgG4-RD patients and thirty-eight healthy controls were 
recruited in this study. Peripheral immunocompetent cells including T cells, 
CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells, NK cells CD4 + CD45RA + T cells (naïve T 
cells), CD4 + CD25 - / + Foxp3 - T cells (Teff), CD4 + CD25hiCD127lowCD161 + T 
cells (CD161 + Treg), CD4 + CD25hiFoxp3 + T cells (Foxp3 + Treg), 
CD4 + CD4RA-CXCR5 + PD1 + CCR7low T cells (pTfh), T helper (Th) 1, Th2, and Th17 
before and after treatment were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, IgG4-RD patients showed higher 
proportions of NK (20.1% vs 13.6%, p < 0.01), Th1 (CD4 + IFN-γ + : 17.9% vs 
14.2%, p = 0.061; TNF-α: 43.7% vs 36.7%, p < 0.05), Th2 (CD4 + IL-4 + : 2.4% vs 
1.3%, p < 0.0001), CD161 + Treg (14.9% vs 11.6%, p < 0.01), pTfh (3.2% vs 2.4%, 
p < 0.05), and Foxp3 + Treg (8.3% vs 7.0%, p < 0.01) and lower proportions of B 
lymphocytes (8.4% vs 13.1%, p < 0.001), Teff (91.6% vs 92.6%, p < 0.01), and 
naïve Th cells (19.9% vs 32.1%, p < 0.01) before treatment. Foxp3 + Treg 
percentage decreased significantly after treatment (8.6% vs 6.9%, p < 0.05). 
Both serum C3 (r =  - 0.6374, p < 0.01) and C4 (r =  - 0.6174, p < 0.01) levels 
were in negative correlation with CD161 + Treg. The eosinophil percentage was 
positively correlated with Foxp3 + Treg (r = 0.5435, p < 0.05). Serum IgE level 
was positively correlated with Th2 (r = 0.5545, p < 0.05). There was a positive 
correlation between CD161 + Treg and pTfh (r = 0.4974, p < 0.05) while a 
negative correlation between Th2 and B cells (r =  - 0.4925, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Immune phenotypes were altered in IgG4-RD. Treg/Teff balance was 
shifted toward Treg in IgG4-RD. CD161 + Treg was likely to be involved in the 
pathogenesis of IgG4-RD. Key Points •Immune phenotypes were altered in B cells, 
T cells, and NK cells in IgG4-RD. •Treg/Teff balance was shifted toward Treg in 
IgG4-RD. •CD161+ Treg maybe play a proinflammatory role in IgG4-RD."
1153,"During its life cycle, Trypanosoma cruzi undergoes physiological modifications 
in order to adapt to insect vector and mammalian host conditions. 
Metacyclogenesis is essential, as the parasite acquires the ability to infect a 
variety of mammalian species, including humans, in which pathology is caused. In 
this work, the transcriptomes of metacyclic trypomastigotes and epimastigotes 
were analyzed in order to identify differentially expressed genes that may be 
involved in metacyclogenesis. Toward this end, in vitro induction of 
metacyclogenesis was performed and metacyclic trypomastigotes obtained. RNA-Seq 
was performed on triplicate samples of epimastigotes and metacyclic 
trypomastigotes. Differential gene expression analysis showed 513 genes, of 
which 221 were upregulated and 292 downregulated in metacyclic trypomastigotes. 
The analysis showed that these genes are related to biological processes 
relevant in metacyclogenesis. Within these processes, we found that most of the 
genes associated with infectivity and gene expression regulation were 
upregulated in metacyclic trypomastigotes, while genes involved in cell 
division, DNA replication, differentiation, cytoskeleton, and metabolism were 
mainly downregulated. The participation of some of these genes in T. cruzi 
metacyclogenesis is of interest, as they may be used as potential therapeutic 
targets in the design of new drugs for Chagas disease."
1154,"PURPOSE: Tumor cells thrive by adapting to the signals in their 
microenvironment. To adapt, cancer cells activate signaling and transcriptional 
programs and migrate to establish micro-niches, in response to signals from 
neighboring cells and non-cellular stromal factors. Understanding how the tumor 
microenvironment evolves during disease progression is crucial to deciphering 
the mechanisms underlying the functional behavior of cancer cells.
METHODS: Multiplex immunohistochemistry, spatial analysis and histological dyes 
were used to identify and measure immune cell infiltration, cell signal 
activation and extracellular matrix deposition in low-grade, high-grade 
astrocytoma and glioblastoma.
RESULTS: We show that lower grade astrocytoma tissue is largely devoid of 
infiltrating immune cells and extracellular matrix proteins, while high-grade 
astrocytoma exhibits abundant immune cell infiltration, activation, and 
extensive tissue remodeling. Spatial analysis shows that most T-cells are 
restricted to perivascular regions, but bone marrow-derived macrophages 
penetrate deep into neoplastic cell-rich regions. The tumor microenvironment is 
characterized by heterogeneous PI3K, MAPK and CREB signaling, with specific 
signaling profiles correlating with distinct pathological hallmarks, including 
angiogenesis, tumor cell density and regions where neoplastic cells border the 
extracellular matrix. Our results also show that tissue remodeling is important 
in regulating the architecture of the tumor microenvironment during tumor 
progression.
CONCLUSION: The tumor microenvironment in malignant astrocytoma, exhibits 
changes in cell composition, cell signaling activation and extracellular matrix 
deposition during disease development and that targeting the extracellular 
matrix, as well as cell signaling activation will be critical to designing 
personalized therapy."
1155,"Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world, and 
chemotherapy can have unfavorable side effects. The aim of the present study is 
to evaluate the therapeutic anticancer role of Moringa oleifera leaf extracts 
(MLE) in urethane-induced lung cancer in adult male albino rats as compared to 
standard chemotherapy. Rats were categorized into four groups (10 rats/group), 
including negative control rats, urethane lung cancer model rats, MLE-treated 
lung cancer rats, and cisplatin-treated rats. Estimation of lung index, some 
biochemical markers of oxidative stress, quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR), and histopathology and transmission electron microscopy were 
performed. The lung index was significantly increased about one-fold in urethane 
lung cancer model rats, but it decreased after MLE treatment. Also, MLE was able 
to improve the induced changes in glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and 
malondialdehyde concentration to be 3.8 ± 0.4 mg/g, 900.6 ± 58 U/g, and 
172 ± 24 nmol/g, respectively. Additionally, after MLE treatment, the expression 
of EGFR-mRNA increased by about 50%. Our light and electron microscopic 
examination revealed that urethane group showed abnormally distributed excessive 
collagen fibers and the development of papillary adenocarcinoma from 
hyperplastic Clara cells in the lumen of terminal bronchiole with bronchiolar 
wall thickening, alveolar collapse, and inflammation. MLE group has moderate 
amount of collagen fiber and absence of tumor mass and provided more or less 
restoration of normal lung histology. Moreover, MLE was able to ameliorate the 
induced changes in mucin and PCNA positive cells in the lung by 10.8 ± 2.3%. 
Collectively, the current study showed that MLE could be used as anticancer 
agents alleviating changes associated with lung cancer in a urethane-induced 
lung cancer bearing rats thereby representing alternative options to toxic 
chemotherapy."
1156,"Development of controlled release system promises a huge impact on the pesticide 
delivery, which has raised attentions in improving efficacy of pesticides. 
Herein, the emerging photoremovable protecting group (PRPG), used in 
spatiotemporal delivery of drug by light, was introduced into agriculture. We 
obtained three TNB-insecticides and two of them exhibited excellent 
photophysicochemical properties. Our dual photo-controlled release system 
displayed more than sixfold insecticidal activity differences upon irradiation 
with UV light or sunlight. The dual release of DIN-TNB-DIN showed synergistic 
effect on mosquito larvae and armyworm larvae. Distribution of the fluorescence 
in body of dead/alive wigglers clearly illustrated the action mode, and visually 
demonstrated the precise and spatiotemporal delivery of insecticides in the 
living mosquito larvae. The new developed dual photo-controlled release system 
might widen the diversity in pesticide delivery, promoting the development in 
improving pesticide efficacy."
1157,"The key cell population permits cancer cells to avoid immune-surveillance is 
regulatory T cells (Tregs). This study evaluates the level of Tregs in chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and the effect of Tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) on Treg levels, as a pathway to understand the immune response and 
behavior among advance stage and optimal response CML patients using imatinib 
therapy. Blood samples were collected from 30 CML patients (optimal response to 
TKI), 30 CML patients (failure response to TKI), and 30 age- and gender-matched 
controls. Analysis involved measuring percentages of Tregs 
(CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 +) by flow cytometer and demethylation levels of FOXP3 
Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) by PCR. The data revealed that Tregs 
and the FOXP3-TSDR demethylation percentages significantly increased in failure 
response group in comparison to the optimal response and control groups, while 
no significant difference between optimal response and control groups. Tregs and 
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation percentages showed high sensitivity and specificity, 
suggesting powerful discriminatory biomarkers between failure and optimal 
groups. An assessment of the Tregs and demethylation percentage among different 
BCR-ABL levels of CML patients on TKI revealed no significant differences in 
parameter percentage in the optimal response to TKI patients with different 
molecular responses (log 3 reduction or other deeper log 4.5 and 5 reduction 
levels). Our findings demonstrate an effective role of functional Tregs among 
different CML stages. Also, the study suggests that the major molecular response 
to therapy at level 0.1% of BCR-ABL transcript could be enough to induce immune 
system restoration in patients."
1158,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (UBE2J1) has been proven to participate in 
the ubiquitination of multiple substrate proteins. However, the underlying 
mechanisms of UBE2J1 as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme participating in cancer 
development and progression remain largely unknown. Here, we identified that 
UBE2J1 is downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cell lines which 
are mediated by DNA hypermethylation of its promoter, and decreased UBE2J1 is 
associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, UBE2J1 serving as a suppressor 
gene inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanistically, 
UBE2J1-TRIM25, forming an E2-E3 complex, physically interacts with and targets 
RPS3 for ubiquitination and degradation at the K214 residue. The downregulated 
RPS3 caused by UBE2J1 overexpression restrains NF-κB translocation into the 
nucleus and therefore inactivates the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study 
revealed a novel role of UBE2J1-mediated RPS3 poly-ubiquitination and 
degradation in disrupting the NF-κB signaling pathway, which may serve as a 
novel and promising biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC."
1159,"This article attempts to provide comprehensive review of plant deubiquitinases, 
paying special attention to recent advances in their biochemical activities and 
biological functions. Proteins in eukaryotes are subjected to post-translational 
modifications, in which ubiquitination is regarded as a reversible process. 
Cellular deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a key component of the ubiquitin 
(Ub)-proteasome system responsible for cellular protein homeostasis. DUBs 
recycle Ub by hydrolyzing poly-Ub chains on target proteins, and maintain a 
balance of the cellular Ub pool. In addition, some DUBs prefer to cleave poly-Ub 
chains not linked through the conventional K48 residue, which often alter the 
substrate activity instead of its stability. In plants, all seven known DUB 
subfamilies have been identified, namely Ub-binding protease/Ub-specific 
protease (UBP/USP), Ub C-terminal hydrolase (UCH), Machado-Joseph 
domain-containing protease (MJD), ovarian-tumor domain-containing protease 
(OTU), zinc finger with UFM1-specific peptidase domain protease (ZUFSP), motif 
interacting with Ub-containing novel DUB family (MINDY), and JAB1/MPN/MOV34 
protease (JAMM). This review focuses on recent advances in the structure, 
activity, and biological functions of plant DUBs, particularly in the model 
plant Arabidopsis."
1160,"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the first developed vaccine to prevent 
tuberculosis (TB) and is the world's most widely used vaccine. It has a 
reconcilable defense in opposition to tuberculosis, meningitis, and miliary 
disease in children but changeable protection against pulmonary TB. Immune 
activation is responsible for regulating neural development by activating it. 
The effect of the BCG vaccine on neuronal disorders due to subordinate immune 
provocation is useful. BCG vaccine can prevent neuronal degeneration in 
different neurological disorders by provoking auto-reactive T-cells. In the case 
of TB, CD4+ T-cells effectively protect the immune response by protecting the 
central defense. Because of the preceding fact, BCG induces protection by 
creating precise T-cells like CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells. Hence, 
vaccination-induced protection generates specific T-cells and CD4+ T-cells, and 
CD8+ T-cells. The BCG vaccine may have an essential effect on motor disorders 
and play a crucial role in neuroprotective management. The present review 
describes how the BCG vaccine might be interrelated with motor disorders and 
play a key role in such diseases."
1161,"Different types of stem cells have remarkable characteristics such as high 
proliferation rate, multi/pluripotency, self-renewal, and broad differentiation 
that can effectively treat diseases, cancers, and damages. Despite abundant 
therapeutic applications of stem cells in medical science, numerous risks 
threaten stem cell transplantation. Tumor development, immune response, cellular 
senescence, dosage effects, and administration timing are critical risks that 
should be considered in stem cell therapy. Hence, an investigation of possible 
risks is required before utilizing stem cell-based medicinal products in the 
clinical phase and human trials. This review aims to survey the literature and 
perspectives on the advantages and risks associated with pluripotent and 
multipotent stem cells."
1162,"Stroke is a life-threatening disease and one of the leading causes of death and 
physical disability worldwide. Currently, no drugs on the market promote neural 
recovery after stroke insult, and spontaneous remodeling processes are limited 
to induce recovery in the ischemic regions. Therefore, promoting a cell-based 
therapy has been needed to elevate the endogenous recovery process. Mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) have been regarded as candidate cell sources for therapeutic 
purposes of ischemic stroke, and their therapeutic effects are mediated by 
exosomes. The microRNA cargo in these extracellular vesicles is mostly 
responsible for the positive effects. When it comes to the therapeutic 
viewpoint, MSCs-derived exosomes could be a promising therapeutic strategy 
against ischemic stroke. The aim of this review is to discuss the current 
knowledge around the potential of MSCs-derived exosomes in the treatment of 
ischemic stroke."
1163,"Cardiovascular disease and renal complications raise the risk of death and 
morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a novel class of glucose-lowering drug that increases 
urine glucose excretion while decreasing blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes 
patients by inhibiting glucose reabsorption. In the present article, we review 
the discovery and development of SGLT2i as a new T2D treatment approach for T2D; 
thereafter, we consider different cell-based methods for the evaluation of 
SGLT2i. Finally, we provide evidence from both clinical and experimental studies 
which bring up the cardio-renal protective effects of SGLT2i. We performed a 
literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science to identify 
publications on preclinical and clinical studies of cardiorenal protective 
action of SGLT2i and their suggested mechanisms. SGLT2i have shown good effects 
in the improvement of cardiovascular and renal complications independent of 
glucose lowering effects. Besides controlling blood glucose levels, SGLT2i were 
found to exhibit therapeutic benefits on the kidney and cardiovascular system by 
lowering diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration, blood pressure (BP), body weight, 
uric acid concentrations, lipid peroxidation, inflammation, etc. As a result of 
their distinct mode of action, SGLT2i have emerged as a promising treatment 
option for T2D and maybe T1D due to their increased urine excretion of glucose. 
It has been demonstrated that SGLT2i have considerable protective effects on 
diabetic nephropathy (DN) and cardiomyopathy in well-designed experimental and 
clinical investigations."
1164,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic syndrome of excess glucose levels in the blood. 
It may be due to glucose intolerance by the tissues and inadequate insulin 
production from pancreatic β-cells. However, diabetic complication includes 
cardiovascular and kidney diseases, eye, skin, and foot complications, and 
neuropathy. The intention behind writing this article was to gather recent 
information regarding the use of ancient traditional medicinal plants having 
recent importance in treating diabetes. Several therapies are available for 
curing the condition based on severity and type of diabetes. Although 
pharmacological treatments are effective and economical, drugs are associated 
with unwanted side effects and physiological complications on long-term use. 
Interestingly, herbs and herbal plants have been used since ancient times 
against diabetes worldwide. Its importance still exists due to medicinal plants' 
effectiveness and safety profile in treating various diseases. In this article, 
we searched online databases, including PUBMED, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and traditional 
resources, for collecting information regarding the use of plants against 
diabetes. We described the pathophysiology of the disease and incorporated plant 
sources and their chemical constituents responsible for antidiabetic activity 
with their mechanism in reducing blood glucose levels. The present article may 
be very helpful for researchers and professionals whose work is inclined towards 
diabetes and in search of lead compounds for the development of a suitable drug."
1165,"OBJECTIVE: HIV patients are prone to infection and difficult to treat, which 
mainly manifests itself in decreased CD4+ T cells in the body.. Therefore, the 
predictive value of lymphocyte count and hemoglobin for CD4+ levels in HIV 
patients was discussed in the prospective study.
METHODS: 125 HIV patients (aged >18 or < 80 years) were recruited. Pearson 
chi-square test was used to explore the correlation between CD4+ content and 
blood-related parameters in HIV patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were used to calculate ORs for each variable. In addition, 
receiver ROC curves were constructed to assess each factor's accuracy and 
sensitivity in diagnosing CD4+.
RESULTS: Lymphocyte count and hemoglobin were significantly correlated with 
CD4+. In terms of multivariate logistic regression level, there was a 
significant correlation between lymphocyte count (OR = 3.170, 95% CI: 
1.442-6.969, P = 0.004), hemoglobin (OR = 2.545, 95% CI: 1.148- 5.646, P = 
0.022) and CD4+ content in HIV patients. Based on the neural network model, the 
level of lymphocyte and hemoglobin might be the predictive indexes of CD4+ 
level. We find the high-risk warning indicator of CD4+ level: 3 < lymphocyte 
(109/L) < 3.6, and 150 < hemoglobin (g/L) < 200.
CONCLUSION: Better predictive value of lymphocyte count and hemoglobin for CD4+ 
level of HIV patients."
1166,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy 
where tumorigenesis and metastasis are believed to be tied to the hallmarks of 
hypoxia and tumor microenvironment (TME).
METHODS: In this study, to investigate the relationships among hypoxia, TME, and 
HCC prognosis, we collected two independent datasets from a public database 
(TCGA-LIHC for identification, GSE14520 for validation) and identified the 
hypoxia-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the TCGA data, and 
the univariable Cox regression and lasso regression analyses were performed to 
construct the prognosis model. An HCC prognosis model with 4 hypoxia-related 
DEGs (""NDRG1"", ""ENO1"", ""SERPINE1"", ""ANXA2"") was constructed, and high- and 
low-risk groups of HCC were established by the median of the model risk score.
RESULTS: The survival analysis revealed significant differences between the two 
groups in both datasets, with the results of the AUC of the ROC curve of 1, 3, 
and 5 years in two datasets indicating the robustness of the prognosis model. 
Meanwhile, for the TCGA-LIHC data, the immune characteristics between the two 
groups revealed that the low-risk group presented higher levels of activated NK 
cells, monocytes, and M2 macrophages, and 7 immune checkpoint genes were found 
upregulated in the high-risk group. Additionally, the two groups have no 
difference in molecular characteristics (tumor mutational burden, TMB). The 
proportion of recurrence was higher in the high-risk group, and the correlation 
between the recurrence month and risk score was negative, indicating high-risk 
correlates with a short recurrence month.
CONCLUSION: In summary, this study shows the association among hypoxic signals, 
TME, and HCC prognosis and may help reveal potential regulatory mechanisms 
between hypoxia, tumorigenesis, and metastasis in HCC. The hypoxia-related model 
demonstrated the potential to be a predictor and drug target of prognosis."
1167,"Recurrent ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the leading causes of disability and 
death worldwide. Patients with recurrent IS, in comparison with survivors of the 
initial non-cardiogenic IS, have more serious neurological deficit and longer 
average hospital stay as well as heavier family and socio-economic burden. 
Therefore, recurrent IS is a major challenge that we urgently need to address. 
The recurrence rate of non-cardiogenic IS is not zero, and even shows an 
increasing trend over a long period of time, despite receiving evidence-based 
management in accordance with guideline, indicating that patients suffering from 
non-cardiogenic IS and who are receiving the optimal management remain at 
considerable residual risks (RRs) responsible for the recurrence of 
cerebrovascular events. In addition to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) and platelets, some new non-traditional parameters such as high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], 
peripheral circulating platelet-derived microvesicles, white blood 
cells-platelet complexes, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, 
monomeric C-reactive protein, neutrophils and their products (neutrophil 
extracellular traps, NETs), may also be potential sources of RRs for recurrent 
IS. On the basis of the three pillars of secondary stroke prevention, namely, 
blood pressure reduction, lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapy, the reduction 
in RRs may provide additional protection against recurrent IS. With this 
background, the identification and quantification of RRs associated with disease 
heterogeneity and individualized treatment strategies based on risk 
stratification are favorable in the mitigation of huge stroke burden people 
unceasingly face."
1168,"BACKGROUND: The carbonic anhydrases (CAs) which are found in most living 
organisms is a member of the zinc-containing metalloenzyme family. The abnormal 
levels and activities are frequently associated with various diseases therefore 
CAs have become an attractive target for the design of inhibitors or activators 
that can be used in the treatmentof those diseases.
METHODS: Herein, we have designed and synthesized new benzimidazole-hydrazone 
derivatives to investigate the effects of these synthesized compounds on CA 
isoenzymes. Chemical structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by 1H 
NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS. The synthetic derivatives were screened for their 
inhibitory potential against carbonic anhydrase I and II by in vitro assay.
RESULTS: These compounds have IC50 values of 5.156-1.684 µM (hCA I) and 
4.334-2.188 µM (hCA II). Inhibition types and Ki values of the compounds were 
determined. The Ki values of the compounds were 5.44±0.14 µM-0.299±0.01 µM (hCA 
I) and 3.699±0.041 µM-1.507±0.01 µM (hCA II). The synthetic compounds displayed 
inhibitory action comparable to that of the clinically utilized reference 
substance, acetazolamide. According to this, compound 3p was the most effective 
molecule with an IC50 value of 1.684 µM. Accordingly, the type of inhibition was 
noncompetitive and the Ki value was 0.299±0.01 µM.
CONCLUSION: According to the in vitro test results, detailed protein-ligand 
interactions of the compound 3p, which is more active against hCA I than 
standard azithromycin (AZM), were analyzed. In addition, the cytotoxic effects 
of the compounds on the L929 healthy cell line were evaluated."
1169,"SARS-CoV2 is a novel respiratory coronavirus and, understanding its molecular 
mechanism is a prerequisite to developing effective treatment for covid-19. This 
RNA genome-carrying virus has a protein coat with spikes (S) that attaches to 
the ACE2 receptor at the cell surface of human cells. Several repurposed drugs 
are used to treat covid-19 patients that are proven to be largely unsuccessful 
or have limited success in reducing mortalities. Several vaccines are in use to 
reduce the viral load to prevent developing symptoms. Major challenges to their 
efficacy include the inability of antibody molecules to enter cells but remain 
effective in the bloodstream to kill the virus. The efficacy of vaccines also 
depends on their neutralizing ability to constantly evolve new virus strains due 
to novel mutations and evolutionary survival dynamics. Taken together, SARS-CoV2 
antibody vaccines may not be very effective and other approaches based on 
genetic, genomic, and protein interactome could be fruitful to identify 
therapeutic targets to reduce disease-related mortalities."
1170,"Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3Ks) are lipid kinases that produce 
3-phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol upon activation by various 
cues. These 3-phosphorylated lipids bind to various protein effectors to control 
many cellular functions. Lipid phosphatases such as phosphatase and tensin 
homolog (PTEN) terminate PI3K-derived signals and are critical to ensure 
appropriate signaling outcomes. Many lines of evidence indicate that PI3Ks and 
PTEN, as well as some specific lipid effectors are highly compartmentalized, 
either in plasma membrane nanodomains or in endosomal compartments. We examine 
the evidence for specific recruitment of PI3Ks, PTEN, and other related enzymes 
to membrane nanodomains and endocytic compartments. We then examine the 
hypothesis that scaffolding of the sources (PI3Ks), terminators (PTEN), and 
effectors of these lipid signals with a common plasma membrane nanodomain may 
achieve highly localized lipid signaling and ensure selective activation of 
specific effectors. This highlights the importance of spatial regulation of PI3K 
signaling in various physiological and disease contexts."
1171,"The aberrant regulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells remains poorly understood. Here, 
the authors systematically investigate the endosomal trafficking of plasma 
membrane PD-L1 in tumor cells. They show that plasma membrane PD-L1 is 
continuously internalized, and then trafficked from early endosomes to 
multivesicular bodies/late endosomes, recycling endosomes, lysosomes, and/or 
extracellular vesicles (EVs). This constitutive endocytic trafficking of PD-L1 
is Rab5- and clathrin-dependent. Triazine compound 6J1 blocks the endosomal 
trafficking of PD-L1 and induces its accumulation in endocytic vesicles by 
activating Rab5. 6J1 also promotes exosomal PD-L1 secretion by activating Rab27. 
Together, these effects result in a decrease in the membrane level of PD-L1 in 
6J1-treated tumor cells and enables tumor cells to be more susceptible to the 
tumor-killing activity of T cells in vitro. 6J1 also increases 
tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells and promotes chemokines secretion in the 
tumor microenvironment. Rab27 knockdown abolishes 6J1-induced PD-L1 secretion in 
EVs and revokes the exhausted tumor-infiltrating T cells in tumors, thereby 
improving the anticancer efficacy of 6J1. Furthermore, a combination of 6J1 and 
an anti-PD-1 antibody significantly improves the anticancer immune response. 
Therefore, manipulating PD-L1 endosomal trafficking provides a promising means 
to promote an anticancer immune response in addition to the immune 
checkpoint-blocking antibody therapy."
1172,"The outcome of laser-triggered plasmons-induced phototherapy, including 
photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), is significantly 
limited by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and the upregulation of heat shock 
proteins (HSPs) in response to heat stress. Mitochondria, the biological battery 
of cells, can serve as an important breakthrough to overcome these obstacles. 
Herein, dendritic triangular pyramidal plasmonic CuPt alloys loaded with 
heat-sensitive NO donor N, N'-di-sec-butyl-N, N'-dinitroso-1,4-phenylenediamine 
(BNN) is developed. Under 808 nm laser irradiation, plasmonic CuPt can generate 
superoxide anion free radicals (·O2 - ) and heat simultaneously. The heat 
generated can then trigger the release of NO gas, which not only enables gas 
therapy but also damages the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Impaired 
mitochondrial respiration leads to reduced oxygen consumption and insufficient 
intracellular ATP supply, which effectively alleviates tumor hypoxia and 
undermines the synthesis of HSPs, in turn boosting plasmonic CuPt-based PDT and 
mild PTT. Additionally, the generated NO and ·O2 - can react to form more 
cytotoxic peroxynitrite (ONOO- ). This work describes a plasmonic CuPt@BNN (CPB) 
triggered closed-loop NO gas, free radicals, and mild photothermal therapy 
strategy that is highly effective at reciprocally promoting antitumor outcomes."
1173,"Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM), primarily produced in innate immune 
cells, exert crucial bioactions for resolving inflammation. Among various 
lipoxygenases (LOX), 15-LOX-1 is key for SPM biosynthesis, but cellular 
activation principles of 15-LOX-1 are unexplored. It was shown that 
3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) shifts 5-LOX regiospecificity from 5- 
to 12-lipoxygenation products. Here, it is demonstrated that AKBA additionally 
activates cellular 15-LOX-1 via an allosteric site accomplishing robust SPM 
formation in innate immune cells, particularly in M2 macrophages. Compared to 
ionophore, AKBA-induced LOX activation is Ca2+ - and 
phosphorylation-independent, with modest induction of 5-LOX products. AKBA docks 
into a groove between the catalytic and regulatory domains of 
15-LOX-1 interacting with R98; replacement of R98 by alanine abolishes 
AKBA-induced 15-LOX product formation in HEK293 cells. In zymosan-induced murine 
peritonitis, AKBA strikingly elevates SPM levels and promotes inflammation 
resolution. Together, targeted allosteric modulation of LOX activities governs 
SPM formation and offers new concepts for inflammation resolution 
pharmacotherapy."
1174,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular disease associated with 
significant phenotypic alterations in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). 
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a pore-forming effector of pyroptosis. In this study, the 
role of VSMC-specific GSDMD in the phenotypic alteration of VSMCs and AAA 
formation is determined. Single-cell transcriptome analyses reveal Gsdmd 
upregulation in aortic VSMCs in angiotensin (Ang) II-induced AAA. VSMC-specific 
Gsdmd deletion ameliorates Ang II-induced AAA in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- 
mice. Using untargeted metabolomic analysis, it is found that putrescine is 
significantly reduced in the plasma and aortic tissues of VSMC-specific GSDMD 
deficient mice. High putrescine levels trigger a pro-inflammatory phenotype in 
VSMCs and increase susceptibility to Ang II-induced AAA formation in mice. In a 
population-based study, a high level of putrescine in plasma is associated with 
the risk of AAA (p < 2.2 × 10-16 ), consistent with the animal data. 
Mechanistically, GSDMD enhances endoplasmic reticulum stress-C/EBP homologous 
protein (CHOP) signaling, which in turn promotes the expression of ornithine 
decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), the enzyme responsible for increased putrescine levels. 
Treatment with the ODC1 inhibitor, difluoromethylornithine, reduces AAA 
formation in Ang II-infused ApoE-/- mice. The findings suggest that putrescine 
is a potential biomarker and target for AAA treatment."
1175,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing technology (scRNA-seq) brings research to single-cell 
resolution. However, a major drawback of scRNA-seq is large sparsity, i.e. 
expressed genes with no reads due to technical noise or limited sequence depth 
during the scRNA-seq protocol. This phenomenon is also called 'dropout' events, 
which likely affect downstream analyses such as differential expression 
analysis, the clustering and visualization of cell subpopulations, cellular 
trajectory inference, etc. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method to 
identify and impute these dropout events. We propose Bubble, which first 
identifies dropout events from all zeros based on expression rate and 
coefficient of variation of genes within cell subpopulation, and then leverages 
an autoencoder constrained by bulk RNA-seq data to only impute those values. 
Unlike other deep learning-based imputation methods, Bubble fuses the matched 
bulk RNA-seq data as a constraint to reduce the introduction of false positive 
signals. Using simulated and several real scRNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate 
that Bubble enhances the recovery of missing values, gene-to-gene and 
cell-to-cell correlations, and reduces the introduction of false positive 
signals. Regarding some crucial downstream analyses of scRNA-seq data, Bubble 
facilitates the identification of differentially expressed genes, improves the 
performance of clustering and visualization, and aids the construction of 
cellular trajectory. More importantly, Bubble provides fast and scalable 
imputation with minimal memory usage."
1176,"Underlying medical conditions, such as cancer, kidney disease and heart failure, 
are associated with a higher risk for severe COVID-19. Accurate classification 
of COVID-19 patients with underlying medical conditions is critical for 
personalized treatment decision and prognosis estimation. In this study, we 
propose an interpretable artificial intelligence model termed VDJMiner to mine 
the underlying medical conditions and predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients 
according to their immune repertoires. In a cohort of more than 1400 COVID-19 
patients, VDJMiner accurately identifies multiple underlying medical conditions, 
including cancers, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, diabetes, 
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.961. Meanwhile, in this same cohort, VDJMiner 
achieves an AUC of 0.922 in predicting severe COVID-19. Moreover, VDJMiner 
achieves an accuracy of 0.857 in predicting the response of COVID-19 patients to 
tocilizumab treatment on the leave-one-out test. Additionally, VDJMiner 
interpretively mines and scores V(D)J gene segments of the T-cell receptors that 
are associated with the disease. The identified associations between single-cell 
V(D)J gene segments and COVID-19 are highly consistent with previous studies.

1177,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat to human health. Due to the prevalence 
of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), it is urgent to discover 
drugs with new mechanisms of action (MOA) to ensure effectiveness against 
strains that are resistant to existing TB drugs. Cynoglossum 
lanceolatum Forsk was used to treat TB in Traditional Chinese Medicine. In this 
paper, shikonin, the anti-Mtb active component, was obtained from the whole herb 
extract of C. lanceolatum by bioassay-guided isolation. Using the microplate 
alamar blue assay (MABA), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 
shikonin against Mtb was determined to be 128 μg/mL. In order to obtain a more 
efficient anti-Mtb molecule, 
(E)-1-(6-bromo-2,3-dihydrochromen-4-ylidene)thiosemicarbazide was synthesized 
based on the scaffold of shikonin, which exhibited potent activity against Mtb 
(MIC = 4 μg/mL). These results highlight that both naphthalene-1,4-dione and 
chroman-4-one are pharmacophores with activities against Mtb. To investigate a 
plausible mechanism of action, the molecular docking was firstly performed 
against catalase-peroxidase enzyme (KatG) of Mtb using AutoDock 4 software. The 
results demonstrated that both shikonin and 
(E)-1-(6-bromo-2,3-dihydrochromen-4-ylidene)thiosemicarbazide could bind to the 
active site of Mtb KatG. KatG enzyme activity and intracellular reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) levels in Mtb cells were then measured by ultraviolet 
spectrophotometric method and fluorescence microplate reader assay, 
respectively. The experiments confirmed that above compounds could inhibit the 
catalytic activity of Mtb KatG, and cause the ROS accumulation in Mtb cells. 
Therefore, inhibition of KatG may be a novel mechanism of action for these two 
compounds to fight against Mtb."
1178,"Mammary pathogenic Escherichia coli (MPEC) is one of the most common pathogens 
associated with clinical mastitis. We analyzed isolates obtained from milk 
samples of cows with clinical mastitis, collected from 10 farms in Brazil, to 
verify molecular and phenotypic characteristics. A total of 192 (4.5%) mammary 
pathogenic E. coli isolates were obtained from 4,275 milk samples analyzed, but 
we tested 161. We assigned most of these isolates to E. coli phylogroups B1 
(52.8%) and A (36.6%), although phylogroups B2, C, D, E, and unknown also 
occurred. All isolates were assessed for the presence of several genes encoding 
virulence factors, such as adhesins (sfaDE, papC, afaBC III, ecpA, fimH, papA, 
and iha), toxins (hlyA, cnf1, sat, vat, and cdt), siderophores (iroN, irp2, 
iucD, ireA, and sitA), an invasion protein (ibeA), and serum resistance proteins 
(traT, KpsMTII, and ompT), and isolates from phylogroups B1, B2, and E showed up 
to 8 genes. Two isolates harbored the locus of enterocyte effacement (escN+) and 
lack the bundle-forming pilus (bfpB-) operon, which corresponds to a molecular 
profile of a subgroup of diarrheagenic E. coli (aEPEC), thus being classified as 
hybrid MPEC/aEPEC isolates. These isolates displayed a localized adherence-like 
pattern of adherence in HeLa cells and were able to promote F-actin 
polymerization underneath adherent bacteria. Based on the pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis analyses, considerable genetic variability was observed. A low 
index of antimicrobial resistance was observed and 2 extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase-producing E. coli were identified, both harboring blaCTX-M15 gene, 
and were classified as ST10 and ST993 using multilocus sequence typing. A total 
of 148 (91.2%) isolates were weak biofilm producers or formed no biofilm. 
Because raw milk is still frequently consumed in Brazil, the occurrence of 
virulence factor-encoding genes from extraintestinal or diarrheagenic E. coli 
added to the presence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing isolates can 
turn this veterinary medicine problem into a public health concern."
1179,"INTRODUCTION: Interim response evaluation by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography/computed tomography (iPET) in diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) could be important to rule out disease progression and has been 
suggested to be predictive of survival. However, treatment guidance by iPET is 
not yet recommended for DLBCL in clinical practice. We aimed to compare the 
predictive value of iPET when utilizing the visual Deauville 5-point scale (DS) 
and the semiquantitative variation of maximum standardized uptake value 
(ΔSUVmax).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 85 patients diagnosed with DLBCL and 
uniformly treated with standard protocols. iPET with DS of 1-3 and/or ΔSUVmax 
≥66% was defined as negative. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression 
analyses were performed to determine the independent factors affecting 
progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) and to estimate PFS and 
OS.
RESULTS: iPET positivity, measured by DS or ΔSUVmax, showed predictive value of 
disease refractoriness, improved by combining DS and ΔSUVmax. After a median 
follow-up of 50.1 months, iPET was an independent predictor for both PFS and OS 
when interpreted by DS, but only for PFS by ΔSUVmax. Combined visual and 
semiquantitative analysis (D4-5 & ΔSUVmax<66%) was an independent predictor of 
PFS and OS, and allowed to identify an ultra-high-risk subgroup of patients with 
very dismal outcome, increasing the discriminating capacity for iPET.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that combined DS and ΔSUVmax in iPET assessment 
predicts refractory disease and distinguishes ultra-high-risk DLBCL patients 
with a very dismal prognosis, who may benefit from PET-guided therapy 
adjustment."
1180,"BACKGROUND: Although novel therapies improved prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) 
patients, clinical outcomes in the multi-refractory population are still poor.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from the Czech Registry of Monoclonal 
Gammopathies, identified and characterized triple-class exposed (3CE) 
relapsed/refractory MM patients, treatment patterns after 3CE, assessed overall 
survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to next treatment (TTNT), 
explored cohorts with and without triple- and penta-refractoriness.
RESULTS: In 83 3CE patients who started subsequent therapies, the median OS was 
14.2 months (95% CI, 8.5-19.9), PFS 6.2 months (95% CI, 3.9-8.5), and TTNT 7.2 
months (95% CI, 4.6-9.8). Triple- and penta-class refractory patients had a 
significantly worse prognosis in all outcomes. Their life expectancy was 
shorter, the disease progression started earlier, and the TTNT was shorter, 
which increased likelihood of becoming refractory to more therapies. 
Time-to-event results from the first index date and all index dates analyses 
were very similar.
CONCLUSION: Similar to previous studies from the US and Europe, our results show 
a high disease burden. Introduction of novel therapies, such as CAR-T cells, new 
bispecific and trispecific monoclonal antibodies, and other drugs, is expected 
to bring significant benefits to these patients."
1181,"Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (EOS) is a high grade soft tissue tumour 
characterised by the production of malignant osteoid, without 
attachment/involvement of underlying bone/periosteum. Rarely, EOS presents as a 
cutaneous tumour. The clinical behaviour of primary cutaneous EOS (PC-EOS) 
remains incompletely characterised. Herein we present the largest case series of 
PC-EOS reported to date. Sixteen PC-EOS cases from the archives/consultation 
files were retrieved (male:female 1:1; age 31-96 years, mean age 66 years). The 
tumours measured 1-10 cm (mean 3.2 cm) and were located on the lower extremity 
(7), head (6), upper extremity (2), and trunk (1). They consisted of 
pleomorphic, spindled-to-epithelioid cells, with fascicular, nodular, or 
sheet-like growth patterns and foci of malignant osteoid. Immunohistochemistry 
did not reveal specific lines of differentiation, and there was no evidence of 
other tumour types. A literature review was conducted to identify all well 
characterised cases of PC-EOS. A combined analysis of present and past cases was 
performed to determine overall trends in clinical characteristics and outcomes. 
The mean follow-up period was 23.9 months, during which 67.5% of patients 
experienced progression-free survival and 18% of patients died of disease. Rates 
of local recurrence and metastasis were 10% and 25%, respectively, approximately 
double past estimates. These data suggest that the prognosis of PC-EOS is less 
favourable than previously thought. The differential diagnosis includes benign 
entities (e.g., ossifying pyogenic granuloma) and malignant neoplasms with 
heterologous osteosarcomatous differentiation (e.g., carcinosarcoma, 
transdifferentiated melanoma). Wide excision remains the standard of care, and 
the role of chemotherapy and radiation remains inconclusive. Recognition of this 
rare entity can facilitate prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment."
1182,"RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the specific mechanism of umbilical cord mesenchymal 
stem cell-derived exosomes (UCMSC-exos) in regulating endometrial repair and 
regeneration?
DESIGN: In this study, UCMSC-exos were harvested by differential 
ultracentrifugation from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell culture 
supernatant and identified with western blotting, transmission electron 
microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Transforming growth factor-β1 
(TGFβ1) at different concentrations was used to construct the intrauterine 
adhesions cell model. The fibrotic markers were assessed by quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The effects of 
miR-145-5p over-expression on endometrial fibrosis were assessed. Dual 
luciferase assay was performed to verify the relationship between miR-145-5p and 
zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2).
RESULTS: The isolated UCMSC-exos had a typical cup-shaped morphology, expressed 
the specific exosomal markers Alix, CD63 and TSG101, and were approximately 
50-150 nm in diameter. TGFβ1 at 10 ng/ml significantly promoted endometrial 
fibrosis, which was reversed by 20 µg/ml UCMSC-exos. Exosomal miR-145-5p 
ameliorated TGFβ1-induced endometrial fibrosis. ZEB2 was inversely regulated by 
exosomal miR-145-5p as a direct target.
CONCLUSIONS: UCMSC-exos might reverse endometrial stromal cell fibrosis by 
regulating the miR-145-5p/ZEB2 axis, representing a potential novel strategy to 
promote endometrial repair."
1183,"In mice and humans, Nik-related protein kinase (Nrk) is an X-linked gene that 
encodes a serine/threonine kinase belonging to GCK group 4. Nrk knockout (Nrk 
KO) mice exhibit delayed delivery, possibly due to defective communication 
between the Nrk KO conceptus and its mother. However, the mechanism of delayed 
labor remains largely unknown. Here, we found that in pregnant mothers with the 
Nrk KO conceptus, the serum progesterone (P4) and placental lactogen (PL-2) 
concentrations in late pregnancy were higher than those in the wild type. 
Moreover, we demonstrated that Nrk is expressed in trophoblast giant cells 
(TGCs) and syncytiotrophoblast-2 (SynT-2) in the labyrinth layer of the mouse 
placenta. In the human placenta, NRK is also expressed in Syn-T of villi. Both 
human Syn-T and mouse TGCs of the labyrinth layer are present within fetal 
tissues that are in direct contact with the maternal blood. The labyrinth layer 
of the Nrk KO conceptus was gigantic, with enlarged cytoplasm and Golgi bodies 
in the TGCs. To investigate the function of Nrk in the labyrinth layer, a 
differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed. The DEG analysis 
revealed that labor-promoting factors, such as prostaglandins, were decreased, 
and pregnancy-maintaining factors, such as the prolactin family and P4 receptor, 
were increased. These findings suggest that the Nrk KO mice exhibit delayed 
delivery owing to high P4 concentrations caused by the hypersecretion of 
pregnancy-maintaining factors, such as PL-2, from the placenta."
1184,"Prophylaxis against COVID-19 is greatly needed for vulnerable populations who 
have a higher risk of developing severe disease. Vaccines and neutralizing 
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are currently the main approaches to preventing 
the virus infection. However, the constant mutation of SARS-CoV-2 poses a huge 
challenge to the effectiveness of these prophylactic strategies. A recent study 
suggested that downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the 
receptor of SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, can decrease susceptibility to 
viral infection in vitro, in vivo, and in human lungs and livers perfused ex 
situ. These findings indicate the potential to use agents to reduce ACE2 
expression to prevent COVID-19, but the efficacy and safety should be verified 
in clinical trials. Considering ACE2 performs physiological functions, risks due 
to its downregulation and benefits from prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
should be carefully weighed. In the future, updating vaccines against variants 
of SARS-CoV-2 might still be an important strategy for prophylaxis against 
COVID-19. Soluble recombinant human ACE2 that acts as a decoy receptor might be 
an option to overcome the mutation of SARS-CoV-2."
1185,"In the fermentative production of compounds by using microorganisms, control of 
the transporter activity responsible for substrate uptake and product efflux, in 
addition to intracellular metabolic modification, is important from a 
productivity perspective. However, there has been little progress in analyses of 
the functions of microbial membrane transporters, and because of the difficulty 
in finding transporters that transport target compounds, only a few transporters 
have been put to practical use. Here, we constructed a Corynebacterium 
glutamicum-derived transporter expression library (CgTP-Express library) with 
the fusion partner gene mstX and used a peptide-feeding method with the 
dipeptide L-Ala-L-Ala to search for alanine exporters in the library. Among 39 
genes in the library, five candidate alanine exporters (NCgl2533, NCgl2683, 
NCgl0986, NCgl0453, and NCgl0929) were found; expression of NCgl2533 increased 
the alanine concentration in cell culture. The CgTP-Express library was thus 
effective for finding a new transporter candidate."
1186,"The remote bactericidal effect of TiO2 photocatalyst, i.e., the bactericidal 
effect away from the photocatalyst, was successfully achieved using a humidified 
airflow. The TiO2 photocatalyst used was anatase-type TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) 
annealed with a low-temperature O2 plasma. For comparison, anatase-type TiO2 NPs 
annealed in the air were used. The bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, were placed away 
from the TiO2 NPs. The plasma-assisted-annealed TiO2 NPs significantly 
inactivated 99% of the bacterial cells in 5 h, whereas the pristine and 
air-annealed TiO2 NPs inactivated 88-90% of the bacterial cells. The remote 
bactericidal effect of plasmaassisted-annealed TiO2 NPs would be attributed to a 
larger amount of H2O2 molecules traveled by the airflow from the TiO2 NPs. The 
molecules were generated by chemically reacting more photoexcited carriers on 
the TiO2 surface with H2O and O2 in the airflow. These photoexcited carriers 
originated from more oxygen-based species adsorbed and more oxygen vacancies 
introduced on the TiO2 surface by the plasma-assisted-annealing."
1187,"The function of the dopamine transporter (DAT) is regulated by membrane 
cholesterol content. A direct, acute removal of membrane cholesterol by 
methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) has been shown to reduce dopamine (DA) uptake and 
release mediated by the DAT. This is of particular interest because a few widely 
prescribed statins that lower peripheral cholesterol levels are blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) penetrants, and therefore could alter DAT function through brain 
cholesterol modulation. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of 
prolonged atorvastatin treatment (24 h) on DAT function in neuroblastoma 2A 
cells stably expressing DAT. We found that atorvastatin treatment effectively 
lowered membrane cholesterol content in a concentration-dependent manner. 
Moreover, atorvastatin treatment markedly reduced DA uptake and abolished 
cocaine inhibition of DA uptake, independent of surface DAT levels. These 
deficits induced by atorvastatin treatment were reversed by cholesterol 
replenishment. However, atorvastatin treatment did not change amphetamine 
(AMPH)-induced DA efflux. This is in contrast to a small but significant 
reduction in DA efflux induced by acute depletion of membrane cholesterol using 
MβCD. This discrepancy may involve differential changes in membrane lipid 
composition resulting from chronic and acute cholesterol depletion. Our data 
suggest that the outward-facing conformation of DAT, which favors the binding of 
DAT blockers such as cocaine, is more sensitive to atorvastatin-induced 
cholesterol depletion than the inward-facing conformation, which favors the 
binding of DAT substrates such as AMPH. Our study on statin-DAT interactions may 
have clinical implications in our understanding of neurological side effects 
associated with chronic use of BBB penetrant statins."
1188,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine the prognostic value of a 
pre-treatment peripheral blood signature and the peripheral blood 
signature-based nomogram for patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma (NPC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected 21 peripheral blood 
indicators from patients with NPC between 2004 and 2015. Data were randomly 
divided into a training and a validation set (ratio: 6:4). The peripheral blood 
signature was constructed based on candidate biomarkers using the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression model. Multivariable logistic 
regression was applied to identify the independent risk factors of overall 
survival to build the nomogram. The predictive value of the peripheral blood 
nomogram was evaluated using time-dependent area under the curve, decision curve 
analysis, and calibration curve.
RESULTS: In total, 6668 patients were enrolled with 4000 and 2668 in the 
training and validation cohorts, respectively. Four peripheral blood indicators, 
(white blood cell count, lymphocyte percentage, haemoglobin, and mean platelet 
volume), were included to construct the peripheral blood signature. Patients 
were divided into low- and high-risk groups using an optimal cut-off value of 
-1.71142. Patients in the high-risk group had significantly lower overall, 
distant metastasis-free, and progression-free survival than patients in the 
low-risk group in both cohorts (P < 0.05). We constructed and validated a 
peripheral blood signature-based nomogram in combination with five vital 
clinical characteristics, (age, sex, tumour stage, nodal stage, and 
pre-treatment Epstein-Barr virus DNA), which showed favourable performance.
CONCLUSION: Patients with NPC with different outcomes could be distinguished 
based on their peripheral blood signature score; the proposed peripheral blood 
signature-based nomogram offers individualised risk estimation."
1189,"OBJECTIVE: The liver-derived circulating PCSK9 enhances the degradation of the 
LDL receptor (LDLR) in endosomes/lysosomes. PCSK9 inhibition or silencing is 
presently used in clinics worldwide to reduce LDL-cholesterol, resulting in 
lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and possibly cancer/metastasis. The 
mechanism by which the PCSK9-LDLR complex is sorted to degradation compartments 
is not fully understood. We previously suggested that out of the three M1, M2 
and M3 subdomains of the C-terminal Cys/His-rich-domain (CHRD) of PCSK9, only M2 
is critical for the activity of extracellular of PCSK9 on cell surface LDLR. 
This likely implicates the binding of M2 to an unknown membrane-associated 
""protein X"" that would escort the complex to endosomes/lysosomes for 
degradation. We reported that a nanobody P1.40 binds the M1 and M3 domains of 
the CHRD and inhibits the function of PCSK9. It was also reported that the 
cytosolic adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) could bind M1 and M3 
subdomains and enhance the activity of PCSK9. In this study, we determined the 
3-dimensional structure of the CHRD-P1.40 complex to understand the intricate 
interplay between P1.40, CAP1 and PCSK9 and how they regulate LDLR degradation.
METHODS: X-ray diffraction of the CHRD-P1.40 complex was analyzed with a 2.2 Å 
resolution. The affinity and interaction of PCSK9 or CHRD with P1.40 or CAP1 was 
analyzed by atomic modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, bio-layer 
interferometry, expression in hepatic cell lines and immunocytochemistry to 
monitor LDLR degradation. The CHRD-P1.40 interaction was further analyzed by 
deep mutational scanning and binding assays to validate the role of predicted 
critical residues. Conformational changes and atomic models were obtained by 
small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).
RESULTS: We demonstrate that PCSK9 exists in a closed or open conformation and 
that P1.40 favors the latter by binding key residues in the M1 and M3 subdomains 
of the CHRD. Our data show that CAP1 is well secreted by hepatic cells and binds 
extracellular PCSK9 at distinct residues in the M1 and M3 modules and in the 
acidic prodomain. CAP1 stabilizes the closed conformation of PCSK9 and prevents 
P1.40 binding. However, CAP1 siRNA only partially inhibited PCSK9 activity on 
the LDLR. By modeling the previously reported interaction between M2 and an 
R-X-E motif in HLA-C, we identified Glu567 and Arg549 as critical M2 residues 
binding HLA-C. Amazingly, these two residues are also required for the 
PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals that CAP1 enhances the function of PCSK9, 
likely by twisting the protein into a closed configuration that exposes the M2 
subdomain needed for targeting the PCSK9-LDLR complex to degradation 
compartments. We hypothesize that ""protein X"", which is expected to guide the 
LDLR-PCSK9-CAP1 complex to these compartments after endocytosis into 
clathrin-coated vesicles, is HLA-C or a similar MHC-I family member. This 
conclusion is supported by the PCSK9 natural loss-of-function Q554E and 
gain-of-function H553R M2 variants, whose consequences are anticipated by our 
modeling."
1190,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac myxomatous aneurysms (CMA) are intracranial aneurysms caused 
by cardiac myxoma (CM). The exact mechanism underlying their development has not 
yet been elucidated. And an optimal treatment method has not yet been 
established because of rarity of the disease. In addition, most existing reports 
have had a short follow-up period or lack of follow-up imaging test results. The 
aim of this study was to provide better insights into the course and treatment 
options of CMAs.
METHODS: We describe four CMA patients treated in our hospital. And literature 
search was performed using PubMed and Embase. Keywords used were as follows: 
""cerebral myxomatous aneurysm"", ""myxomatous aneurysm"", ""cardiac myxoma"", and 
""intracranial aneurysm"". Only publications in English and related to this 
disorder with adequate follow-up periods and aneurysmal wall biopsy results were 
included. Clinical, radiological, pathological, and treatment characteristics 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 134 CMA cases were managed conservatively that included 5 
enlargements, 6 regressions, and 120 stable aneurysms were identified for a 
total of 453.33 aneurysm-years (1.76% per aneurysm-year, 1.32% per 
aneurysm-year, and 26.47% per aneurysm-year, respectively). Poor outcome rate 
was high in cases with hemorrhage (either parenchymal or SAH) due to rupture of 
the CMA (46.67%, 7 out of 15). Thirteen cases had aneurysm biopsy results of 
which 11 showed tumor invasion on the aneurysm wall.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though the natural course of unruptured, benign-looking CMAs 
appears to be favorable, the presence or absence of viable tumor cells in the 
aneurysm may promote an unfavorable disease course. In the case of large, 
symptomatic, and enlarging CMAs, surgical, endovascular, or combined treatment 
should be considered as the mortality and morbidity due to rupture might be 
high."
1191,"The growth and development in Tribolium castaneum were poorly understood at the 
transcriptome level. Currently, we identified 15,756, 9941 and 10,080 
differentially expressed transcripts between late eggs VS early larvae, late 
larvae VS early pupae, and late pupae VS early adults of T. castaneum by 
RNA-seq, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis on nine genes expression. 
Functional enrichment analysis indicated that DNA replication, cell cycle and 
insect hormone biosynthesis significantly enriched differentially expressed 
genes. The transcription of DNA replication and cell cycle genes decreased after 
hatching but increased after pupation. The juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroid 
biosynthesis genes decreased after hatching, and the JH degradation genes were 
stimulated after pupation and eclosion while the ecdysteroid degradation gene 
CYP18A1 decreased after pupation. Silencing CYP18A1 elevated the titer of 
ecdysteroids and caused developmental arrest at the late larval stage. This 
study promotes the understanding of insect growth and development."
1192,"BACKGROUND: Heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) people with HIV (PWH) may not 
achieve virologic suppression (VS) with combination antiretroviral therapy due 
to multi-drug resistance (MDR), intolerance, and safety concerns. These PWH 
often receive highly individualized treatment regimens, but these regimens may 
not enable PWH to achieve VS, thereby halting disease progression. Novel 
medications are required for treating individuals with MDR HIV. Lenacapavir 
(LEN), a first-in-class HIV capsid inhibitor, is under investigation for the 
treatment of HTE individuals with MDR HIV in the Phase 2/3 CAPELLA study.
OBJECTIVE: To compare LEN plus optimized background regimen (OBR) with 
fostemsavir (FTR)+OBR, ibalizumab (IBA)+OBR and OBR alone in terms of VS, CD4 
cell count change from baseline (CFB), immunologic recovery, and discontinuation 
due to adverse events, using indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs).
METHODS: A systematic review identified clinical evidence on HIV-1 treatments in 
HTE PWH. A feasibility assessment evaluated the identified studies for ITC 
analyses based on population characteristics, interventions, comparators, and 
outcomes of interest. Unanchored simulated treatment comparisons (STCs) of 
LEN+OBR versus comparators were conducted.
RESULTS: LEN+OBR had 6.57 times higher odds of VS at Week 24-28 than FTR+OBR 
(95% CI: 1.34, 32.28), 8.93 times higher odds of VS than IBA+OBR (95% CI: 2.07, 
38.46), and 12.74 times higher odds of VS than OBR alone (95% CI: 1.70, 95.37). 
CFB in CD4 cell count was similar across LEN+OBR, FTR+OBR and IBA+OBR.
CONCLUSION: LEN+OBR has statistically significantly greater odds of VS at Week 
24-28 than its comparators and represents a novel treatment for people with MDR 
HIV.
HIGHLIGHTS: Available evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of different 
therapies in HTE PWH is sparse. This is the first analysis that provides 
comparative treatment estimates which can be used alongside other outcomes to 
support decisions regarding the care of people with MDR HIV. We have shown that 
LEN+OBR is favored over key comparators in terms of achieving VS, and therefore 
has potential to reduce the burden associated with virologic failure in people 
with MDR HIV."
1193,"Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is a diagnosis which denotes the 
coexistence of pigmentary and vascular birthmarks of specific types, accompanied 
by variable multisystem involvement including central nervous system disease, 
asymmetrical growth and a predisposition to malignancy. Using a tightly 
phenotyped group and high depth next generation sequencing of affected tissues 
we discover here clonal mosaic variants in gene PTPN11 encoding SHP2 phosphatase 
as a cause of PPV type III or spilorosea. Within an individual the same variant 
is found in distinct pigmentary and vascular birthmarks and is undetectable in 
blood. We go on to demonstrate that the same variants can cause either the 
specific pigmentary or vascular phenotypes alone, as well as driving melanoma 
development within the pigmentary lesion. Protein conformational modelling 
highlights that while variants lead to loss of function at the level of the 
phosphatase domain, resultant conformational changes promote longer ligand 
binding. In vitro modelling of the missense variants confirms downstream MAPK 
pathway overactivation, and widespread disruption of human endothelial cell 
angiogenesis. Importantly, PTPN11-mosaic patients theoretically risk passing on 
the variant to their children as the germline RASopathy Noonan syndrome with 
lentigines. These findings improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and 
biology of naevus spilus and capillary malformation syndromes, paving the way 
for better clinical management."
1194,"Zika virus became a public health concern when it re-emerged in 2015, due to its 
ability to cause congenital deformities in foetus and neurological complications 
in adults. Despite extensive data on protection, the interplay of protective and 
pathogenic adaptive immune responses towards ZIKV infection remains poorly 
understood. In this study, using a T-cell deficient mouse model that retains 
persistent ZIKV viral titres in the blood and organs, we show that adoptive 
transfer of CD8+ T-cells led to a significant reduction in viral load. This 
animal model reveals that ZIKV can induce grossly visible auricular dermatitis 
and blepharitis, mediated by ZIKV-specific CD8+ T-cells. Single cell RNA 
sequencing of these causative CD8+ T-cells from the ears show an overactivated 
and elevated cytotoxic signature in mice with severe symptoms. Our results 
strongly suggest a role for CD8+ T-cell associated pathologies post-ZIKV 
infection in CD4+ T-cell immunodeficient patients."
1195,"Ventilator-induced Lung Injury (VILI) is characterized by hypoxia, inflammatory 
cytokine influx, loss of alveolar barrier integrity, and decreased lung 
compliance. Aging influences lung structure and function and is a predictive 
factor in the severity of VILI; however, the mechanisms of aging that influence 
the progression or increased susceptibility remain unknown. Aging impacts immune 
system function and may increase inflammation in healthy individuals. Recent 
studies suggest that the bioactive sphingolipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate 
(S1P) and the enzyme that degrades it S1P lyase (SPL) may be involved in lung 
pathologies including acute lung injury. It is unknown whether aging influences 
S1P and SPL expression that have been implicated in lung inflammation, injury, 
and cell apoptosis. We hypothesized that aging and injurious mechanical 
ventilation synergistically impair S1P levels and enhance S1P lyase (SPL) 
expression that amplifies alveolar barrier damage and diminishes pulmonary 
function. Young (2-3 mo) and old (20-25 mo) C57BL/6 mice were mechanically 
ventilated for 2 h using pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation (PCMV) at 45 
cmH2O and 35 cmH2O, respectively. We assessed the impact of aging and PCMV on 
several indications of acute lung injury, immune cell recruitment, S1P levels 
and SPL activity. Furthermore, we evaluated the protective effects of inhibiting 
SPL by tetrahydroxybutylimidazol (THI) administration on the negative outcomes 
associated with aging and mechanical injury. PCMV exacerbated lung injury in old 
mice and increased neutrophil influx that was further exacerbated due to aging. 
SPL expression increased in the young and old ventilated mice and the old 
nonventilated group. THI treatment reduced several of the indicators of lung 
injury and resulted in elevated S1P levels in lung tissue and plasma from mice 
that were injured from mechanical ventilation. CD80 and CD206 activation markers 
of alveolar and interstitial macrophages were also influenced by THI. SPL 
inhibition may be a viable therapeutic approach for patients requiring 
mechanical ventilation by preventing or regulating the exaggerated inflammatory 
response and reducing lung injury."
1196,"The co-occurrence of nanoplastics and other pollutants in the environment has 
gotten a lot of attention, but information on the biological toxicity of their 
co-exposure was limited. This study aims to reveal the endocrine disrupting 
effect and reproductive toxicity of nano-polystyrene (NPS) and 
diethylstilbestrol (DES) to zebrafish under separate and combined exposure. 
Results indicated that NPS and DES exposure in isolation reduced the 
hepatosomatic index and gonadosomatic index, and altered the cell maturity in 
gonads in both cases. Even worse, the co-exposure of NPS and DES exacerbated the 
damage to the liver and gonads of fish. The two pollutants individually 
inhibited the secretion of sex hormones and vitellogenin. The inhibition effect 
of DES was especially dose-dependent, while NPS had weaker effect than DES. 
Their combined action on the secretion of sex hormones and vitellogenin 
exhibited additive effect. However, NPS did not affect the content of thyroid 
hormones in fish, and also had no significant effect on the reduction of thyroid 
hormone caused by DES exposure. Furthermore, their co-exposure decreased the 
cumulative eggs from 1031 to 306, and the spawning number from 12 to 8. The 
fertilization rate and hatchability rete of eggs were reduced by 30.9 % and 
40.4 %, respectively. The abnormality rate of embryos was 65.0 %, significantly 
higher than in separate DES and NPS groups (55.7 % and 30.8 % respectively). The 
abnormal development of offspring was mainly pericardial cyst, spinal curvature, 
and growth retardation."
1197,"Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5) plays an important biological 
function in immune defense and is highly expressed in activated macrophages, 
osteoclasts and dendritic cells. In teleost, the functionality of ACP5 remains 
to be revealed. In this study, we cloned and identified SoACP5 from red drum 
(Sciaenops ocellatus) and analyzed its function in vivo and in vitro. The open 
reading frame of SoACP5 is 1002 bp in length, encoding 333 amino acids. SoACP5 
shares high sequence identities (96.70%-49.25%) with ACP5 of other species. The 
SoACP5 mRNA was widely distributed in collected tissues of healthy red drum, and 
with the maximum in gills. The expression of SoACP5 increased significantly in 
vivo following challenge with Edwardsiella tarda. Moreover, the recombinant 
SoACP5 protein (rSoACP5) was purified with his-tag band resin columns, and 
confirmed to have phosphatase activity which was optimal at pH 5 and 55 °C. 
Various metal ions (K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+ and Fe3+) have 
different effects on phosphatase activity. rSoACP5 induced the cellular 
proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes. The over-expression and knockdown 
of SoACP5 in vivo had a significant effect on bacterial proliferation. 
Furthermore, both of the antibacterial activity and phosphatase activity were 
decreased when the reducedSoACP5 was oxidized by H2O2. In summary, the present 
study indicated that SoACP5 is likely involved in host defense against bacterial 
infection in S. ocellatus."
1198,"We have previously shown that the CBb subunit of crotoxin, a β-neurotoxin with 
phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity, targets the human ΔF508CFTR chloride channel 
implicated in cystic fibrosis (CF). By direct binding to the nucleotide binding 
domain 1 (NBD1) of ΔF508CFTR, this neurotoxic PLA2 acts as a potentiator 
increasing chloride channel current and corrects the trafficking defect of 
misfolded ΔF508CFTR inside the cell. Here, for a therapeutics development of new 
anti-cystic fibrosis agents, we use a structure-based in silico approach to 
design peptides mimicking the CBb-ΔF508NBD1 interface. Combining biophysical and 
electrophysiological methods, we identify several peptides that interact with 
the ΔF508NBD1 domain and reveal their effects as potentiators on phosphorylated 
ΔF508CFTR. Moreover, protein-peptide interactions and electrophysiological 
studies allowed us to identify key residues of ΔF508NBD1 governing the 
interactions with the novel potentiators. The designed peptides bind to the same 
region as CBb phospholipase A2 on ΔF508NBD1 and potentiate chloride channel 
activity. Certain peptides also show an additive effect towards the clinically 
approved VX-770 potentiator. The identified CF therapeutics peptides represent a 
novel class of CFTR potentiators and illustrate a strategy leading to 
reproducing the effect of specific protein-protein interactions."
1199,"Understanding of how energetically unfavorable plasma membrane shapes form, 
especially in a context of living cells or tissues and dynamic processes such as 
clathrin-mediated endocytosis is at its beginning. Even though cutting-edge 
microscopy techniques that could bridge this gap exists, they remain underused 
in biomedical sciences. Here, we demystify the perceived complexity of advanced 
microscopy approaches and demonstrate their power into resolving nanometer axial 
dynamics in living cells. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy 
based approaches are a main focus of this review. We present clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis as a model system when describing the principles, data acquisition 
requirements, data interpretation strategies as well as limitations of described 
tools. We hope that this standardized way of describing total internal 
reflection fluorescence based advanced microscopy techniques will bring them 
closer to the potential users and help in choosing the right approach to the 
right question."
1200,"BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease in Asia, caused by 
Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot). From Nepal, only scant data on the genetic 
epidemiology of this agent is available, and determinants of immunoregulation 
are poorly understood.
METHODS: Patients (n=238) referred to the National Public Health Laboratory 
(Kathmandu, Nepal) from all over Nepal for suspected scrub typhus were enrolled 
upon positive IgM testing between July and October 2015. From Ot 16S and 47 kD 
PCR-positive samples, the variable domain I of the 56 kD gene was sequenced and 
phylogenetically analysed. T helper cell-associated cytokines (n=13) and 
chemokines (n=12) were quantified by multiplex bead arrays.
RESULTS: In 93/238 (39.1%) IgM-positive samples, Ot DNA was detected by qPCR. 
Phylogenetic analysis of 56 kD sequences revealed 7 distinct clusters, 6 of them 
with high homologies to strains detected in other countries. The Th1-related 
cytokines IFN-γ and CXCL10 were strongly upregulated and correlated with 
bacteremia, while levels of Th2-associated chemokines were reduced. Bacteremia 
also correlated with concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10, but not TNF-α.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a considerable genetic heterogeneity of 
human-pathogenic Ot strains circulating in Nepal. Acute Nepalese scrub typhus 
patients showed strong Th1 but impaired Th2 responses, especially on the 
chemokine level."
1201,"INTRODUCTION: Moyamoya has been extensively described in East Asian populations, 
and despite its accepted clinical presentation and course, it is fundamental to 
describe major cerebrovascular complications in other ethnically diverse 
samples. Hence, we sought to determine if distinct ethnic groups are at higher 
risk of developing stroke using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.
METHODS: We included all moyamoya patients admitted from January 2013 until 
December 2018 in the NIS database. Multivariate regression analysis was used to 
determine the risk of developing stroke and poor outcomes in different races 
compared to white patients.
RESULTS: Out of the 6093 admissions with diagnosis of moyamoya disease that were 
captured, 2,520 were white (41.6%), 2,078 were African American (AA) (34.1%), 
721 were Hispanic (11.8%), and 496 were Asian (8.14%). For arterial ischemic 
stroke (AIS), we found that AA race had a significantly reduced risk of AIS 
compared to white patients (odds ratio = 0.8, 95% confidence interval: 0.7-0.9, 
p = 0.031). While being Hispanic or Asian significantly increased 1.5 and 2-fold 
the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the unique features and phenotypes of moyamoya 
cases among different ethnicities. While possibly AA are protected from 
developing AIS due to underlying causes of moyamoya such as sickle cell disease, 
Asians seems to be more susceptible to hemorrhagic stroke."
1202,"Conventional techniques for in vitro cancer drug screening require 
labor-intensive formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and dye staining of tumor 
tissues at fixed endpoints. This way of assessment discards the valuable 
pharmacodynamic information in live cells over time. Here, we found endogenous 
lipofuscin-like autofluorescence acutely accumulated in the cell death process. 
Its unique red autofluorescence could report the apoptosis without labeling and 
continuously monitor the treatment responses in 3D tumor-culture models. 
Lifetime imaging of lipofuscin-like red autofluorescence could further 
distinguish necrosis from apoptosis of cells. Moreover, this endogenous 
fluorescent marker could visualize the apoptosis in live zebrafish embryos 
during development. Overall, this study validates that lipofuscin-like 
autofluorophore is a generic cell death marker. Its characteristic 
autofluorescence could label-free predict the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs in 
organoids or animal models."
1203,"Fibrosis, defined as an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix, is the 
end point of a defective regenerative process, unresolved inflammation and/or 
chronic damage. Numerous muscle disorders (MD) are characterized by high levels 
of fibrosis associated with muscle wasting and weakness. Fibrosis alters muscle 
homeostasis/regeneration and fiber environment and may interfere with gene and 
cell therapies. Slowing down or reversing fibrosis is a crucial therapeutic goal 
to maintain muscle identity in the context of therapies. Several pathways are 
implicated in the modulation of the fibrotic progression and multiple 
therapeutic compounds targeting fibrogenic signals have been tested in MDs, 
mostly in the context of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. In this review, we present 
an up-to-date overview of pharmacotherapies that have been tested to reduce 
fibrosis in the skeletal muscle."
1204,"In order to form follicles and ovulate normally, there must be abundant blood 
vessels. Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (AS), as a traditional Chinese 
medicinal herb, has the effects of tonifying the blood and activating the blood 
circulation. However, the effect of AS on angiogenesis in hen-follicles remains 
to be discovered. In this study, we identified vascular richness, granulosa 
layer thickness, expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 
(CD31) and the content of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in 
granulosa layers to elucidate the effect of AS extract on angiogenesis in 
preovulatory follicles (F1-F3) of late-phase laying hens (75 wk). Based on 
network pharmacology, we predicted beta-sitosterol, ferulic acid, and caffeic 
acid as the main active components of AS, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α 
(HIF1α), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) as hub targets 
of AS in angiogenesis. The intersection targets were enriched by Gene Ontology 
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and the hub 
targets were verified by immunofluorescence and western blot. Molecular docking 
of active components with hub targets was performed and verified in vitro. The 
results showed that AS extract promoted angiogenesis in preovulatory follicles 
and increased granulosa cell layer thickness, CD31 expression and content of 
VEGFA. Experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that AS extract promoted 
the expression of HIF1α and VEGFA, up-regulated the phosphorylation levels of 
VEGFR2. These results further demonstrated the reliability of molecular docking 
and network pharmacology findings. In summary, AS extract can promote 
angiogenesis in the preovulatory follicles in late-phase laying hens."
1205,"Herein, we conducted a comparative study on the embryotoxicity of ochratoxin A 
(OTA) and its diastereomer 2'R-ochratoxin A (2'R-OTA) under in ovo conditions, 
as well as assess the in vitro embryotoxicity of these substances together with 
ochratoxin B and α-ochratoxin, using chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) embryo 
cell lines. In ovo tests involved egg incubation of 8 different groups (i.e., 
control ""0""-no puncture or injection (standard incubation); ""00""-punctured eggs 
without injection; ""OTA 0.25,"" ""OTA 0.50,"" ""OTA 0.75,"" ""2'R-OTA 0.25,"" ""2'R-OTA 
0.50,"" ""2'R-OTA 0.75""-eggs containing OTA or 2'R-OTA at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 
µg/egg concentration, respectively). The results confirmed OTA's impact on early 
and late embryo mortality, where chick hatchability decreased with increasing 
toxin dosage. Both OTA and 2'R-OTA demonstrated embryotoxicity, however, in the 
case of the highest OTA diastereomer dose, nearly 11% higher chick hatchability 
was observed compared with the group that received OTA. 2'R-OTA dosage did not 
reduce parameters chick quality compared to chicks hatched from control group 
eggs. OTA concentrations were higher than 2'R-OTA detected in chicken organs 
such as liver and kidney, whereas 2'R-OTA concentrations were higher in blood 
serum and heart. The presented studies highlighted the differences in the 
ability to accumulate toxins in certain organs, which, to a certain extent, may 
affect the potential toxicity on individual organs. Additionally, during in 
vitro tests, when assessing the cytotoxic effects of OTA and its analogues 
toward the chicken embryonic cell line in an MTT assay, the cell metabolic 
activity was inhibited to a comparable extent at 27-times higher concentration 
of 2'R-OTA than OTA (0.24 µM). Also, comparably lower toxicity was attributed to 
the remaining OTA derivatives."
1206,"It is generally accepted herbal polysaccharide and is a bioactive compound of 
herbal medicines with immunomodulatory activities. It has a wide range of 
pharmacological effects. It can be used as a green substitute for antibiotics or 
as a feed additive in quail breeding. Therefore, the herbal polysaccharide has a 
broader and safer application prospect. The immunosuppressive disease of quail 
is one of the most important infectious diseases. It seriously affects the 
growth, development, and production performance of quail, causing huge economic 
losses to quail industry. However, there is no report on the effective 
alleviation of spleen injury in immunosuppressed animals by herbal 
polysaccharide. Therefore, we established a pathological model of 
immunosuppressive Chinese yellow quail for the first time, with the Terminalia 
chebula Retz polysaccharide (TCP) as the control, and histological observation, 
TUNEL staining were used to study the effects of Rubia cordifolia L. processed 
Terminalia chebula Retz polysaccharide (RTCP) on splenic tissue structure and 
apoptosis of immunosuppressed Chinese yellow quail. The experimental results 
showed that spleen organ index of the cyclophosphamide (CTX) group was 
significantly lower than these of blank control group, the TCP group and the 
RTCP group (P < 0.05). And the number of splenic nodules in the CTX group was 
significantly lower than that in the blank control group (P < 0.01). Compared 
with the CTX group, the spleen volume of the TCP group and the RTCP group 
increased, and the number and area of spleen nodules increased. Among them, the 
spleen nodules in the RTCP group were significantly more higher than that in the 
CTX group (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, TUNEL staining showed that the TUNEL positive 
cells in the CTX group were the most significantly higher than those in the 
blank control group (P < 0.01). TCP group and RTCP group were significantly 
higher than the blank control group (P < 0.01), but significantly lower than CTX 
group (P < 0.05). All these results suggested that RTCP could effectively 
improve CTX-induced spleen damage in immunosuppressed Chinese yellow quails by 
promoting the recovery of spleen organ index, repairing the spleen tissue 
structure, and diminishing the apoptosis. Moreover, RTCP is more effective than 
TCP. The results prove that the efficacy of RTCP in protecting spleen from CTX 
induced injury was enhanced after processing with Rubia cordifolia L. Therefore, 
our findings will provide more possibilities to promote the clinical application 
and development of processed traditional Chinese medicine in the further."
1207,"In all cell types, mitochondrial biogenesis is balanced with mitophagy to 
maintain a healthy mitochondrial pool that sustains specific energetic demands. 
Cell types that have a higher energetic burden, such as skeletal muscle cells 
and cardiomyocytes, will subsequently develop high mitochondrial volumes. In 
these cells, calcium influx during activity triggers cascades leading to 
activation of the co-transcriptional regulation factor PGC-1α, a master 
regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, in a well-defined pathway. Despite the 
advantages in ATP production, high mitochondrial volumes might prove to be 
perilous, as it increases exposure to reactive oxygen species produced during 
oxidative phosphorylation. Mechanosensory hair cells are highly metabolically 
active cells, with high total mitochondrial volumes to meet that demand. 
However, the mechanisms leading to expansion and maintenance of the hair cell 
mitochondrial pool are not well defined. Calcium influx during 
mechanotransduction and synaptic transmission regulate hair cell mitochondria, 
leading to a possibility that similar to skeletal muscle and cardiomyocytes, 
intracellular calcium underlies the expansion of the hair cell mitochondrial 
volume. This review briefly summarizes the potential mechanisms underlying 
mitochondrial biogenesis in other cell types and in hair cells. We propose that 
hair cell mitochondrial biogenesis is primarily product of cellular 
differentiation rather than calcium influx, and that the hair cell high 
mitochondrial volume renders them more susceptible to reactive oxygen species 
increased by calcium flux than other cell types."
1208,"From early to middle childhood, brain regions that underlie memory consolidation 
undergo profound maturational changes. However, there is little empirical 
investigation that directly relates age-related differences in brain structural 
measures to memory consolidation processes. The present study examined memory 
consolidation of intentionally studied object-location associations after one 
night of sleep (short delay) and after two weeks (long delay) in normally 
developing 5-to-7-year-old children (n = 50) and young adults (n = 39). 
Behavioural differences in memory retention rate were related to structural 
brain measures. Our results showed that children, in comparison to young adults, 
retained correctly learnt object-location associations less robustly over short 
and long delay. Moreover, using partial least squares correlation method, a 
unique multivariate profile comprised of specific neocortical (prefrontal, 
parietal, and occipital), cerebellar, and hippocampal head and subfield 
structures in the body was found to be associated with variation in short-delay 
memory retention. A different multivariate profile comprised of a reduced set of 
brain structures, mainly consisting of neocortical (prefrontal, parietal, and 
occipital), hippocampal head, and selective hippocampal subfield structures 
(CA1-2 and subiculum) was associated with variation in long-delay memory 
retention. Taken together, the results suggest that multivariate structural 
pattern of unique sets of brain regions are related to variations in short- and 
long-delay memory consolidation across children and young adults."
1209,"Vitamin C is an essential vitamin that acts as a co-factor for many enzymes 
involved in epigenetic regulation in humans. Low vitamin C levels in 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) promote self-renewal and vitamin C 
supplementation retards leukaemogenesis in vitamin C-deficient mouse models. 
Studies on vitamin C levels in patients with myeloid malignancies are limited. 
We thus conducted a retrospective analysis on a prospective cohort of patients 
with myeloid malignancies on whom plasma vitamin C levels were measured serially 
at diagnosis and during treatment. Baseline characteristics including 
hematological indices, cytogenetics, and molecular mutations are described in 
this cohort. Among 64 patients included in our study, 11 patients (17%) had low 
vitamin C levels. We noted a younger age at diagnosis for patients with myeloid 
malignancies who had low plasma vitamin C levels. Patients with low plasma 
vitamin C levels were more likely to have acute myeloid leukemia compared to 
other myeloid malignancies. Low vitamin C levels were associated with ASXL1 
mutations. Our study calls for further multi-institutional studies to understand 
the relevance of low plasma vitamin C level in myeloid neoplasms, the role of 
vitamin C deficiency in leukemogenesis, and the potential benefit of vitamin C 
supplementation."
1210,"Several diseases are caused by the lack of functional proteins, including 
lysosomal storage diseases or haemophilia A and B. Patients suffering from one 
of these diseases are treated via enzyme replacement therapies to restore the 
missing protein. Although this treatment strategy prevents some disease 
symptoms, enzyme replacement therapies are very expensive and require very 
frequent infusions, which can cause infusion adverse reactions and massively 
impair the quality of life of the patients. This review proposes a technology to 
sustainably produce proteins within the patient to potentially make frequent 
protein-infusions redundant. This technology is based on blood circulating 
immune cells as producers of the needed therapeutic protein. To ensure a stable 
protein concentration over time the cells are equipped with a system, which 
induces cell proliferation when low therapeutic protein levels are detected and 
a system inhibiting cell proliferation when high therapeutic protein levels are 
detected."
1211,"Sulfate is essential for healthy foetal growth and neurodevelopment. The SLC13A1 
sulfate transporter is primarily expressed in the kidney where it mediates 
sulfate reabsorption and maintains circulating sulfate levels. To meet foetal 
demands, maternal sulfate levels increase by twofold in pregnancy via 
upregulated SLC13A1 expression. Previous studies found hyposulfataemia and 
reduced renal Slc13a1 mRNA expression in rodent models with either severe 
vitamin D deficiency or perturbed vitamin D signalling. Here we investigated a 
mouse model of moderate vitamin D deficiency. However, serum sulfate level and 
renal Slc13a1 mRNA expression was not decreased by a moderate reduction in 
circulating vitamin D level. We confirmed that the mouse Slc13a1 5'-flanking 
region was upregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 using luciferase assays in a cultured 
renal OK cell line. These results support the presence of a functional VDRE in 
the mouse Slc13a1 but suggests that moderate vitamin D deficiency does not 
impact on sulfate homeostasis. As sulfate biology is highly conserved between 
rodents and humans, we proposed that human SLC13A1 would be under similar 
transcriptional regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3. Using an online prediction tool we 
identified a putative VDRE in the SLC13A1 5'-flanking region but unlike the 
mouse Slc13a1 sequence, the human sequence did not confer a significant response 
to 1,25(OH)2D3 in vitro. Overall, this study suggests that moderate vitamin D 
deficiency may not alter sulfate homeostasis. This needs to be confirmed in 
humans, particularly during pregnancy when vitamin D and sulfate levels need to 
be maintained at high levels for healthy maternal and child outcomes."
1212,"Myocardial infarction (MI) damages cardiomyocytes permanently and compromises 
cardiac function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with the potential to 
differentiate into multiple lineages are considered as one of the best options 
for the treatment of MI. However, aging affects their regeneration capability. 
With age, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate in cells ultimately causing 
cell death. To successfully utilize these stem cells in clinic, novel strategies 
to improve their functional capability should be explored. In this study, we 
aimed to enhance the cardiac regeneration potential of bone marrow MSCs derived 
from aging rats by treating them with antioxidants, rutin or quercetagetin in 
separate in vivo experiments. Oxidative stress was induced by treating MSCs of 
young and aging rats with different concentrations of H2O2 which resulted in an 
increase in the ROS level. MSCs were treated with rutin or quercetagetin at 
varying concentrations and exposed to H2O2. It was observed that both 
antioxidants significantly (P < 0.001) suppressed H2O2-induced intracellular ROS 
accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. An optimized concentration of 10 µM 
rutin or quercetagetin was used for the in vivo experiments. MI models were 
developed in aging rats by ligation of left anterior descending artery and 
treated MSCs were transplanted in the MI models. Echocardiography was performed 
after 2 and 4 weeks of cell transplantation to evaluate the functional status of 
the infarcted heart and histological analysis was performed after 4 weeks to 
assess cardiac regeneration. Significant improvement was observed in cardiac 
parameters including LVEF% (P < 0.001), LVFS% (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001), LVIDd 
(P < 0.01 and P < 0.001), LVIDs (P < 0.001), LVEDV (P < 0.001) and LVESV 
(P < 0.001) in the treated young as well as aging MSCs. It is concluded from 
these findings that rutin and quercetagetin treatment enhance the regeneration 
efficiency of young and aging MSCs in vivo. These antioxidants can be 
effectively utilized to improve cellular therapy for myocardial infarction by 
suppressing ROS production."
1213,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major health problem, characterized by progressive 
cartilage degeneration. Previous works have shown that mechanical loading can 
alleviate OA symptoms by suppressing catabolic activities. This study evaluated 
whether mechanical loading can enhance anabolic activities by facilitating the 
recruitment of stem cells for chondrogenesis. We evaluated cartilage degradation 
in a mouse model of OA through histology with H&E and safranin O staining. We 
also evaluated the migration and chondrogenic ability of stem cells using in 
vitro assays, including immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western 
blot analysis. The result showed that the OA mice that received mechanical 
loading exhibited resilience to cartilage damage. Compared to the OA group, 
mechanical loading promoted the expression of Piezo1 and the migration of stem 
cells was promoted via the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. Also, the chondrogenic 
differentiation was enhanced by the upregulation of SOX9, a transcription factor 
important for chondrogenesis. Collectively, the results revealed that mechanical 
loading facilitated cartilage repair by promoting the migration and chondrogenic 
differentiation of endogenous stem cells. This study provided new insights into 
the loading-driven engagement of endogenous stem cells and the enhancement of 
anabolic responses for the treatment of OA."
1214,"An RNA aptamer that induces suitable conformational changes upon binding to a 
user-defined ligand allows us to artificially construct a riboswitch, a 
ligand-dependent and cis-acting gene regulatory RNA. Although such an aptamer 
can be obtained through in vitro selection, it is still challenging to 
rationally expand the variety of orthogonal ligand/aptamer (ligand/riboswitch) 
pairs. To achieve this in a facile, selection-free way, we herein focused on a 
specific type of ligand, 6-nt nanosized DNA (nDNA) and its aptamer that was 
previously selected to construct a eukaryotic artificial riboswitch. 
Specifically, we merely mutated one or more possible Watson-Crick base pairs in 
the nDNA/aptamer (nDNA/riboswitch) interactions into another base pair or pairs. 
Using two sets that each had 16 comprehensive mutations, we obtained three 
groups of several orthogonal nDNA/riboswitch pairs. These pairs could be used to 
create complex gene circuits, including multiple simultaneous and/or multistep 
cascading regulations in synthetic biology."
1215,"Peripheral blood eosinophilia is associated with a variety of benign and 
neoplastic conditions. Rarely, marked eosinophilia can mask an underlying Acute 
Leukaemia, delaying the correct diagnosis and treatment. Here, we report a case 
of 14-year-old boy, who presented with marked eosinophilia and space occupying 
lesion in the brain. Bone marrow biopsy and biopsy of brain lesion were 
performed to assess the underlying disorder, revealing the unexpected diagnosis 
of Precursor B- Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in this patient. Cytogenetic 
studies revealed a normal male karyotype. This case highlights the significance 
of considering the rare possibility of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia among the 
differential diagnosis of persistent eosinophilia in order to facilitate prompt 
and appropriate treatment."
1216,"Papillary renal cell carcinoma comprises around 15% of all renal cell 
carcinomas. Patients are usually asymptomatic, and 25 percent of individuals 
have advanced locoregional disease at presentation. Papillary renal cell 
carcinoma presenting as a huge abdominal cystic mass is uncommon and is reported 
rarely in literature. We present a case of renal cell carcinoma presenting with 
abdominal pain, distention, and constipation. A retroperitoneal cystic lesion 
measuring 23.4×23.8 cm cyst was reported on ultrasonography as potential cause 
of the symptoms. We now talk about the case of a 57- year-old male who presented 
to us with abdominal pain, distension, and constipation. He also had a history 
of on and off low-grade fever for the last seven months. A computed topography 
(CT scan) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast revealed 
a large retroperitoneal cystic mass extending from the left hypochondrium to the 
left kidney and into the pelvis crossing the midline. Internal calcific foci, 
enhancing septa, irregularly thickened walls and hyperdense nodules were also 
demonstrated. A radical left nephrectomy via a midline laparotomy was performed 
electively. The cystic mass was excised and the specimen was sent for 
histopathological evaluation which revealed papillary renal cell carcinoma with 
PAX-8 and CK-7 positivity. Patient made an uneventful recovery post-operatively 
and was discharged. Cystic tumors of renal origin can rarely present as a huge 
abdominal cystic mass confusing them for masses of intestinal or hepatic origin. 
Timely diagnosis can be made with a detailed history, examination, imaging 
studies and histopathology, and instigate timely intervention."
1217,"BACKGROUND: Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an uncommon neoplasm of mature 
B-lymphoid cells which is characterized by cytopenias, commonly of all three 
cell lines, with typical hairy cells on peripheral smear and/or bone marrow 
along with organomegaly. Objective was to document the outcomes of HCL patients 
treated at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan.
METHODS: Medical records of patients from 2004 to 2020 were reviewed and data 
was collected to assess patient's demographics, symptomatology, remission rate 
and overall survival. The record flies of all patients presenting to AFBMTC with 
HCL were included in the study. The record file with insufficient data were 
excluded.
RESULTS: 26 patients with a mean age of 48.12±11.43 years were diagnosed with 
HCL and treated at AFBMTC. Out of these, 23 (88.4%) were male and 03 (11.5%) 
females. The main presenting complaints were generalized body aches (34.6%), 
fever (15.4%), incidental finding of cytopenias (11.5%) and abdominal discomfort 
(26.9%). Splenomegaly was found in 76.92% while hepatomegaly was found in 46.15% 
of patients. A total of 12 (46.15%) patients received Cladribine (either 
intravenous or subcutaneous) and splenectomy was done in 7 (26.92%) as 1st line 
treatment. Eleven patients out of 12 (83.33%) who received Cladribine and 05 
(71.42%) patients out of seven who underwent splenectomy; achieved complete 
remission (CR) after 1 st line of treatment. One patient received Cladribine as 
1st line of treatment but did not respond and CHOP regimen was given as second 
line. Out of the 26 patients, 5 patients (19.23%) relapsed at a median interval 
of 5.83±6.6 years. Two patients received Cladribine + Rituximab while 03 
patients received cladribine as their salvage therapy. Disease free survival 
(DFS) of 71.4% among the patients underwent splenectomy while 75.0% among the 
patients received Cladribine. DFS for combination therapy (included CHOP and 
CVP) was 66.7% while OS was calculated among patients who received cladribine, 
splenectomy and combination chemotherapy as 100%, 85.7%, 66.7% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine has a significant efficacy and encouraging acute and 
long-term benefits when administered to patients with HCL. A single course of 
cladribine was able to induce CR in a vast majority of patients. At a median 
follow up of 4.6 years the OS was 100% with cladribine and 85% with splenectomy. 
Those who relapsed were successfully retreated with cladribine + Rituximab."
1218,"Cervical cancer which is caused by persistent infection with oncogenic human 
papillomavirus (HPV), is the third most common cancer. HPV infection causes the 
progression of the normal cervix to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 
because it often occurs at the function conversion of the cervical squamous 
epithelium and columnar epithelium zone, further to invasive carcinoma. The 
difference in the ALDH1 expression was very significant. With the progression of 
cervical cancer, reports explained obviously increased nuclear and cytoplasm 
ALDH1 staining in comparisons of cervical carcinomas and normal cervix (P < 
0.0001), cervical carcinomas compared with CIN (P = 0.0002). Therefore, ALDH1 as 
a stem marker, not only resists cervical cancer but also resists in normal 
cervix and CIN tissues. Developing an experimental method to discover cervical 
cancer earlier is feasible. Furthermore, the ALDH1 was expressed in human 
cervical cancer cell lines (Hela, SiHa, CaSki, HT-3, and C33A) together with 
western blot and immunocytochemical analysis. ALDH1 plays a significant role in 
nuclear and cytoplasm staining by immunochemistry in single or clustered HT-3 
and C33A cells. However, western blot and immunochemical analysis did not detect 
ALDH1 in HeLa or CaSki, SiHa cells. We also discovered that there were no 
remarkable differences in age, tumor size, clinical TNM staging, multiple pelvic 
lymph node metastasis, or histological staging (p > 0.05) between the 
ALDH1-positive groups in 100 cervical cancer tissues. But after the control 
variable age, different ALDH rating survival function contrasted, it can be 
concluded that the higher ALDH1 scores with the survival of patients with the 
worse condition."
1219,"Extra-nodal localisations of mantle cell lymphomas are most frequently found in 
the gastrointestinal tract. It is therefore important for an endoscopist to be 
familiar with the endoscopic image of a mantle cell lymphoma. In this case 
series of three patients with colonic involvement of mantle cell lymphoma, we 
discuss the endoscopic diagnosis."
1220,"The platelet integrin αIIbβ3 undergoes long range conformational transitions 
associated with its functional conversion from inactive (low affinity) to active 
(high affinity) states during hemostasis. Although new conformations 
intermediate between the well-characterized bent and extended states have been 
identified, their molecular dynamic properties and functions in the assembly of 
adhesions remain largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluated the properties 
of intermediate conformations of integrin αIIbβ3 and characterized their effects 
on the assembly of adhesions by combining all-atom simulations, principal 
component analysis, and mesoscale modeling. Our results show that in the low 
affinity, bent conformation, the integrin ectodomain tends to pivot around the 
legs; in intermediate conformations the upper headpiece becomes partially 
extended, away from the lower legs. In the fully open, active state, αIIbβ3 is 
flexible and the motions between upper headpiece and lower legs are accompanied 
by fluctuations of the transmembrane helices. At the mesoscale, bent integrins 
form only unstable adhesions, but intermediate or open conformations stabilize 
the adhesions. These studies reveal a mechanism by which small variations in 
ligand binding affinity and enhancement of the ligand-bound lifetime in the 
presence of actin retrograde flow stabilize αIIbβ3 integrin adhesions."
1221,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification, methylation at the N6 position of 
adenosine, plays critical roles in tumorigenesis. m6A readers recognize m6A 
modifications and thus act as key executors for the biological consequences of 
RNA methylation. However, knowledge about the regulatory mechanism(s) of m6A 
readers is extremely limited. In this study, RN7SK was identified as a small 
nuclear RNA that interacts with m6A readers. m6A readers recognized and 
facilitated secondary structure formation of m6A-modified RN7SK, which in turn 
prevented m6A reader mRNA degradation from exonucleases. Thus, a positive 
feedback circuit between RN7SK and m6A readers is established in tumor cells. 
From findings on the interaction with RN7SK, new m6A readers, such as EWS RNA 
binding protein 1 (EWSR1) and KH RNA binding domain containing, signal 
transduction associated 1 (KHDRBS1), were identified and shown to boost 
Wnt/βcatenin signaling and tumorigenesis by suppressing translation of Cullin1 
(CUL1). Moreover, several Food and Drug Administration-approved small molecules 
were demonstrated to reduce RN7SK expression and inhibit tumorigenesis. 
Together, these findings reveal a common regulatory mechanism of m6A readers and 
indicate that targeting RN7SK has strong potential for tumor treatment."
1222,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are ubiquitous multipotent cells that exhibit 
significant therapeutic potentials in a variety of disorders. Nevertheless, 
their clinical efficacy is limited owing to poor survival, low rate of 
engraftment, and impaired potency upon transplantation. Spheroidal 
three-dimensional (3D) culture of MSCs (MSC3D) has been proved to better 
preserve their in vivo functional properties. However, the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the improvement in MSC function by spheroid formation are not clearly 
understood. NLRP3 inflammasomes, a key component of the innate immune system, 
have recently been shown to play a role in cell fate decision of MSCs. The 
present study examined the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the survival and 
potency of MSC spheroids. We found that MSC3D led to decreased activation of 
NLRP3 inflammasomes through alleviation of ER stress in an autophagy-dependent 
manner. Importantly, downregulation of NLRP3 inflammasomes signaling critically 
contributes to the enhanced survival rate in MSC3D through modulation of 
pyroptosis and apoptosis. The critical role of NLRP3 inflammasomes suppression 
in the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of MSC spheroids was further confirmed in 
an in vivo mouse model of DSS-induced colitis. These findings suggest that 3D 
culture confers survival and functional advantages to MSCs by suppressing NLRP3 
inflammasomes activation."
1223,"Mutualistic exchange of metabolites can play an important role in microbial 
communities. Under natural environmental conditions, such exchange may be 
compromised by the dispersal of metabolites and by the presence of 
non-cooperating microorganisms. Spatial proximity between members during sessile 
growth on solid surfaces has been shown to promote stabilization of 
cross-feeding communities against these challenges. Nonetheless, many natural 
cross-feeding communities are not sessile but rather pelagic and exist in 
turbulent aquatic environments, where partner proximity is often achieved via 
direct cell-cell adhesion, and cooperation occurs between physically associated 
cells. Partner association in aquatic environments could be further enhanced by 
motility of individual planktonic microorganisms. In this work, we establish a 
model bipartite cross-feeding community between bacteria and yeast auxotrophs to 
investigate the impact of direct adhesion between prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
partners and of bacterial motility in a stirred mutualistic co-culture. We 
demonstrate that adhesion can provide fitness benefit to the bacterial partner, 
likely by enabling local metabolite exchange within co-aggregates, and that it 
counteracts invasion of the community by a non-cooperating cheater strain. In a 
turbulent environment and at low cell densities, fitness of the bacterial 
partner and its competitiveness against a non-cooperating strain are further 
increased by motility that likely facilitates partner encounters and adhesion. 
These results suggest that, despite their potential fitness costs, direct 
adhesion between partners and its enhancement by motility may play key roles as 
stabilization factors for metabolic communities in turbulent aquatic 
environments."
1224,"Primary lymphomatoid granulomatosis of the CNS (CNS-LG) is a rare lymphoid 
neoplasia associated Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and often accompanied by 
immunodeficiencies. No treatment standards have been defined yet. However, due 
to often devastating neurologic sequelae and based on similarities to diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma, curative treatment requires intensive therapy protocols 
resembling protocols applied in CNS lymphoma. Here, the clinical courses and 
treatments of four primary CNS-LG patients in analogy to aggressive 
CNS-lymphomas including methotrexate, thiotepa, cytarabine, carmustine, and 
rituximab are presented. This is the first report on high-dose chemotherapy with 
CNS-directed drugs and autologous blood stem cell transplantation in 
primary CNS-LG."
1225,"MDM4 is an important p53-negative regulator, consequently, it is involved in 
cell proliferation, DNA repair, and apoptosis regulation. MDM4 overexpression 
and amplification are described to lead to cancer formation, metastasis, and 
poor disease prognosis. Several MDM4 SNPs are in non-coding regions, and some 
affect the MDM4 regulation by disrupting the micro RNA binding site in 3'UTR 
(untranslated region). Here, we gathered several association studies with 
different MDM4 SNPs and populations to understand the relationship between its 
SNPs and solid tumor risk. Many studies failed to replicate their results 
regarding different populations, cancer types, and risk genotypes, leading to 
conflicting conclusions. We suggested that distinct haplotype patterns in 
different populations might affect the association between MDM4 SNPs and cancer 
risk. Thus, we propose to investigate some linkage SNPs in specific haplotypes 
to provide informative MDM4 markers for association studies with cancer."
1226,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy nonspecifically targets both tumor and healthy 
proliferating cells. Methionine deprivation using L-methioninase along with 
chemotherapy appears promising towards cancer management. The present study is 
an attempt to use a new combination of L-methioninase with Tamoxifen (TAM) to 
treat breast cancer in mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: L-Methioninase from Methylobacterium sp. was partially 
purified (SPMet's) by cold acetone precipitation and lyophilized. Its 
cytotoxicity effect, alone and in combination with Tamoxifen, was evaluated in 
vitro (MCF-7) cells and in vivo (athymic nude mice) conditions. SPMet's was 
found to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells with an IC50 value of 47.05 µg/ml, 
while the combination of SPMet's and TAM had an IC50 of 6.4 µg/ml. Athymic nude 
mice were grouped into: Group-I - Tumor control; Group-II - TAM; Group-III - 
SPMet's; Group-IV - SPMet's + TAM. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was maximum in 
Group-IV with 84.65% followed by Group-II with 65.12%. Hematological and 
Biochemical parameters in Group-II, III, and IV were restored to normal levels. 
Tumor histopathology showed increased apoptosis and necrosis in Group-IV. 
Caspases 3 & 8 gene upregulation was significantly higher in Group-IV than other 
treated groups, indicating higher efficacy of the combination approach.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study report about a combination of SPMet's and 
TAM on in vivo breast cancer model, with significantly higher anticancer 
activity and without noticeable side effects. The findings of this study have 
several important implications for future clinical studies."
1227,"DNA methylation and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit an indispensable role 
in follicular development. However, the specific mechanisms regarding lncRNAs 
mediated by DNA methylation in follicular development remain unclearly. In this 
study, we found that inhibiting the expression of DNMT1 promoted granulosa cells 
(GCs) apoptosis to inhibit follicular development. A novel follicular 
development-associated lncRNA named inhibitory factor of follicular development 
(IFFD) was mediated by DNMT1 and showed to arrest follicular development by 
inhibiting GCs proliferation and estrogen (E2) secretion but promoting GCs 
apoptosis. Mechanistically, the deactivated Cas9-TET1 demonstrated that the 
hypomethylation in -1261/-1254 region of IFFD promoted the transcription of IFFD 
by recruiting SP1. IFFD induced the expression of GLI family zinc finger 1 
through competitive binding miR-370, thereby up-regulating the expression of 
CASP3 to promote GCs apoptosis, as well as downregulating the expressions of 
PCNA and CYP19A1 to inhibit GCs proliferation and E2 secretion. Collectively, 
DNMT1-mediated IFFD might be a novel target for the regulation of follicular 
development."
1228,"Overexpression of the Aux/IAA protein TaIAA15-1A from wheat improves drought 
tolerance by regulating the ABA signalling pathway in transgenic Brachypodium. 
Drought is a major abiotic stress that causes severe crop yield loss. Aux/IAA 
genes have been shown to be involved in drought stress responses. However, to 
the best of our knowledge, there has been little research on the molecular 
mechanism of the wheat Aux/IAA gene in the context of drought tolerance. In this 
study, we found that expression of the wheat Aux/IAA gene TaIAA15-1A was 
upregulated by PEG6000, NaCl, SA, JA, IAA and ABA. Transgenic plants 
overexpressing TaIAA15-1A showed higher drought tolerance than wild-type (WT) 
plants. The physiological analyses showed that the transgenic lines exhibited a 
higher survival rate, shoot length, and relative water content than the WT 
plants. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and 
peroxidase (POD) were enhanced in transgenic lines, causing a reduction in the 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion radical (O2-) contents. 
Transcriptome analysis showed that TaIAA15-1A overexpression alters the 
expression of these genes involved in the auxin signalling pathway, ABA 
signalling pathway, phenolamides and antioxidant pathways. The results of 
exogenous ABA treatment suggested that TaIAA15-1A overexpression increased 
sensitivity to ABA at the germination and postgermination stages compared to WT 
plants. These results indicate that TaIAA15-1A plays a positive role in plant 
drought tolerance by regulating ABA-related genes and improving antioxidative 
stress ability and has potential application in genetically modified crops."

1230,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are major metabolic products of indigestible 
polysaccharides in the gut and mediate the function of immune cells to 
facilitate homeostasis. The immunomodulatory effect of SCFAs has been 
attributed, at least in part, to the epigenetic modulation of immune cells 
through the inhibition the nucleus-resident enzyme histone deacetylase (HDAC). 
Among the downstream effects, SCFAs enhance regulatory T cells (Treg) over 
inflammatory T helper (Th) cells, including Th17 cells, which can be pathogenic. 
Here, we characterize the potential of two common SCFAs-butyrate and 
pentanoate-in modulating differentiation of T cells in vitro. We show that 
butyrate but not pentanoate exerts a concentration-dependent effect on Treg and 
Th17 differentiation. Increasing the concentration of butyrate suppresses the 
Th17-associated RORγtt and IL-17 and increases the expression of Treg-associated 
FoxP3. To effectively deliver butyrate, encapsulation of butyrate in a liposomal 
carrier, termed BLIPs, reduced cytotoxicity while maintaining the 
immunomodulatory effect on T cells. Consistent with these results, butyrate and 
BLIPs inhibit HDAC and promote a unique chromatin landscape in T cells under 
conditions that otherwise promote conversion into a pro-inflammatory phenotype. 
Motif enrichment analysis revealed that butyrate and BLIP-mediated suppression 
of Th17-associated chromatin accessibility corresponded with a marked decrease 
in bZIP family transcription factor binding sites. These results support the 
utility and further evaluation of BLIPs as an immunomodulatory agent for 
autoimmune disorders that are characterized by chronic inflammation and 
pathogenic inflammatory T cells."
1231,"RESEARCH QUESTION: Is there an association between post-occlusive reactive 
hyperaemia (PORH) and ovarian stimulation in women with normoandrogenaemic 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?
DESIGN: Women eligible for IVF at an academic fertility centre were invited to 
join this prospective study. Microvascular endothelial function was measured as 
PORH by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) before and after ovarian stimulation. 
Metabolic characteristics, hormone profiles and biochemical markers were 
analysed.
RESULTS: Thirty-four normoandrogenaemic women with PCOS and 36 
normoandrogenaemic women without PCOS were included. The PCOS group displayed 
higher C-reactive protein levels and insulin resistance (P = 0.048 and 
P = 0.025, respectively). No significant difference was found in 
microcirculatory function between the groups at baseline. After ovarian 
stimulation, PORH was enhanced in the control group (slope 7.1 ± 3.3 versus 9.7 
± 4.5; P = 0.007; peak flow 30.7 ± 16.3 versus 43.5 ± 17.3, P = 0.008; however, 
the PCOS group experienced a blunting response to supraphysiological hormone 
status (slope 8.2 ± 5.1 versus 7.2 ± 4.3, P = 0.212; peak flow, 38.8 ± 19.4 
versus 37.0 ± 21.8, P = 0.895).
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired microcirculatory function could be found using a 
non-invasive LDF technique in normoandrogenaemic women with PCOS undergoing IVF, 
indicating early changes in vascular endothelial dysfunction. Future 
observational studies should clarify whether PORH measurement might help predict 
IVF prognosis or obstetric complications."
1232,"Polycythemia vera (PV) is a Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm 
characterized by excessive myeloid cells production, mostly secondary to 
mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. PV natural history might be 
burdened by thrombotic events (TEs) and evolution into post-PV myelofibrosis 
(PPV-MF) or blast phase (BP). To date, no treatment strategies have been shown 
to have disease modifying effects, so therapy is directed at preventing TEs. All 
patients require phlebotomies (PHLs) to keep hematocrit below 45% and once-daily 
low dose aspirin (if not contraindicated). Apart from patients at ""high risk"" 
because of age over 60 years or a thrombosis history, cytoreductive therapies 
(CT) should be given to patients with relevant signs of myeloproliferation or 
intolerance to PHLs. Approved choices both for first and second line CT are 
hydroxyurea (HU) and pegylated forms of interferon (peg-IFN), the latter 
probably being better for young patients, and subjects without critical and 
recent vascular events or massive splenomegaly. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib 
is the treatment of choice in case of resistance/intolerance to HU, with proved 
efficacy in terms of thrombotic prevention. Data are too preliminary to consider 
CT for ""low risk"" PV cases, but ropeg-IFN is being studied in this setting with 
a short follow-up. A careful monitoring for signs of evolution into PPV-MF is 
fundamental for optimizing patient management."
1233,"BACKGROUND: Successful anastomotic healing is critical to preventing 
complications after intestinal surgery. We aimed to compare the early healing of 
end-to-end small bowel anastomosis by self-forming magnets with surgical 
stapling in a porcine model.
METHOD: Six Yorkshire pigs underwent 2 simultaneous small bowel anastomoses 
using a circular stapler and self-forming magnet technique. The primary outcome 
was healing quality, measured by 4 histologic features: inflammatory cell 
infiltration, collagen formation, grade of inflammation, and bacterial 
infiltration at the anastomosis. The samples were evaluated at days 1, 3, and 7. 
Gross evaluation of anastomotic integrity was a secondary outcome.
RESULTS: The self-forming magnet group displayed significant differences at each 
time point. On day 1, the stapled group displayed dense inflammatory cell 
infiltration and extensively ulcerated intestinal layers with significant edema. 
The self-forming magnet group showed less inflammatory infiltrate, and all 
intestinal layers remained compressed in direct apposition. By day 3, the 
self-forming magnet group already exhibited neovascularization with scant 
bacterial colonies. By contrast, stapled anastomoses had large areas of 
inflammation separating collagen fibers with prevalent bacterial infiltrations. 
On day 7, self-forming magnet anastomoses were characterized by robust 
neovascularization, maturing granulation tissue, and mucosal re-epithelization 
without significant inflammation. Meanwhile, stapled samples had persisting 
dense inflammation, tissue cavities with hemorrhage, and immature fibrous 
tissue. Grossly, the self-forming magnet created a patent lumen without defect, 
whereas stapled anastomoses demonstrated focal areas of serosal separation.
CONCLUSION: Bowel anastomosis by self-forming magnets is associated with 
superior early histologic healing metrics, including early seal generation 
through mechanical compression, decreased inflammation, early 
neovascularization, lower bacterial infiltration, and faster re-epithelization."
1234,"Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but were 
immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing 
tumor-cell-surface glycans. To reverse this glycan-mediated immunosuppression, 
the surface NK-inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and 
NK-activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal 
efficiency. Here, we design a core-shell membrane-fusogenic liposome (MFL) to 
simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK-activating glycans and 
biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via 
a membrane-fusion manner. Loaded into a 
tumor-microenvironment-triggered-degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could 
be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through 
fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver 
sialyltransferase-inhibitor-loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor 
NK-activating-glycan-modified shell onto tumor surface. This 
spatially-differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the 
effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate 
immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK-activating Lewis X 
trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic 
acid-caused immunosuppression of tumor surface was reprogrammed to be 
LeX-induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to 
NK-cell-mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL 
provides a novel platform for multiplex cell engineering and personalized 
regulation of intercellular interactions for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. This

1235,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for cancer recurrence, treatment 
failure and metastatic dissemination. As such, the elimination of CSCs 
represents one of the most important approaches for the future of cancer 
treatment. Among other properties, CSCs show the activation of particular cell 
signalling pathways and the over-expression of certain transcription factors, 
such as SOX2. Herein, we describe a new model system to isolate stem-like cancer 
cells, based on the functional transcriptional activity of SOX2. Briefly, we 
employed a SOX2-enhancer-GFP-reporter system to isolate cancer cells with high 
SOX2 transcriptional activity by FACS sorting. The over-expression of SOX2 in 
this sub-population was validated by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. 
SOX2-high cancer cells showed CSCs features, such as greater mammosphere forming 
ability, validating that this sub-population was enriched in CSCs. To further 
explore the model, we analysed other stemness characteristics in MCF7 and 
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, corroborating that SOX2-high cells were 
more metabolically active, proliferative, migratory, invasive, and 
drug-resistant. SOX2-high MDA-MB-231 cells also showed a loss of E-cadherin 
expression, and increased Vimentin expression, consistent with an 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore, endogenous SOX2 
transcriptional activity and protein levels are mechanistically linked to 
aggressive phenotypic behaviours and energy production in CSCs."
1236,"Aging of the vascular system is the main cause of many cardiovascular diseases. 
The structure and function of the blood vessel wall change with aging. To 
prevent age-related cardiovascular diseases, it is essential to understand the 
cellular heterogeneity of vascular wall and changes of cellular communication 
among cell subpopulations during aging. Here, using published single-cell RNA 
sequencing datasets of young and old monkey aortas, we analyzed the 
heterogeneity of vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in detail 
and identified a distinct endothelial cell subpopulation that involved in 
vascular remodeling and calcification. Moreover, cellular communication that 
changed with aging was analyzed and we identified a number of signaling pathways 
that associated with vascular aging. We found that EGF signaling pathway play an 
essential role in vascular remodeling and calcification of aged aortas. This 
work provided a better understanding of vascular aging and laid the foundation 
for prevention of age-related vascular pathologies."
1237,"BACKGROUND: Bladder carcinoma (BC) represents one of the most prevalent 
malignant cancers, while predicting its clinical outcomes using traditional 
indicators is difficult. This study aimed to develop a miRNA signature for the 
prognostic prediction of patients with BC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MiRNAs that expressed differentially were identified 
between 413 BC and 19 non-tumor patients, whose prognostic values were evaluated 
using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The independent 
prognostic factors were screened out and were used to establish a signature. The 
risk score of the signature was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to verify the predictive 
performance of the miRNA signature and the risk score. A nomogram was 
constructed which integrated with the miRNA signature and clinical parameters. 
Experiments were performed.
RESULTS: 7 prognosis related miRNAs were selected as independent risk factors, 
and a 7-miRNA signature was constructed, with an area under ROC (AUC) of 0.721. 
The 7-miRNA-signature based risk score acts as an independent prognostic factor, 
with satisfactory predictive performance (AUC = 0.744). Increased miR-337-3p 
expressions were detected in tumor samples and BC cell lines than in 
non-tumorigenic tissues and cell lines. Experiments suggested that miR-337-3p 
induces the proliferation, migration, and invasion of BC cells.
CONCLUSION: The constructed 7-miRNA signature is a promising biomarker for 
predicting the prognosis of patients with BC, and miR-337-3p may act as a 
candidate therapeutic target in BC treatments."
1238,"Prostate cancer is the most prevalent genitourinary malignant cancer in men 
worldwide. Patients with prostate cancer who progress to castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) or metastatic CRPC have significantly poorer survival. 
Advanced prostate cancer is a clinical challenge due to the lack of effective 
treatment strategies. In the field of oncology, SGOL2 was an emerging and 
differentially expressed molecule, which enhanced the proliferation of cell 
populations in vitro in our studies. Mass spectrum and Co-IP validated the 
interaction of SGOL2 and RAB1A in a protein-protein manner. We further 
investigated the role of SGOL2 in the regulatory mechanism of RAB1A in prostate 
cancer cell lines. Furthermore, SGOL2 regulated RAB1A expression by inhibiting 
its ubiquitination. Rescue Experiments demonstrated that SGOL2 promoted prostate 
cancer cell proliferation and migration by upregulating RAB1A expression. 
Finally, we found that SGOL2 and RAB1A may regulate the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) in prostate cancer. In conclusion, our findings concluded that SGOL2 
stabilized RAB1A expression to promote prostate cancer development. Both of them 
were of great importance in TME modulation."
1239,"Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a chronic large vessel disease characterized by 
aortic fibrotic thickening, which was mainly mediated by activation of aorta 
adventitial fibroblasts (AAFs). Our previous genetic study demonstrated that 
TAK-associated locus IL6 rs2069837 regulated glycoprotein non-metastatic 
melanoma protein B (GPNMB) expression. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the 
pathogenic role of GPNMB in TAK. Through pathological staining, we find that 
GPNMB was mainly expressed in vascular adventitia and positively correlated with 
adventitial extracellular matrix (ECM) expression in TAK vascular lesion. 
Specifically, GPNMB was increased in adventitial CD68+ macrophages, which were 
closely located with CD90+ adventitial fibroblasts. In in-vitro cell culture, 
THP-1-derived macrophages with GPNMB overexpression promoted ECM expression in 
AAFs. This effect was also confirmed in aortic tissue or AAFs culture with GPNMB 
overexpression or active GPNMB protein stimulation. Mechanistically, Co-IP assay 
and siRNA or inhibitor intervention demonstrated that integrin αVβ1 receptor 
mediated GPNMB effect on AAFs, which also activated downstream Akt and Erk 
pathway in AAFs. Furthermore, we showed that leflunomide treatment inhibited 
GPNMB-mediated fibrosis in AAFs, as well as GPNMB expression in macrophages, 
which were also partially validated in leflunomide-treated patients. Taken 
together, these data indicated that macrophage-derived GPNMB promotes AAFs ECM 
expression via the integrin αVβ1 receptor and Akt/Erk signaling pathway and 
leflunomide might play an anti-fibrotic role in TAK by interfering with the 
macrophage-derived GPNMB/AAFs axis. This study provides evidence that targeting 
GPNMB is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating vascular fibrosis in TAK."
1240,"The positive and pro-economic trend in the management of cancer treatment is the 
search for the antineoplastic potential of known, widely used and safe drugs 
with a different clinical purpose. A good candidate seems to be moxifloxacin 
with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, which as the member of the fourth 
generation fluoroquinolone is known to affect not only bacterial but also 
eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases, however at high concentration. Due to the fact 
that the modification of parent drug with lipid component can improve anticancer 
potential by increasing of bioavailability, selectivity, and cytotoxic 
efficiency, we evaluated the mechanisms of cytotoxic activity of novel 
moxifloxacin conjugates with fatty acids and verified metabolic profile in 
SW480, SW620 and PC3 cell lines. Our study revealed that cytotoxic potential of 
moxifloxacin conjugates was stronger than free moxifloxacin, moreover, they 
remained non-toxic to normal HaCaT cells. PC3 were more sensitive to MXF 
conjugates than colon cancer cells. The most promising cytotoxic activity 
exhibited conjugate 4m and 16m with oleic and stearic acid reducing viability of 
PC3 and SW620 cells. Tested conjugates activated caspases 3/7 and induced 
late-apoptosis, mainly in PC3 and SW620 cells. However, the most pronounced 
inhibition of NF-κB activation and IL-6 secretion was observed in SW480. 
Metabolomic analysis indicated influence of the moxifloxacin conjugates on 
intensity of lipid derivatives with the most successful metabolite profile in 
PC3. Our findings suggested the cytotoxic potential of moxifloxacin conjugates, 
especially with oleic and stearic acid can be beneficial in oncological therapy, 
including their possible anti-inflammatory and known antibacterial effect."
1241,"As a well-known marine metal element, Cd can significantly affect bivalve 
mollusk life processes such as growth and development. However, the effects of 
Cd on the molecular mechanisms of the economically important cephalopod species 
Sepia esculenta remain unclear. In this study, S. esculenta larval immunity 
exposed to Cd is explored based on RNA-Seq. The analyses of GO, KEGG, and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of 1,471 differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) reveal that multiple immune processes are affected by exposure such 
as inflammatory reaction and cell adhesion. Comprehensive analyses of KEGG 
signaling pathways and the PPI network are first used to explore Cd-exposed S. 
esculenta larval immunity, revealing the presence of 16 immune-related key and 
hub genes involved in exposure response. Results of gene and pathway functional 
analyses increase our understanding of Cd-exposed S. esculenta larval immunity 
and improve our overall understanding of mollusk immune functions."
1242,"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in marine 
and estuarine environments and is endemic among the global shrimp aquaculture 
industry. V. parahaemolyticus proteins PirA and PirB have been determined to be 
major virulence factors that contribute significantly to the development of 
acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease. Our previous work had demonstrated the 
lethality of recombinant PirA and PirB proteins to Pacific white shrimp 
(Liptopenaeus vannamei). To understand the host response to these proteins, 
recombinant PirA and PirB proteins were administered using a reverse gavage 
method and individual shrimp were then sampled over time. Shrimp hepatopancreas 
libraries were generated and RNA sequencing was performed on the control and 
recombinant PirA/B-treated samples. Differentially expressed genes were 
identified among the assayed time points. Differentially expressed genes that 
were co-expressed at the later time points (2-, 4- and 6-h) were also identified 
and gene associations were established to predict functional physiological 
networks. Our analysis reveals that the recombinant PirA and PirB proteins have 
likely initiated an early host response involving several cell survival 
signaling and innate immune processes."
1243,"Perimenopause is a natural transition to menopause, when hormone disturbance can 
result in both short-term mental disorders, such as anxiety, and long-term 
neuroinflammation due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, which may lead to 
more serious neurological disorders later on, such as dementia. Effective 
treatments may prevent both short-term and long-term neurological sequela, which 
formed the aim of this study. In aged female C57BL/6 mice (16-18 months of age), 
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentiated from human-induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs), were administered via tail vein injection. Mice showed 
increased blood estrogen levels, alleviated anxiety and neuroinflammation, and 
improved BBB integrity. Interestingly, transplanted MSCs were located close to 
ovarian sympathetic nerves and decreased ovarian norepinephrine levels, which in 
turn increased ovarian estrogen secretion. Moreover, the administration of 
anastrozole, an inhibitor of estrogen synthesis, diminished the therapeutic 
effects of MSCs in vivo, suggesting the effect to be estrogen-dependent. In 
vitro study confirmed the impact of MSCs on sympathetic nerves via mitochondria 
exchange. In conclusion, iPSC-derived MSCs may provide a novel option to manage 
perimenopause-related hormonal dysregulation and neurological disorders during 
the female aging process."
1244,"With the aging of global population, the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) has surged in recent decades. NAFLD is a multifactorial disease 
that follows a progressive course, ranging from simple fatty liver, nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It 
is well established that aging induces pathological changes in liver and 
potentiates the occurrence and progression of NAFLD, HCC and other age-related 
liver diseases. Studies of senescent cells also indicate a pivotal engagement in 
the development of NAFLD via diverse mechanisms. Moreover, nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NAD+), silence information regulator protein family (sirtuins), 
and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) are three vital and broadly studied 
targets involved in aging process and NAFLD. Nevertheless, the crucial role of 
these aging-associated factors in aging-related NAFLD remains underestimated. 
Here, we reviewed the current research on the roles of aging, cellular 
senescence and three aging-related factors in the evolution of NAFLD to HCC, 
aiming at inspiring promising therapeutic targets for aging-related NAFLD and 
its progression."
1245,"Fiber growing inside the cotton bolls is a highly demandable product and its 
quality is key to the success of the textile industry. Despite the various 
efforts to improve cotton fiber staple length Pakistan has to import millions of 
bales to sustain its industrial needs. To improve cotton fiber quality Bacterial 
cellulose synthase (Bcs) genes (acsA, acsB) were expressed in a local cotton 
variety CEMB-00. In silico studies revealed a number of conserved domains both 
in the cotton-derived and bacterial cellulose synthases which are essential for 
the cellulose synthesis. Transformation efficiency of 1.27% was achieved by 
using Agrobacterium shoot apex cut method of transformation. The quantitative 
mRNA expression analysis of the Bcs genes in transgenic cotton fiber was found 
to be many folds higher during secondary cell wall synthesis stage (35 DPA) than 
the expression during elongation phase (10 DPA). Average fiber length of the 
transgenic cotton plant lines S-00-07, S-00-11, S-00-16 and S-00-23 was 
calculated to be 13.02% higher than that of the non-transgenic control plants. 
Likewise, the average fiber strength was found to be 20.92% higher with an 
enhanced cellulose content of 22.45%. The mutated indigenous cellulose synthase 
genes of cotton generated through application of CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in 6.03% 
and 12.10% decrease in fiber length and strength respectively. Furthermore, 
mature cotton fibers of transgenic cotton plants were found to have increased 
number of twists with smooth surface as compared to non-transgenic control when 
analyzed under scanning electron microscope. XRD analysis of cotton fibers 
revealed less cellulose crystallinity index in transgenic cotton fibers as 
compared to control fibers due to deposition of more amorphous cellulose in 
transgenic fibers as a result of Bcs gene expression. This study paved the way 
towards unraveling the fact that Bcs genes influence cellulose synthase activity 
and this enzyme helps in determining the fate of cotton fiber length and 
strength."
1246,"We reported that A-kinase anchoring protein 5 (AKAP5) played a role in 
cardiomyocyte apoptosis after hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R). The role of AKAP5 in 
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has not been fully elucidated. Herein we investigated 
whether AKAP5 regulates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). After H/R, deficiency 
of AKAP5 in H9C2 cardiomyocytes and neonatal rat cardiac myocytes activated 
CaMKII and stimulated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. AKAP5 upregulation limited 
this. Low expression of AKAP5 increased CaMKII interaction with histone 
deacetylases 4/5 (HDAC4/5) and increased nuclear export of HDAC4/5. In addition, 
AKAP5 interactions with protein kinase A (PKA) and phospholamban (PLN) were 
diminished. Moreover, the phosphorylation of PLN was decreased, and 
intracellular calcium increased. Interference of this process with St-Ht31 
increased CaMKII signaling, decreased PLN phosphorylation and promoted post-H/R 
cell hypertrophy. And PKA-anchoring deficient AKAP5ΔPKA could not attenuate 
hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but AKAP5 could. 
Altogether, AKAP5 downregulation exacerbated H/R-induced hypertrophy in 
cardiomyocytes. This was due to, in part, to less in AKAP5-PKA interaction and 
the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ with a subsequent increase in CaMKII 
activity."
1247,"High expression of the transmembrane receptor IL6ST (gp130) has been identified 
as a predictive biomarker of endocrine treatment response in ERα-positive breast 
cancers. To investigate its function further in this disease, this study 
evaluated the expression, function and signalling of IL6ST in ERα-positive 
breast cancer cell lines and investigated crosstalk between ERα and IL6ST. IL6ST 
was differentially expressed in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines (low in 
MCF-7, high in ZR751 and T47D), while multiple soluble isoforms of IL6ST were 
identified. IL6ST is the common signal transducing receptor component for the 
IL6ST family of cytokines and the effects of seven IL6ST cytokines on these cell 
lines were studied. These cytokines caused differential growth and migration 
effects in these cell lines e.g. MCF-7 cells were growth-stimulated, while ZR751 
cells were inhibited by IL6 and OSM.. Activation of the STAT and ERK pathways is 
associated with these responses. Evidence to support trans-signalling involved 
in cell growth and migration was obtained in both MCF-7 and ZR751 models. 
Interaction between cytokines and estrogen on ERα-positive cell lines growth 
were analysed. High expression of IL6ST (in ZR751) may lead to growth inhibition 
by interacting cytokines while lower expression (in MCF-7) appears associated 
with proliferation. High IL6ST expression is consistent with a more beneficial 
clinical outcome if cytokine action contributes to anti-estrogen action."
1248,"Fosamprenavir is a phosphate ester prodrug that, upon dissolution, is cleaved to 
the poorly soluble yet readily absorbable parent drug amprenavir. In this study, 
a novel cell-free in vitro setup with quasi-continuous monitoring of the dynamic 
dissolution/bio-conversion/permeation of fosamprenavir was designed and tested. 
It consists of side-by-side diffusion cells, where the donor and acceptor 
compartments are separated by the biomimetic barrier PermeaPad®, and sampling 
from the donor compartment is accomplished via a microdialysis probe. Externally 
added bovine alkaline phosphatase induced bioconversion in the donor 
compartment. Microdialysis sampling allowed to follow the enzymatic conversion 
of fosamprenavir to amprenavir by the bovine alkaline phosphatase in an (almost) 
real-time manner eliminating the need to remove or inactivate the enzyme. 
Biomimetic conversion rates in the setup were established by adding appropriate 
amounts of the alkaline phosphatase. A substantial (6.5-fold) and persistent 
supersaturation of amprenavir was observed due to bioconversion at lower (500 
µM) concentrations, resulting in a substantially increased flux across the 
biomimetic barrier, nicely reflecting the situation in vivo. At conditions with 
an almost 10-fold higher dose than the usual human dose, some replicates showed 
premature precipitation and collapse of supersaturation, while others did not. 
In conclusion, the proposed novel tool appears very promising in gaining an 
in-depth mechanistic understanding of the bioconversion/permeation interplay, 
including transient supersaturation of phosphate-ester prodrugs like 
fosamprenavir."
1249,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) can easily injure the intestinal tract, which represents 
the first barrier against food contaminants. The intestinal toxicity induced by 
DON was mainly focused on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, 
however, the underlying mechanisms by which DON triggers apoptosis by other 
pathways remain poorly understood. In this study, the Janus kinase 2/signal 
transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT-3) pathway was proposed 
to regulate the intrinsic apoptosis induced by DON and thoroughly investigated 
in intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). First, DON was found to be 
able to efficiently inhibit cell viability and increase the release of lactate 
dehydrogenase. It could also enhance the activity of the cleaved caspase-3 in a 
time-dependent manner, accompanied by a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential 
and an up-regulation of the apoptosis rate. Then, the expression of genes 
associated with inflammation and apoptosis were investigated. DON increased the 
expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, SOCS3 and Bax, but decreased the expression of 
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Moreover, we discovered that DON robustly inhibited STAT-3 
activity together with the down-regulation of JAK2, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, 
paralleling the increase in p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, a pharmacological 
activation of JAK2/STAT-3 alleviated DON induced-apoptosis. Concurrent with the 
apoptotic pathway, during the initial exposure to DON (first 4 h), a survival 
pathway involving phosphorylated Erk1/2, Akt, and FoxO1 was also observed. Thus, 
apoptosis induced by DON was Janus faced: although the survival pathway was 
activated, the DON-induced apoptotic JAK2/STAT-3/caspase-3 pathway dominated, 
leading to an imbalance in cell homeostasis. This study provides a novel avenue 
to comprehensively reveal the pathological mechanisms of DON-induced intestinal 
disorders, which is promising for future applications to other contaminants in 
food and feed."
1250,"The cardiac neural crest is a subpopulation of cells arising from the caudal 
hindbrain. The delaminated cardiac neural crest cells migrate to the heart using 
the CXCR/SDF1 chemokine signaling system. These cells contribute to the 
formation of the cardiovascular system, including the septation of the outflow 
tract, which is unique to these cells. Here, we investigated the effect of 
ectopic expression of the cardiac neural crest gene MafB on trunk neural crest 
cells. First, we found that MafB has the potential to activate its own 
cis-regulatory element in enteric and trunk neural crest cells but not in 
cranial neural crest cells. Forced expression of two cardiac neural crest genes, 
Ets1 and Sox8, together with or without MafB, induced ectopic Sox10E2 enhancer 
activity in the trunk region. Finally, we uncovered that the expression of MafB, 
Ets1 and Sox8 can induce ectopic CXCR4 expression in the trunk neural crest 
cells, resulting in acquisition of responsiveness to the SDF1 signal. These 
results demonstrate that MafB, Ets1 and Sox8 are critical components for 
generation of the identity of the cardiac neural crest, especially the cell 
migration property."
1251,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common cause of morbidity in human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals. HIV infection leads to a wide 
spectrum of kidney cell damage, including tubular epithelial cell (TEC) injury. 
Among the HIV-1 proteins, the pathologic effects of viral protein R (Vpr) are 
well established and include DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest, and cell 
death. Several in vitro studies have unraveled the molecular pathways driving 
the cytopathic effects of Vpr in tubular epithelial cells. However, the in vivo 
effects of Vpr on tubular injury and CKD pathogenesis have not been thoroughly 
investigated. Here, we use a novel inducible tubular epithelial cell-specific 
Vpr transgenic mouse model to show that Vpr expression leads to progressive 
tubulointerstitial damage, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, and tubular 
cyst development. Importantly, Vpr-expressing tubular epithelial cells displayed 
significant hypertrophy, aberrant cell division, and atrophy; all reminiscent of 
tubular injuries observed in human HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). 
Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed the Vpr-mediated transcriptomic 
responses in specific tubular subsets and highlighted the potential multifaceted 
role of p53 in the regulation of cell metabolism, proliferation, and death 
pathways in Vpr-expressing tubular epithelial cells. Thus, our study 
demonstrates that HIV Vpr expression in tubular cells is sufficient to induce 
HIVAN-like tubulointerstitial damage and fibrosis, independent of 
glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria. Additionally, as this new mouse model 
develops progressive CKD with diffuse fibrosis and kidney failure, it can serve 
as a useful tool to examine the mechanisms of kidney disease progression and 
fibrosis in vivo."
1252,"Increased expression of AP-1 transcription factor components has been reported 
in acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the role of specific components, such as 
Fosl1, in tubular cells or AKI is unknown. Upstream regulator analysis of murine 
nephrotoxic AKI transcriptomics identified AP-1 as highly upregulated. Among 
AP-1 canonical components, Fosl1 was found to be upregulated in two 
transcriptomics datasets from nephrotoxic murine AKI induced by folic acid or 
cisplatin and from proximal tubular cells exposed to TWEAK, a cytokine mediator 
of AKI. Fosl1 was minimally expressed in the kidneys of control uninjured mice. 
Increased Fosl1 protein was localized to proximal tubular cell nuclei in AKI. In 
human AKI, FOSL1 was found present in proximal tubular cells in kidney sections 
and in urine along with increased urinary FOSL1 mRNA. Selective Fosl1 deficiency 
in proximal tubular cells (Fosl1Δtub) increased the severity of murine 
cisplatin- or folate-induced AKI as characterized by lower kidney function, more 
severe kidney inflammation and Klotho downregulation. Indeed, elevated AP-1 
activity was observed after cisplatin-induced AKI in Fosl1Δtub mice compared to 
wild type mice. More severe Klotho downregulation preceded more severe kidney 
dysfunction. The Klotho promoter was enriched in Fosl1 binding sites and Fosl1 
bound to the Klotho promoter in cisplatin-AKI. In cultured proximal tubular 
cells, Fosl1 targeting increased the proinflammatory response and downregulated 
Klotho. In vivo, recombinant Klotho administration protected Fosl1Δtub mice from 
cisplatin-AKI. Thus, increased proximal tubular Fosl1 expression during AKI is 
an adaptive response, preserves Klotho. and limits the severity of tubular cell 
injury and AKI."
1253,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rougan Formula (RG) has long been clinically 
applied to treat hepatic fibrosis in patients with different chronic liver 
diseases. However, the core active substances and the potential pharmacological 
mechanisms of RG remain unclear.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study is to explore bioactive components, 
key targets, and potential mechanisms of RG by performing network 
pharmacological analyses and experimental model validation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All chemical components in RG extract were identified 
using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem 
mass technology. The candidate components and drug targets of RG, as well as 
disease-related genes, were extracted from TCMSP and GeneCards databases. The 
potential pathways related to genes were predicted by Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses. The core 
bioactive components, key targets, and signaling pathways were ultimately 
obtained by analyzing protein-protein interaction (PPI) and 
component-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks. Subsequently, the efficacy and 
underlying mechanisms of RG on hepatic fibrosis were experimentally validated in 
transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)-induced hepatic stellate cell 
activation model and CCL4-induced hepatic fibrosis mouse model.
RESULTS: A total of 52 components in RG extract were obtained, and 22 of them 
were selected as the core bioactive components. Five hundred and thirty-nine 
overlapped targets were determined by matching drug targets with disease-related 
targets. The results of PPI and C-T-P network analyses revealed 100 key targets 
and 19 signaling pathways associated with RG efficacy. In vitro and in vivo 
studies further verified that RG exerted a significant anti-hepatic fibrotic 
effect by suppressing the activation of hepatic stellate cells by downregulating 
the TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: These results may provide some evidence for further clinical 
research and development of RG formula as an effective and safe drug for hepatic 
fibrosis treatment."
1254,"INTRODUCTION: X-linked hypophosphatemic (XLH) rickets causes significant bone 
deformities in the lower limbs resulting from a bone mineralization defect. 
According to Frost's Mechanostat theory, compensatory modeling of the bones 
takes place during increased mechanical loads. In addition, mechanical stimuli 
modulate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells; common precursors to 
bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts.
HYPOTHESIS: Bone deformities of the lower limbs lead to increased femoral bone 
mass and decreased fatty infiltration of the bone marrow (FIBM) in children with 
XLH rickets compared to a control group.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven children (10.3y [6-17]) with XLH rickets and 22 
healthy children (10.2y [5-15.5]) underwent lower limb Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging. A calculation of FIBM was performed at the mid-femur, as well as a 
calculation of the total bone cross-sectional area (CSA), the cortical CSA, the 
anteroposterior and mediolateral axes of the femur, bone marrow and the 
thickness of the femoral cortices.
RESULTS: Total bone CSA, total cortical CSA and bone marrow CSA were higher in 
the XLH group than in the control group (p<0.05). The mid-lateral diameters of 
the femur and bone marrow were more elongated than those of the control group 
(p<0.001). Only the anterior cortex was thinned in the XLH group (p=0.001), 
while there was no difference with the control group for the posterior, medial 
and lateral cortices. The total percentage of FIBM was 72.81% [±3.95] and 77.4% 
[±5.52] for the XLH and control groups respectively (p<0.001).
DISCUSSION: The increase in bone mass in the XLH population reflects an 
adaptation of bone tissue to the bone deformities present in this pathology. The 
decrease in FIBM indicates a lower risk of osteoporosis in the XLH population

LEVEL OF STUDY: III; Case-control study."
1255,"OBJECTIVE: Early detection of OSCC is a crucial step towards improving OSCC 
prognosis. In recent years, novel diagnostic aids such as light-based detection 
systems have been introduced for early diagnosis. VELscope is one such 
light-based device which is used to examine tissue fluorescence. Based on 
different studies, VELscope has a sensitivity of 90% in the diagnosis of oral 
premalignant and malignant lesions. Tumor depth of invasion and invasive front 
have recently been proposed as influential factors in OSCC prognosis. Therefore, 
the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between tissue color seen 
through this device and tumor depth of invasion.
METHODS & MATERIALS: 20 histopathologically approved OSCCs were included in this 
study. Conventional oral examination was carried out followed by an assessment 
of the lesion using VELscope. The H&E slides prepared following the final OSCC 
surgeries were then examined by an oral pathologist to assess tumor depth of 
invasion (interpreted as low-risk/high-risk), invasive front(low-risk/high-risk) 
and perivascular and perineural invasions. Data was transferred to SPSS 16 
software. The association between color changes and histopathological factors 
was analyzed using the fisher's exact and chi-square tests.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 51/5+/-16/74, 60% of which were men. 
Most lesions were exophytic and the most common color seen during VELscope 
examination was red. 55% and 50% of the OSCCs showed high-risk tumor depths and 
invasive fronts respectively. Perivascular and perineural invasion was seen in 
55% and 35% of the samples respectively. Statistical analysis showed that 72/2% 
of the lesions with high tumor depths and 70% with high-risk invasive fronts 
were seen as red, although these associations were not significant (P>0/05). 
Tumor depth was significantly correlated with invasive front (P<0/05).
CONCLUSION: There was no significant relationship between the type of color seen 
through VELscope and tumor depth of invasion, however most cases with high-risk 
depth of invasions were red."
1256,"The tumor-suppressive activity of p53 is largely attributed to its ability to 
induce cell death, including apoptosis through transcription-dependent and 
-independent mechanisms. On the one hand, nuclear p53 transcriptionally 
activates the expression of a myriad of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family genes, such 
as NOXA, PUMA, BID, BAD, BIK, BAX, etc., whereas inactivates the expression of 
anti-apoptotic BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL1, leading to mitochondrial apoptosis. On 
the other hand, cytoplasmic p53 also promotes mitochondrial apoptosis by 
directly associating with multiple BCL-2 family proteins in the mitochondria. 
Apoptosis-related protein in TGF-β signaling pathway (ARTS), a 
mitochondria-localized pro-apoptotic protein encoded by an alternative spliced 
variant of the SEPT4 gene, triggers apoptosis by facilitating proteasomal 
degradation of BCL-2 and XIAP upon pro-apoptotic stimuli. We recently identified 
SEPT4/ARTS as a new p53 target gene in response to genotoxic stress. ARTS in 
turn binds to p53, drives its mitochondrial localization, and enhances the 
interaction between p53 and BCL-XL, thereby promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. 
This review will illustrate the mechanisms of p53-induced mitochondrial 
apoptosis, offer some recently discovered new insights into the ARTS functions 
in regulating mitochondrial cell death, and discuss the clinical significance of 
ARTS in cancer and non-cancer diseases."
1257,"The influence of mineralogy on the assembly of microbial communities in glacial 
environments has been difficult to assess due to complications in isolating 
mineralogy from other variables. Here we assess the abundance and composition of 
microbial communities that colonized defined minerals incubated for 12 months in 
two meltwater streams (N and S) emanating from Kaldalónsjökull (Kal), a 
basalt-hosted glacier in Iceland. The two streams shared similar meltwater 
geochemistry as well as bedrock and proglacial sediment elemental compositions. 
Yet genomic DNA and PCR-amplifiable 16S rRNA genes were detected only in Kal S. 
The amount of recoverable DNA was highest for hematite incubated in Kal S and 
the composition of 16S rRNA genes recovered from Kal S sediments was most like 
those recovered from hematite and magnetite, an effect driven largely by 
similarities in the relative abundance of the putative hydrogenotrophic iron 
reducer Rhodoferax. We suggest this is attributable to comminution and 
weathering reactions involving exposed iron silicate minerals that generate and 
release hydrogen and Fe(III) that can be coupled to support microbial metabolism 
in Kaldalónsjökull, and possibly other basaltic habitats. The low abundance of 
cells in Kal N could be due to low availability of Fe(III) or another substrate."
1258,"Plasma lipid transport and metabolism is essential to ensure correct cellular 
function throughout the body. Dynamically regulated in time and space, the well 
characterized mechanisms underpinning plasma lipid transport and metabolism 
offer an enticing, but as yet underexplored, rationale to design synthetic lipid 
nanoparticles with inherent cell/tissue selectivity. Herein, we describe a 
systemically administered liposome formulation, composed of just two lipids, 
that is capable of hijacking a triglyceride lipase-mediated lipid transport 
pathway resulting in liposome recognition and uptake within specific endothelial 
cell subsets. In the absence of targeting ligands, liposome-lipase interactions 
are mediated by a unique, phase-separated (""parachute"") liposome morphology. 
Within the embryonic zebrafish, selective liposome accumulation is observed at 
the developing blood-brain-barrier. In mice, extensive liposome accumulation 
within the liver and spleen - which is reduced but not eliminated following 
small molecule lipase inhibition - supports a role for endothelial lipase but 
highlights these liposomes are also subject to significant ""off-target"" by 
reticuloendothelial system organs. Overall, these compositionally simplistic 
liposomes offer new insights into the discovery and design of lipid-based 
nanoparticles that can exploit endogenous lipid transport and metabolism 
pathways to achieve cell selective targeting in vivo. This article is protected

1259,"In the present study, we investigated a possible relationship between the immune 
response and the oxidative stress (OS) state trend in a group of 12 chickens 
after intraocular administration of an attenuated Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) 
vaccine. Blood samples were collected at the vaccination time (T0), after 14 
(T1) and 21 d (T2). White blood cell count (WBC), differential leucocyte count, 
and anti-MG antibodies titer (S/P) were studied as immune response indexes. As 
plasmatic OS biomarkers levels, we considered malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric 
oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen metabolites derived 
compounds (d-ROMs), the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and superoxide 
anion (O2-). After antigenic stimulation, it was observed a significant decrease 
in monocythemia and a significant increase in thrombocythemia, S/P, MDA, and 
SOD. Furthermore, subjects with high d-ROMs levels at T0 tended to develop 
higher cellular mobilization with increases in WBC and lymphocytes accompanied 
by lower antibody release. It was also observed that the antioxidant components 
FRAP and SOD were moderately positively correlated to the entity of antibody 
response."
1260,"The present study was performed to investigate the effect of oral administration 
of β-glucan (G70), a product obtained from the cell wall of yeast, on Newcastle 
disease virus (NDV)-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers, lymphocyte 
proliferation, and the role of T lymphocyte subpopulations in chickens treated 
with live NDV vaccine. In addition, the influence of β-glucan on splenic gene 
expression was investigated by transcriptome sequencing. The results revealed 
that the supplementation of β-glucan boosted the titer of serum NDV HI increased 
the NDV stimulation index of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and intestinal 
tract, and promoted the differentiation of T lymphocytes into CD4+ T cells. The 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis demonstrated that G70 upregulated the mRNA 
expressions related to G-protein coupled receptor and MHC class I polypeptide, 
and downregulated the mRNA expressions related to cathelicidin and 
beta-defensin. The immunomodulatory effect of G70 might function through 
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. To sum up, G70 could boost 
the immunological efficacy of live NDV vaccine in chickens and could be applied 
as a potential adjuvant candidate in the poultry industry."
1261,"The crop of pigeon has specific characteristics as producing crop milk in the 
lactating period. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the regulation of 
crop lactation remain unclear. miRNAs, the essential regulators of gene 
expression, are implicated in various physiological and biological activities. 
In this study, we discovered a new miRNA that regulated 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (PIK3CD) 
and crop fibrocyte proliferation. Results of the luciferase reporter assay 
suggested that miR-193-5p suppressed PIK3CD expression by targeting a conserved 
binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of PIK3CD mRNA. MiR-193-5p 
promoted crop fibrocyte proliferation and migration, whereas PIK3CD inhibited 
these effects. These findings suggested an important regulatory role of 
miR-193-5p in crop fibrocyte proliferation, suggesting that miR-193-5p and 
PIK3CD might be important regulators of crop milk production."
1262,"Bioassays using cultures of the toxic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum and the 
ciliate Cyclidium sp. as prey were conducted to test the effect of pH 
(range = 6.5 - 8.5), salinity (range = 1.50 - 7.50‰), and a combination of pH 
and salinity on the toxicity of P. parvum. pH had a significant effect on P. 
parvum toxicity. Toxicity was rapidly (within 24 hr) induced by increasing pH of 
the medium, or reduced by lowering pH. Conversely, lowering salinity reduced 
toxicity, albeit less effectively compared to pH, and P. parvum cells remained 
toxic at the lowest values tested (1.50‰ at pH 7.5). An additional effect 
between pH and salinity was also observed: low salinity combined with low pH led 
to not only decreased toxicity, but also resulted in lower P. parvum growth 
rates. Such effects of pH and salinity on P. parvum growth and toxicity provide 
insight into the environmental factors supporting community dominance and toxic 
blooms of the alga."
1263,"Endothelial metabolism is a promising target for vascular functional regulation 
and disease therapy. Glucose is the primary fuel for endothelial metabolism, 
supporting ATP generation and endothelial cell survival. Multiple studies have 
discussed the role of endothelial glucose catabolism, such as glycolysis and 
oxidative phosphorylation, in vascular functional remodeling. However, the role 
of the first gatekeepers of endothelial glucose utilization, glucose 
transporters, in the vasculature has long been neglected. Here, this review 
summarizes glucose transporter studies in vascular research. We mainly focus on 
GLUT1 and GLUT3 because they are the most critical glucose transporters 
responsible for most endothelial glucose uptake. Some interesting topics are 
also discussed, intending to provide directions for endothelial glucose 
transporter research in the future."
1264,"The discovery of lung tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells and the elucidation 
of their function in antiviral immunity have inspired considerable efforts to 
leverage the power of TRM cells, in defense to the infections and reinfections 
by respiratory viruses. Here, we have reviewed lung TRM cell identification, 
molecular regulation, and function after influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections. 
Furthermore, we have discussed emerging data on TRM responses induced by 
systemic and mucosal vaccination strategies. We hope that our current 
outstanding of TRM cells in this review could provide insights toward the 
development of vaccines capable of inducing highly efficacious mucosal TRM 
responses for protection against respiratory viral infections."
1265,"Short aromatic peptide derivatives, i.e. peptides or amino acids modified with 
aromatic groups, such as 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), can self-assemble 
into extracellular matrix-like hydrogels due to their nanofibrillar 
architecture. Among different types of amino acids, lysine (Lys) and glycine 
(Gly) are involved in multiple physiological processes, being key factors in the 
proper growth of cells, carnitine production, and collagen formation. We have 
previously successfully presented the possibility of obtaining supramolecular 
gels based on Fmoc-Lys-Fmoc and short peptides such as Fmoc-Gly-Gly-Gly in order 
to use them as a substrate for cell cultures. In this paper, we investigated how 
the introduction of a gelling polymer can influence the properties of the 
network as well as the compatibility of the resulting materials with different 
cell types. A series of hydrogel compositions consisting of combinations of 
Fmoc-Lys-Fmoc and Fmoc-Gly-Gly-Gly with Agarose and Phytagel were thus obtained. 
All compositions formed structured gels as shown by rheological studies and 
scanning electron microscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis 
evidenced the formation of H bonds between the polysaccharides and amino acids 
or short peptides. Moreover, all gels exhibited good cell viability on 
fibroblasts as demonstrated by a live-dead staining test and good in vivo 
biocompatibility, which highlights the great potential of these biomaterials for 
biomedical applications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1266,"This study was designed to screen novel thiourea derivatives against different 
enzymes, such as α-amylase, α-glucosidase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B, and 
advanced glycated end product (AGEs). A cytotoxicity analysis was performed 
using rat L6 myotubes and molecular docking analysis was performed to map the 
binding interactions between the active compounds and α-amylase and 
α-glucosidase. The data revealed the potency of five compounds, including E 
(1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dimethyl phenyl) thiourea), AG 
(1-(2-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl)-3-(3-methoxy phenyl) thiourea), AF 
(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4-ethylphenyl) thiourea), AD 
(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4-ethylphenyl) thiourea), and AH 
(1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-(2-iodophenyl) thiourea), showed activity against 
α-amylase. The corresponding percentage inhibitions were found to be 85 ± 1.9, 
82 ± 0.7, 75 ± 1.2, 72 ± 0.4, and 65 ± 1.1%, respectively. These compounds were 
then screened using in vitro assays. Among them, AH showed the highest activity 
against α-glucosidase, AGEs, and PTP1B, with percentage inhibitions of 86 ± 0.4% 
(IC50  = 47.9 μM), 85 ± 0.7% (IC50  = 49.51 μM), and 85 ± 0.5% (IC50 
 = 79.74 μM), respectively. Compound AH showed an increased glucose uptake at a 
concentration of 100 μM. Finally, an in vivo study was conducted using a 
streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model and PTP1B expression was assessed 
using real-time PCR. Additionally, we examined the hypoglycemic effect of 
compound AH in diabetic rats compared to the standard drug glibenclamide."
1267,"Currently, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most produced nanoparticles in 
global market and have been widely utilized in the biomedical field. Here, we 
investigated the morphological and mechanical effects of AgNPs on cancerous 
cells of A549 cells and SMMC-7721 cells with atomic force microscope (AFM). The 
influences of AgNPs on the morphological properties and mechanical properties of 
cancerous cells were characterized utilizing the force-volume (FV) mode and 
force spectroscopy (FS) mode of AFM measurement. We mainly focus on the 
comparison of the effects of AgNPs on the two types of cancerous cells based on 
the fitting results of calculating the Young's moduli based on Sneddon model. 
The results showed that the morphology changed little but the mechanical 
properties of height, roughness, adhesion force and Young's moduli of two 
cancerous cells varied significantly with the stimulation of different 
concentrations of AgNPs. This research has provide insights into the 
classification and characterization of the effects of the various concentrations 
of AgNPs on the cancerous cells in vitro by utilizing AFM methodologies for 
disease therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1268,"Statins reduce serum cholesterol and isoprenoids by the inhibition of 
cholesterol synthesis in the mevalonate pathway. Exosomes are extracellular 
vesicles (30-200 nm) released by all cells that regulate cell-to-cell 
communication in health and disease by transferring functional proteins, 
metabolites and nucleic acids to recipient cells. There are many reports that 
show an effect of statins on exosomes, from their production and release to 
their content and performance. In this review, we have summarized existing data 
on the impact of statins on the biosynthesis, secretion, content, uptake and 
function of exosomes."
1269,"Intramuscular administration of p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome1)-encoding plasmid 
demonstrated an anticancer effect in rodent models and dogs as well as a high 
safety profile and the first evidence of clinical benefits in humans. Also, an 
anti-inflammatory effect of the plasmid was reported in several rodent disease 
models. Yet, the mechanisms of action for the p62 plasmid remain unknown. Here, 
we tested a hypothesis that the p62-plasmid can act through the modulation of 
bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal cells (MSCs). We demonstrated that a p62 
plasmid can affect MSCs indirectly by stimulating p62-transfected cells to 
secrete an active ingredient(s) sensed by untransfected MSCs. When we 
transfected MSCs with the p62-plasmid, collected their supernatant, and added it 
to an untransfected MSCs culture, it switched the differentiation state and 
prompt osteogenic responses of the untransfected MSCs. According to an accepted 
viewpoint, ovariectomy leads to bone pathology via dysregulation of MSCs, and 
restoring the MSC homeostasis would restore ovariectomy-induced bone damage. To 
validate our in vitro observations in a clinically relevant in vivo model, we 
administered the p62 plasmid to ovariectomized rats. It partially reversed bone 
loss and notably reduced adipogenesis with concurrent reestablishing of the MSC 
subpopulation pool within the bone marrow. Overall, our study suggests that 
remote modulation of progenitor MSCs via administering a p62-encoding plasmid 
may constitute a mechanism for its previously reported effects and presents a 
feasible disease-preventing and/or therapeutic strategy."
1270,"Aging causes loss of brain synapses and memory, and microglial phagocytosis of 
synapses may contribute to this loss. Stressed neurons can release the 
nucleotide UTP, which is rapidly converted into UDP, that in turn activates the 
P2Y6 receptor (P2Y6 R) on the surface of microglia, inducing microglial 
phagocytosis of neurons. However, whether the activation of P2Y6 R affects 
microglial phagocytosis of synapses is unknown. We show here that inactivation 
of P2Y6 R decreases microglial phagocytosis of isolated synapses (synaptosomes) 
and synaptic loss in neuronal-glial co-cultures. In vivo, wild-type mice aged 
from 4 to 17 months exhibited reduced synaptic density in cortical and 
hippocampal regions, which correlated with increased internalization of synaptic 
material within microglia. However, this aging-induced synaptic loss and 
internalization were absent in P2Y6 R knockout mice, and these mice also lacked 
any aging-induced memory loss. Thus, P2Y6 R appears to mediate aging-induced 
loss of synapses and memory by increasing microglial phagocytosis of synapses. 
Consequently, blocking P2Y6 R has the potential to prevent age-associated memory 
impairment."
1271,"Radiotherapy is one of the most common modalities for the treatment of a wide 
range of tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC); however, radioresistance of 
cancer cells remains a major limitation for this treatment. Following 
radiotherapy, the activities of various cellular mechanisms and cell signaling 
pathways are altered, resulting in the development of radioresistance, which 
leads to therapeutic failure and poor prognosis in patients with cancer. 
Furthermore, even though several inhibitors have been developed to target tumor 
resistance, these molecules can induce side effects in nontumor cells due to low 
specificity and efficiency. However, the role of these mechanisms in CRC has not 
been extensively studied. This review discusses recent studies regarding the 
relationship between radioresistance and the alterations in a series of cellular 
mechanisms and cell signaling pathways that lead to therapeutic failure and 
tumor recurrence. Our review also presents recent advances in the in vitro/in 
vivo study models aimed at investigating the radioresistance mechanism in CRC. 
Furthermore, it provides a relevant biochemical basis in theory, which can be 
useful to improve radiotherapy sensitivity and prolong patient survival."
1272,"BACKGROUND: Succinate, although most famous for its role in the Krebs cycle, can 
be released extracellularly as a signal of cellular distress, particularly in 
situations of metabolic stress and inflammation. Solitary chemosensory cells 
(SCCs) express SUCNR1, the succinate receptor, and modulate type 2 inflammatory 
responses in helminth and protozoal infections in the small intestine. SCCs are 
the dominant epithelial source of interleukin-25 as well as an important source 
of cysteinyl leukotrienes in the airway and have been implicated as upstream 
agents in type 2 inflammation in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and asthma.
METHODS: In this study, we use scRNAseq analysis, live cell imaging of 
intracellular calcium from one donor and primary sinonasal air liquid interface 
(ALI) cultures from five donors to demonstrate preliminary evidence suggesting 
that succinate can act as a stimulant of SCCs in the human sinonasal epithelium.
RESULTS: Results from scRNAseq analysis show that approximately 10% of the 
SCC/Ionocyte cluster of cells express SUCNR1 as well as a small population of 
immune cells. Using live cell imaging of intracellular calcium, we also 
demonstrate that clusters of cells on primary sinonasal ALI cultures initiate 
calcium-mediated signaling in response to succinate stimulation. Furthermore, we 
demonstrate evidence that primary sinonasal ALI cultures treated with succinate 
had increased levels of apical beta-defensin 2, an antimicrobial peptide, 
compared to treatment with a control solution.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings demonstrate the need for further 
investigation into the activation of the sinonasal epithelium by succinate in 
the pathogenesis of CRS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1273,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyse the clinical and histopathological 
characteristics of focal oral melanocytic lesions in a Brazilian reference 
service in Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted over an 18-year 
period. Demographic data and clinical features were collected from the archives, 
and all biopsy specimens diagnosed as oral melanocytic lesions were retrieved 
and reviewed.
RESULTS: We identified 339 melanocytic lesions. Of these, 191 were melanotic 
macules, 112 melanocytic nevi, 14 mucosal lentigo simplex, 12 melanomas, nine 
solar lentigos, and one melanoacanthoma. Lesions occurred mostly in 
white-skinned (74.2%) women (65.2%). The main reported clinical aspect was the 
macule (67.4%), and the most affected site was the lip vermilion (25.4%), 
followed by the palate (22.9%). Melanomas were larger in size and were observed 
in older patients with an overall shorter time of onset. The most frequent 
subtypes of melanocytic nevi were intramucosal (44.6%), compound (24.1%), and 
blue nevus (20.5%). They showed a heterogeneous architectural pattern with the 
presence of the three cell types.
CONCLUSION: The most frequent lesions are melanotic macule and nevus, especially 
the intramucosal subtype. Patients are usually white-skinned women presenting a 
small, long-lasting, macular lesion on the lip vermilion or palate."
1274,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is common metabolic disease that poses a 
major risk to public health and fertility. Previous studies indicate that DM may 
cause male infertility by triggering oxidative stress and germ cell apoptosis in 
the testis. Due to the undesirable effects of known antidiabetic drugs, 
scientists have begun to investigate the use of alternative drugs to control 
infertility complications observed in men. In this context, present study aimed 
to investigate the possible antiapoptotic effect of losartan against DM-induced 
testicular germ cell apoptosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Expreimental DM model was induced by intraperitoneal 
injection of streptozocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg) to 28 rats, which were then randomly 
assigned to 4 groups; 1 mL saline solution was given to DM + saline group by 
oral gavage, 5 mg/kg/day oral losartan was given to DM + low-dose losartan, 
20 mg/kg/day oral losartan was given to DM + mid-dose losartan and, 80 mg/kg/day 
oral losartan was given to DM + high-dose losartan group for 4 weeks. Bax, Bcl-2 
and cleaved-Caspase 3 immunoexpression, terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase 
dutp nick end labeling (TUNEL), Annexin-V and Real Time PCR analyses performed 
to evaluate antiapoptotic effects of losartan on diabetic rats' testis. In 
addition, biochemical analyzes carried out to evaluate change in oxidative 
stress.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that losartan may have dose-related antiapoptotic 
effects on rats' testis via decreasing oxidative stress."
1275,"BACKGROUND: Increased Ca2+ entry causes an increase in tumor cell proliferation, 
apoptosis, cytosolic reactive free oxygen species (cyROS), and mitochondrial ROS 
(miROS) in tumor cells. The cyROS and miROS stimulate the cation channels, 
including the TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1. Sambucus ebulus L (SEB) (Dwarf Elder) 
induced both antioxidant and anticancer effects in the human hepatocarcinoma and 
human colon carcinoma cancer cell lines. We investigated the etiology of 
colorectal cancer and the impact of three channels, as well as the protective 
effects of SEB on apoptosis, cyROS, and miROS in the colon of mice with 
colitis-associated colon cancer (AOM/DSS).
METHODS: A total 28 mice were equally divided into four groups as control, SEB 
(100 mg/kg/day for 14 days), AOM/DSS, and SEB + AOM/DSS. Azoxymethane/dextran 
sulfate sodium-induced colon cancer associated with colitis was induced in the 
AOM/DSS groups within 10 weeks. At the end of the experiments, the colon samples 
were removed from the mice.
RESULTS: The protein bands of caspase - 3, TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1 were 
increased by the treatments of AOM/DSS. The levels of apoptosis, cyROS, cleaved 
caspase - 3, and cleaved caspase - 9, as well as the depolarization of the 
mitochondrial membrane, all increased in the AOM/DSS group. Although they were 
reduced in the SEB and AOM/DSS + SEB groups by the treatments of SEB, TRPA1 
(AP18), TRPM2 (ACA), and TRPV1 (capsazepine) antagonists, the apoptotic and 
oxidant values were further elevated in the AOM/DSS group by the treatments of 
TRPA1 (cinnamaldehyde), TRPM2 (H2O2), and TRPV1 (capsaicin) agonists.
CONCLUSION: The activations of TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1 channels induced the 
increase of apoptotic and oxidant actions in the colon cancer cells, although 
their inhibition via SEB treatment decreased the actions. Hence, TRPA1, TRPM2, 
and TRPV1 activations could be used as effective agents in the treatment of 
colon tumors."
1276,"BACKGROUND: As an available cell line, mouse pluripotent P19 has been widely 
employed for neuronal differentiation studies. In this research, by applying the 
in vitro differentiation of this cell line into neuron-like cells through 
retinoic acid (RA) treatment, the roles of some genes including DNMT3B, ICAM1, 
IRX3, JAK2, LHX1, SOX9, TBX3 and THY1 in neural differentiation was 
investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Bioinformatics, microscopic, and transcriptional studies 
were conducted in a time-dependent manner after RA-induced neural 
differentiation. According to bioinformatics studies, we determined the 
engagement of the metabolic and developmental super-pathways and pathways in 
neural cell differentiation, particularly focusing on the considered genes. 
According to our qRT-PCR analyses, JAK2, SOX9, TBX3, LHX1 and IRX3 genes were 
found to be significantly overexpressed in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.05). 
In addition, the significant downregulation of THY1, DNMT3B and ICAM1 genes was 
observed during the experiment (p < 0.05). The optical microscopic investigation 
showed that the specialized extensions of the neuron-like cells were revealed on 
day 8 after RA treatment.
CONCLUSION: Accordingly, the neural differentiation of P19 cell line and the 
role of the considered genes during the differentiation were proved. However, 
our results warrant further in vivo studies."
1277,"Dosing requires consideration of diverse patient-specific factors affecting drug 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The available pharmacometric methods have 
limited capacity for modeling the inter-relationships and patterns of 
variability among physiological determinants of drug dosing (PDODD). To 
investigate whether generative adversarial networks (GANs) can learn a 
generative model from real-world data that recapitulates PDODD distributions. A 
GAN architecture was developed for modeling a PDODD panel comprised of: age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, body weight, body surface area, total body fat, lean body 
weight, albumin concentration, glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), urine flow 
rate, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, alanine aminotransferase to alkaline 
phosphatase R-value, total bilirubin, active hepatitis B infection status, 
active hepatitis C infection status, red blood cell, white blood cell, and 
platelet counts. The panel variables were derived from National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data sets. The dependence of GAN-generated 
PDODD on age, race, and active hepatitis infections was assessed. The continuous 
PDODD biomarkers had diverse non-normal univariate distributions and bivariate 
trend patterns. The univariate distributions of PDODD biomarkers from GAN 
simulations satisfactorily approximated those in test data. The joint 
distribution of the continuous variables was visualized using three 
2-dimensional projection methods; for all three methods, the points from the GAN 
simulation random variate vectors were well dispersed amongst the test data. The 
age dependence trend patterns in GAN data were similar to those in test data. 
The histograms for R-values and EGFR from GAN simulations overlapped extensively 
with test data histograms for the Hispanic, White, African American, and Other 
race/ethnicity groups. The GAN-simulated data also mirrored the R-values and 
EGFR changes in active hepatitis C and hepatitis B infection. GANs are a 
promising approach for simulating the age, race/ethnicity and disease state 
dependencies of PDODD."
1278,"Liquid-liquid phase separation has emerged as a fundamental mechanism underlying 
intracellular organization, with evidence for it being reported in numerous 
different systems. However, there is a growing concern regarding the lack of 
quantitative rigor in the techniques employed to study phase separation, and 
their ability to account for the complex nature of the cellular milieu, which 
affects key experimentally observable measures, such as the shape, size and 
transport dynamics of liquid droplets. Here, we bridge this gap by combining 
recent experimental data with theoretical predictions that capture the 
subtleties of nonlinear elasticity and fluid transport. We show that within a 
biologically accessible range of material parameters, phase separation is highly 
sensitive to elastic properties and can thus be used as a mechanical switch to 
rapidly transition between different states in cellular systems. Furthermore, we 
show that this active mechanically mediated mechanism can drive transport across 
cells at biologically relevant timescales and could play a crucial role in 
promoting spatial localization of condensates; whether cells exploit such 
mechanisms for transport of their constituents remains an open question."
1279,"In this study, we have investigated the chemotherapeutic potential of titanium 
dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on skin and breast cancer cells. The cells have 
treated with a 75 µg/ml concentration of titanium dioxide because it is a 
recommended dose with proven effectiveness in vitro studies and then the cells 
were exposed to UV-A radiation. The combined effects of titanium dioxide and 
UV-A radiation on cell viability, cell cycle, plasma membrane, mitochondrial 
membrane potentials and apoptotic activity of the cells were investigated. The 
viability of SK-MEL 30 cells was measured by MTT assay and apoptotic activity of 
cells was determined by Annexin-V FITC/PI staining. As a result of the research, 
an increase was observed in the viability of cells treated with 75 µg/ml 
titanium dioxide concentration, while a significant decrease in cell viability 
was observed for both cell types when UV-A radiation and TiO2 were applied 
together. The results also showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells 
increased as a result of UV + TiO2 exposure. Accordingly, it can be said that 
TiO2 nanoparticles may research as potential chemotherapeutic agents for skin 
and breast cancers, especially in the presence of UV radiation."
1280,"Compelling pieces of epidemiological, clinical, and experimental research have 
demonstrated that Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor associated with 
increased cancer incidence and mortality in many human neoplasms. In the 
pathophysiology context of DM, many of the main classical actors are relevant 
elements that can fuel the different steps of the carcinogenesis process. 
Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, metabolic inflammation, and dyslipidemia are 
among the classic contributors to this association. Furthermore, new emerging 
actors have received particular attention in the last few years, and compelling 
data support that the microbiome, the epigenetic changes, the reticulum 
endoplasmic stress, and the increased glycolytic influx also play important 
roles in promoting the development of many cancer types. The arsenal of 
glucose-lowering therapeutic agents used for treating diabetes is wide and 
diverse, and a growing body of data raised during the last two decades has tried 
to clarify the contribution of therapeutic agents to this association. However, 
this research area remains controversial, because some anti-diabetic drugs are 
now considered as either promotors or protecting elements. In the present 
review, we intend to highlight the compelling epidemiological shreds of evidence 
that support this association, as well as the mechanistic contributions of many 
of these potential pathological mechanisms, some controversial points as well as 
future challenges."
1281,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors in human 
beings. Tumor capacity of evading immune-mediated lysis is a critical step in PC 
malignant progression. We aimed to evaluate the underlying regulatory mechanism 
of miR-4299 in the proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, and immune escape in 
PC. miR-4299 and ADAM17 expressions in PC tissues and cell lines were detected 
using qRT-PCR. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to detect cell viability 
and apoptosis, respectively. A luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to 
confirm the targeted relationship between miR-4299 and ADAM17. Xenograft tumors 
in nude mice were used to detect tumorigenesis in vivo. PC cells were 
co-cultured with NK cells for determining the immune escape ability. 
NKG2D-positive rate of NK cells was detected using flow cytometry; NK 
cell-killing ability was detected using MTT assay. miR-4299 was downregulated in 
PC tissues and cell lines. miR-4299 inhibited PC cell proliferation and 
invasion, promoted cell apoptosis, and reduced PC tumor growth in vivo. ADAM17 
3'UTR directly bound to miR-4299. ADAM17 overexpression could reverse miR-4299 
effects on PC cell viability, invasion, apoptosis, and immune escape. miR-4299 
exerted suppressive effects on PC cell proliferation, invasion, and immune 
escape via targeting ADAM17 expression. This study revealed a novel 
miR-4299/ADAM17 axis-modulating PC progression and proposed to concern the 
immune regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in PC development."
1282,"NOTCH1 is a transmembrane receptor in metazoans that is linked to a variety of 
disorders. The receptor contains an extracellular domain (ECD) with 36 tandem 
epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats. The ECD is responsible for 
intercellular signaling via protein-ligand interactions with neighboring cells. 
Each EGF repeat consists of approximately 40 amino acids and 3 conserved 
disulfide bonds. The Abruptex region (EGF24-29) is critical for NOTCH1 signaling 
and is known for its missense mutations. Certain EGF repeats are modified with 
the addition of O-linked glycans and many have calcium binding sites, which give 
each EGF repeat a unique function. It has been shown that the loss of the 
O-fucose site of EGF27 alters NOTCH1 activity. To investigate the role of 
glycosylation in the NOTCH1 signaling pathway, nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy has been employed to study the structures of EGF27 and its 
glycoforms. Here, we report the backbone and sidechain 1H, 15N, and 
13C-resonance assignments of the unmodified EGF27 protein and the predicted 
secondary structure derived from the assigned chemical shifts."
1283,"Bacterial biofilm formation is one of the dynamic processes, which facilitates 
bacteria cells to attach to a surface and accumulate as a colony. With the help 
of biofilm formation, pathogenic bacteria can survive by adapting to their 
external environment. These bacterial colonies have several resistance 
properties with a higher survival rate in the environment. Especially, 
pathogenic bacteria can grow as biofilms and can be protected from antimicrobial 
compounds and other substances. In aquaculture, biofilm formation by pathogenic 
bacteria has emerged with an increased infection rate in aquatic animals. 
Studies show that Vibrio anguillarum, V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. 
harveyi, V. campbellii, V. fischeri, Aeromonas hydrophila, A. salmonicida, 
Yersinia ruckeri, Flavobacterium columnare, F. psychrophilum, Piscirickettsia 
salmonis, Edwardsiella tarda, E. ictaluri, E. piscicida, Streptococcus 
parauberis, and S. iniae can survive in the environment by transforming their 
planktonic form to biofilm form. Therefore, the present review was intended to 
highlight the principles behind biofilm formation, major biofilm-forming 
pathogenic bacteria found in aquaculture systems, gene expression of those 
bacterial biofilms and possible controlling methods. In addition, the 
possibility of these pathogenic bacteria can be a serious threat to aquaculture 
systems."
1284,"BACKGROUND: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was previously reported to be an 
independent factor associated with survival in locally advanced esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (LAESCC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
(NAC); however, the detailed clinicopathological significance of LVI remains 
unclear. This study evaluated the prognostic impact of LVI in patients with 
LAESCC after NAC with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF) or docetaxel, cisplatin 
and 5-fluorouracil (DCF) followed by surgery and in LAESCC patients with 
recurrence after NAC and surgery.
METHODS: 438 patients with thoracic LAESCC who had undergone NAC followed by an 
esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy were assessed using a propensity 
score matched analysis, and their long-term outcomes were retrospectively 
reviewed.
RESULTS: In matched cohort, a multivariate analysis of relapse-free survival 
(RFS) in the NAC-CF group suggested that ypN (≥ 1, HR = 3.715, p = 0.004) and 
LVI (positive, HR = 3.366, p = 0.012) were independent factors associated with 
RFS; in the NAC-DCF group, ypN (≥ 1, HR = 4.829, p < 0.001) was the only 
independent factor associated with RFS. Comparisons of overall survival (OS) 
between the ypN + /LVI + group and other groups among patients with recurrence 
in each NAC regimen showed significant differences in both of NAC groups 
(p < 0.001, respectively). The ypN + /LVI + group had a significantly poor OS in 
both an oligometastatic recurrence (OMR) group (p < 0.001) and a non-OMR group 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that the independent factor associated 
with prognosis of patients with LAESCC after NAC and surgery may differ 
according to the NAC regimen, and the presence of both ypN and LVI was a 
prognostic factor for patients with recurrence, including those with OMR. These 
results might be helpful when deciding on an additional treatment strategy for 
LAESCC patients."
1285,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of macular edema in uveitis is a key goal of treatment, 
because this complication remains a potential therapeutic problem for 
specialists.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Examination was carried out in 1-2 groups - 50 persons 
with uncomplicated recurrent anterior uveitis (AU) in the stage of relapse or 
remission - and 3-4 groups - 26 persons with recurrent AU complicated by uveitic 
macular edema (UME) in the stage of relapse or remission of AU. Control group - 
27 healthy volunteers. All patients underwent an ophthalmologic examination, 
using OCT (Spectralis HRA + OCT (Heidelberg Engineering)). The state of cellular 
and humoral immunity and the expression of activation markers on blood 
lymphocytes in all patients were assessed. An immunohistocytochemical analysis 
using monoclonal antibodies (the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method) was employed 
to assess the expression of lymphocyte activation markers. The monoclonal 
antibody panel (MCAP) for immunophenotyping included antibodies reacting with 
CD5, CD54 (ICAM-1), CD25, and CD95 (FAS) antigens. Immunophenotyping was 
performed using immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: In the patients with AU + UME, the parameters of the T-cell link of the 
immune response were increased and the parameters of humoral immunity (CD19, 
IgA, IgG) were decreased in comparison with the uncomplicated AU patients. The 
absolute and relative numbers of natural killer cells in the peripheral blood 
were higher, and the relative numbers of phagocytic neutrophils were lower in 
the group of anterior uveitis with UME than in uncomplicated AU. The absolute 
and relative expression levels of ICAM-1 (CD54) and the absolute expression 
level of CD5 on peripheral blood lymphocytes were increased in relapse at 
patients with AU + UME compared with uncomplicated AU. The expression levels of 
CD25 and CD95 were not different in these groups.
CONCLUSION: Activation of cellular immunity markers ICAM-1 and CD5 seems to play 
a role in uveitic macular edema. The expression levels of CD25 and CD95 were not 
significantly different in these groups."
1286,"BACKGROUND: Glaucoma is a blinding disease largely caused by dysregulation of 
outflow through the trabecular meshwork (TM), resulting in elevated intraocular 
pressure (IOP). We hypothesized that transplanting TM cells into a 
decellularized, tissue-engineered anterior segment eye culture could restore the 
outflow structure and function.
METHODS: Porcine eyes were decellularized with freeze-thaw cycles and perfusion 
of surfactant. We seeded control scaffolds with CrFK cells transduced with 
lentiviral vectors to stably express eGFP and compared them to scaffolds seeded 
with primary TM cells as well as to normal, unaltered eyes. We tracked the 
repopulation behavior, performed IOP maintenance challenges, and analyzed the 
histology.
RESULTS: Transplanted cells localized to the TM and progressively infiltrated 
the extracellular matrix, reaching a distribution comparable to normal, 
unaltered eyes. After a perfusion rate challenge to mimic a glaucomatous 
pressure elevation, transplanted and normal eyes reestablished a normal 
intraocular pressure (transplanted = 16.5 ± 0.9 mmHg, normal = 16.9 ± 0.9). 
However, eyes reseeded with eGFP-expressing CrFK cells could not regulate IOP, 
remaining high and unstable (27.0 ± 6.2 mmHg) instead.
CONCLUSION: Tissue-engineered anterior segment scaffolds can serve as readily 
available, scalable ocular perfusion cultures. This could reduce dependency on 
scarce donor globes in outflow research and may allow engineering perfusion 
cultures with specific geno- and phenotypes."
1287,"PURPOSE: A significant portion of patients with locally advanced head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) relapse despite multimodality treatment denoting 
the need for biomarkers. The pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) is a recently 
developed blood count-based prognostic biomarker. We evaluated the relationship 
between PIV and survival in locally advanced HNSCC patients treated with 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT).
METHODS: A total of 199 patients who underwent CRT at Hacettepe University 
Oncology Hospital were included. The relationship between clinical and 
laboratory parameters with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) 
was analyzed by multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The median age was 59 years and 90.5% of the patients were male. 66.8% 
of the patients had laryngeal primaries, and 78.9% had T3-T4 disease. 84.9% of 
the patients received CRT with cisplatin. The optimal PIV threshold value was 
calculated as 404 in ROC analyses. This PIV value had 75.8% sensitivity and 
70.4% specificity for OS prediction (AUC 0.781; 95% CI 0.715-0.846; p < 0.001). 
In multivariate analyses, high PIV levels (≤ 404 vs. > 404, HR 2.862; 95% CI 
1.553-5.276; p = 0.001), higher NLR (≤ 2.5 vs. > 2.5, HR 1.827; 95% CI 
1.017-3.281; p = 0.044) levels and ECOG performance score of 2 (HR 2.267; 95% CI 
1.385-3.711; p = 0.001) were associated with shorter OS. These factors were 
associated with shorter DFS also (HR for PIV 2.485, 95% CI 1.383-4.467, 
p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed shorter OS and DFS in locally advanced HNSCC patients 
with high PIV levels. If prospective studies support our findings, the PIV score 
could be a prognostic biomarker in HNSCC."
1288,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to investigate whether the combined PET/CT 
radiomic features of the primary tumor and lymph node could predict lymph node 
metastasis (LNM) of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in stage T2-4.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 192 NSCLC patients who underwent 
tumor and node dissection between August 2016 and December 2017 and underwent 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT scanning 1-3 weeks before surgery. In 
total, 192 primary tumors (> 3 cm) and 462 lymph nodes (LN > 0.5 cm) were 
analyzed. The pretreatment clinical features of these patients were recorded, 
and the radiomic features of their primary tumor and lymph node were extracted 
from PET/CT imaging. The Spearman's relevance combined with the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator was used for radiomic feature selection. Five 
independent machine learning models (multi-layer perceptron, extreme Gradient 
Boosting, light gradient boosting machine, gradient boosting decision tree, and 
support vector machine) were tested as classifiers for model development. We 
developed the following three models to predict LNM: tumor PET/CT-clinical 
(TPC), lymph PET/CT-clinical (LPC), and tumor and lymph PET/CT-clinical (TLPC). 
The performance of the models and the clinical node (cN) staging was evaluated 
using the ROC curve and confusion matrix analysis.
RESULTS: The ROC analysis showed that among the three models, the TLPC model had 
better predictive clinical utility and efficiency in predicting LNM of NSCLC 
(AUC = 0.93, accuracy = 85%; sensitivity = 0.93; specificity = 0.75) than both 
the TPC model (AUC = 0.54, accuracy = 50%; specificity = 0.38; 
sensitivity = 0.59) and the LPC model (AUC = 0.82, accuracy = 70%; 
specificity = 0.41; sensitivity = 0.92). The TLPC model also exhibited great 
potential in predicting the N2 stage in NSCLC (AUC = 0.94, accuracy = 79%; 
specificity = 0.64; sensitivity = 0.91).
CONCLUSION: The combination of CT and PET radiomic features of the primary tumor 
and lymph node showed great potential for predicting LNM of resectable T2-4 
NSCLC. The TLPC model can non-invasively predict lymph node metastasis in NSCLC, 
which may be helpful for clinicians to develop more rational therapeutic 
strategies."
1289,"Macrophages play essential roles in erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling. 
β-thalassemia is characterized by a genetic defect in hemoglobin synthesis, 
which increases the rate of iron recycling. We previously showed that reduced 
expression of the BTB and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1) gene leads to increased 
phagocytosis of abnormal RBCs by activated monocytes. However, the mechanisms 
underlying this abnormal RBC clearance remained unclear. Herein, spleen and bone 
marrow cells of β-thalassemic mice were examined for erythrophagocytosis CD 
markers and iron-recycling genes. Higher expression levels of CD47 and CD163 on 
RBCs and macrophages, respectively, were observed in β-thalassemic mice than on 
wild-type cells. The decreased expression of Bach1 caused an increase in Nrf2, 
Spic, Slc40a1, and Hmox1 expression in splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) of 
thalassemic mice. To investigate BACH1 regulation, a macrophage cell line was 
transfected with BACH1-siRNA. Decreased BACH1 expression caused an increase in 
CD163 expression; however, the expression levels were lower when the cells were 
cultured in media supplemented with β-thalassemia/HbE patient plasma. 
Additionally, the iron recycling-related genes SPIC, SLC40A1, and HMOX1, were 
significantly upregulated in BACH1-suppressed macrophages. Our findings provide 
insights into BACH1 regulation, which plays an important role in 
erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling in thalassemic macrophages. This article

1290,"H2AX is a histone H2A variant that becomes phosphorylated upon genotoxic stress. 
The phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) plays an antioncogenic role in the DNA damage 
response and its foci patterns are highly variable, in terms of intensities and 
sizes. However, whether characteristic γ-H2AX foci patterns are associated with 
oncogenesis (oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci patterns) remains unknown. We 
previously reported that a defect in the acetyltransferase activity of TIP60 
promotes cancer cell growth in human cell lines. In this study, we compared 
γ-H2AX foci patterns between TIP60 wild-type cells and TIP60 HAT mutant cells by 
using machine learning. When focused solely on the intensity and size of γ-H2AX 
foci, we extracted the TIP60 HAT mutant-like oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci 
pattern among all datasets of γ-H2AX foci patterns. Furthermore, by using the 
dimensionality reduction method UMAP, we also observed TIP60 HAT mutant-like 
oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci patterns in TIP60 wild-type cells. In summary, we 
propose the existence of an oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci pattern and the 
importance of a machine learning approach to extract oncogenic signaling among 
the γ-H2AX foci variations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1291,"Exosome-based liquid biopsy technologies play an increasingly prominent role in 
tumor diagnosis. However, the simple and sensitive method for counting exosomes 
still faces considerable challenges. In this work, the CD63 aptamer-modified DNA 
tetrahedrons on the gold electrode were used as recognition elements for the 
specific capture of exosomes. Partially complementary DNA probes act as bridges 
linking trapped exosomes and three AuNP-DNA signal probes. This clover-like 
structure can tackle the recognition and sensitivity issues arising from the 
undesired AuNP aggregation event. When cancerous exosomes are present in the 
system, the high accumulation of methylene blue molecules from DNA-AuNP 
nanocomposites on the surface of the electrode leads to an intense current 
signal. According to the results, the aptasensor responds to MCF-7 cell-derived 
exosomes in the concentration range from 1.0 × 103 to 1.0 × 108 particles·μL-1, 
with the detection limit of 158 particles·μL-1. Furthermore, the aptasensor has 
been extended to serum samples from breast cancer patients and exhibited 
excellent specificity. To sum it up, the aptasensor is sensitive, 
straightforward, less expensive, and fully capable of receiving widespread 
application in clinics for tumor monitoring."
1292,"Hypoxic preconditioning is protective in multiple models of injury and disease, 
but whether it is beneficial for cells transplanted into sites of spinal cord 
injury (SCI) is largely unexplored. In this study, we analyzed whether 
hypoxia-related preconditioning protected Schwann cells (SCs) transplanted into 
the contused thoracic rat spinal cord. Hypoxic preconditioning was induced in 
SCs prior to transplantation by exposure to either low oxygen (1% O2 ) or 
pharmacological agents (deferoxamine or adaptaquin). All preconditioning 
approaches induced hypoxic adaptations, including increased expression of HIF-1α 
and its target genes. These adaptations, however, were transient and resolved 
within 24 h of transplantation. Pharmacological preconditioning attenuated 
spinal cord oxidative stress and enhanced transplant vascularization, but it did 
not improve either transplanted cell survival or recovery of sensory or motor 
function. Together, these experiments show that hypoxia-related preconditioning 
is ineffective at augmenting either cell survival or the functional outcomes of 
SC-SCI transplants. They also reveal that the benefits of hypoxia-related 
adaptations induced by preconditioning for cell transplant therapies are not 
universal."
1293,"Hematological toxicity (hematotoxicity) leading to peripheral cytopenias is a 
common long-term adverse effect following the use of CD19-chimeric antigen 
receptor (CD19-CAR) T-cell therapies. However, management remains unclear for 
patients whose cytopenias persist beyond 1 month after CAR T-cell infusion. We 
present the case of a 21-year old who received CD19-CAR T-cell therapy for 
relapse following a haploidentical transplant. He developed hematotoxicity and 
consequently multiple life-threatening infections. We administered a CD34+ 
hematopoietic stem cell boost (HSCB) from his transplant donor, which led to 
hematopoietic recovery and resolution of his infections without any effect on 
the activity of CD19-CAR T cells. CD34+ HSCB can be a safe and effective option 
to treat hematotoxicity following CD19-CAR T-cell therapy."
1294,"Keratoma is an aberrant keratin mass thought to originate from epidermal 
horn-producing cells interposed between the stratum medium of the hoof wall and 
the underlying third phalanx. The cause is unknown, although the presence of 
keratomas is frequently associated with chronic irritation, focal infection, or 
trauma. A total of 167 donkeys with keratomas were presented in this study. The 
diagnosis of a keratoma was based on clinical signs, radiography, and 
histopathologic examination. Surgical excision was attempted on all donkeys with 
lameness unless euthanasia was advised. Histopathologic examination, including 
Giemsa, periodic acid Schiff, and Young's silver special histochemical stains, 
was performed and showed the presence of fungal hyphae and spirochete bacteria 
within the degenerate keratin. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for treponeme 
bacteria was performed on 10 keratoma lesions and 9 healthy pieces of hoof 
(controls). All healthy donkey tissues were negative for the 3 recognized 
digital dermatitis (DD) treponeme phylogroups, whereas 3 of 10 (30%) donkey 
keratoma samples were positive for one of the DD treponeme phylogroups. Routine 
fungal culture and PCR for fungi were performed on 8 keratoma lesions and 8 
healthy pieces of hoof (controls). Keratinopathogenic fungi were detected in 1 
of 8 (12.5%) keratomas, while only non-keratinopathogenic, environmental fungi 
were detected in 8 control healthy hoof samples. This is the first time the DD 
treponemes phylogroup and keratinopathogenic fungi have been detected in 
keratomas. Further studies are required to assess the significance of this 
finding."
1295,"OBJECTIVE: Changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) may contribute to disease progression. Here, we systematically 
quantified ultrastructural and subcellular characteristics of the axon-myelin 
unit in MS NAWM and determined how this correlates with low grade inflammation.
METHODS: Human brain tissue obtained with short post-mortem delay and fixation 
at autopsy enables systematic quantification of ultrastructural characteristics. 
In this study, we performed high-resolution immunohistochemistry and 
quantitative transmission electron microscopy to study inflammation and 
ultrastructural characteristics of the axon-myelin unit in MS NAWM (n=8) and 
control white matter (WM) in the optic nerve.
RESULTS: In the MS NAWM, there were more activated and phagocytic microglia 
cells (HLA+ P2RY12- and Iba1+ CD68+ ) and more T cells (CD3+ ) compared to 
control WM, mainly located in the perivascular space. In MS NAWM compared to 
control WM there were, as expected, longer paranodes and juxtaparanodes and 
larger overlap between paranodes and juxtaparanodes. There was less compact 
myelin wrapping, a lower g-ratio, and a higher frequency of axonal mitochondria. 
Changes in myelin and axonal mitochondrial frequency correlated positively with 
the number of active and phagocytic microglia and lymphocytes in the optic 
nerve.
INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that in MS NAWM myelin detachment and 
uncompact myelin wrapping occurs, potassium channels are unmasked at the nodes 
of Ranvier, and axonal energy demand is increased, or mitochondrial transport is 
stagnated, accompanied by increased presence of activated and phagocytic 
microglia and T cells. These sub-clinical alterations to the axon-myelin unit in 
MS NAWM may be contributing to disease progression. This article is protected by

1296,"BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a potential 
prognostic factor for tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), and is associated 
with oral epithelial dysplasia grade in oral leukoplakia (OL).
METHODS: thirty cases of TSCC and thirty cases of OL were analyzed. FGFR1 and 
p-AKT protein expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and quantified 
using a digital algorithm. FGFR1 gene amplification was analyzed by FISH in the 
TSCC cases.
RESULTS: Clinical appearance and dysplasia grade were correlated with OL 
malignant transformation. OL cases presenting high FGFR1 expression showed a 
higher risk of malignant transformation (p=0.016, HR: 7.3, 95%CI: 1.4-37.4). 
p-AKT showed faint to no expression in OL, which did not correlate with 
dysplasia grade or malignant transformation. High expression of FGFR1 and p-AKT 
were associated with poor OS and DFS in TSCC, although only FGFR1 expression was 
significantly associated to poor OS (p=0.024; HR: 4.9, 95%CI: 1.2-19.9). Cases 
presenting double FGFR1/p-AKT overexpression (n=8) showed markedly impaired OS 
(p=0.020; HR: 6.4, 95%CI: 1.3-31.1) and DFS (p=0.001, HR: 13.0, 95%CI: 
3.0-55.7). FGFR1 amplification was observed in 16.6% of TSCC cases, being 
correlated with vascular and neural invasion (p=0.001 and 0.017, respectively), 
but not with FGFR1 protein expression, OS, or DFS.
CONCLUSION: FGFR1 protein expression is an important prognostic factor in OL and 
TSCC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1297,"Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that enteroviruses (EV) and 
particularly coxsackieviruses B (CVB) are likely to trigger or accelerate the 
onset of islet autoimmunity and the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 
genetically susceptible individuals. Several mutually non-exclusive mechanisms 
have been proposed to explain the involvement of CVB in the pathogenesis of T1D. 
CVB can infect and persist in the intestine, thymic cells, 
monocytes/macrophages, ductal cells and pancreatic β-cells, which leads to 
structural or functional alterations of these cells. A chronic inflammatory 
response and disruption of tolerance towards β-cells due to CVB infections are 
able to promote the recruitment and activation of pre-existing autoreactive 
T-cells and the destruction of β-cells. Vaccine or therapeutic strategies to 
control EV infections have been developed and open perspectives for the 
prevention or treatment of T1D."
1298,"The NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull (NSG) mouse is a relevant model for toxicology and 
tumorigenicity studies evaluating human cell therapies. Data was compiled from 
toxicology study control NSG mice exposed to gamma irradiation (0 or 200 cGy) or 
busulfan. Retrospective data evaluation included mortality, clinical 
observations, body weights, hematology, and external and internal macroscopic 
observations. There was no mortality in any of the 129 toxicology control 
(irradiated and non-irradiated) mice up to the 20-week observation period. 
Mortalities occurred between Days 1 and 25 among animals given busulfan 
≥25 mg/kg/day at 1 or 2 doses via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. There were 
4/10, 6/10 and 4/10 deaths at 25, 30 and 35 mg/kg/day busulfan, respectively. 
Busulfan-treated mice presented with dose-dependent clinical signs including 
signs of anemia in some individuals. Hematology, including white blood cell 
(WBC) and neutrophil (NEUT) counts, from irradiated mice at Weeks 12 and 20 
revealed comparable values to non-irradiated animals. In contrast, irradiated 
mice treated with a positive control (HL-60) were euthanized prior to Week 12. 
There were no irradiation-related differences in macroscopic observations with 
lymphoid atrophy identified comparably in irradiated and non-irradiated groups. 
These results suggest that irradiation was suitable for conditioning to enable 
cell engraftment in NSG mice in the context of regulatory toxicology and 
tumorigenicity studies. Busulfan administered at 20 mg/kg/day for 2 days, i.p. 
was also well-tolerated, and it could be considered for toxicology studies of 
genetically modified human cells."
1299,"Transcription is a noisy and stochastic process that produces sibling-to-sibling 
variations in physiology across a population of genetically identical cells. 
This pattern of diversity reflects, in part, the burst-like nature of 
transcription. Transcription bursting has many causes and a failure to remove 
the supercoils that accumulate in DNA during transcription elongation is an 
important contributor. Positive supercoiling of the DNA ahead of the 
transcription elongation complex can result in RNA polymerase stalling if this 
DNA topological roadblock is not removed. The relaxation of these positive 
supercoils is performed by the ATP-dependent type II topoisomerases DNA gyrase 
and topoisomerase IV. Interference with the action of these topoisomerases 
involving, inter alia, topoisomerase poisons, fluctuations in the [ATP]/[ADP] 
ratio, and/or the intervention of nucleoid-associated proteins with GapR-like or 
YejK-like activities, may have consequences for the smooth operation of the 
transcriptional machinery. Antibiotic-tolerant (but not resistant) persister 
cells are among the phenotypic outliers that may emerge. However, interference 
with type II topoisomerase activity can have much broader consequences, making 
it an important epigenetic driver of physiological diversity in the bacterial 
population."
1300,"BACKGROUND: The major goal of routine follow-up in oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (OPSCC) patients is the asymptomatic detection of new disease in order 
to improve survival. This study evaluated the effect of routine follow-up on 
overall survival (OS).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 307 consecutive OPSCC patients treated with 
curative intent between 2006 and 2012 was analyzed. The effectiveness of routine 
follow-up was studied by comparing treatment-intent and OS in patients with 
asymptomatically versus symptomatically detected new disease.
RESULTS: Three- and five-year risks of new disease were 29% (95% CI: 24-34) and 
33% (95% CI: 27-39). Of the 81 patients with locoregional recurrence or second 
primary head and neck cancer, 8 (10%) were detected asymptomatically with no 
difference in OS with those detected with symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic detection of new disease during routine visits was not 
associated with improved OS. The focus of follow-up should be on providing 
psychosocial care and rehabilitation."
1301,"Microtubule-associated protein Tau is primarily expressed in axons of neurons, 
but also in Olig2-positive oligodendrocytes in adult rodent and monkey brains. 
In this study, we sought to determine at what cell stage Tau becomes expressed 
in the oligodendrocyte lineage. We performed immunostaining of adult mouse brain 
sections using well-known markers of oligodendrocyte lineage and found that Tau 
is expressed in mature oligodendrocytes, but not in oligodendrocyte progenitors 
and immature pre-oligodendrocytes. We also investigated Tau expression in 
developing mouse brain. Surprisingly, Tau expression occurred after the peak of 
myelination and even exceeded GSTπ expression, which has been considered as a 
marker of myelinating oligodendrocytes. These results suggest Tau as a novel 
marker of oligodendrocyte maturation. We then investigated whether Tau is 
important for oligodendrocyte development and/or myelination and how Tau changes 
in demyelination. First, we found no changes in myelination and oligodendrocyte 
markers in Tau knockout mice, suggesting that Tau is dispensable. Next, we 
analyzed the proteolipid protein 1 transgenic model of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher 
disease, which is a rare leukodystrophy. In hemizygous transgenic mice, the 
number of Tau-positive cells were significantly increased as compared with wild 
type mice. These cells were also positive for Olig2, CC1, and GSTπ, but not 
PDGFRα and GPR17. In stark contrast, the expression level of Tau, as well as 
GSTπ, was dramatically decreased in the cuprizone-induced model of multiple 
sclerosis. Taken together, we propose Tau as a new marker of oligodendrocyte 
lineage and for investigating demyelination lesions."
1302,"BACKGROUND: Microinvasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCCmi) is an incipient 
stage of oral cancer. Through this systematic review, we aim to assess patterns 
of histopathological outcomes reported in OSCCmi cases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online search in major databases was performed without 
period restriction, and 2,024 publications in English, Spanish and Portuguese 
were obtained. After screening and eligibility, 4 studies were selected. The 
risk of bias was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal 
Checklist. A descriptive synthesis was conducted.
RESULTS: All 4 publications included were retrospective, reporting a total of 
116 OSCCmi patients, with a male predominance (1.6:1) and a mean age of 55.9 
years. The main parameters considered for microinvasion were tumor thickness 
(TT) (range 4-10mm) and depth of invasion (DOI) (range 0,02-5mm). Definition, 
cut-off values, and assessment of microscopic features were not standardized. 
Other relevant measures such as perineural or lymphovascular invasion and 
pattern of invasive front were barely described, and cytological/architectural 
characteristics were not discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: TT and DOI are currently the primary histopathological criteria 
used to define OSCCmi. Nonetheless, the outcomes of this systematic review 
showed the absence of standardized quantitative parameters to render the 
diagnosis of microinvasive OSCC. Therefore, additional studies aiming to 
standardize histopathological features to diagnose OSCCmi are paramount."
1303,"BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent malignant 
head and neck tumor, excluding the nonmelanoma skin cancer. Despite recent 
advances in the diagnosis and treatment, the disease's mortality rate is 
nonetheless high. The presence of isolated neoplastic cells or small clusters of 
up to four cells at the tumor's invasive front, named tumor budding, is 
associated with a worse prognosis in OSCC. Angiogenesis has also been recognized 
as a determining factor in the progression of malignancies and in the 
development of metastases. Several studies have investigated the assessment of 
microvascular density (MVD) as a potential prognostic factor in OSCC. This study 
aimed to evaluate, in OSCC, differences in MVD between tumors with 
high-intensity tumor budding and tumors with low-intensity or no tumor budding. 
In samples with high-intensity tumor budding, differences in MVD between the 
budding area and the area outside the budding were also evaluated. Moreover, the 
study assessed differences in MVD concerning clinicopathological characteristics 
such as sex, age, tobacco smoking, tumor location and tumor size.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty [150] samples of OSCC were subjected 
to immunohistochemistry to assess the intensity of tumor budding (by 
immunostaining for multi-cytokeratin) and MVD (by immunostaining for CD34 and 
CD105, independently). The data were treated using descriptive and analytical 
statistics.
RESULTS: There were no differences in MVD, assessed by immunostaining for CD34 
or CD105, concerning clinicopathological characteristics such as sex, age, 
tobacco smoking, tumor location and tumor size (p > 0.05). Tumors with 
high-intensity tumor budding did not show differences in MVD, assessed by 
immunostaining for CD34 or CD105, when compared to tumors with low-intensity or 
no tumor budding (p > 0.05). However, in samples with high-intensity tumor 
budding, the MVD assessed by immunostaining for CD34 was higher in the budding 
area than in the area outside the budding (p < 0.05). This difference was not 
observed when MVD was assessed by immunostaining for CD105 (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The higher MVD in the budding area may be an additional indication 
that this is a peculiar region of the tumor, associated with biological 
phenomena related to tumor progression."
1304,"BACKGROUND: Biomedical engineering proposes the use of stem cells as a bone 
rehabilitation treatment in patients with alveolar bone defects. Many authors 
suggest that this innovative technique could represent the future of bone 
regeneration in dentistry. The present study systematically reviewed the 
efficacy of stem cells in bone regeneration in patients with alveolar bone 
atrophy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was developed following the criteria of the 
PRISMA guideline (2020). The literature review was conducted in Pubmed, Medline 
Complete, and Scopus. The search algorithms used the following key words: stem 
cells, bone regeneration, and alveolar ridge augmentation. To assess the risk of 
bias, the CASPe methodology was used.
RESULTS: Seven clinical trials in humans were included in this systematic 
review. In all the studies, the proposed objective of bone regeneration by using 
stem cells was achieved, although in a different way with different results. 
Although the authors of the analysed clinical trials achieved favourable 
results, they highlighted the presence of multiple limitations throughout bone 
regeneration treatments, such as scarce scientific literature on stem cells, a 
reduced number of follow-up studies, and a lack of a standardized international 
protocol.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the analysed studies, it is concluded that the therapy 
proposed by tissue engineering through the use of stem cells to rehabilitate 
patients with bone atrophies can be considered effective. In addition, the need 
for further studies and standardization of protocols is highlighted."
1305,"OBJECTIVES: Hirschsprung disease (HD) is a congenital condition defined by the 
absence of ganglion cells in the distal-most portion of the gastrointestinal 
tract. Biopsies and resections for HD can be adrenaline inducing for the general 
surgical pathologist because specimens are infrequent; HD is 1 of only a few 
neuroanatomic diseases that general surgical pathologists diagnose; numerous 
preanalytic factors (eg, biopsy adequacy, surgeon sampling protocol, processing 
artifacts) can affect histologic interpretation; and most importantly, the 
diagnosis has high stakes.
METHODS: We provide a comprehensive overview of the background, relevant 
clinical procedures, and pathologic assessment of HD. Grossing and frozen 
section protocols, an algorithmic approach to diagnosis, and histologic pearls 
and pitfalls are also discussed.
RESULTS: Evaluation and recognition of the features of HD have evolved 
significantly in the past 2 decades with the discovery of the value of 
calretinin immunohistochemistry in the late 2000s and the recent development of 
straightforward and reproducible histologic criteria for identification of the 
HD transition zone.
CONCLUSIONS: These advancements have substantially improved the pathologist's 
ability to reliably evaluate for HD. Nonetheless, as with any high-stakes 
surgical pathology specimen, clear communication with the clinical team is 
essential."
1306,"The human prion protein gene (PRNP) is mapped to the short arm of chromosome 20 
(20pter-12). Prion disease is associated with mutations in the prion 
protein-encoding gene sequence. Earlier studies found that the mutation G127V in 
the PRNP increases protein stability. In contrast, the mutation E200K, which has 
the highest mutation rate in the prion protein, causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
(CJD) in humans and induces protein aggregation. We aimed to identify the 
structural mechanisms of E200k and G127V mutations causing CJD. We used a 
variety of bioinformatic algorithms, including SIFT, PolyPhen, I-Mutant, 
PhD-SNP, and SNP& GO, to predict the association of the E200K mutation with 
prion disease. MD simulation is performed, and graphs for root mean square 
deviation, root mean square fluctuation, radius of gyration, DSSP, principal 
component analysis, porcupine, and free energy landscape are generated to 
confirm and prove the stability of the wild-type and mutant protein 
structures. The protein is analyzed for aggregation, and the results indicate 
more fluctuations in the protein structure during the simulation owing to the 
E200K mutation; however, the G127V mutation makes the protein structure stable 
against aggregation during the simulation."
1307,"Cytophilic (cell-adhesive) materials are very important for tissue engineering 
and regenerative medicine. However, for engineering hierarchically organized 
tissue structures comprising different cell types, cell-specific attachment and 
guidance are decisive. In this context, materials made of recombinant spider 
silk proteins are promising scaffolds, since they exhibit high biocompatibility, 
biodegradability and the underlying proteins can be genetically functionalized. 
Here, previously established spider silk variants were genetically modified with 
cell adhesive peptide sequences from extracellular matrix proteins, including 
IKVAV, YIGSR, QHREDGS and KGD. Interestingly, eADF4(C16)-KGD as one of 18 tested 
variants was cell-selective for C2C12 mouse myoblasts, one out of eleven tested 
cell lines. Co-culturing with B50 rat neuronal cells confirmed the 
cell-specificity of eADF4(C16)-KGD material surfaces for C2C12 mouse myoblast 
adhesion. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1308,"Background Whereas the risk factors for structural valve degeneration (SVD) of 
glutaraldehyde-treated bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) are well studied, those 
responsible for the failure of BHVs fixed with alternative next-generation 
chemicals remain largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the reasons 
behind the development of SVD in ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether-treated BHVs. 
Methods and Results Ten ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether-treated BHVs excised 
because of SVD, and 5 calcified aortic valves (AVs) replaced with BHVs because 
of calcific AV disease were collected and their proteomic profile was 
deciphered. Then, BHVs and AVs were interrogated for immune cell infiltration, 
microbial contamination, distribution of matrix-degrading enzymes and their 
tissue inhibitors, lipid deposition, and calcification. In contrast with 
dysfunctional AVs, failing BHVs suffered from complement-driven neutrophil 
invasion, excessive proteolysis, unwanted coagulation, and lipid deposition. 
Neutrophil infiltration was triggered by an asymptomatic bacterial colonization 
of the prosthetic tissue. Neutrophil elastase, myeloblastin/proteinase 3, 
cathepsin G, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs; neutrophil-derived MMP-8 and 
plasma-derived MMP-9), were significantly overexpressed, while tissue inhibitors 
of metalloproteinases 1/2 were downregulated in the BHVs as compared with AVs, 
together indicative of unbalanced proteolysis in the failing BHVs. As opposed to 
other proteases, MMP-9 was mostly expressed in the disorganized prosthetic 
extracellular matrix, suggesting plasma-derived proteases as the primary culprit 
of SVD in ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether-treated BHVs. Hence, hemodynamic 
stress and progressive accumulation of proteases led to the extracellular matrix 
degeneration and dystrophic calcification, ultimately resulting in SVD. 
Conclusions Neutrophil- and plasma-derived proteases are responsible for the 
loss of BHV mechanical competence and need to be thwarted to prevent SVD."
1309,"Background Homeostasis of the vessel wall is cooperatively maintained by 
endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells, and adventitial fibroblasts. The 
genetic deletion of fibulin-4 (Fbln4) in smooth muscle cells (SMKO) leads to the 
formation of thoracic aortic aneurysms with the disruption of elastic fibers. 
Although Fbln4 is expressed in the entire vessel wall, its function in ECs and 
relevance to the maintenance of valvulo-arterial integrity are not fully 
understood. Methods and Results Gene silencing of FBLN4 was conducted on human 
aortic ECs to evaluate morphological changes and gene expression profile. Fbln4 
double knockout (DKO) mice in ECs and smooth muscle cells were generated and 
subjected to histological analysis, echocardiography, Western blotting, RNA 
sequencing, and immunostaining. An evaluation of the thoracic aortic aneurysm 
phenotype and screening of altered signaling pathways were performed. Knockdown 
of FBLN4 in human aortic ECs induced mesenchymal cell-like changes with the 
upregulation of mesenchymal genes, including TAGLN and MYL9. DKO mice showed the 
exacerbation of thoracic aortic aneurysms when compared with those of SMKO and 
upregulated Thbs1, a mechanical stress-responsive molecule, throughout the 
aorta. DKO mice also showed progressive aortic valve thickening with collagen 
deposition from postnatal day 14, as well as turbulent flow in the ascending 
aorta. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and immunostaining of the aortic valve 
revealed the upregulation of genes involved in endothelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition, inflammatory response, and tissue fibrosis in DKO valves and the 
presence of activated valve interstitial cells. Conclusions The current study 
uncovers the pivotal role of endothelial fibulin-4 in the maintenance of 
valvulo-arterial integrity, which influences thoracic aortic aneurysm 
progression."
1310,"The complement system is central to the rapid immune response witnessed in 
vertebrates and invertebrates, which plays a crucial role in physiology and 
pathophysiology. Complement activation fuels the proteolytic cascade, which 
produces several complement fragments that interacts with a distinct set of 
complement receptors. Among all the complement fragments, C5a is one of the most 
potent anaphylatoxins, which exerts solid pro-inflammatory responses in a myriad 
of tissues by binding to the complement receptors such as C5aR1 (CD88, C5aR) and 
C5aR2 (GPR77, C5L2), which are part of the rhodopsin subfamily of G-protein 
coupled receptors. In terms of signaling cascade, recruitment of C5aR1 or C5aR2 
by C5a triggers the association of either G-proteins or β-arrestins, providing a 
protective response under normal physiological conditions and a destructive 
response under pathophysiological conditions. As a result, both deficiency and 
unregulated activation of the complement lead to clinical conditions that 
require therapeutic intervention. Indeed, complement therapeutics targeting 
either the complement fragments or the complement receptors are being actively 
pursued by both industry and academia. In this context, the model structural 
complex of C5a-C5aR1 interactions, followed by a biophysical evaluation of the 
model complex, has been elaborated on earlier. In addition, through the drug 
repurposing strategy, we have shown that small molecule drugs such as raloxifene 
and prednisone may act as neutraligands of C5a by effectively binding to C5a and 
altering its biologically active molecular conformation. Very recently, 
structural models illustrating the intermolecular interaction of C5a with C5aR2 
have also been elaborated by our group. In the current study, we provide the 
biophysical validation of the C5a-C5aR2 model complex by recruiting major 
synthetic peptide fragments of C5aR2 against C5a. In addition, the ability of 
the selected neutraligands to hinder the interaction of C5a with the peptide 
fragments derived from both C5aR1 and C5aR2 has also been explored. Overall, the 
computational and experimental data provided in the current study supports the 
idea that small molecule drugs targeting C5a can potentially neutralize C5a's 
ability to interact effectively with its cognate complement receptors, which can 
be beneficial in modulating the destructive signaling response of C5a under 
pathological conditions."
1311,"AIMS: Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including 
dapagliflozin, improve β cell function in type 2 diabetic individuals. Whether 
dapagliflozin can protect islet microvascular endothelial cells (IMECs) and thus 
contribute to the improvement of β cell function remains unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The db/db mice were treated with dapagliflozin or vehicle 
for 6 weeks. β cell function, islet capillaries and the levels of inflammatory 
chemokines in IMECs were detected. The mouse IMEC cell line MS-1 cells were 
incubated with palmitate and/or dapagliflozin for 24 h. Angiogenesis and 
inflammatory chemokine levels were evaluated, and the involved signaling 
pathways were analyzed. The mouse β cell line MIN6 cells, in the presence or 
absence of co-culture with MS-1 cells, were treated with palmitate and/or 
dapagliflozin for 24 h. The expression of β cell specific markers and insulin 
secretion in MIN6 cells were determined.
RESULTS: Dapagliflozin significantly improved β cell function, increased islet 
capillaries and decreased the levels of inflammatory chemokines of IMECs in 
db/db mice. In the palmitate-treated MS-1 cells, angiogenesis was enhanced and 
the levels of inflammatory chemokines were downregulated by dapagliflozin. 
Either PI3K inhibitor or mTOR inhibitor eliminated the dapagliflozin-mediated 
effects. Importantly, dapagliflozin attenuated the palmitate-induced 
downregulation of β cell function-related gene expression and decrease of 
insulin secretion in MIN6 cells co-cultured with MS-1 cells but not in those on 
mono-culture.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin restores islet vascularization and attenuates the 
inflammation of IMECs in type 2 diabetic mice. The dapagliflozin-induced 
improvement of β cell function is at least partially accounted for by its 
beneficial effects on IMECs in a PI3K/Akt-mTOR-dependent manner. This article is

1312,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most severe and frequent form of 
muscular dystrophy. The mdx mouse is one of the most widely used experimental 
models to understand aspects of the biology of dystrophic skeletal muscles and 
the mechanisms of DMD. Oxidative stress and apoptosis are present in early 
stages of the disease in mdx mice. The high production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) causes activation of apoptotic death regulatory proteins due to 
DNA damage and breakdown of nuclear and mitochondrial membranes. The quadriceps 
(QUA) muscle of the mdx mouse is a good tool to study oxidative events. Previous 
studies have demonstrated that cilostazol exerts an anti-oxidant effect by 
decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The present study 
aimed to evaluate the ability of cilostazol to modulate oxidative stress and 
apoptosis in the QUA muscle of mdx mice. Fourteen-day-old mdx mice received 
cilostazol or saline for 14 days. C57BL/10 mice were used as a control. In the 
QUA muscle of mdx mice, cilostazol treatment decreased ROS production (-74%), 
the number of lipofuscin granules (-47%), lipid peroxidation (-11%), and the 
number of apoptotic cells (-66%). Thus cilostazol showed anti-oxidant and 
anti-apoptotic action in the QUA muscle of mdx mice."
1313,"BACKGROUND: In the search for alternative tools for integrated pest management, 
azadirachtin, a botanical insecticide, has been used with the most promising 
activity against Spodoptera spp., but the mechanism of cytotoxicity on 
reproductive organs remains unclear. Spodoptera eridania (Stoll, 1782) is a 
polyphagous pest with great economic importance that has become an important 
target to elucidate the action of azadirachtin on the reproductive organs of 
insect pests, helping to understand the deleterious effects caused by its 
exposure. This study evaluated the effects of chronic exposure to azadirachtin 
on the morphology and ultrastructure of S. eridania larval testes as well as 
larval development.
RESULTS: Azadirachtin exposure (6 or 18 mg a.i. L-1 ) caused a progressive 
increase in cumulative mortality and reduced gain in body mass after five days. 
Testicular structure indicated a reduction in their size with internal 
morphological changes such as spermatogonia, spermatogonial, spermatocytes and 
spermatid cysts in degeneration. The occurrence of cell death in germ and 
somatic cells was evidenced by the TUNEL technique. Electron microscopy revealed 
changes in cystic cells, such as cytoplasmic membrane rupture and cytoplasmic 
vacuolization. Chromatin compaction, changes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum 
and Golgi complex cisternae were observed in germ cells. Apoptotic bodies 
occurred between germ cell cysts.
CONCLUSION: Azadirachtin damaged the testes of S. eridania larvae, and these 
changes compromised spermatogenesis and consequently the development of the 
reproductive potential of this specimen, making azadirachtin a promising 
botanical insecticide for application in integrated pest management programs.

1314,"In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) leads to 
disease progression. Strategies to overcome the resistance are required in 
treatment for advanced lung cancer. In this study, we investigated the 
therapeutic effect of afatinib and HangAmDan-B1 (HAD-B1) co-administration in 
gefitinib-resistant NSCLC using HCC827-GR, NSCLC cell line with gefitinib 
resistance, and the HCC827-GR cell implanted mouse model. HAD-B1 consists of 4 
herbs, Panax notoginseng Radix, Cordyceps militaris, Panax ginseng C. A. Mey, 
and Boswellia carteri Birdwood, and has been reported to be effective in 
patients with advanced lung cancer in clinical practice. Our findings 
demonstrated that HAD-B1 combined with afatinib markedly inhibited cell 
proliferation and induced apoptosis compared to afatinib monotherapy and HAD-B1 
monotherapy. Inhibition of HCC827-GR cell proliferation by HAD-B1 occurred 
through MET amplification and reduced phosphorylation, and the synergistic 
effect of afatinib and HAD-B1 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in 
HCC827-GR cells via the downregulation of ERK and mTOR signaling pathways. In 
hematology and biochemistry tests, HAD-B1 alleviated the toxicity of tumor. In 
conclusion, HAD-B1 combined with afatinib would be a promising therapeutic 
strategy for NSCLC with EGFR-TKI resistance."
1315,"There is strong cross-talk between abnormal intracellular calcium concentration, 
high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an exacerbated inflammatory 
process in the dystrophic muscles of mdx mice, the experimental model of 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this study, we investigated effects of 
Idebenone, a potent anti-oxidant, on oxidative stress markers, the anti-oxidant 
defence system, intracellular calcium concentrations and the inflammatory 
process in primary dystrophic muscle cells from mdx mice. Dystrophic muscle 
cells were treated with Idebenone (0.05 μM) for 24 h. The untreated mdx muscle 
cells were used as controls. The MTT assay showed that Idebenone did not have a 
cytotoxic effect on the dystrophic muscle cells. The Idebenone treatment was 
able to reduce the levels of oxidative stress markers, such as H2 O2 and 4-HNE, 
as well as decreasing intracellular calcium influx in the dystrophic muscle 
cells. Regarding Idebenone effects on the anti-oxidant defence system, an 
up-regulation of catalase levels, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione 
peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was observed in the 
dystrophic muscle cells. In addition, the Idebenone treatment was also 
associated with reduction in inflammatory molecules, such as nuclear factor 
kappa-B (NF-κB) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in mdx muscle cells. These 
outcomes supported the use of Idebenone as a protective agent against oxidative 
stress and related signalling mechanisms involved in dystrophinopathies, such as 
DMD."
1316,"INTRODUCTION: The gender and minority gap in general surgery residency is 
narrowing; however, literature lacks comprehensive data regarding the 
demographics of fellowship programs following general surgery training.
METHODS: Data from 2017 to 2021 for gender, ethnicity, and surgical subspecialty 
are publicly available from the ERAS database and ACGME yearly data reports. 
Cochran-Armitage trend tests were used to determine statistical significance in 
trends for female and minority applicants and trainees.
RESULTS: The overall trend of female applicants to surgical specialties remained 
stagnant. However, female applicants to vascular surgery increased significantly 
from 25% to 35% (P = .045). There was no significant increase in female trainees 
in any surgical specialties evaluated. Furthermore, the overall trend of 
minority applicants to surgical specialties also remained stagnant, except for 
pediatric surgery, which showed significantly fewer minority applicants. Despite 
pediatric surgery having fewer applicants, minority trainees in this specialty 
increased significantly from 8% to 19% (P = .008).
CONCLUSION: Several current initiatives, such as intentional mentorship, are 
being reported to promote diverse and equal representation among female and 
minority applicants and trainees. However, the current overall margin of 
increase in diversity among surgical specialty applicants and trainees is 
minimal, indicating that continued efforts are needed to diversify surgical 
specialty training programs."
1317,"The possibility to reproduce in vitro the complex multiscale physical features 
present in the human tissues creates novel opportunities for biomedical advances 
and fundamental understanding of cell-environment interfaces and interactions. 
While stiffness has been recognized as a key property in influencing cell 
behavior, so far systematic studies on the role of stiffness have been limited 
to values in the KPa-MPa range, significantly below the stiffness of bone. Here, 
we report a platform enabling the tuning and control of the stiffness of a 
biocompatible polymeric interface up to values characteristic of the bone 
tissue, which are in the GPa range. The ability to fine tune the stiffness up to 
these large values is achieved by using extremely thin polymer films on glass 
and cross-linking the films using UV light irradiation. We show that a higher 
stiffness is related to better adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic 
differentiation, and that it is also possible to switch on/off cell attachment 
and growth by solely tuning the stiffness of the interface, without any surface 
chemistry or topography modification. Since the stiffness is tuned directly by 
UV irradiation, this platform is ideal for rapid and simple stiffness 
patterning, and stiffness gradients fabrication. This materials platform 
represents an innovative tool for combinatorial studies of the synergistic 
effect of tissue environmental cues on cell behavior, and creates new 
opportunities for next generation biosensors, single-cell patterning, and 
lab-on-a-chip devices. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1318,"BACKGROUND: NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) is an important source of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). Activated NOX2 may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our 
previous studies showed that a novel vitamin E mixture, Tocovid, had potential 
neuroprotective effects in a stroke mice model and an AD cell model.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was two-fold: to assess whether long-term 
Tocovid treatment can regulate NOX2, and the therapeutic effects of long-term 
administration of Tocovid to an AD mice model.
METHODS: Therapeutic effects of long-term administration of Tocovid (200 mg/kg 
/day) on an Aβ-overexpressed transgenic AD mice model (APP23, n = 8) was 
investigated. The therapeutic effect of Tocovid in 16-month-old mice compared 
with the no-treatment APP23 group (n = 9) was assessed.
RESULTS: Tocovid treatment strongly improved motor and memory deficits of APP23 
mice by attenuating NOX2 expression, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, 
neurovascular unit dysfunction, synaptic alteration, and Aβ deposition after 16 
months.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that NOX2 is a potential target in AD 
pathology. Long-term administration of Tocovid may be a promising candidate for 
AD treatment."
1319,"OBJECTIVE: assessment of the effect of a series of 20 whole-body cryotherapy 
sessions on the morphological and rheological indicators of blood in healthy 
people.
METHODS: The experimental group consisted of 15 women and 15 men who underwent a 
series of whole-body cryotherapy treatments. The control group consisted of 15 
women and 15 men - without intervention. For the analysis of blood biochemical 
parameters, venous blood was collected twice: Study 1: on the day of the 
commencement of whole body cryotherapy / from the control group; and Study 2: 
after a series of 20 cryotherapy sessions / from the control group (4 weeks).
RESULTS: After whole-body cryotherapy a statistically significant decrease in 
RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, EI 0.30 and an increase in MCHC and EI 2.19-60.30 were 
observed in women, as well as a decrease in MCV, MCH, AI and an increase in PLT, 
EI 0.30-60.30, AMP, T1/2 in men.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of whole-body cryotherapy causes changes in blood counts in 
various directions and has a positive effect on the rheological properties of 
blood in women and men - it increases the elongation index and reduces the 
aggregation index."
1320,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Microfluidics is a useful tool for investigating blood 
microrheology. The study aimed to present the development of a microfluidic 
device for assessing the microrheological properties of blood cells' suspensions 
and its application in patients with T2DM.
METHODS: A new microfluidic device was elaborated, connected to a system, 
including a microscope with a digital camera, a pump with a manometer and a 
computer with specially developed software. Blood cells' suspensions were 
investigated in a microchamber between two parallel optical slides within a 
100μm distance. The motion of the blood cells in the microchamber was observed 
by the microscope and it was recorded and visualized by a digital camera. A 
method for evaluating the deformability of blood cells and a device for its 
implementation were used [1].
RESULTS: The pressure and flow rate ranges in the microfluidic device were 
specified by model suspensions of beta-ferroxy-hydroxide and red blood cells 
(RBC) suspensions. The pressure changes, realized by a pump (micropipette), 
connected to a manometer were established and the corresponding shear rates in 
the microfluidic device were determined. Data about the blood microrheological 
properties like RBC aggregation and deformability, leukocyte adhesion from a 
group of healthy volunteers and from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) were obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed device and experimental system is a promising tool 
for the study of blood microrheology."
1321,"BACKGROUND: Resistance exercise induces thrombocytosis and increases platelet 
activation and function. These changes might be related to exercise variables 
including exercise intensity and type.
OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of traditional resistance exercise (TRE) and 
circuit resistance exercise (CRE) on cellular markers of platelet activation and 
function.
METHODS: In this crossover study ten healthy male (mean±SD: age, 25.6±2.4 years) 
subjects performed TRE encompassed 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 100% of 10-RM (10 
repetition maximum) for 6 exercises, and CRE protocols included 3 sets of 10 
repetitions at 100% of 10-RM for all 6 exercises consecutively, in two separate 
weeks. To measure platelet indices, PAC1, CD41a, CD42b and CD62P three blood 
samples were taken before, immediately after exercise, and after 30 min 
recovery.
RESULTS: Lactate concentration, blood pressure, platelet count (PLT), and mean 
platelet volume (MPV) were significantly (p <  0.05) increased following both 
resistance exercise trials. Significant increases in PAC1, and CD62P; and 
significant reductions for CD42b and CD41a were detected following both REs (p < 
 0.05). However, changes in PAC1 and CD62P were significantly different between 
the two protocols (p <  0.05), with higher increases detected following CRE.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute RE increases platelet indices and platelet activation; and 
that CRE results in higher platelet activation than TRE, probably due to 
exercise-induced increases in shear stress."
1322,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the major human 
health challenges with minimal therapeutic benefits due to its late detection, 
and de novo - and acquired chemotherapy resistance.
OBJECTIVE: In this work we unravel the potential pro-survival role of RAB25 in 
pancreatic cancer chemotherapy resistance and aim to identify if RAB25is a 
prognostic marker of patients' survival in PDA.
METHODS: We used RNA sequencing, shRNA mediated gene knockdown, BioGRID open 
repository of CRISPR screens (ORCS), GEPIA, kmplot.com, and cBioPortal.org 
databases to identify the role of RAB25 in PDA cell proliferation, chemotherapy 
response, expression in tumour versus normal tissues, and overall patients' 
survival.
RESULTS: RNA sequencing show Rab25 to be one of the top upregulated genes in 
gemcitabine resistant mouse PDA cells. Knockdown of Rab25 in these cells 
enhanced gemcitabine toxicity. In addition, re-analysis of previously published 
CRISPR/Cas9 data confirm RAB25 to be responsible for chemotherapy resistance in 
KRASG12D mutant human pancreatic cancer cell line. Finally, we used publicly 
available TCGA datasets and identify the upregulation of RAB25 in tumour tissues 
compared to the adjacent normal tissue, co-occurrence of KRASG12 mutations with 
RAB25 amplifications, and poor patients' survival in cohorts with higher mRNA 
expression of RAB25.
CONCLUSION: RAB25 expression is a prognostic marker for patient's survival and 
gemcitabine resistance in PDA."
1323,"Coral bleaching is primarily caused by high sea surface temperatures, and 
nutrient enrichment of reefs is associated with lower resilience to thermal 
stress and ecological degradation. Excess inorganic nitrogen relative to 
phosphate has been proposed to sensitise corals to thermal bleaching. We 
assessed the physiological and proteomic responses of cultures of the 
dinoflagellate coral symbiont Symbiodinium microadriaticum to elevated 
temperature under low-nutrient, high-nutrient, and phosphate-limited conditions. 
Elevated temperature induced reductions of many chloroplast proteins, 
particularly the light-harvesting complexes, and simultaneously increased the 
abundance of many chaperone proteins. Proteomes were similar when the N:P ratio 
was near the Redfield ratio, regardless of absolute N and P concentrations, but 
were strongly affected by phosphate limitation. Very high N:P inhibited 
Symbiodinium cell division while increasing the abundances of chloroplast 
proteins. The proteome response to phosphate limitation was greater than that to 
elevated temperature, as measured by the number of differentially abundant 
proteins. Increased physiological sensitivity to high temperatures under high 
nutrients or imbalanced N:P was not apparent; however, oxidative stress response 
proteins were enriched amongst proteins responding to thermal stress under 
imbalanced N:P ratios. These data provide a detailed catalogue of the effects of 
high temperatures and nutrients on a coral symbiont proteome."
1324,"Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) generally shows low or undetectable 
expression in most normal tissues but is highly expressed in fibroblasts in 
almost all carcinomas. FAP is one of the potential molecules to detect activated 
fibroblasts and has multiple roles in tumour progression. We generated 
transgenic mice that specifically expressed tdTomato along with FAP promoter 
activity. Coculturing a mouse gastric cancer cell line and FAP-tdTomato 
transgenic mouse-derived fibroblasts showed that tdTomato expression was 
elevated in the cocultured fibroblasts. Moreover, stomach wall transplanted 
tumours in mice also showed FAP-tdTomato expression in fibroblasts of the 
stomach and each metastatic legion. These results indicated that FAP-tdTomato 
expression in fibroblasts was elevated by stimulation through the interaction 
with cancer cells. Functionally, collagen production was increased in 
FAP/tdTomato-positive fibroblasts cocultured with mouse cancer cells. These 
FAP-tdTomato transgenic mice have the potential to be used to investigate 
real-time FAP dynamics and the importance of FAP expression in tumour 
development."
1325,"SCOPE: Our previous in vivo studies showed Ganoderma atrum polysaccharide 
(PSG-F2 ) has a protective effect against the acrylamide (AA)-induced intestinal 
oxidative damage in rats. Now, we aimed to explore the protective mechanism with 
IEC-6 cell model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Based on RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq), we screened MAPK 
signaling pathway as one of the most crucial pathways for pretreatment with 
PSG-F2 in AA-induced damage in IEC-6 cells. In total, six key MAPK signaling 
pathway-related proteins (p-P38/P38, p-ERK/ERK, and p-JNK/JNK), and three tight 
junction key proteins (Zonula Occludens protein-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin) were 
detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence, which verified the RNA-Seq 
data. Moreover, PD98059 interference inhibited critical proteins in the MAPK 
signaling pathway, thus uncovering the precise molecular mechanisms of MAPK/ERK 
signaling pathway involved in the protective effects of PSG-F2 against 
AA-induced intestinal barrier damage.
CONCLUSION: These finding confirmed that PSG-F2 could be used as a daily dietary 
supplement to protect the intestinal cells from damage caused by thermal 
processing hazards AA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1326,"3D printing has recently emerged as an innovative fabrication method to 
construct critical-sized and patient-specific bone scaffolds. The ability to 
control the bulk geometry of scaffolds in both macro and micro-scales 
distinguishes this technology from other fabrication methods. In this study, 
bone tissue-specific scaffolds with different pore geometries were printed from 
polylactic acid (PLA) filaments at three given infill densities ranging from 20 
to 30%. A hybrid hydrogel made of synthetic biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) and 
collagen was applied to coat 3D printed well-structured triangular samples with 
30% infill density. The coating process changed the surface texture, increased 
the average strand diameter and average pore size, and decreased the open 
porosity of samples, all of which increased the mechanical strength of 
biomimetic-coated scaffolds. According to matrix mineralization staining and 
osteo-related gene expression, the coating of scaffolds significantly 
facilitates metabolic activity and osteogenic differentiation of dental 
pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells (DPSCs). Taken together, these results 
indicated that the biomimetic coating is a highly promising approach that could 
be taken into consideration in the design of a porous scaffold for bone tissue 
engineering."
1327,"AIM: To explore the effects of phase-transited lysozyme (PTL) coated dentine 
slices on cell adhesion, migration and odontogenic differentiation of human 
dental pulp cells (HDPCs).
METHODOLOGY: Cell growth and cell cycle analysis were conducted to verify the 
biocompatibility of PTL for HDPCs. Cell adhesion, cell morphology and 
proliferation were explored by DiI staining, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
and MTT assay. Cell migration was investigated by Transwell assay. The effects 
of PTL on the odontogenesis and mineralization of HDPCs were assessed by 
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot 
(WB). The mineralization of HDPCs was evaluated by Alizarin red staining. HDPCs 
were isolated from extracted third molars. The level of statistically 
significant difference was accepted at P<0.05.
RESULTS: PTL showed no negative effect on cell cycle of HDPCs and compared with 
the blank group, HDPCs labelled with DiI staining showed significantly more 
adhered cells at 48h (P<0.05), extending cell processes and more finger-like or 
reticular pseudopodia on PTL-coated dentine slices. The results of MTT and 
Transwell assay showed that PTL promoted the proliferation (P<0.05) and 
migration (P<0.01) of HDPCs respectively. Compared with the blank group, the 
gene expression of dentine sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), osteopontin (OPN) and 
bone sialoprotein (BSP) in HDPCs cultured on PTL was significantly upregulated 
on day 3 and 7 (P<0.05), while the protein expression of DSPP showed no 
significant change on both day 7 and day 14. Alizarin red staining showed that 
PTL promoted more mineralization nodules formation of HDPCs (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PTL promoted the adhesion, proliferation and migration of HDPCs on 
dentine slices, and positively affected odontogenic differentiation and 
mineralization of HDPCs."
1328,"Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is a type of autoimmune myositis 
typically characterized clinically by proximal muscle weakness with elevated 
creatine kinase levels, pathologically by myofiber necrosis and regeneration 
with paucity of lymphocytic cell infiltration, and serologically by the presence 
of either of two myositis-specific autoantibodies, anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR 
antibodies. However, the HLA loci and alleles associated with IMNM are still not 
fully understood at least partly because IMNM was a relatively recently 
established condition. In this study, we genotyped the six HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, 
-C, -DRB1, -DQB1 and -DPB1) in 250 patients (237 patients over age 18 years and 
13 juvenile patients) diagnosed with IMNM based on clinicopathological features 
and autoantibody information and performed a case control study with Japanese 
healthy subjects. In the adult patients, specific HLA alleles associated with 
IMNM were identified at all HLA loci, with DRB1*08:03 showing the strongest 
association (OR=2.5; p=0.00000017). Furthermore, subgroup analysis with various 
clinical information showed that C*03:04 (OR=3.7; P=0.00012) was a higher risk 
allele for collagen disease in adult patients, and B*13:01 (OR=23.2; P=0.021) 
and C*03:04 (OR=5.8; P=0.0074) were higher risk for juvenile patients with 
anti-HMGCR antibody-positive IMNM. These findings will help to better understand 
the HLA genetic background and features of IMNM in designing future studies.

1329,"Plant cells are surrounded by a structured cell wall, which not only defines 
cell shape but also provides a structural barrier for protection against 
pathogen infection. However, the presence of this barrier does not impede the 
establishment of mutualistic symbioses between plants and several microbes (e.g. 
ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and rhizobia). 
To establish such beneficial associations, symbiotic microbes need to colonize 
the plant tissues via intercellular and/or intracellular infection, a process 
that requires cell wall modifications. Although cell wall composition and 
changes during this process have interested researchers for years, the 
functional characterization of the molecular players involved is still limited. 
In this viewpoint, based on several new studies I discuss how the PME-PL/PG 
pathway mediates cell wall pectin modifications at the symbiotic interface, and 
highlight further research directions which can broaden our understanding of how 
beneficial root symbioses are established."
1330,"AIM: To compare the odontogenic differentiation potential of a composite 
scaffold (CSHA) comprising of nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp) and 
carboxymethyl-chitosan (CMC) with Biodentine on human dental pulp stem cells 
(hDPSCs).
METHODOLOGY: A CSHA scaffold was prepared through an ultrasonication route by 
adding nHAp and CMC (1:5 w/w) in water medium followed by freeze-drying. 
Physico-chemical characterization was achieved using scanning electron 
microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In-vitro bioactivity and pH assessments 
were done by soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 28 days. The angiogenic 
and odontogenic differentiation abilities were assessed by expression of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Dentine sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) 
markers on cultured hDPSCs by flow-cytometry and RT-qPCR at 7,14 and 21 days. 
Cell viability/proliferation and biomineralization abilities of CSHA were 
compared with Biodentine by MTT assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, 
Alizarin Red Staining (ARS) and osteopontin (OPN) expression on hDPSCs following 
7 and 14 days. Data were statistically analyzed with Kruskal Wallis and Friedman 
tests as well as one way ANOVA followed by appropriate post hoc tests (p 
< 0.05).
RESULTS: Characterization experiments revealed a porous microstructure of CSHA 
with pore diameter ranging between 60-200 μm and 1.67 Ca/P molar ratio along 
with the characteristic functional groups of both HAp and CMC. CSHA displayed 
bioactivity in SBF by forming apatite-like crystals and maintained a consistent 
pH value of 7.70 during 28 days' in-vitro studies. CSHA significantly 
upregulated VEGF and DSPP levels on hDPSCs on day 21 compared with day 7 (p 
< 0.05). Further, CSHA supported cell viability/proliferation over 14 days like 
Biodentine with no statistical differences (p > 0.05). However, CSHA exhibited 
increased ALP and ARS activity with an intense OPN staining compared with 
Biodentine after 14 days (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the odontogenic differentiation and 
biomineralization abilities of CSHA on hDPSCs with significant VEGF and DSPP 
gene upregulations. Further, CSHA exhibited enhanced mineralization activity 
than Biodentine, as evidenced by increased ALP, ARS and OPN activity on day 14. 
The nHAp-CMC scaffold has the potential to act as an effective pulp capping 
agent, however, this needs to be further validated through in-vivo animal 
studies."
1331,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the main 
death-leading malignant tumors which deserve in-depth explorations to uncover 
the underlying molecular mechanisms. Plenty of proofs have revealed that long 
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in malignancy and progression of HCC. 
Nevertheless, the definite role of lncRNA-SNHG4 in HCC remains vague.
METHODS: To figure out the role of SNHG4 in HCC, the bioinformatics analysis and 
functional assays and in vivo assay were performed.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) displayed that the higher expression of lncRNA SNHG4 was detected in HCC 
tissues, which predicted the poor prognosis. The upregulation of SNHG4 was 
positively associated with worse clinicopathological characteristics. The 
functional experiments were performed to identify the role of SNHG4 in HCC. We 
found that SNHG4 enhanced the proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities 
of HCC cell line, and facilitated the tumor growth in vivo. A series of 
follow-up studies have shown that SNHG4 promoted the progression and malignancy 
of HCC through upregulating CREB5 via sponging miR-211-5p.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, the above findings suggest that SNHG4 promotes HCC 
malignancy through the SNHG4/miR-211-5p/CREB5 axis, providing potential 
therapeutic targets and prognostic factors for HCC."
1332,"Methods to induce islet β-cells from induced pluripotent stem cells or embryonic 
stem cells have been established. However, islet β-cells are susceptible to 
apoptosis under hypoxic conditions, so the technique used to transplant β-cells 
must maintain the viability of the cells in vivo. The present study describes 
the development of a tricultured cell sheet, which was made by co-culturing 
islet β-cells, vascular endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells for 1 day. 
The islet β-cells in the tricultured cell sheet self-organized into islet-like 
structures surrounded by a dense vascular network in vitro. Triple-layered 
tricultured cell sheets engrafted well after transplantation in vivo and 
developed into insulin-secreting tissue with abundant blood vessels and a high 
density of islet β-cells. We anticipate that the tricultured cell sheet could be 
used as an in vitro pseudo-islet model for pharmaceutical testing and may have 
potential for development into transplantable grafts for use in regenerative 
medicine."
1333,"Here, we demonstrate improvements to our bioinformatic pipeline, PING, which 
provides high-resolution genotyping of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 
(KIR) sequencing data, that expand the method to provide KIR interpretation from 
whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. We evaluated performance using synthetic 
sequence datasets and real-world data from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP). PING 
demonstrated high exonic genotyping performance on the synthetic sequence 
dataset meant to approximate real-world data at 95% accuracy (N=1366). This 
result was mirrored in the analysis of 1KGP European data (N=215) with most 
genes showing near or below 5% frequency of unresolved exonic genotypes, which 
is an important indicator for genotyping errors in real-world data. An analysis 
into the distributions of genotyping errors for the synthetic sequence datasets 
gave insights into how to further improve genotype accuracy. Similarly, an 
analysis into ambiguous exonic genotype frequencies for the 1KGP European data, 
which showed high rates of unresolved genotypes, highlighted that an effective 
phasing method will be an impactful future additional to the PING workflow. 
Together, these results demonstrate that PING can effectively provide 
high-resolution KIR genotyping on WGS data. This article is protected by

1334,"Stem cell niches have been thoroughly investigated in tissue with high 
regenerative capacity but not in tissues where cell turnover is slow, such as 
the human heart. The left AtrioVentricular junction (AVj), the base of the 
mitral valve, has previously been proposed as a niche region for cardiac 
progenitors in the adult human heart. In the present study, we explore the right 
side of the human heart; the base of the tricuspid valve, to investigate the 
potential of this region as a progenitor niche. Paired biopsies from explanted 
human hearts were collected from multi organ donors (N=12). The lateral side of 
the AVj, right atria (RA) and right ventricle (RV) were compared for the 
expression of stem cell niche-related biomarkers using RNA sequencing. Gene 
expression data indicated upregulation of genes related to embryonic development 
and extracellular matrix composition in the proposed niche region, i.e. the AVj. 
In addition, immunohistochemistry showed high expression of the fetal cardiac 
markers MDR1, SSEA4, and WT1 within the same region. Nuclear expression of 
HIF1-α was detected suggesting hypoxia. Rare cells were found with the 
co-staining of the proliferation marker PCNA and Ki67 with cardiomyocyte nuclei 
marker PCM1 and cardiac TroponinT (cTnT), indicating proliferation of small 
cardiomyocytes. WT1+/cTnT+ and SSEA4+/cTnT+ cells were also found, suggesting 
cardiomyocyte specific progenitors. The expression of the stem cell markers 
gradually decreased with distance from the tricuspid valve. No expression of 
these markers was observed in the RV tissue. In summary, the base of the 
tricuspid valve is an extracellular matrix rich region containing cells with 
expression of several stem cell niche-associated markers. Co-expression of stem 
cell markers with cTnT indicates cardiomyocyte specific progenitors. We 
previously reported similar data from the base of the mitral valve and thus 
propose that human adult cardiomyocyte progenitors reside around both 
atrioventricular valves."
1335,"Periodontitis is an oral disease caused by a bacterial infection that has stages 
according to the severity of tissue destruction. The advanced stage of 
periodontitis presents irreversible destruction of soft and hard tissues, which 
finally results in the loss of teeth. When conventional treatment modalities 
show limited results, tissue regeneration therapy is required in patients with 
advanced periodontitis. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of 
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) delivering bone 
morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) on tissue regeneration in a periodontitis model. 
BMP-7 is a member of the BMP family that shows bone-forming ability; however, 
BMP's rapid clearing and degradation and unproven efficacy make it difficult to 
apply it in clinical dentistry. To overcome this, we established 
BMP-7-expressing engineered BM-MSCs (BMP7-eBMSCs) that showed superior 
osteogenic differentiation potential when subcutaneously transplanted with a 
biphasic calcium phosphate scaffold into immunocompromised mice. Furthermore, 
the efficacy of BMP7-eBMSC transplantation for periodontal tissue regeneration 
was evaluated in a rat ligature-induced periodontitis model. Upon measuring 2D 
and 3D amounts of regenerated alveolar bone using micro-computed tomography, the 
amounts were found to be significantly higher in the BMP7-eBMSC transplantation 
group than in the eBMSC transplantation group. Most importantly, fibrous 
periodontal ligament tissue regeneration was also achieved upon BMP7-eBMSC 
transplantation, which was evaluated by calculating the modified relative 
connective tissue attachment. The amount of connective tissue attachment in the 
BMP7-eBMSC transplantation group was significantly higher than that in the 
ligature-induced periodontitis group, although the increase was comparable 
between the BMP7-eBMSC and human periodontal ligament stem cell transplantation 
groups. Taken together, our results suggested that the sustainable release of 
BMP-7 induces periodontal tissue regeneration and that transplantation of 
BMP7-eBMSCs is a feasible treatment option for periodontal regeneration."
1336,"An important quality attribute of a recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) as 
a therapeutic vector is its infectivity. Current assays to quantify infectious 
rAAV rely on coinfection with a helper virus such as adenovirus, which requires 
helper virus preparation and introduces additional variability. Here we describe 
a stable assay cell line that was generated by integrating the coding sequences 
for AAV Rep68 and adenovirus E4orf6 and DNA Binding Protein (DBP) under the 
control of inducible promoters. The Rep68 protein expression was further 
modulated by a ligand-responsive destabilization domain. In several benchmarks, 
the cell line gave comparable titers to those obtained using a classical 
adenovirus coinfection method. The cell line was also used to titer vectors of 
multiple AAV serotypes. This cell line has the potential to serve as an 
effective and robust tool for product quality evaluation."
1337,"This current case report describes a 56-year-old male patient with a skin mass 
on his lip that had been growing for 1 year. The pathological findings 
demonstrated that the epidermis was characterized by hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia 
and hypertrophy and was formed in the shape of a crater. The skin on both ends 
had developed into a ball-like growth that resembled a volcanic cone. There was 
invasive growth of heterotype squamous epithelium and a small number of 
inflammatory cells infiltrating the dermis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an 
increase in P16 (the focus, +) and the hot spot Ki-67 index. The diagnosis was 
of tumour-like hyperplasia, malignancy and moderate-to-severe dysplasia 
confirming that it was keratoacanthoma. The patient underwent surgical resection 
and was discharged from hospital, but the tumour returned. Paclitaxel and 
cisplatin were administered intraoperatively and bilateral lingual artery 
perfusion chemoembolization was undertaken six times. This procedure led to an 
excellent postoperative recovery and discharge from hospital. Tumour therapy was 
regarded as successful. The patient's medical history included acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia L1 and long-term immunosuppressant use. After a 6-month 
period of follow-up, he died from systemic organ failure as a consequence of 
having too many ailments."
1338,"Spatial abilities are cognitive resources used to mentally manipulate 
representations of objects to solve problems. Haptic abilities represent tactile 
interactions with real world objects transforming somatic information into 
mental representations. Both are proposed to be factors in anatomy education, 
yet spatial abilities and haptic abilities relationships remain unknown. The 
objective of the current study was to explore spatial abilities - haptic 
abilities interactions. A haptic abilities test (HAT) was developed based on the 
mental rotations test (MRT) with three-dimensional (3D) objects. The HAT was 
undertaken in three sensory conditions: (1) sighted, (2) sighted with haptics, 
and (3) haptics. Participants (n = 22; 13 females, 9 males) completed the MRT 
and were categorized into high spatial abilities (HSA) [n = 12, mean (±SD): 13.7 
(±3.0)] and low spatial abilities (LSA) (n = 10, 5.6 (±2.0) based on score 
distributions about the overall mean. Each spatial abilities group's HAT scores 
were compared across the three sensory conditions. Spearman's correlation 
coefficients between MRT and HAT scores indicated a statistically significant 
correlation in sighted condition (r = 0.553, P = 0.015), but were not 
significant in the sighted with haptics (r = 0.0.078, P = 0.212) and haptics 
conditions (r = 0.043, P = 0.279). These data suggest haptic abilities appear 
unrelated to spatial abilities. With haptic exploration, LSA HAT scores were 
compensated; comparing HSA to LSA: sighted with haptics [12 (12-13)] vs [12 
(11-13)], P = 0.254, and in haptics conditions [12 (11-13)] vs [12 (10-12)], P 
= 0.381). Migrations to online anatomy teaching, may unwittingly remove 
important sensory modalities from the learner. Understanding learner behaviors 
and performance decrements when haptic inputs are removed from the learning 
environment represents valuable insight informing future anatomy curriculum and 
resource development."
1339,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are one of the commonest maladies, 
affecting 5-10% of pregnancies worldwide. The American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists (ACOG) identifies four categories of HDP, namely gestational 
hypertension(GH), Preeclampsia (PE), chronic hypertension(CH), and chronic 
hypertension with superimposed Preeclampsia. PE is a multisystem, heterogeneous 
disorder that encompasses 2% - 8% of all pregnancy-related complications, 
contributing to about 9% to 26% of maternal deaths in low-income countries and 
16% in high-income countries. These translate to  50,000 maternal deaths and 
over 500,000 fetal deaths worldwide, therefore demanding high priority in 
understanding clinical presentation, screening, diagnostic criteria, and 
effective management. PE is accompanied by uteroplacental insufficiency leading 
to vascular and metabolic changes, vasoconstriction, and end-organ ischemia. PE 
is diagnosed after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women who were previously 
normotensive or hypertensive. Besides shallow trophoblast invasion and 
inadequate remodeling of uterine arteries, dysregulation of the nonimmune system 
has been the focal point in PE. This results from aberrant immune system 
activation and imbalanced differentiation of T cells. Further, a failure of 
tolerance toward the semi-allogenic fetus results due to altered distribution of 
Tregs such as CD4+FoxP3+ or CD4+CD25+CD127(low) FoxP3+ cells, thereby creating a 
cytotoxic environment by suboptimal production of immunosuppressive cytokines 
like IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13. Also, intracellular production of complement 
protein C5a may result in decreased FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. With immune 
system dysfunction as a major driver in PE pathogenesis, it is logical that 
therapeutic targeting of components of the immune system with pharmacologic 
agents like anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating molecules are either being 
used or under clinical trial. Cholesterol synthesis inhibitors like Pravastatin 
may improve placental perfusion in PE, while Eculizumab (monoclonal antibody 
inhibiting C5) and small molecular inhibitor of C5a, Zilucoplan are under 
investigation. Monoclonal antibody against IL-17(Secukinumab) has been proposed 
to alter the Th imbalance in PE. Autologous Treg therapy and immune checkpoint 
inhibitors like anti-CTLA-4 are emerging as new candidates in immune horizons 
for PE management in the future. This article is protected by copyright. All

1340,"The Covid-19 pandemic required adjustments and limitations in university 
teaching, thereby challenging teaching concepts in anatomy requiring in-person 
contact, including the gross anatomy course. Therefore, the present study 
investigates the impact of Covid-19-associated adjustments on students' 
perception of the gross anatomy course's importance and quality, students' 
preferred learning setting and outcome, and their motivation to involve 
themselves in academic activities, including becoming a future peer-teacher of 
the course. Using paper-based questionnaires in Ulm, Germany, 397 (response 
rate: 82.3%) students of the winter term 2020/21 were surveyed using 
quantitative and qualitative items, which were compared to cohorts prior to the 
pandemic. Students reported a higher global rating on course quality during 
Covid-19 (pre-Covid-19: 5.3 ± 0.9, during-Covid-19: 5.6 ± 0.7, P < 0.001; 1 = 
very bad, 6 = very good). Students' perceived importance of the gross anatomy 
course showed a small but significant increase (pre-Covid-19: 4.2 ± 0.6, 
during-Covid-19: 4.3 ± 0.6, P < 0.001; 1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly 
agree). Students' motivation to apply as a peer-teacher remained stable, 
nevertheless, they reported less interest in transferring their knowledge to 
junior students. Finally, students reported that they spent significantly more 
learning time alone and their examination grades remained unchanged during the 
pandemic. Astonishingly, despite radical changes of the teaching environment due 
to Covid-19, students appreciate the offered teaching and highly valued the

Glomeromycotina fungi is preceded by the exchange of chemical signals: fungal 
released Myc-factors, including chitoligosaccharides (CO) and 
lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCO), activate plant symbiotic responses, while root 
exuded strigolactones stimulate hyphal branching and boost CO release. 
Furthermore, fungal signaling reinforcement through CO application was shown to 
promote AM development in Medicago truncatula, but the cellular and molecular 
bases of this effect remained unclear. • Here we focused on long-term M. 
truncatula responses to CO treatment, demonstrating its impact on the 
transcriptome of both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots over several weeks 
and providing an insight into the mechanistic bases of the CO-dependent 
promotion of AM colonization. • CO treatment caused the long-lasting regulation 
of strigolactone biosynthesis and fungal accommodation related genes. This was 
mirrored by an increase in root didehydro-orobanchol content, and the promotion 
of accommodation responses to AM fungi in root epidermal cells. Lastly, an 
advanced down-regulation of AM symbiosis marker genes was observed at the latest 
time point in CO-treated plants, in line with an increased number of senescent 
arbuscules. • Overall, CO treatment triggered molecular, metabolic and cellular 
responses underpinning a protracted acceleration of AM development."
1342,"Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1) is a key regulator of plant architecture. 
However, knowledge of downstream genes applicable for improving rice plant 
architecture is very limited. We identified the plant architecture regulatory 
gene NAL11 (NARROW LEAF 11), which encodes a heat-shock protein (HSP) containing 
a DnaJ domain. A promising rare allele of NAL11 (NAL11-923del-1552 ) positively 
selected in Aus cultivars was identified; this allele exhibited increased 
expression and generated relatively few tillers, thick stems and large panicles, 
components of the ideal plant architecture (IPA). NAL11 is involved in 
regulating the cell cycle and cell proliferation. NAL11 loss-of-function mutants 
present impaired chloroplast development and gibberellin (GA) defects. 
Biochemical analyses show that IPA1 directly binds to elements in the missing 
fragment of the NAL11-923del-1552 promoter and negatively regulates NAL11 
expression. Genetic analyses support the hypothesis that NAL11 acts downstream 
of IPA1 to regulate IPA by modulating GA homeostasis, and NAL11 may be an 
essential complement for IPA1. Our work revealed that avoidance of the 
inhibition of NAL11-923del-1552 caused by IPA1 represents a positive strategy 
for rescuing GA defects accompanied by the upregulation of IPA1 in breeding 
high-yield rice."
1343,"AIMS: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with clear cells and psammoma-like 
calcifications would often raise suspicion for MITF family translocation RCC. 
However, we have rarely encountered tumors consistent with clear cell RCC that 
contain focal psammomatous calcifications.
METHODS & RESULTS: We identified clear cell RCCs with psammomatous 
calcifications from multiple institutions and performed immunohistochemistry and 
fluorescence and RNA in situ hybridization (FISH and RNA ISH). Twenty-one tumors 
were identified: 12 men, 9 women, ages 45 to 83 years. Tumor size was 2.3 to 
14.0 cm (median 6.75 cm). Nucleolar grade was 3 (n=14), 2 (n=4), or 4 (n=3). In 
addition to clear cell pattern, morphology included eosinophilic (n=12), 
syncytial giant cell (n=4), rhabdoid (n=2), branched glandular (n=1), early 
spindle cell (n=1), and poorly differentiated components (n=1). Labeling for CA9 
was usually 80-100% of the tumor cells (n=17/21) but was sometimes decreased in 
areas of eosinophilic cells (n=4). All (19/19) were positive for CD10. Most 
(19/20) were positive for AMACR (variable staining, 20-100%). Staining was 
negative for keratin 7, although 4 showed rare positive cells (4/20). Results 
were negative for cathepsin K (0/19), melan A (0/17), HMB45 (0/17), TFE3 (0/5), 
TRIM63 RNA-ISH (0/13), and TFE3 (0/19) and TFEB rearrangements (0/12). Seven of 
19 (37%) showed chromosome 3p deletion. One (1/19) showed trisomy 7 and 17 
without papillary features.
CONCLUSIONS: Psammomatous calcifications in RCC with a clear cell pattern 
suggests a diagnosis of MITF family translocation RCC; however, psammomatous 
calcifications can rarely be found in true clear cell RCC."
1344,"As the seed precursor, the ovule produces the female gametophyte (or embryo 
sac), and the subsequent double fertilization occurs in it. The integuments 
emerge sequentially from the integument primordia at the early stages of ovule 
development, and finally enwrap the embryo sac gradually during gametogenesis, 
protecting and nursing the embryo sac. However, the mechanisms regulating 
integument development are still obscure. In this study, we show that SOMATIC 
EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASES (SERKs) play essential roles during 
integument development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The serk1/2/3 triple mutant 
shows arrested integuments and abnormal embryo sacs, similar defects also found 
in the triple loss-of-function mutants of ERECTA family (ERf) genes. Ovules of 
serk1/2/3 er erl1/2 show defects similar to er erl1/2 and serk1/2/3. Results of 
yeast two-hybrid analyses, bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses, 
and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SERKs interact with ERf, 
which depends on EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) family small peptides. 
The sextuple mutant epfl1/2/3/4/5/6 shows integument defects similar to both of 
er erl1/2 and serk1/2/3. Our results demonstrate that ERf-SERK-mediated EPFL 
signaling orchestrates the development of the female gametophyte and the 
surrounding sporophytic integuments."
1345,"Fruit malformation is a major constrain in fruit production world-wide resulting 
in substantial economic losses. The farmers for decades noticed that the 
chilling temperature prior to the blooming often caused malformed fruits. 
However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. Here we 
examined the fruit development in response to cold stress in tomato, and 
demonstrated that short-term cold stress increased the callose accumulation in 
both shoot apical and floral meristems, resulting in the symplastic isolation 
and altered intercellular movement of WUS. In contrast to the rapidly restored 
SlWUS transcription during the recovery from cold stress, the callose removal 
was delayed due to obstructed plasmodesmata. The delayed reinstatement of 
cell-to-cell transport of SlWUS prevented the activation of SlCLV3 and TAG1, 
causing the interrupted feedback-inhibition of SlWUS expression, leading to the 
expanded stem cell population and malformed fruits. We further showed that the 
callose dynamics in response to short-term cold stress presumably exploits the 
mechanism of bud dormancy during the seasonal growth, involving two antagonistic 
hormones ABA and GA. Our results provide a novel insight into the cold stress 
regulated malformation of fruit."
1346,"An ageing population and increased screen use in younger people have contributed 
to a rise in incidence of dry eye disease (DED). Quality of life can be 
significantly affected by DED, with patients experiencing eye dryness, burning, 
pain and sensitivity to light. If left untreated, DED may progress to cause 
lasting damage to the delicate cell layers of the ocular surface. The 
aqueous-deficient form of DED is characterized by decreased tear volume. This 
can occur through underlying disease or damage to the lacrimal gland (LG), which 
results in increased inflammation at the ocular surface and decreased tear 
secretion. Regenerative therapy for treatment of aqueous-deficient DED would 
ideally restore LG function without causing adverse side effects and be feasible 
in terms of cost, production and practical application in the clinic. In this 
review, we evaluate research directed at the development of clinical procedures 
for regeneration of the LG using various stem cell types and their products. We 
also discuss work identifying potential therapeutic targets that may alter 
pathways to effect healing and ameliorate development of DED. Finally, we 
discuss shortcomings and recommend future avenues for research. These include 
determination of the best tissue of origin for mesenchymal cells and 
transference of knowledge gleaned from animal studies to clinical 
investigations."
1347,"The HSC70/HSP70 family of heat shock proteins are evolutionarily conserved 
chaperones involved in protein folding, protein transport, and RNA binding. 
Arabidopsis HSC70 chaperones are thought to act as housekeeping chaperones and 
as such are involved in many growth-related pathways. Whether Arabidopsis HSC70 
binds RNA and whether this interaction is functional has remained an open 
question. We provide evidence that the HSC70.1 chaperone binds its own mRNA via 
its C-terminal Short Variable Region (SVR) and inhibits its own translation. The 
SVR encoding mRNA region is necessary for HSC70.1 transcript mobility to distant 
tissues and that HSC70.1 transcript and not protein mobility is required to 
rescue root growth and flowering time of hsc70 mutants.We propose that this 
negative protein-transcript feedback loop may establish an on-demand chaperone 
pool that allows for a rapid response to stress. In summary, our data suggest 
that the Arabidopsis HSC70.1 chaperone can form a complex with its own 
transcript to regulate its translation and that both protein and transcript can 
act in a non-cell-autonomous manner, potentially maintaining chaperone 
homeostasis between tissues."
1348,"This review aimed to identify preclinical and clinical studies examining the 
effects of rosmarinic acid (RA), carnosic acid (CaA), rosmanol (RO), carnosol 
(CA), and ursolic acid (UA) against allergic and immunologic disorders. Various 
online databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, 
Cochrane trials, and Scopus, were searched from inception until October 2022. 
Due to the suppression of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, the main factor 
in allergic asthma, RA may be a promising candidate for the treatment of asthma. 
The other ingredients comprising CA and UA reduce the expression of interleukin 
(IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and improve airway inflammation. Rosemary's anti-cancer 
effect is mediated by several mechanisms, including DNA fragmentation, apoptosis 
induction, inhibition of astrocyte-upregulated gene-1 expression, and 
obstruction of cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. The compounds, 
essentially found in Rosemary essential oil, prevent smooth muscle contraction 
through its calcium antagonistic effects, inhibiting acetylcholine (ACH), 
histamine, and norepinephrine stimulation. Additionally, CA exhibits a 
substantially greater interaction with the nicotinic ACH receptor than a family 
of medications that relax the smooth muscles, making it a potent antispasmodic 
treatment. The components have demonstrated therapeutic effects on the immune, 
allergy, and respiratory disorders."
1349,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains an underutilized treatment modality in 
oncology. Many efforts have been dedicated to the development of better 
photosensitizers, better formulations and delivery methods, rigorous planning of 
light dose distribution in tissues, mechanistic insight, improvement of 
treatment protocols and combinations with other therapeutic agents. Hopefully, 
progress in all these fields will eventually expand the use of PDT. Here we 
offer a brief review of our own contribution to the development of a 
photosensitizer for PDT - redaporfin - currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, and 
present data on its combination with two glycolysis inhibitors: 2-deoxyglucose 
and 3-bromopyruvate. We show that 3-bromopyruvate is more cytotoxic to a 
carcinoma cell line (CT26) than to a normal fibroblast (3T3) cell line, and that 
this selectivity is maintained in the in vitro combination with redaporfin-PDT. 
This combination was investigated in BALB/c mice with large subcutaneous CT26 
tumors and it is shown that the cure rate in the combination is higher (33% 
cures) than in PDT (11% cures) or in 3-bromopyruvate (no cures) alone. The 
combination of redaporfin-PDT with 3-bromopyruvate illustrates the potential of 
combination therapies and how PDT benefits can be enhanced by systemic drugs 
with complementary targets."
1350,"The quantitative comprehension of the prokaryotic cell growth requires a 
multi-scale modeling framework from a kinetics perspective. Cells regulate 
protein synthesis in response to nutrient conditions for fastest growth. In 
vitro biochemical experiments reveal the detailed kinetics pathway of ribosomes 
beyond the scope of the kinetics model of Hopfield. At the cellular level, the 
complexity of the molecular responses to various nutrient conditions has caused 
great difficulty in elucidating the in vivo cell growth. Herein, a kinetics 
framework is developed to investigate the ribosomal speed-accuracy relation 
which lays a foundation for studying the in vivo cell growth under 
nutrient-controlled condition. We demonstrate that the partition of ribosomes at 
different chemical states depends on magnesium levels ([Mg2+]) and contributes 
to distinct patterns of the speed-accuracy relation. The relation falls into 
either ""Trade-off"" or ""Competition"" regime depending on [Mg2+] which influences 
the competitive binding between cognate and near cognate tRNAs for ribosomes. By 
combining the speed-accuracy relation with the cellular nutrient dynamics, we 
further derive how a maximal cell growth rate is achieved by varying both 
accuracy (i.e. via modulating [Mg2+]) and proteomic content. As nutrient quality 
improves, cells reduce accuracy and increase growth rate by importing more 
[Mg2+]. The accuracy values are sufficiently high to guarantee good cellular 
performance. Under this scenario, besides capturing the linear dependence of 
ribosomal mass fraction on growth rate, cellular responses to nutrient 
conditions manifest in the prediction of two quadratic scaling relations. The 
nutrient intake flux shows a quadratic relation with cell mass while the number 
of ribosomes follows quadratic dependence on growth rate. Both relations are in 
quantitative agreement with recent experiments."
1351,"All plant cells are surrounded by a cell wall that provides cohesion, protection 
and a means of directional growth to plants. Cellulose microfibrils contribute 
the main biomechanical scaffold for most of these walls. The biosynthesis of 
cellulose, which typically is the most prominent constituent of the cell wall 
and therefore Earth's most abundant biopolymer, is finely attuned to 
developmental and environmental cues. Our understanding of the machinery that 
catalyzes and regulates cellulose biosynthesis has substantially improved due to 
recent technological advances in for example structural biology and microscopy. 
Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the structure, function and 
regulation of the cellulose synthesis machinery and its regulatory interactors. 
We aim to highlight important knowledge gaps in the field, and outline emerging 
approaches that promise a means to close those gaps."
1352,"BACKGROUND: There is a considerable need to incorporate biomarkers of resistance 
to new antiandrogen agents in the management of castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (CRPC).
METHODS: We conducted a phase II trial of enzalutamide in first-line chemo-naïve 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC and analyzed the prognostic value of 
TMPRSS2-ERG and other biomarkers, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), 
androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) in CTCs and plasma Androgen Receptor 
copy number gain (AR-gain). These biomarkers were correlated with treatment 
response and survival outcomes and developed a clinical-molecular prognostic 
model using penalized cox-proportional hazard model. This model was validated in 
an independent cohort.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were included. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene was 
detected in 32 patients with no differences observed in efficacy outcomes. CTC 
detection was associated with worse outcome and AR-V7 in CTCs was associated 
with increased rate of progression as best response. Plasma AR gain was strongly 
associated with an adverse outcome, with worse median prostate specific antigen 
(PSA)-PFS (4.2 vs. 14.7 m; p < 0.0001), rad-PFS (4.5 vs. 27.6 m; p < 0.0001), 
and OS (12.7 vs. 38.1 m; p < 0.0001). The clinical prognostic model developed in 
PREVAIL was validated (C-Index 0.70) and the addition of plasma AR (C-Index 
0.79; p < 0.001) increased its prognostic ability. We generated a parsimonious 
model including alkaline phosphatase (ALP); PSA and AR gain (C-index 0.78) that 
was validated in an independent cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: TMPRSS2-ERG detection did not correlate with differential activity 
of enzalutamide in first-line mCRPC. However, we observed that CTCs and plasma 
AR gain were the most relevant biomarkers."
1353,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is associated with a high incidence of lung metastasis, which 
leads to a high risk of cancer death. Circular RNA (circRNA), a novel class of 
noncoding RNA, is emerging as a key player in human cancer. Herein, we explored 
the role of circMGEA5 in OS metastasis by conducting circRNA expression 
microarray. CircMGEA5 was significantly upregulated in metastatic OS tissues 
compared to primary tissues. High circMGEA5 was positively related with shorter 
overall and disease-free survival time. Knockdown of circMGEA5 suppressed OS 
cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). 
Mechanistically, circMGEA5 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to 
directly sponge miR-153-3p and miR-8084, resulting in increasing ZEB1 and Snail 
expression, respectively, thereby inducing EMT and metastasis. In turn, ZEB1 and 
Snail were capable to bind to circMGEA5 promoter, activating circMGEA5 
transcription, thus forming a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, we 
established the tail vein injection model and found that circMGEA5 depletion 
remarkably reduced lung metastasis nodules generated by OS cells. In sum, our 
findings, for the first time, reveal the metastasis-promoting role of circMGEA5 
in OS. Targeting of this newly identified ceRNA axis may be crucial in the 
development of novel therapies for metastatic OS patients."
1354,"SCOPE: Clarifying the function of sensory active TRP channels in non-sensory 
tissue is of growing interest, especially with regard to food ingredients in 
nutritionally relevant concentrations. The study hypothesized the TRPV1 agonist 
[6]-gingerol to facilitate cellular immune responses of primary human 
neutrophils, after treatment with 50 nM, a concentration that can be reached in 
the circulation after habitual dietary intake.
METHODS AND RESULTS: qRT-PCR analyses revealed a high abundancy of TRP channel 
RNA expression in the types of primary leukocytes investigated, namely 
neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells, T cells, and B cells. Incubation of 
neutrophils with 50 nM of the known TRPV1 ligand [6]-gingerol led to increased 
surface expression of CD11b, CD66b, and the fMLF receptor FPR1, as shown by flow 
cytometry. Upon subsequent stimulation with fMLF, the neutrophils displayed an 
about 30 % (p<0.05) increase in CXCL8 secretion as well as in ROS production. 
Pharmacological inhibition of TRPV1 by trans-tert-butylcyclohexanol abolished 
the [6]-gingerol induced effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The TRPV1 channel is functionally expressed in human neutrophils. 
Activation of the channel with [6]-gingerol as a food-derived ligand in 
nutritionally relevant concentrations leads to an enhanced responsiveness in the 
cells towards activating stimuli, thereby facilitating a canonical cellular 
immune response in human neutrophils. This article is protected by copyright.

1355,"Dry eye syndrome, as a persist corneal epithelial defect (PED), is an 
inconvenient ocular disorder that is generally treated by high-dosage, 
conventional eye drops. Addressing low efficacy and rather restricted 
bioavailability of the conventional eye drops, drug-eluting contact lenses (CLs) 
are widely used as alternatives in ophthalmic drug delivery applications. In the 
present study, a nanofiber-containing ring implant poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) 
hydrogel is designed as a carrier for hyaluronic acid (HA) delivery. hyaluronic 
acid is physically encapsulated in a nanofiber-containing ring-shaped hydrogel 
with a 2 mm width that is implanted in the final CLs hydrogel. The designed CL 
has 59% porosity, 275% swelling ratio and undergoes no weight loss at 
physiological conditions in14 days. In-vitro release studies were performed on 
the CLs with and without nanofibers. The results showed that nanofiber 
incorporation in the designed CL was highly influential in decreasing burst 
release and supported sustained release of HA over 14 days. In addition, 
nanofiber incorporation in the designed system strengthened the lens, and the 
young modulus of the PVA hydrogel increased from 6 to 10 kPa. Cell viability 
study also revealed no cell cytotoxicity and cell attachment. Overall, the study 
demonstrated the effective role of nanofibers in the physical strengthening of 
the CL. Also, the designed system holds promise as a potential candidate for HA 
delivery over an extended period for treating dry eye syndrome."
1356,"Talimogene Laherparepvec (T-VEC) is a first in class oncolytic virotherapy 
approved for the treatment of unresectable melanoma recurrent after initial 
surgery. Biodistribution data from phase 2 study was used to develop a viral 
kinetics mechanistic model describing the interaction between cytokines like 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), immune system and 
T-VEC treatment. Our analysis found 1) viral infection rate has great influence 
on T-VEC treatment efficacy, 2) an increase of T-VEC dose of 102 pfu/mL 21 days 
and beyond after the initial dose of T-VEC resulted in a ~12% increase in 
response; and 3) at the systemic level the ratio of resting innate immune cells 
to the death rate of innate immune impact T-VEC treatment efficacy. This 
analysis clarifies under which condition the immune system either assists in 
eliminating tumor cells or inhibits T-VEC treatment efficacy which is critical 
to both efficiently design future oncolytic agents and understanding cancer 
development."
1357,"Myocardial infarctions affect approximately 735,000 people annually in the 
United States and have a substantial impact on quality of life. Neonates have an 
enhanced capability of repairing cardiovascular damage, while adults do not. The 
mechanistic basis for this age-dependent difference in regenerative capacity 
remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a 
significant role in regulating the regenerative ability of cardiovascular cells. 
This report defines the alterations in miRNA expression within the 
cardiovascular repair zone of infarcted sheep hearts following intracardiac 
injection of neonatal islet-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells. Sheep were 
infarcted via left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. After 3 to 4 
weeks of infarction, sheep neonatal islet-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells 
were injected into the infarcted area for repair. Cell-treated sheep were 
euthanized 2 months following cell injection, and their hearts were harvested 
for the analysis of miRNA and gene expression within the cardiovascular repair 
zone. Ten miRNAs were differentially regulated in vivo, including miR-99, 
miR-100, miR-302a, miR-208a, miR-665, miR-1, miR-499a, miR-34a, miR-133a, and 
miR-199a. These miRNAs promote stemness, cell division, and survival. Several 
signaling pathways are regulated by these miRNAs, including Hippo, Wnt, and 
Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene B (ERBB). Transcripts encoding Wnt, ERBB, 
and Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) were elevated in vivo in the infarct repair zone. Wnt5a 
signaling and ERBB/NRG1 transcripts contribute to activation of Yes-Associated 
Protein 1. MiRNAs that impact proliferation, cell survival, and signaling 
pathways that promote regeneration were induced during cardiovascular repair in 
the sheep model. This information can be used to design new approaches for the 
optimization of miRNA-based treatments for the heart."
1358,"Alginate hydrogel is an attractive biomaterial for cell microencapsulation. The 
microarchitecture of hydrogels can regulate cellular functions. This study aims 
to investigate the applicability of sodium citrate buffer (SCB) as a culture 
medium supplement for modulating the microstructure of alginate microbeads to 
provide a favorable microenvironment for chondrogenic induction. The 
chondrocyte-laden microbeads, with and without TGF-β3 incorporation, were 
produced through an encapsulator. The obtained small-sized microbeads (~300 μm) 
were exposed to a treatment medium containing SCB, composed of varied 
concentrations of sodium citrate (1.10 - 1.57 mM), sodium chloride (3.00 - 
4.29 mM), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (0.60 - 0.86 mM) to partially 
degrade their crosslinked structure for three days, followed by culture in a 
normal medium until Day 21. SEM micrographs demonstrated a loose hydrogel 
network with an enhanced pore size in the SCB-treated microbeads. Increasing the 
concentration of SCB in the treatment medium reduced the calcium content of the 
microbeads via a Na+ /Ca2+ exchange process and improved the water absorption of 
the microbeads, resulting in a higher swelling ratio. All the tested SCB 
concentrations were non-cytotoxic. Increases in aggrecan and type II collagen 
gene expression and their corresponding extracellular matrix accumulation, 
glycosaminoglycans, and type II collagen were vividly detected in the 
TGF-β3-containing microbeads with increasing SCB concentrations in the treatment 
medium. Our findings highlighted that the combination of SCB treatment and 
TGF-β3 incorporation in the chondrocyte-laden microbeads is a promising strategy 
for enhancing cartilage regeneration, which may contribute to a versatile 
application in cell delivery and tissue engineering."
1359,"Within vascular plants, the partitioning of hydraulic resistance along the 
soil-to-leaf continuum affects transpiration and its response to environmental 
conditions. In trees, the fractional contribution of leaf hydraulic resistance 
(Rleaf ) to total soil-to-leaf hydraulic resistance (Rtotal ), or fRleaf (= 
Rleaf /Rtotal ), is thought to be large, but this has not been tested 
comprehensively. We compiled a multi-biome dataset of fRleaf using new and 
previously published measurements of pressure differences within trees in situ. 
Across 80 samples, fRleaf averaged 0.51 (95% CI = 0.46, 0.57) and it declined 
with tree height. We also used the allometric relationship between field-based 
measurements of soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance and laboratory-based 
measurements of leaf hydraulic conductance to compute the average fRleaf for 19 
tree samples, which was 0.40 (95% CI = 0.29, 0.56). The in-situ technique 
produces a more accurate descriptor of fRleaf because it accounts for dynamic 
leaf hydraulic conductance. Both approaches demonstrate the outsized role of 
leaves in controlling tree hydrodynamics. A larger fRleaf may play a role in 
protecting stems from loss of hydraulic conductance. Thus, the decline in fRleaf 
with tree height would contribute to greater drought vulnerability in taller 
trees and potentially to their observed disproportionate drought mortality. This

1360,"SCOPE: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) provide a useful and minimally 
invasive source of biomarkers. Here we aimed to identify PBMC transcriptomic 
biomarkers predictive of metabolic impairment related to increased adiposity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the global PBMC transcriptome in metabolically 
healthy (normoglycemic) volunteers with overweight-obesity (OW-OB, n = 12), and 
in subjects with metabolically-obese normal-weight (MONW, n = 5) phenotype, in 
comparison to normal weight (NW, n = 12) controls. We identified 1,072 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OW-OB versus NW and 992 in MONW versus 
NW. Hierarchical clustering of the top 100 DEGs clearly distinguished OW-OB and 
MONW from NW. Remarkably, the OW-OB and MONW phenotypes shared 257 DEGs 
regulated in the same direction. The top up-regulated gene CXCL8, coding for 
interleukin 8, with a role in obesity-related pathologies, was of special 
interest as a potential marker for predicting increased metabolic risk. CXCL8 
expression was increased mainly in the MONW group and correlated directly with 
C-reactive protein levels.
CONCLUSIONS: PBMC gene expression analysis of CXCL8 or a pool of DEGs might be 
used to identify early metabolic risk in an apparently healthy population 
regardless of their BMI, i.e., subjects with OW-OB or MONW phenotype and to 
apply adequate and personalized nutritional preventive strategies. This article

1361,"Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor involved in a range of metabolic 
pathways including the activation of long-chain fatty acids for catabolism. 
Cells synthesize CoA de novo from vitamin B5 (pantothenate) via a pathway 
strongly conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In humans, it involves 
five enzymatic steps catalyzed by four enzymes: pantothenate kinase (PANK 
[isoforms 1-4]), 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS), 
phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPCDC), and CoA synthase (COASY). To 
date, inborn errors of metabolism associated with all of these genes, except 
PPCDC, have been described, two related to neurodegeneration with brain iron 
accumulation (NBIA), and one associated with a cardiac phenotype. This paper 
reports another defect in this pathway (detected in two sisters), associated 
with a fatal cardiac phenotype, caused by biallelic variants (p.Thr53Pro and 
p.Ala95Val) of PPCDC. PPCDC enzyme (EC 4.1.1.36) catalyzes the decarboxylation 
of 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine to 4'-phosphopantetheine in CoA biosynthesis. 
The variants p.Thr53Pro and p.Ala95Val affect residues highly conserved across 
different species; p.Thr53Pro is involved in the binding of flavin 
mononucleotide, and p.Ala95Val is likely a destabilizing mutation. 
Patient-derived fibroblasts showed an absence of PPCDC protein, and nearly 50% 
reductions in CoA levels. The cells showed clear energy deficiency problems, 
with defects in mitochondrial respiration, , and mostly glycolytic ATP 
synthesis. Functional studies performed in yeast suggest these mutations to be 
functionally relevant. In summary, this work describes a new, ultra-rare, severe 
inborn error of metabolism due to pathogenic variants of PPCDC."
1362,"Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and preventing susceptible 
patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly 
desirable but have proven to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid 
immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral 
immunity. A combination of checkpoint blocking antibody and virus-specific 
antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be 
anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one-step in-situ polymerization of 
dopamine under a cell-friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize 
and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and 
expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In 
addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity 
due to native immunogenicity of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns. 
Immunization with dressed bacteria promote the maturation and activation of 
antigen-presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune 
responses in tumor-bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral 
antigen-specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed 
tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive 
nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next-generation therapeutics for

1363,"BACKGROUND: There is an increased demand for hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) to treat various diseases including combined immunodeficiencies (CID), 
with limited worldwide availability. Variables affecting the decision regarding 
CID patients' prioritization for HSCT are not known. We aimed to determine 
general, clinical, and immunologic factors associated with the higher risk of 
early death (≤6 months after diagnosis) in untransplanted CID patients.
METHODS: Data collection was done retrospectively from five centers and included 
general patients' information, and clinical and laboratory variables. Inclusion 
criteria were untransplanted patients who are either dead or alive with a 
follow-up period ≥6 months after diagnosis.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-six CID patients were reported by participating 
centers, of whom 111 were included in the study with a cumulative follow-up 
period of 278.6 years. Seventy-two patients died with the median age of death of 
10.5 months. 35.1% of the patients succumbed within 6 months after the 
diagnosis. Having a history of Candida infections, sepsis or hepatomegaly was 
associated with an increased risk of early death. None of the other general or 
clinical variables was associated with such risk. Bivariate analysis of 
lymphocyte subsets showed that patients with the following counts: CD3+  < 100, 
CD4+  < 200, CD8+  < 50, or CD16+ CD56+ <200 cells/μl had increased risk of 
early death. In adjusted analysis, increased risk of early death was observed 
among patients with CD3+ count <100 cells/μl.
CONCLUSION: Combined immunodeficiencies patients with a history of Candida 
infections, sepsis, hepatomegaly, or severe T-lymphopenia should be given 
priority for HSCT to avoid early death."
1364,"BACKGROUND: The performance of uniportal VATS lobectomy (uVATS) for non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) larger than 5 cm is uncertain due to a lack of 
evidence. Here, we present a retrospective, propensity-score matched cohort 
study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of uVATS for patients with 
locally advanced NSCLC.
METHODS: The data of patients with NSCLC larger than 5 cm diameter who underwent 
curative resection via uVATS or thoracotomy lobectomy between January 2015 and 
December 2020 was collected. Propensity-score matching was utilized to control 
the observable biases.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients underwent uVATS lobectomy, while 38 received 
thoracotomy lobectomy. No conversion to open surgery or perioperative death 
occurred. uVATS lobectomy achieved similar total lymph node dissection counts 
compared to thoracotomy and even yielded a higher amount of lymph node 
dissection in pTNM stage II patients. The long-term overall and recurrence-free 
survival rates were also similar between the two groups. Results from the 
propensity-score matching generated cohort agreed with those from the full 
cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: uVATS lobectomy is feasible and effective for curative lobectomy 
for NSCLC larger than 5 cm in diameter in selected patients. Further validations 
from well-designed prospective studies are required for uVATS lobectomy for 
patients with locally advanced NSCLC."
1365,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly toxic lesions that can cause genomic 
instability and can be repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and 
homologous recombination (HR) pathways. Despite extensive studies about DSB 
repair pathways, the roles of each pathway during meiotic maturation in oocytes 
are not well understood. Here we show that oocytes selectively utilize NHEJ and 
HR to repair DSBs during meiotic maturation. Inhibition of NHEJ impaired the 
meiotic maturation of oocytes with DNA damage by activating the spindle assembly 
checkpoint (SAC) with a concomitant increase in metaphase I (MI) arrest and DNA 
damage levels. In contrast, oocytes with DNA damage bypassed SAC-mediated MI 
arrest despite the presence of fragmented DNA when HR was inhibited. Notably, 
this bypass of SAC arrest by HR inhibition was associated with a loss of 
centromere integrity and subsequent impairment of chromosome architecture. Our 
results demonstrate that, while NHEJ is critical for the meiotic maturation of 
oocytes with DNA damage, HR is essential to maintain centromere integrity 
against DNA damage during meiotic maturation, revealing distinct roles of NHEJ 
and HR during meiotic maturation in mouse oocytes."
1366,"Tumor therapeutic resistances are frequently linked to the recurrence and poor 
prognosis of cancers and have been a key bottleneck in clinical tumor treatment. 
Mucin1 (MUC1), a heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein, exhibits abnormally 
overexpression in a variety of human tumors and has been confirmed to be related 
to the formation of therapeutic resistance. In this review, the multifaceted 
roles of MUC1 in tumor therapy resistance are summarized from aspects of 
pan-cancer principles shared among therapies and individual mechanisms dependent 
on different therapies. Concretely, the common mechanisms of therapy resistance 
across cancers include interfering with gene expression, promoting genome 
instability, modifying tumor microenvironment, enhancing cancer heterogeneity 
and stemness, and activating evasion and metastasis. Moreover, the individual 
mechanisms of therapy resistance in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and biotherapy 
are introduced. Last but not least, MUC1-involved therapy resistance in 
different types of cancers and MUC1-related clinical trials are summarized."
1367,"Bacterial L-asparaginase (LA) is a chemotherapeutic drug that has remained 
mainstay of cancer treatment for several decades. LA has been extensively used 
worldwide for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A 
halotolerant bacterial strain Bacillus licheniformis sp. isolated from marine 
environment was used for LA production. The enzyme produced was subjected to 
purification and physico-chemical characterisation. Purified LA was 
thermotolerant and demonstrated more than 90% enzyme activity after 1 h of 
incubation at 80 °C. LA has also proved to be resistant against pH gradient and 
retained activity at pH ranging from 3.0 to 10. The enzyme also had high 
salinity tolerance with 90% LA activity at 10% NaCl concentration. Detergents 
like Triton X-100 and Tween-80 were observed to inhibit LA activity while more 
than 70% catalytic activity was maintained in the presence of metals. 
Electrophoretic analysis revealed that LA is a heterodimer (~ 63 and ~ 65 kDa) 
and has molecular mass of around 130 kDa in native form. The kinetic parameters 
of LA were tested with LA having low Km value of 1.518 µM and Vmax value of 
6.94 µM/min/mL. Purified LA has also exhibited noteworthy antiproliferative 
activity against cancer cell lines-HeLa, SiHa, A549, and SH-SY-5Y. In addition, 
bench-scale LA production was conducted in a 5-L bioreactor using moringa leaves 
as cost-effective substrate."
1368,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been shown to play significant 
roles in the regulation of normal cognitive processes in the hippocampus, and 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are also 
involved in these processes. This study aims to explore the mAChR-mediated 
regulation of AMPARs GluA2 trafficking and to reveal the key proteins and the 
signaling cascade involved in this process. Primary hippocampal neurons, as cell 
models, were treated with agonist 77-LH-28-1 and antagonist VU0255035, Fsc231, 
and APV. C57BL/6J male mice were stereotactically injected with 77-LH-28-1 and 
Fsc231 to obtain hippocampal slices. The trafficking of GluA2 was detected by 
surface biotinylation and immunostaining. Activation of M1 mAChRs promoted 
endocytosis and decreased the postsynaptic localization of the AMPA receptor 
subunit GluA2 and that phosphorylation of GluA2 at Ser880 was increased by M1 
mAChR activity. Fsc231 blocked the endocytosis and postsynaptic localization of 
GluA2 induced by 77-LH-28-1 without affecting the phosphorylation of Ser880. 
PICK1 was required for M1 mAChR-mediated GluA2 endocytosis and downstream of 
phosphorylation of GluA2-Ser880, and the PICK1-GluA2 interaction was essential 
for M1 mAChR-mediated postsynaptic expression of GluA2. Taken together, our 
results show a functional correlation of M1 mAChRs with GluA2 and the role of 
PICK1 in their interplay. The schematic diagram for the modulation of GluA2 
trafficking by M1 mAChRs. Activation of M1 mAChRs induces PKC activation, and 
the interaction of PICK1-GluA2 determines the endocytosis and postsynaptic 
localization of GluA2."
1369,"INTRODUCTION: Lymphopenia has been correlated with poorer survival in patients 
with metastatic cancers treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Treatments such as 
chemotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy can induce lymphopenia. Radiation-induced 
lymphopenia is common and prolonged in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients. We 
evaluated the impact of lymphopenia, on efficacy of anti PD-1 nivolumab 
immunotherapy in HNSCC patients.
METHODS: a multicenter retrospective study included consecutive patients treated 
with nivolumab for recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC between January 2017 and 
June 2019. Lymphopenia was defined as lymphocyte counts below 1000 cells/mm3 
upon initiation of nivolumab. Logistical regression was performed on factors 
associated with lymphopenia and ROC analyses assessed association between 
lymphopenia and survival.
RESULTS: median age was 65. Of the 100 included patients, 60% had been treated 
by surgery, 67% had had first-line chemotherapy, and 89% loco-regional 
radiotherapy, 65% had concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy. Lymphopenia 
occurred in 56 (56%) patients upon initiation of nivolumab, with 29 (29%) 
patients having radiation-related lymphopenia. Prior locoregional radiotherapy 
was the only factor associated with lymphopenia upon initiation of nivolumab by 
logistical regression (OR 0.144 [0.029-0.706], p - 0.017). Lymphopenia upon 
initiation of nivolumab did not affect progression-free survival (PFS) (p 
- 0.815), overall survival (OS) (p - 0.783) or disease control rate (DCR) (p 
- 0.125). Locoregional symptomatology (HR - 2.37 [1.24-4.54], p - 0.009), 
metastatic symptomatology (HR - 4.74 [2.21-10.15], and persistent lymphopenia 
under nivolumab (HR 3.96 [1.19-13.17] p - 0.034) were associated with poorer OS 
in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Lymphopenia upon initiation of nivolumab was not associated with 
poorer survival in R/M HNSCC patients, but persistence of lymphopenia during 
immunotherapy might be a prognostic marker of patient survival."
1370,"Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid that is widely distributed in the earth's 
crust. People are continuously exposed to this toxicant in their food and 
drinking water. Inorganic arsenic occurs in two oxidation states, arsenite 3+ 
(iAs3+) and arsenate 5+ (iAs5+). The most toxic form is its trivalent form which 
interferes with the electron transfer cycle and induces overproduction of 
reactive oxygen species, leading to depletion of the antioxidant defense system, 
as well as altering fatty acid levels and mitochondrial action. Since arsenic 
crosses the blood-brain barrier, it can damage cells in different regions of the 
brain, causing neurological disorders through the induction of oxidative stress, 
inflammation, DNA damage, and cell death. Hydroxytyrosol, taurine, alpha-lipoic 
acid, ellagic acid, and thymoquinone have been shown to effectively alleviate 
arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. The protective effects are the result of the 
anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of the phytochemicals and in 
particular their anti-apoptotic function via the Nrf2 and PI3/Akt/SIRT1 
signaling pathways."
1371,"This study aimed to investigate whether hot-melt extrusion (HME) processing can 
promote molecular encapsulation of a multi-component natural product composed of 
volatile and pungent hydrophobic substances (ginger oleoresin (OR)) with 
cyclodextrins. 6-Gingerol and 6-shogaol, the biomarkers of ginger OR, were 
quantified by HPLC. Phase-solubility studies were performed using β-cyclodextrin 
(βCD) and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) for ginger OR complexation. Solid 
complexes were then prepared by thermal (HME)- and solvent (slurry (SL))-based 
methods. Morphology, thermal behavior, solubility, in vitro dissolution, and in 
vivo anti-inflammatory activity were evaluated. HPβCD gave rise to AL-type 
complexes with ginger OR, whereas βCD led to materials with limited solubility. 
Ginger OR was complexed with HPβCD by HME without significant change in gingerol 
and shogaol content. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) suggested 
higher volatile retention in HME complexes than in SL ones. Shogaol and gingerol 
solubility and dissolution significantly increased from SL and HME complexes 
compared with ginger OR. In turn, 1:2 OR/HPβCD HME complex showed higher 
6-shogaol solubility than SL, associated with a gradual release. The 
carrageenan-induced pleurisy test showed that the anti-inflammatory activity of 
ginger OR was maintained after complexation with HPβCD. The complexes 
significantly decrease the levels of IL-1β and inhibit cell migration. HME 
complex showed performance equivalent to the positive control and superior to 
the SL material. Taken together, these results indicate that HME can be useful 
for promoting the molecular encapsulation of complex natural products that 
contain volatile and thermolabile substances. HME complexes showed better in 
vivo and in vitro performance than complexes prepared using the solvent-based 
method."
1372,"Glomerular diseases afflict millions of people and impose an enormous burden on 
public healthcare costs worldwide. Identification of potential therapeutic 
targets for preventing glomerular diseases is of considerable clinical 
importance. CHILKBP is a focal adhesion protein and modulates a wide array of 
biological functions. However, little is known about the role of CHILKBP in 
glomerular diseases. To investigate the function of CHILKBP in maintaining the 
structure and function of podocytes in a physiologic setting, a mouse model 
(CHILKBP cKO) was generated in which CHILKBP gene was conditionally deleted in 
podocytes using the Cre-LoxP system. Ablation of CHILKBP in podocytes resulted 
in massive proteinuria and kidney failure in mice. Histologically, typical 
podocyte injury including podocyte loss, foot process effacement, and 
glomerulosclerosis was observed in CHILKBP cKO mice. Mechanistically, we 
identified ZO-1 as a key junctional protein that interacted with CHILKBP. Loss 
of CHILKBP in podocytes exhibited a significant reduction of ZO-1 expression, 
leading to abnormal actin organization, aberrant slit diaphragm protein 
expression and compromised podocyte filtration capacity. Restoration of CHILKBP 
or ZO-1 in CHILKBP-deficient podocytes effectively alleviated podocyte injury 
induced by the loss of CHILKBP in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we showed the 
glomerular expression of CHILKBP and ZO-1 was decreased in patients with 
proteinuric kidney diseases. Our findings reveal a novel signaling pathway 
consisting of CHILKBP and ZO-1 that plays an essential role in maintaining 
podocyte homeostasis and suggest novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate 
glomerular diseases."
1373,"In recent years, there has been growing interest in SARM1 as a potential 
breakthrough drug target for treating various pathologies of axon degeneration. 
SARM1-mediated axon degeneration relies on its TIR domain NADase activity, but 
recent structural data suggest that the non-catalytic ARM domain could also 
serve as a pharmacological site as it has an allosteric inhibitory function. 
Here, we screened for synthetic small molecules that inhibit SARM1, and tested a 
selected set of these compounds in a DRG axon degeneration assay. Using cryo-EM, 
we found that one of the newly discovered inhibitors, a calmidazolium designated 
TK106, not only stabilizes the previously reported inhibited conformation of the 
octamer, but also a meta-stable structure: a duplex of octamers (16 protomers), 
which we have now determined to 4.0 Å resolution. In the duplex, each ARM domain 
protomer is engaged in lateral interactions with neighboring protomers, and is 
further stabilized by contralateral contacts with the opposing octamer ring. 
Mutagenesis of the duplex contact sites leads to a moderate increase in SARM1 
activation in cultured cells. Based on our data we propose that the duplex 
assembly constitutes an additional auto-inhibition mechanism that tightly 
prevents pre-mature activation and axon degeneration."
1374,"The sustained immunosuppression associated with severe sepsis favours an 
increased susceptibility to secondary infections and remains incompletely 
understood. Plasmablast and plasma cell subsets, whose primary function is to 
secrete antibodies, have emerged as important suppressive populations expanded 
during sepsis. In particular, sepsis supports CD39hi plasmablast metabolic 
reprogramming associated with adenosine-mediated suppressive activity. Arginine 
deficiency has been linked to increased risk of secondary infections in sepsis. 
Overcoming arginine shortage by citrulline administration efficiently improves 
sepsis-induced immunosuppression and secondary infections in the cecal ligation 
and puncture murine model. Here we aimed to determine the impact of citrulline 
administration on B cell suppressive responses in sepsis. We demonstrate that 
restoring arginine bioavailability through citrulline administration, markedly 
reduces the dominant extrafollicular B cell response, decreasing the 
immunosuppressive LAG3+ and CD39+ plasma cell populations, and restoring splenic 
follicles. At the molecular level, the IRF4/MYC-mediated B cell reprogramming 
required for extrafollicular plasma cell differentiation is shunted in splenic B 
cells of mice fed with citrulline. Our study reveals a prominent impact of 
nutrition on B cell responses, and plasma cell differentiation and further 
supports the development of citrulline-based clinical studies to prevent sepsis 
associated immune dysfunction. This article is protected by copyright. All

1375,"Histological artefacts in cryosectioned tissue can hinder rapid diagnostic 
assessments during surgery. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue 
provides higher quality slides, but the process for obtaining them is laborious 
(typically lasting 12-48 h) and hence unsuitable for intra-operative use. Here 
we report the development and performance of a deep-learning model that improves 
the quality of cryosectioned whole-slide images by transforming them into the 
style of whole-slide FFPE tissue within minutes. The model consists of a 
generative adversarial network incorporating an attention mechanism that 
rectifies cryosection artefacts and a self-regularization constraint between the 
cryosectioned and FFPE images for the preservation of clinically relevant 
features. Transformed FFPE-style images of gliomas and of non-small-cell lung 
cancers from a dataset independent from that used to train the model improved 
the rates of accurate tumour subtyping by pathologists."
1376,"The effectivity of cancer immunotherapies is hindered by immunosuppressive 
tumour microenvironments that are poorly infiltrated by effector T cells and 
natural killer cells. In infection and autoimmune disease, the recruitment and 
activation of effector immune cells is coordinated by pro-inflammatory T helper 
17 (TH17) cells. Here we show that pathogen-mimicking hollow nanoparticles 
displaying mannan (a polysaccharide that activates TH17 cells in microbial cell 
walls) limit the fraction of regulatory T cells and induce TH17-cell-mediated 
anti-tumour responses. The nanoparticles activate the pattern-recognition 
receptor Dectin-2 and Toll-like receptor 4 in dendritic cells, and promote the 
differentiation of CD4+ T cells into the TH17 phenotype. In mice, intra-tumoural 
administration of the nanoparticles decreased the fraction of regulatory T cells 
in the tumour while markedly increasing the fractions of TH17 cells (and the 
levels of TH17-cell-associated cytokines), CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells 
and M1-like macrophages. The anti-tumoural activity of the effector cells was 
amplified by an agonistic antibody against the co-stimulatory receptor OX40 in 
multiple mouse models. Nanomaterials that induce TH17-cell-mediated immune 
responses may have therapeutic potential."
1377,"BACKGROUND: Teeth can be used as a raw material for preparing bone substitutes 
due to their similar chemical composition to bone. The objective of our study 
was to evaluate the effect of odontogenic biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) 
incorporating dentin noncollagenous proteins (DNCPs) on osteogenesis and 
stability in maxillary sinus augmentation.
METHODS: The composition, structure and morphology of the odontogenic BCP were 
tested by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and scanning 
electron microscopy methods. The biocompatibility and osteoinduction of DNCPs 
and materials were examined in vitro and their bone regeneration capacity was 
verified in vivo.
RESULTS: The results showed that the cells adhered and proliferated well on the 
DNCP-loaded BCP scaffold. The odontogenic BCP and DNCPs promoted osteogenic 
differentiation of cells, The new bone formation in the BCP groups and DNCP 
subgroups was significantly higher than the new bone formation in the control, 
and the new bone quality was better. The bone regeneration effect of odontogenic 
BCP was similar to the effect of deproteinized bovine bone mineral, but β-TCP 
did not maintain the height and volume of bone reconstruction.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the combined application of DNCPs and odontogenic BCP 
is an effective strategy for tissue engineering osteogenesis in the maxillary 
sinus region. The biomimetic strategy could provide a new approach for patients 
requiring maxillary sinus lifting."
1378,"In this study, we explored the pyroptosis-related biomarkers and signatures of 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-COADREAD and were 
analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs in 
CRC‒pyroptosis-related genes (CRC‒PRGs) were obtained by intersecting DEGs 
associated with CRC and PRGs. The CRC‒PRGs were verified; functional enrichment 
analysis was performed with Gene Ontology (GO) followed by cluster analysis. Cox 
analyses and LASSO regression were used in TCGA dataset to construct a 
prognostic model for patients with CRC. A prognostic risk assessment model was 
constructed and efficacy was evaluated. Decision curve analysis was utilized to 
assess the role of the Lasso-Cox regression prognostic model for clinical 
utility at 1, 3, and 5 years. Twelve CRC‒PRGs were identified as prognostic 
pyroptosis-related DEGs. CXCL8, IL13RA2, MELK, and POP1 were selected as 
prognostic genes to construct features with a good prognostic performance in GEO 
and TCGA. Functional enrichment indicated that the 4-gene signature might be 
involved in CRC tumorigenesis and development through various pathways by 
playing a prognostic role in CRC. Furthermore, the results of the immune 
landscape analysis showed that the expression of CXCL8 and IL13RA2 in 
TCGA-COADREAD dataset was positively correlated with significant differential 
enrichment of most immune cells. A novel prognostic model consisting of four key 
genes, CXCL8, IL13RA2, MELK, and POP1, can accurately predict the survival of 
patients with CRC. This finding may provide a new perspective for the treatment 
of pyroptosis-related CRC."
1379,"Non-infectious pulmonary complications (NIPCs) after allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are associated with poor outcomes. It is 
important to maximize the effectiveness of primary treatment because secondary 
treatment has not been established. We analyzed data from 393 patients who 
underwent allogeneic HSCT during a 10-year period. Thirty-seven were diagnosed 
with NIPCs, which consisted of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, bronchiolitis 
obliterans, and interstitial lung disease including cryptogenic organizing 
pneumonia. Among these, 18 died (Dead group) while 19 remained alive (Alive 
group) during the study period. The median time between NIPC diagnosis and first 
administration of ≥ 1 mg/kg/day corticosteroids (prednisolone dose equivalent) 
was significantly longer in the Dead group than the Alive group, at 9 days 
versus 4 days (p = 0.01). We further divided these cases into those who received 
prednisolone within seven days and after 8 days. We found that the ≤ 7 days 
group were more likely to survive after their NIPC diagnosis compared to 
the ≥ 8 days group (p = 0.06). Our analysis showed that early initiation of 
corticosteroid therapy is associated with long-term survival in NIPCs."
1380,"Human disorders of the enteric nervous system (ENS), e.g., Hirschsprung's 
disease, are rarely associated with major central nervous system involvement. We 
describe two families each segregating a different homozygous truncating variant 
in KIF26A with a unique constellation of severe megacolon that resembles 
Hirschsprung's disease but lacks aganglionosis as well as brain malformations 
that range from severe to mild. The intestinal phenotype bears a striking 
resemblance to that observed in Kif26a-/- mice where KIF26A deficiency was found 
to cause abnormal GDNF-Ret signaling resulting in failure to establish normal 
neuronal networks despite myenteric neuronal hyperplasia. Very recently, a range 
of brain developmental phenotypes were described in patients and mice with 
KIF26A deficiency and were found to result from abnormal radial migration and 
increased apoptosis. Our report, therefore, reveals a recognizable 
autosomal-recessive human KIF26A deficiency phenotype characterized by severe 
ENS dysfunction and a range of brain malformations."
1381,"Cell-substrate adhesion nano-interfaces can, in principle, exhibit a spatial 
distribution of local pH values under the influence of the weakly acidic 
microenvironment of glycocalyx grafted on lipid bilayer cell membrane which is 
compressed and closely attached to culture substrate in the vicinity of 
integrin-adhesion complexes. However, a simple local pH distribution imaging 
methodology has not been developed. In this study, to visualize the local pH 
distribution at the cell adhesion interface, we prepared glass substrates 
chemically modified with a pH-responsive fluorescent dye fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC), observed the distribution of FITC fluorescence intensity 
at the adhesion interface of fibroblast (NIH/3T3) and cancer cells (HeLa), and 
compared the FITC images with the observed distribution of focal adhesions. FITC 
images were converted to pH mapping based on the pH-fluorescence calibration 
data of surface-immobilized FITC pre-measured in different pH media, which 
showed significantly larger regions with lowered pH level (6.8-7.0) from outside 
the cell (pH 7.4) were observed at the thick inner periphery of HeLa cells while 
3T3 cells exhibited smaller lowered pH regions at the thin periphery. The 
lowered pH regions overlapped with many focal adhesions, and image analysis 
showed that larger focal adhesions tend to possess more lowered pH sites inside, 
reflecting enhanced glycocalyx compression due to accumulated integrin-adhesion 
ligand binding. This tendency was stronger for HeLa than for 3T3 cells. The role 
of glycocalyx compression and the pH reduction at the cell adhesive interface is 
discussed."
1382,"Alzheimer's disease causes loss of memory and deterioration of mental abilities 
is utmost predominant neurodegenerative disease accounting 70-80% cases of 
dementia. The appearance of plaques of amyloid-β and neurofibrillary tangles in 
the brain post-mortems of Alzheimer's patients established them as key 
participants in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Exosomes exist as 
extracellular vesicles of nano-size which are present throughout the body. 
Exosomes are known to spread toxic hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid-β between 
the cells and are linked to the loss of neurons by inducing apoptosis. Exosomes 
have progressed from cell trashcans to multifunctional organelles which are 
involved in various functions like internalisation and transmission of 
macromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. This review covers 
current findings on relationship of exosomes in biogenesis and angiogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease and functions of exosomes in the etiology of AD. 
Furthermore, the roles of exosomes in development, diagnosis, treatment, and its 
importance as therapeutic targets and biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease have 
also been highlighted."
1383,"BACKGROUND: The phase III ATTRACTION-3 study showed that second-line nivolumab 
monotherapy for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma prolonged overall 
survival (OS) but did not improve progression-free survival (PFS). Subsequent 
systemic therapy after discontinuing nivolumab may affect these outcomes. To 
test this possibility, we evaluated the outcomes of treatment with taxanes after 
nivolumab in ATTRACTION-3.
METHODS: We reviewed the charts of Japanese patients who had discontinued 
second-line nivolumab in ATTRACTION-3 and started subsequent third-line taxanes 
between January 7, 2016, and November 12, 2018. The primary endpoint was 
objective response rate (ORR) to third-line taxanes.
RESULTS: Of the 75 patients included in this study, 54 (72%), 18 (24%), and 3 
(4%) patients received either paclitaxel, docetaxel, or combination therapy 
comprising docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil, respectively. The ORR in 
the overall, paclitaxel, and docetaxel groups was 29.6%, 36.5%, and 12.5%, 
respectively; these numbers were comparable to those (20-44%) in patients 
receiving taxanes as first- and second-line therapy. The median OS in the 
overall, paclitaxel, and docetaxel groups was 9.9, 9.9, and 9.3 months, 
respectively, whereas the corresponding median PFS was 4.9, 4.7 and 6.5 months, 
respectively. Treatment-related adverse events were observed in 65 (87%) 
patients, of which grade 3-4 occurred in 37 (49%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Favorable effectiveness and safety profile of taxanes following 
second-line nivolumab was observed in Japanese patients with advanced esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma. When a patient with advanced esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma receiving nivolumab becomes refractory or intolerant, subsequent 
taxane treatment may be a promising option."
1384,"One of the main barriers to making efficient Photosystem I-based biohybrid solar 
cells is the need for an electrochemical pathway to facilitate electron transfer 
between the P700 reaction center of Photosystem I and an electrode. To this end, 
nature provides inspiration in the form of cytochrome c6, a natural electron 
donor to the P700 site. Its natural ability to access the P700 binding pocket 
and reduce the reaction center can be mimicked by employing cytochrome c, which 
has a similar protein structure and redox chemistry while also being compatible 
with a variety of electrode surfaces. Previous research has incorporated 
cytochrome c to improve the photocurrent generation of Photosystem I using time 
consuming and/or specialized electrode preparation. While those methods lead to 
high protein areal density, in this work we use the quick and facile 
vacuum-assisted drop-casting technique to construct a Photosystem I/cytochrome c 
photoactive composite film with micron-scale thickness. We demonstrate that this 
simple fabrication technique can result in high cytochrome c loading and 
improvement in cathodic photocurrent over a drop-casted Photosystem I film 
without cytochrome c. In addition, we analyze the behavior of the cytochrome 
c/Photosystem I system at varying applied potentials to show that the 
improvement in performance can be attributed to enhancement of the electron 
transfer rate to P700 sites and therefore the PSI turnover rate within the 
composite film."
1385,"A polyphasic approach was used to determine the taxonomic position of a marine 
actinomycete, designated isolate CWH03T, which we previously reported to produce 
new linear azole-containing peptides spongiicolazolicins A and B. Strain CWH03T 
is mesophilic, neutrophilic, and halotolerant streptomycete that forms spiral 
spore chains on aerial mycelium. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed 
that CWH03T was most closely related to Streptomyces tirandamycinicus HNM0039T 
(99.7%), Streptomyces spongiicola HNM0071T (99.4%), 'Streptomyces marianii' 
ICN19T (99.1%) and Streptomyces wuyuanensis CGMCC4.7042T (99.0%). The 
phylogenetic tree prepared using the 16S rRNA gene, as well as the phylogenomic 
tree using the genome BLAST distance phylogeny method and 81 core housekeeping 
genes, respectively, showed that the closest relative of strain CWH03T was S. 
spongiicola HNM0071T. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA 
hybridization values between strains CWH03T and S. spongiicola HNM0071T were 
91.46% and 44.2%, respectively, which were below the thresholds of 96% and 70% 
for prokaryotic conspecific assignation. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of 
strain CWH03T was 72.3%. Whole-cell hydrolysates of strain CWH03T contained 
LL-diaminopimelic acid. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H8) (88.3%), and 
the major fatty acids were iso-C16:0 (28.4%), anteiso-C15:0 (15.0%) and 
iso-C15:0 (12.9%). The major phospholipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, 
phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified phospholipid. 
Based on data obtained from phenotypic, phylogenetic, genomic, and 
chemotaxonomic analyses, strain CWH03T represents a novel species of the genus 
Streptomyces, for which the proposed name is Streptomyces pacificus sp. nov. The 
type strain is CWH03T ( = NBRC 114659T = TBRC 15780T)."
1386,"BACKGROUND: The Trichosporonaceae family comprises a large number of 
basidiomycetes widely distributed in nature. Some of its members, especially 
Trichosporon asahii, have the ability to cause human infections. This ability is 
related to a series of virulence factors, which include lytic enzymes 
production, biofilm formation, resistance to oxidizing agents, melanin and 
glucuronoxylomannan in the cell wall, metabolic plasticity and phenotypic 
switching. The last two are poorly addressed within human pathogenic 
Trichosporonaceae.
OBJECTIVE: These factors were herein studied to contribute with the knowledge of 
these emerging pathogens and to uncover mechanisms that would explain the higher 
frequency of T. asahii in human infections.
METHODS: We included 79 clinical isolates phenotypically identified as 
Trichosporon spp. and performed their molecular identification. Lactate and 
N-acetyl glucosamine were the carbon sources of metabolic plasticity studies. 
Morphologically altered colonies after subcultures and incubation at 37 °C 
indicated phenotypic switching.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The predominant species was T. asahii (n = 65), followed 
by Trichosporon inkin (n = 4), Apiotrichum montevideense (n = 3), Trichosporon 
japonicum (n = 2), Trichosporon faecale (n = 2), Cutaneotrichosporon 
debeurmannianum (n = 1), Trichosporon ovoides (n = 1), and Cutaneotrichosporon 
arboriforme (n = 1). T. asahii isolates had statistically higher growth on 
lactate and N-acetylglucosamine and on glucose during the first 72 hours of 
culture. T. asahii, T. inkin, and T. japonicum isolates were able to perform 
phenotypic switching. These results expand the virulence knowledge of 
Trichosporonaceae members and point for a role for metabolic plasticity and 
phenotypic switching on the trichosporonosis pathogenesis."
1387,"Although micronuclei are well-known biomarkers of genotoxic damage, the 
biological consequences of micronucleus induction are only poorly understood. To 
further elucidate these consequences, HeLa cells stably expressing histone 2B 
coupled with green fluorescent protein were used for long-term live cell imaging 
to investigate the fate of micronuclei and micronucleated cells after treatment 
of cells with various genotoxic agents (doxorubicin (20, 30 and nM), tert-butyl 
hydroperoxide (tBHP, 50, 100 and 150 µM), radiation (0.5, 1 and 2 Gy), methyl 
methanesulfonate (MMS, 20, 25 and 30 µg/ml) and vinblastine (1, 2 and 3 nM)). 
Most micronuclei persist for multiple cell cycles or reincorporate while 
micronucleated cells were more prone to cell death, senescence and fatal mitotic 
errors compared to non-micronucleated cells, which is consistent with previous 
studies using etoposide. No clear substance-related effects on the fate of 
micronuclei and micronucleated cells were observed. To further investigate the 
fate of micronuclei, extrusion of micronuclei was studied with treatments 
reported as inducing the extrusion of micronuclei. Since extrusion was not 
observed in HeLa cells, the relevance of extrusion of micronuclei remains 
unclear. In addition, degradation of micronuclei was analysed via immunostaining 
of γH2AX, which demonstrated a high level of DNA damage in micronuclei compared 
to the main nuclei. Furthermore, transduction with two reporter genes 
(LC3B-dsRed and LaminB1-dsRed) was conducted followed by long-term live cell 
imaging. While autophagy marker LC3B was not associated with micronuclei, Lamin 
B1 was found in approximately 50% of all micronuclei. While degradation of 
micronuclei was not observed to be a frequent fate of micronuclei, the results 
show impaired stability of DNA and micronuclear envelope indicating rupture of 
micronuclei as a pre-step to chromothripsis."
1388,"Nuclear actin-based movements have been shown to orchestrate clustering of DNA 
double-strand breaks (DSBs) into homology-directed repair domains. Here we 
describe multiscale three-dimensional genome reorganization following DNA damage 
and analyze the contribution of the nuclear WASP-ARP2/3-actin pathway toward 
chromatin topology alterations and pathologic repair. Hi-C analysis reveals 
genome-wide, DNA damage-induced chromatin compartment flips facilitated by 
ARP2/3 that enrich for open, A compartments. Damage promotes interactions 
between DSBs, which in turn facilitate aberrant, actin-dependent intra- and 
inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Our work establishes that clustering of 
resected DSBs into repair domains by nuclear actin assembly is coordinated with 
multiscale alterations in genome architecture that enable homology-directed 
repair while also increasing nonhomologous end-joining-dependent translocation 
frequency."
1389,"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased in non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), and defining at-risk patients is important. Thus, we aimed to 
assess the association between programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression 
and VTE [pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT)] in NSCLC. In 
this retrospective, observational multicentre study, 369 patients with NSCLC who 
had PD-L1 immunohistochemistry based on biopsies taken between January 2017 and 
December 2019, were divided as PD-L1-positive (n = 181) and -negative (n = 188) 
groups, and low-positive (n = 99) and high-positive (n = 82) PD-L1 groups. Among 
all population, 12.5% of them developed a VTE during a median follow-up of 
474 days. The rates of DVT, PE, and PE + DVT were 5.7%, 6% and 0.8%, 
respectively. VTE (15.5% vs. 9.5%) and DVT (3.8% vs. 7.4%) were similar between 
two groups, while PE was significantly higher in PD‑L1-positive group than those 
in PD-L1-negative group (11.1% vs 1%, p < 0.001). There were no significant 
differences between low- and high-positive groups in terms of VTE (14.1% vs. 
17%), PE (12.1% vs. 9.8%), and DVT (2% vs. 6.1%). In the multivariate analysis, 
multiple metastases (Hazard ratio [HR] 4.02; 95% confidence interval [Cl] 
1.18-13.63; p = 0.07) and PD-L1 positivity was associated with an increased PE 
risk (HR 8.39; 95% Cl 2.07-34.07; p = 0.003). In conclusion, PD-L1 positivity 
may be of important role in predicting the increased risk of PE in patients with 
NSCLC and thereby may be used to define patients likely to benefit from 
thromboprophylaxis."
1390,"High sugar intake is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Genotoxicity 
is an important factor in diabetes onset, and iron (Fe) may be an aggravating 
element. However, this relationship is still poorly established. Thus, this 
study evaluated whether Fe supplementation could aggravate obesity, impaired 
glucose tolerance, and sugar overload-induced genotoxicity in rats. A total of 
24 rats were treated with different diets: standard diet (SD, n = 8), invert 
sugar overload (320 g/L, HSD, n = 8), or Fe plus invert sugar overload 
(2.56 mg/L of Fe2+, Fe-HSD, n = 8) for four months. After treatment, the Fe-HSD 
group showed no excessive weight gain or impaired glucose tolerance. DNA damage 
in blood, as assessed by comet assay, gradually increased in HSD during 
treatment (p < 0.001), whereas Fe-HSD showed a nonlinear increase in DNA damage. 
Moreover, Fe-HSD presented 0.6-fold more DNA damage compared with SD 
(p = 0.0055) in the 1st month of treatment. At months 2 and 3, results show 
a ≥ 1.4-fold increase in HSD and Fe-HSD DNA damage, respectively, compared with 
SD (p < 0.01). At the end of the experiment, only HSD DNA damage differed from 
SD (1.5-fold more, p = 0.0196). Fe supplementation did not aggravate the invert 
sugar-induced DNA damage (p > 0.05). In the pancreas, results showed no 
differences in DNA damage. Mutagenicity, evaluated by micronucleus testing, was 
not observed regardless of treatment (p = 0.428). Fe supplementation, in the 
evaluated concentration, did not aggravate weight gain, impaired glucose 
tolerance, and sugar overload-induced genotoxicity in rats."
1391,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in the skeleton likely 
plays a variety of physiological and pathophysiological roles that are not yet 
fully understood. In elucidating the complex relationship between bone and BMAT, 
glucocorticoids (GCs) are positioned to play a key role, as they have been 
implicated in the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) 
between osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. The purpose of this review is to 
illuminate aspects of both endogenous and exogenous GC signaling, including the 
influence of GC receptors, in mechanisms of bone aging including relationships 
to BMAT.
RECENT FINDINGS: Harmful effects of GCs on bone mass involve several cellular 
pathways and events that can include BMSC differentiation bias toward 
adipogenesis and the influence of mature BMAT on bone remodeling through 
crosstalk. Interestingly, BMAT involvement remains poorly explored in GC-induced 
osteoporosis and warrants further investigation. This review provides an update 
on the current understanding of the role of glucocorticoids in the biology of 
osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds)."
1392,"In this perspective, the authors summarise some properties of the solid tumour 
micro-environment that have been explored during the last 55 years. It is well 
established that the concentrations of nutrients, including oxygen, decrease 
with increasing distance from tumour blood vessels, and that low extracellular 
pH is found in nutrient-poor regions. Cell proliferation is dependent on 
nutrient metabolites and decreases in regions distal from patent blood vessels. 
Proliferating cells cause migration of neighbouring cells further from blood 
vessels where they may die, and their breakdown products pass into regions of 
necrosis. Anticancer drugs reach solid tumours via the vascular system and 
establish concentration gradients such that drug concentration within tumours 
may be quite variable. Treatment with chemotherapy such as doxorubicin or 
docetaxel can kill well-nourished proliferating cells close to blood vessels, 
thereby interrupting migration toward necrotic regions and lead to 
re-oxygenation and renewed proliferation of distal cells, as can occur with 
radiotherapy. This effect leads to the paradox that cancer treatment can rescue 
cells that were destined to die in the untreated tumour. Renewed and sometimes 
accelerated repopulation of surviving tumour cells can counter the effects of 
cell killing from repeated treatments, leading to tumour shrinkage and regrowth 
without changes in the intrinsic sensitivity of cells to the administered 
treatment. Strategies to prevent these effects include the combined use of 
chemotherapy with agents that selectively kill hypoxic tumour cells, including 
inhibitors of autophagy, since this is a process that may allow recycling of 
cellular macromolecules from dying cells and improve their survival."
1393,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for infection in patients with 
anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).
METHODS: Newly onset patients with AAV in China were included, and their 
laboratory tests and disease activity were analyzed. Based on infection, 
patients were divided into the infection group (A-I) and the non-infection group 
(A-NI). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to 
investigate variables that are independently associated with infection.
RESULTS: In total, 418 patients were enrolled. Significantly higher white blood 
cell count (WBC, p < 0.001), neutrophils (p < 0.001), NLR (p < 0.001), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (p < 0.001), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR, 
p < 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, p = 0.032), C-reactive protein 
(CRP, p < 0.001), procalcitonin (PCT, p < 0.001), and Birmingham vasculitis 
activity score (BVAS, p = 0.005) were observed in the A-I group than in the A-NI 
group. It was detected that NLR (ρ = 0.273, p < 0.001), MLR (ρ = 0.153, 
p = 0.011), ESR (ρ = 0.143, p = 0.020), and PCT (ρ = 0.391, p < 0.001) were 
positively correlated with BVAS. Furthermore, NLR was not only an independent 
predictor of infection (adjusted OR: 1.144, 95% CI: 1.059-1.236, p = 0.001), but 
with the largest area under ROC curve, of which value was 0.750. Notably, the 
optimal cut-off value of NLR for infection was 6.01, with sensitivity of 70.07% 
and specificity of 71.68%.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that in addition to WBC, CRP, ESR, and PCT, 
NLR should also be used as a beneficial inflammatory indicator to differentiate 
infection in newly diagnosed AAV. Key Points • NLR was a helpful inflammatory 
marker in differentiating infection in newly diagnosed AAV."
1394,"While initial encoding of contextual memories involves the strengthening of 
hippocampal circuits, these memories progressively mature to stabilized forms in 
neocortex and become less hippocampus dependent. Although it has been proposed 
that long-term storage of contextual memories may involve enduring synaptic 
changes in neocortical circuits, synaptic substrates of remote contextual 
memories have been elusive. Here we demonstrate that the consolidation of remote 
contextual fear memories in mice correlated with progressive strengthening of 
excitatory connections between prefrontal cortical (PFC) engram neurons active 
during learning and reactivated during remote memory recall, whereas the 
extinction of remote memories weakened those synapses. This synapse-specific 
plasticity was CREB-dependent and required sustained hippocampal signals, which 
the retrosplenial cortex could convey to PFC. Moreover, PFC engram neurons were 
strongly connected to other PFC neurons recruited during remote memory recall. 
Our study suggests that progressive and synapse-specific strengthening of PFC 
circuits can contribute to long-term storage of contextual memories."
1395,"Patients (pts) with polycythemia vera (PV) suffer from pruritus, night sweats, 
and other symptoms, as well as from thromboembolic complications and progression 
to post-PV myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib (RUX) is approved for second-line therapy 
in high-risk PV pts with hydroxyurea intolerance or resistance. The RuxoBEAT 
trial (NCT02577926, registered on October 1, 2015, at clinicaltrials.gov) is a 
multicenter, open-label, two-arm phase-IIb trial with a target population of 380 
pts with PV or ET, randomized to receive RUX or best available therapy. This 
pre-specified futility analysis assesses the early clinical benefit and 
tolerability of RUX in previously untreated PV pts (6-week cytoreduction was 
allowed). Twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive RUX. Compared 
to baseline, after 6 months of treatment, there was a significant reduction of 
median hematocrit (46 to 41%), the median number of phlebotomies per year (4.0 
to 0), and median patient-reported pruritus scores (2 to 1), and a trend for 
reduced night sweat scores (1.5 to 0). JAK2V617F allele burden, as part of the 
scientific research program, also significantly decreased. One hundred nine 
adverse events (AEs) occurred in 24/28 patients (all grade 1 to 3), and no pt 
permanently discontinued treatment because of AEs. Thus, treatment with 
ruxolitinib in untreated PV pts is feasible, well-tolerated, and efficient 
regarding the above-mentioned endpoints."
1396,"Royal jelly is a gelatinous nutrient secretion produced by the mandibular glands 
of young worker honey bees and has a critical role in honey bee life. In the 
honey bee colonies, queen and worker honey bees have very different morphologies 
and behaviors due to their diet in the larval period, despite having the same 
genome. In comparison, queen bees formed from larvae that feed royal jelly 
exclusively, and worker bees formed from larvae that feed on much less royal 
jelly. DNA methylation has been shown to play a critical role in the development 
of queen and worker honeybees. Alterations in DNA methylation, one of the 
epigenetic mechanisms defined as hereditable nucleotide modifications that occur 
in gene expression without changes in the DNA sequence, are closely related to 
many diseases, especially cancer. Hypermethylation of CpG islands located in the 
promoter regions of genes causes gene silencing and tumor suppressor genes 
epigenetically have silenced in cancer. The inactivation of tumor suppressor 
genes disrupts nearly all cellular pathways in cancer. In contrast to genetic 
alterations, gene silencing by epigenetic modifications may potentially be 
reversed and used in cancer treatment. Royal jelly, which causes epigenetic 
changes in bee colonies, has the potential to cause a change in cancer cells. In 
our study, royal jelly's effects on DNA methyltransferase enzyme and gene 
methylation of RASSF1A tumor suppressor were investigated in human cancer cell 
lines (HeLa, HT29, and A549), and modifications in the gene expression profile 
of royal jelly were determined by next generation sequencing."
1397,"INTRODUCTION: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a form of 
adoptive cell therapy that has demonstrated tremendous results in the treatment 
of hematopoietic malignancies, leading to the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approval of four CD19-targeted CAR-T cell products. With the unprecedented 
success of CAR-T cell therapy in hematological malignancies, hundreds of 
preclinical studies and clinical trials are currently undergoing to explore the 
translation of this treatment to solid tumors. However, the clinical experience 
in non-hematologic malignancies has been less encouraging, with only a few 
patients achieving complete responses. Tumor-associated antigen heterogeneity, 
inefficient CAR-T cell trafficking and the immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment are considered as the most pivotal roadblocks in solid tumor 
CAR-T cell therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the relevant literature/clinical trials for 
CAR-T cell immunotherapy for solid tumors from Pubmed and ClinicalTrials.gov.
CONCLUSION: Herein, we provide an update on solid tumor CAR-T cell clinical 
trials, focusing on the studies with published results. We further discuss some 
of the key hurdles that CAR-T cell therapy is encountering for solid tumor 
treatment as well as the strategies that are exploited to overcome these 
obstacles."
1398,"Papke et al. recently reported a series of twenty-three soft tissue lesions 
chiefly arising in older adults featuring distinct morphological and genetic 
characteristics. Pseudoendocrine sarcoma (PS) is the somewhat descriptive and 
provisional term adopted for the newly reported mesenchymal neoplasm. Since the 
publication of the original paper published in January 2022, a single case of PS 
has been published. Pseudoendocrine sarcoma shows a predilection for the 
paravertebral deep soft tissues of the trunk, low-grade neuroendocrine-like 
histological features, and hallmark CTNNB1 activating mutations.Herein, we will 
discuss a case of a 72-year-old woman presenting with a 4-cm laterocervical 
mass. Hematoxylin and eosin slides showed a multilobular proliferation of 
monomorphic epithelioid cells with speckled chromatin arranged in nests and 
trabeculae. Immunohistochemical staining and molecular analysis were consistent 
with the newly proposed entity."
1399,"Veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) is a 
potentially life-threatening complication of haematopoietic cell transplantation 
(HCT) conditioning. The DEFIFrance post-marketing registry study evaluated 
effectiveness and safety in patients who received defibrotide. It collected 
retrospective/prospective patient data from 53 French HCT centres from July 2014 
to March 2020. Primary endpoints were survival and complete response (CR; total 
serum bilirubin <2 mg/dL, multiorgan failure resolution) at Day 100 post-HCT 
among patients with severe/very severe VOD/SOS. A secondary endpoint was 
evaluation of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) of interest. Of 
798 patients analysed, 251 and 81 received defibrotide treatment for severe/very 
severe VOD/SOS and mild/moderate VOD/SOS post-HCT, respectively; 381 received 
defibrotide for VOD/SOS prophylaxis. In patients with severe/very severe VOD/SOS 
post-HCT, Kaplan-Meier-estimated CR at Day 100 was 74% (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 66%, 81%). At Day 100, 137/251 (55%) were alive and in CR. 
Kaplan-Meier-estimated Day 100 post-HCT survival was 61% (95% CI: 55%, 67%) in 
patients with severe/very severe VOD/SOS. TESAEs of interest occurred in 29% of 
these patients; VOD/SOS-related mortality at 12 months was 15%. DEFIFrance 
represents the largest collection of real-world data on post-registration 
defibrotide use, supporting the real-world utility of defibrotide for patients 
with severe/very severe VOD/SOS post-HCT."
1400,"The essential roles of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a scaffold 
protein in DNA replication and repair are well established, while its cytosolic 
roles are less explored. Two metabolic enzymes, alpha-enolase (ENO1) and 
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), both contain PCNA interacting motifs. 
Mutation of the PCNA interacting motif APIM in ENO1 (F423A) impaired its binding 
to PCNA and resulted in reduced cellular levels of ENO1 protein, reduced growth 
rate, reduced glucose consumption, and reduced activation of AKT. Metabolome and 
signalome analysis reveal large consequences of impairing the direct interaction 
between PCNA and ENO1. Metabolites above ENO1 in glycolysis accumulated while 
lower glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolite pools decreased in the APIM-mutated 
cells; however, their overall energetic status were similar to parental cells. 
Treating haematological cancer cells or activated primary monocytes with a PCNA 
targeting peptide drug containing APIM (ATX-101) also lead to a metabolic shift 
characterized by reduced glycolytic rate. In addition, we show that ATX-101 
treatments reduced the ENO1 - PCNA interaction, the ENO1, GAPDH and 6PGD protein 
levels, as well as the 6PGD activity. Here we report for the first time that 
PCNA acts as a scaffold for metabolic enzymes, and thereby act as a direct 
regulator of primary metabolism."
1401,"Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is a highly conserved protein 
essential for DNA replication, repair and scaffold functions in the cytosol. 
Specific inhibition of PCNA in cancer cells is an attractive anti-cancer 
strategy. ATX-101 is a first-in-class drug targeting PCNA, primarily in cellular 
stress regulation. Multiple in vivo and in vitro investigations demonstrated 
anti-cancer activity of ATX-101 in many tumor types and a potentiating effect on 
the activity of anti-cancer therapies. Healthy cells were less affected. Based 
on preclinical data, a clinical phase 1 study was initiated. Twenty-five 
patients with progressive, late-stage solid tumors were treated with weekly 
ATX-101 infusions at four dose levels (20, 30, 45, 60 mg/m2). ATX-101 showed a 
favorable safety profile supporting that vital cellular functions are not 
compromised in healthy cells. Mild and moderate infusion-related reactions were 
observed in 64% of patients. ATX-101 was quickly cleared from blood with 
elimination half-lives of less than 30 min at all dose levels, probably due to 
both, a quick cell penetration and peptide digestion in serum, as demonstrated 
in vivo. No tumor responses were observed but stable disease was seen in 70% of 
the efficacy population (n = 20). Further studies have been initiated to provide 
evidence of efficacy. Trial registration numbers: ANZCTR 375262 and ANZCTR 
375319."
1402,"The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising worldwide. Here, we 
identified SCNN1B as an outlier down-regulated in CRC and it functions as a 
tumor suppressor. SCNN1B mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in 
primary CRC and CRC cells. In a tissue microarray cohort (N = 153), SCNN1B 
protein was an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcomes in CRC. 
Ectopic expression of SCNN1B in CRC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, 
induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, and suppressed cell migration in 
vitro. Xenograft models validated tumor suppressive function of SCNN1B in vivo. 
Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that SCNN1B 
correlates with KRAS signaling. Consistently, MAPK qPCR and kinase arrays 
revealed that SCNN1B suppressed MAPK signaling. In particular, SCNN1B 
overexpression suppressed p-MEK/p-ERK expression and SRE-mediated transcription 
activities, confirming blockade of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Mechanistically, 
SCNN1B did not affect KRAS activation, instead impairing activation of c-Raf by 
inducing its inhibitory phosphorylation and targeting active c-Raf for 
degradation. The ectopic expression of c-Raf fully rescued cell proliferation 
and colony formation in SCNN1B-overexpressing CRC cells, confirming c-Raf as the 
principal molecular target of SCNN1B. In summary, we identified SCNN1B as a 
tumor suppressor by functioning as a c-Raf antagonist, which in turn suppressed 
oncogenic MEK-ERK signaling."
1403,"The kinase LCK and CD4/CD8 co-receptors are crucial components of the T cell 
antigen receptor (TCR) signaling machinery, leading to key T cell fate 
decisions. Despite decades of research, the roles of CD4-LCK and CD8-LCK 
interactions in TCR triggering in vivo remain unknown. In this study, we created 
animal models expressing endogenous levels of modified LCK to resolve whether 
and how co-receptor-bound LCK drives TCR signaling. We demonstrated that the 
role of LCK depends on the co-receptor to which it is bound. The CD8-bound LCK 
is largely dispensable for antiviral and antitumor activity of cytotoxic T cells 
in mice; however, it facilitates CD8+ T cell responses to suboptimal antigens in 
a kinase-dependent manner. By contrast, the CD4-bound LCK is required for 
efficient development and function of helper T cells via a kinase-independent 
stabilization of surface CD4. Overall, our findings reveal the role of 
co-receptor-bound LCK in T cell biology, show that CD4- and CD8-bound LCK drive 
T cell development and effector immune responses using qualitatively different 
mechanisms and identify the co-receptor-LCK interactions as promising targets 
for immunomodulation."
1404,"Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms is of great significance 
for understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress in various physiological and 
pathological processes. However, the quantification by fluorescence bioimaging 
in living tissues has much stricter requirements than the 'Petri dish'-cultured 
cells in flat plates. Based on the evaluation of the electronic structure and 
steric hindrance-tuned reactivity of phospha-substituted rhodamine with GSH, a 
reversible Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe ZpSiP with a distinct 
performance (Kd = 4.9 mM, t1/2 = 0.57 s, k = 81 M-1 s-1) is developed for real 
time quantifying GSH in living cells. Furthermore, the near-infrared (NIR) probe 
succeeded in sensitively tracking the dynamics of GSH in the real organisms 
bearing tumors, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis for unveiling the 
related pathological processes. We believe that the advance in chemistry with 
quantitative analysis methods will initiate more promising progress and broad 
applications."
1405,"Prevention of neointima formation is the key to improving long-term outcomes 
after stenting or coronary artery bypass grafting. RNA N6 -methyladenosine (m6 
A) methylation has been reported to be involved in the development of various 
cardiovascular diseases, but whether it has a regulatory effect on neointima 
formation is unknown. Herein, we revealed that methyltransferase-like 3 
(METTL3), the major methyltransferase of m6 A methylation, was downregulated 
during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and neointima formation. 
Knockdown of METTL3 facilitated, while overexpression of METTL3 suppressed the 
proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) by arresting HASMCs 
at G2/M checkpoint and the phosphorylation of CDC2 (p-CDC2) was inactivated by 
METTL3. On the other hand, the migration and synthetic phenotype of HASMCs were 
enhanced by METTL3 knockdown, but inhibited by METTL3 overexpression. The 
protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP7 and MMP9 were reduced, 
while the expression level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 was 
increased in HASMCs with METTL3 overexpression. Moreover, METTL3 promoted the 
autophagosome formation by upregulating the expression of ATG5 
(autophagy-related 5) and ATG7. Knockdown of either ATG5 or ATG7 largely 
reversed the regulatory effects of METTL3 overexpression on phenotypic switching 
of HASMCs, as evidenced by increased proliferation and migration, and 
predisposed to synthetic phenotype. These results indicate that METTL3 inhibits 
the phenotypic switching of VSMCs by positively regulating ATG5-mediated and 
ATG7-mediated autophagosome formation. Thus, enhancing the level of RNA m6 A or 
the formation of autophagosomes is the promising strategy to delay neointima 
formation."
1406,"The desire for exploration of cellular functional mechanisms has substantially 
increased the rapid development of artificial cells. However, the construction 
of synthetic cells with high organizational complexity remains challenging due 
to the lack of facile approaches ensuring dynamic multi-compartments of 
cytoplasm and stability of membranes in protocells. Herein, a stable 
coacervate-in-Pickering emulsion protocell model comprising a membraneless 
coacervate phase formed by poly-l-lysine (PLys) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
encapsulated in Pickering emulsion is put forward only through simple one-step 
emulsification. The dynamic distribution of intracellular components 
(coacervates in this protocell model) can be manipulated by changes in 
temperature or pH. This coacervate-in-Pickering emulsion protocell system 
exhibits repeatable cycle stability in response to external stimuli (at least 24 
cycles for temperature and 3 cycles for pH). By encapsulating antagonistic 
enzymes into coacervates, glucose oxidase (GOx) and urease as an example, the 
control of local enzyme concentration is achieved by introducing glucose and 
urea to adjust the pH value in Pickering emulsion droplets. This hybrid 
protocell model with programmatically dynamic microcompartmentation and 
sufficient stability is expected to be further studied and applied in cellular 
biology, facilitating the development of lifelike systems with potential in 
practical applications."
1407,"Immunogenic carrier proteins such as the non-toxic diphtheria toxin variant, 
cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197), are widely used in subunit vaccine 
formulations to boost immunogenicity of chemically conjugated antigens. 
Conjugate vaccines are inherently expensive due to laborious manufacturing 
steps. Here, this work develops a particulate vaccine platform based on using 
engineered Escherichia coli to assemble CRM197-antigen fusion proteins into 
discrete submicron-sized particles. This approach enables precise loading of 
diverse antigens and epitopes enhancing their immunogenicity. A cost-effective, 
high-yield, and scalable biomanufacturing process is developed. Purified 
particulate CRM197-antigen vaccines are ambient-temperature stable. CRM197 
particles incorporating pathogen-specific antigens or epitopes from SARS-CoV-2, 
Streptococcus pyogenes (group A), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis induced 
cell-mediated and humoral immune responses mediating protective immunity in 
respective animal models of infection. The CRM197 particle vaccine platform is 
versatile, enabling co-delivery of selected antigens/epitopes together with 
immunogenic CRM197 as discrete stable particles avoiding laborious manufacture 
of soluble CRM197 and antigen followed by chemical conjugation."
1408,"Oxidative stress is a cause for numerous diseases and aging processes. Thus, one 
is keen to tune the level of intracellular stress and to learn from that. An 
unusual approach is presented here. The methodology involves multifunctional 
surfactants. Although their molecular design is non-biological, a fullerenol 
head group attached covalently to pi-conjugated dyes, the surfactants possess 
superior biocompatibility. Using an intrinsic fluorescence signal as a probe we 
show that the amphiphiles becomes incorporated into the Caco-2 cells. There, 
they are able to exhibit additional functions. The compound reduces cellular 
stress in dark reaction pathways. The antagonistic property is activated under 
irradiation, the photocatalytic production of ROS, resulting in cell damage. The 
feature is activated even by NIR-light via a two-photon process. The properties 
as molecular semiconductors leads to a trojan horse situation and allows 
programming the spatial distribution of cytotoxicity. This article is protected

1409,"The innate inverse Auger effect within bulk silicon can result in multiple 
carrier generation. Observation of this effect is reliant upon low high-energy 
photon reflectance and high-quality surface passivation. In the photovoltaics 
industry, metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) to afford black silicon (b-Si) 
can provide a low high-energy photon reflectance. However, an industrially 
feasible and cheaper technology to conformally passivate the outer-shell defects 
of these nanowires is currently lacking. Here, a technology is introduced to 
infiltrate black silicon nanopores with a simple and vacuum-free organic 
passivation layer that affords millisecond-level minority carrier lifetimes and 
matches perfectly with existing solution-based processing of the MACE black 
silicon. Advancements such as the demonstration of an excellent passivation 
effect whilst also being low reflectance provide a new technological route for 
inverse Auger multiple carrier generation and an industrially feasible technical 
scheme for the development of the MACE b-Si solar cells."
1410,"Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion hybrid capacitors (ZHCs) have aroused 
unprecedented attention because of their high safety, cost effectiveness, and 
environmental compatibility. However, the intractable issues of dendrite growth 
and side reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface deteriorate durability 
and reversibility of Zn anodes, deeply encumbering the large-scale application 
of ZHCs. Concerning these obstacles, a negatively charged carboxylated 
chitosan-intensified hydrogel electrolyte (CGPPHE) with cross-linked networks is 
reported to stabilize Zn anodes. Beyond possessing good mechanical 
characteristics, the CGPPHE with polar groups can reduce the desolvation energy 
barrier of hydrated Zn2+ , constrain the 2D Zn2+ diffusion, and uniformize 
electric field and Zn2+ flux distributions, assuring dendrite-free Zn deposition 
with high plating-stripping efficiency. Concurrently, the hydrophilic CGPPHE 
alleviates harmful hydrogen evolution and corrosion by abating water activity. 
Accordingly, Zn|CGPPHE|Zn and Zn|CGPPHE|Cu cells exhibit an extended life 
exceeding 350 h (1600 mAh cm-2 cumulative capacity under 20 mA cm-2 ) and a high 
average coulombic efficiency of 98.2%, respectively. The resultant flexible ZHCs 
with CGPPHE and template-regulated carbon cathode present perfect properties in 
capacity retention (97.7% over 10 000 cycles), energy density (91.8 Wh kg-1 ), 
and good mechanical adaptability. This study provides insight into developing 
novel hydrogel electrolytes toward highly rechargeable and stable ZHCs."
1411,"As the emerging modalities for tumor therapy, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and 
chemodynamic therapy (CDT) can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), typically 
inducing tumor cell apoptosis. However, the construction of more efficient 
sonosensitizers integrated with excellent Fenton/Fenton-like catalytic activity 
to improve the synergistic therapeutic effect of SDT and CDT is still highly 
challenging. In this study, 2D semiconductor FePS3 nanosheets (NSs), as one of 
the metal phosphorus trichalcogenides for both sonosensitizer and Fenton 
catalyst, are successfully synthesized via an ultrasonic-assisted liquid phase 
exfoliation method from bulk FePS3 and further modified with lipoic 
acid-polyethylene glycol (LA-PEG) to obtain FePS3 -PEG NSs with desirable 
biocompatibility. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the 
engineered FePS3 -PEG NSs induce the combinatorial SDT/CDT effect attributing to 
the enhanced ROS generation and significant glutathione depletion, which can 
conduct highly efficient and safe tumor inhibition and prolong the life span of 
tumor-bearing mice. This work provides the paradigm of semiconductor FePS3 NSs 
as the integrative sonosensitizer/Fenton nanocatalyst for dual nanodynamic tumor 
therapy, paving the new way for exploring other 2D metal phosphorus 
trichalcogenides in biomedicine."
1412,"Cerebral microvascular disease (MVD) is an important cause of vascular cognitive 
impairment. MVD is heterogeneous in aetiology, ranging from universal ageing to 
the sporadic (hypertension, sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and 
chronic kidney disease) and the genetic (e.g., familial CAA, cerebral autosomal 
dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy 
(CADASIL), and cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical 
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL)). The brain parenchymal consequences 
of MVD predominantly consist of lacunar infarcts (lacunes), microinfarcts, white 
matter disease of ageing, and microhaemorrhages. MVD is characterized by 
substantial arteriolar neuropathology involving ubiquitous vascular smooth 
muscle cell (SMC) abnormalities. Cerebral MVD is characterized by a wide variety 
of arteriolar injuries but only a limited number of parenchymal manifestations. 
We reason that the cerebral arteriole plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis 
of each type of MVD. Perturbations in signalling and function (i.e., changes in 
proliferation, apoptosis, phenotypic switch, and migration of SMC) are prominent 
in the pathogenesis of cerebral MVD, making ""cerebral angiomyopathy"" an 
appropriate term to describe the spectrum of pathologic abnormalities. The 
evidence suggests the cerebral arteriole acts as both source and mediator of 
parenchymal injury in MVD."
1413,"Sodium-based dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) have become a new type of energy storage 
device with great application value because of their high operating voltage, 
high energy density, and low cost. However, transition-metal dichalcogenide 
(TMD) anodes show unsatisfactory Na+ electrochemical performance owing to the 
low intrinsic conductivity and inferior ion transport kinetics. Here, an 
elaborate design is developed to prepare a composite of WSSe nanosheets 
supported on a 3D cross-networked porous carbon skeleton (WSSe@CPCS), which 
possesses en-rich anion vacancies and WSSe with expanded inter-layer spacing, as 
well as an interconnected porous structure. As a result, the WSSe@CPCS anode for 
sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) exhibits preeminent reversible capacities, excellent 
cycle stability, and superior rate capability. The systematic electrochemical 
kinetic analysis and density functional theory results further show that the 
effect of anion vacancies and CPCS synergistically enhances the conductivity and 
reduces charge transfer resistance, thus making a great contribution to fast 
reaction kinetics. Finally, the implementations of the WSSe@CPCS anode in 
progressive SIB and DIB full-cell configurations exhibit satisfactory 
performance, which reveals their widely practical application. This research 
will provide an exciting approach to designing advanced defect-structured 
tungsten-based TMD materials for SIBs, DIBs, and even a broad range of energy 
storage."
1414,"Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic sites for most excitatory glutamatergic 
synapses. We previously demonstrated a severe spine loss and synaptic 
reorganization in human neocortices presenting Type II focal cortical dysplasia 
(FCD), a developmental malformation and frequent cause of drug-resistant focal 
epilepsy. We extend the findings, investigating the potential role of complement 
components C1q and C3 in synaptic pruning imbalance. Data from Type II FCD were 
compared with those obtained in focal epilepsies with different etiologies. 
Neocortical tissues were collected from 20 subjects, mainly adults with a mean 
age at surgery of 31 years, admitted to epilepsy surgery with a 
neuropathological diagnosis of: cryptogenic, temporal lobe epilepsy with 
hippocampal sclerosis, and Type IIa/b FCD. Dendritic spine density quantitation, 
evaluated in a previous paper using Golgi impregnation, was available in a 
subgroup. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, and 
organotypic cultures were utilized to study complement/microglial activation 
patterns. FCD Type II samples presenting dendritic spine loss were characterized 
by an activation of the classical complement pathway and microglial reactivity. 
In the same samples, a close relationship between microglial cells and dendritic 
segments/synapses was found. These features were consistently observed in Type 
IIb FCD and in 1 of 3 Type IIa cases. In other patient groups and in 
perilesional areas outside the dysplasia, not presenting spine loss, these 
features were not observed. In vitro treatment with complement proteins of 
organotypic slices of cortical tissue with no sign of FCD induced a reduction in 
dendritic spine density. These data suggest that dysregulation of the complement 
system plays a role in microglia-mediated spine loss. This mechanism, known to 
be involved in the removal of redundant synapses during development, is likely 
reactivated in Type II FCD, particularly in Type IIb; local treatment with 
anticomplement drugs could in principle modify the course of disease in these 
patients."
1415,"The current report describes the chemical investigation and biological activity 
of extracts produced by three fungal strains Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium 
simplicissimum, and Fusarium proliferatum isolated from the roots of Piper 
nigrum L. growing in Vietnam. These fungi were namely determined by 
morphological and DNA analyses. GC-MS identification revealed that the EtOAc 
extracts of these fungi were associated with the presence of saturated and 
unsaturated fatty acids. These EtOAc extracts showed cytotoxicity towards cancer 
cell line HepG2, inhibited various microbacterial organisms, especially fungus 
Aspergillus niger and yeast Candida albicans (the MIC values of 50-100 µg/mL). 
In α-glucosidase inhibitory assay, they induced the IC50 values of 1.00-2.53 
µg/mL were better than positive control acarbose (169.80 µg/mL). The EtOAc 
extract of F. oxysporum also showed strong anti-inflammatory activity against NO 
production and PGE-2 level. Four major compounds linoleic acid (37.346%), oleic 
acid (27.520%), palmitic acid (25.547%), and stearic acid (7.030%) from the 
EtOAc extract of F. oxysporum were selective in molecular docking study, by 
which linoleic and oleic acids showed higher binding affinity towards 
α-glucosidase than palmitic and stearic acids. In subsequent docking assay with 
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic 
acid could be moderate inhibitors."
1416,"As an emerging therapeutic strategy, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) 
have been proven to be superior to traditional drugs in many aspects. However, 
due to their unique mechanism of action, the existing degradation evaluation 
methods still have many limitations, which seriously restrict the development of 
PROTACs. In this methodological study, by using direct stochastic optical 
reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) based single-cell protein quantitative 
analysis, we systematically investigated the dynamic degradation characteristics 
of FLT3 protein during PROTACs treatment. We found that the distribution of FLT3 
varies between FLT3-ITD mutation and FLT3-WT cells. PROTACs had an obvious 
time-course effect on protein degradation and present two distinct phases, which 
provided a basis for deciding when to evaluate protein degradation. Compared 
with long-time administration, high concentration PROTACs had a better 
effectiveness because it achieved a higher Dmax. Two-color dSTORM-based 
colocalization analysis efficiently detected the proportion of ternary 
complexes, making it very useful in screening PROTACs. Taken together, our 
findings verify that dSTORM method is an ideal tool for evaluating PROTACs and 
it will accelerate the development of new PROTACs."
1417,"BACKGROUND: Salvage transplant has been historically considered effective 
therapy for myeloma patients relapsing after first transplant, if they achieved 
adequate remission duration. However, the efficacy of novel agent combinations 
has called this paradigm into question.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis in a homogeneously 
treated cohort of 106 patients undergoing ASCT2 at our institution, all of whom 
received novel agent-based chemotherapy (immunomodulatory agent [IMiD] and/or 
proteasome inhibitor [PI]) for both induction and relapse. As an exploratory 
objective we assessed whether predictive thresholds of progression free survival 
post first transplant (ASCT1) for benefit post ASCT2 vary with use of IMiD 
maintenance post ASCT1.
RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) was 98% post-ASCT2 and 
treatment-related mortality (TRM) was low at 1.8%. With a median follow-up of 26 
months (range 0.5-85) from ASCT2, median overall survival (OS) is estimated at 
80 months (95% CI: ≥ 49-months) and median progression-free survival after ASCT2 
(PFS2) at 24 months (95% CI 19-39). PFS post first transplant (PFS1) at >/= 50 
months was associated with improved OS. Predictors of PFS2 included PFS1 ≤42 
months and progression on IMiD-based maintenance post- ASCT1.
CONCLUSION: ASCT2 continues to offer acceptable outcomes for most patients 
treated within modern day treatment paradigms, with longer PFS after ASCT1 and 
IMiD non-refractory disease being associated with improved outcomes."
1418,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are standard of care in advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all patients benefit, even 
among PD-L1 tumor proportional score (TPS) ≥50%, indicating an unmet need for 
additional biomarkers such as those assessing the tumor immune microenvironment 
(TIME). DetermaIO is a 27-gene assay that classifies TIME and has previously 
demonstrated association with ICI response.
METHODS: FFPE samples were selected from BC Cancer and West Clinic Cancer Center 
patients with performance status (PS) ≤2 who received at least 2 cycles of ICI 
monotherapy in the first (1L) or second line (2L). IO scores were generated and 
analyzed for association with PFS and OS.
RESULTS: In the entire cohort (N=147), IO score was significantly associated 
with OS (HR=0.68, 95%CI 0.47-0.99, P = .042) and PFS (HR=0.62, 95%CI 0.43-0.88, 
P = .0069). In 1L treated patients (PD-L1≥50%, N=78), IO score was significantly 
associated with PFS (HR=0.55, 95%CI 0.32-0.94, P = .028). In exploratory 
analyses, IO score was associated with benefit in 1L PS2 patients for OS 
(HR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.091-0.74, P = .012) and PFS (HR = 0.27, 95%CI 0.098-0.72, 
P = .0095) which was confirmed in PFS subgroup analysis in the independent West 
Cancer Center study (N=13 HR=0.14, 95%CI 0.027-0.76, P = .023).
CONCLUSION: These data confirm the association of DetermaIO with ICI clinical 
benefit in NSCLC, and expand on previous studies by demonstrating that first 
line treated PD-L1≥50% patients can further be stratified by IO score to 
identify efficacy. Exploratory analysis suggested that the IO score identifies 
benefit in patients with poor PS."
1419,"Global efforts are underway to eliminate measles and rubella, and active viral 
surveillance is the key to achieving this goal. In addition, the World Health 
Organization announced guidelines for handling materials potentially infectious

eradication. To support global efforts, we established new PV-non-susceptible 
cell lines that are useful for the isolation of measles virus (MeV) and rubella

1420,"Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that median preoptic (MnPO) 
neurons are necessary for the full hypertensive response to chronic angiotensin 
II (AngII) in rats consuming a high salt diet. The MnPO is implicated in many of 
the physiologic actions of AngII, primarily acting as a downstream nucleus to 
AngII binding at circumventricular organs such as the organum vasculosum of the 
lamina terminalis (OVLT). We have previously shown a prominent effect of lesion 
of the OVLT on the chronic hypertensive effects of AngII in rats consuming high 
salt. Additionally, we have shown that lesion of the MnPO attenuated the 
hypertensive response to chronic intravenous infusion of AngII in rats. However, 
whether MnPO neurons or fibers of passage contribute to this response is not 
clear. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either sham (SHAM; 
n = 8) or ibotenic acid lesion of the MnPO (MnPOx; n = 6). In the MnPOx group, 
200 nl of ibotenic acid in phosphate buffer saline (5 μg/μl) was injected into 
each of 3 predetermined coordinates targeted at the entire MnPO. After a week of 
recovery, rats were instrumented with radiotelemetric pressure transducers, 
provided 2.0% NaCl diet and distilled water ad libitum and given another week to 
recover. After 3 days of baseline measurements, osmotic minipumps were implanted 
subcutaneously in all rats for administration of AngII at a rate of 
150 ng/kg/min. Blood pressure measurements were made for 14 days after minipump 
implantation. By day 7 of AngII treatment, blood pressure responses appeared to 
plateau in both groups while the hypertensive response was markedly attenuated 
in MnPOx rats (MnPOx, 122 ± 6 mmHg; SHAM, 143 ± 8 mmHg). These results support 
the hypothesis that neurons of the MnPO are involved in the central pathway 
mediating the chronic hypertensive effects of AngII in rats consuming a high 
salt diet."
1421,"This paper is aimed at identifying by means of micro-CT the microstructural 
differences between normal and degenerative mitral marginal chordae tendineae. 
The control group is composed of 21 normal chords excised from 14 normal mitral 
valves from heart transplant recipients. The experimental group comprises 22 
degenerative fibroelastic chords obtained at surgery from 11 pathological valves 
after mitral repair or replacement. In the control group the superficial 
endothelial cells and spongiosa layer remained intact, covering the wavy core 
collagen. In contrast, in the experimental group the collagen fibers were 
arranged as straightened thick bundles in a parallel configuration. 100 
cross-sections were examined by micro-CT from each chord. Each image was 
randomized through the K-means machine learning algorithm and then, the global 
and local Shannon entropies were obtained. The optimum number of clusters, K, 
was estimated to maximize the differences between normal and degenerative chords 
in global and local Shannon entropy; the p-value after a nested ANOVA test was 
chosen as the parameter to be minimized. Optimum results were obtained with 
global Shannon entropy and 2≤K≤7, providing p < 0.01; for K=3, p = 2.86·10-3. 
These findings open the door to novel perioperative diagnostic methods in order 
to avoid or reduce postoperative mitral valve regurgitation recurrences."
1422,"Fungal polysaccharides possess a broad biological activity, including cytotoxic 
and antioxidant activities. This work aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic and 
antioxidant activity of the acidic polysaccharides of Phylloporia boldo strain 
(named PBAP40). Cytotoxic activity of polysaccharide was evaluated determining 
the viability of three tumor cell lines by MTT assay. The effect of acidic 
polysaccharide on the cell cycle of HL-60 cell line was evaluated by flow 
cytometry, and the antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH and ABTS assays. 
PBAP40 showed cytotoxic effects in tumor cell lines. Results suggest that P. 
boldo acidic polysaccharides arrested tumor cells in the cell cycle Sub G1 
phase. The acidic polysaccharides of PBAP40 strain were not cytotoxic for the 
non-tumor cell line. PBAP40 also showed excellent antioxidant activity. The 
FT-IR analysis of the acidic polysaccharides indicated the presence of glucans 
bearing α- and β- type glycosidic bonds."
1423,"OBJECTIVE: High mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) has been increasingly 
acknowledged to be significantly expressed in malignant tumors. However, it has 
been discovered to serve as a pro-inflammatory factor in several diseases. This 
study aimed to investigate the involvement of HMGA2 in septic lung injury.
METHODS: Human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells were subjected to 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to construct models. The effects of HMGA2 knockdown on 
cell viability, inflammation, and apoptosis were evaluated. Following the 
verification of the association between HMGA2 and Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 
(EZH2), the impacts of EZH2 on HMGA2 regulation were determined.
RESULTS: The levels of HMGA2 in the LPS-treated cells were all significantly 
elevated. HMGA2 knockdown alleviated damage caused by LPS in cellular viability, 
and reduced inflammation and apoptosis. Whereas EZH2 overexpression reversed the 
impacts of HMGA2 knockdown on these aspects, indicating EZH2 participated in the 
regulation of HMGA2 on cells.
CONCLUSION: HMGA2 could synergize with EZH2 to induce lung epithelial cell 
destruction in septic lung injury. Herein, targets for treatment have been 
investigated, which involves suppressing pro-inflammatory factors to reduce the 
body's inflammatory response."
1424,"OBJECTIVE: To assess accuracy of whole slide imaging (WSI) in the interpretation 
of permanent and frozen sections in surgical pathology and the identification of 
tumors in cutaneous en face frozen sections.
METHODS: Twenty glass slides containing cutaneous en face frozen sections were 
selected from twenty cases of keratinocyte carcinomas treated with Mohs 
micrographic surgery. Ten slides contained tumor and ten did not. A blinded 
dermatologic surgeon used traditional light microscopy (LM) to assess physical 
slides for tumor presence and type, while noting the confidence (scale 1-10) and 
time (min) in making the determination. After a seven-day washout period, the 
surgeon repeated this process using WSI of the same slides, each de-identified 
and scanned at 20x using the Aperio AT2 (Leica Biosystems).
RESULTS: Percent agreement between LM and WSI was 100%, with Cohen's kappa of 
1.0. The average time taken to determine tumor presence was significantly 
greater using WSI than LM. Similarly, the surgeon was significantly more 
confident using LM than WSI.
CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study suggests that diagnostic concordance is 
excellent between LM and WSI in the evaluation of Mohs frozen sections. However, 
WSI was cumbersome to use, not ergonomic, and required significantly more time."
1425,"OBJECTIVE: Shc SH2 domain-binding protein (SHCBP1) is involved in regulating 
tumour progression in a variety of tumour types. The aim of this study was to 
analyze the prognostic landscape of SHCBP1 in pan-cancer and investigate the 
relationship between SHCBP1 expression and tumour immune microenvironment.
METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and genotype tissue expression (GTEx) 
database were used for obtaining the required data for the evaluation of SHCBP1 
expression. The clinical characteristics and prognostic role of SHCBP1 were 
analyzed by using TCGA cohort. This was followed by gene set enrichment analysis 
by R software. Based on TCGA pan-cancer data, the correlation between SHCBP1 
expression and immune infiltration, immune-related genes, microsatellite 
instability (MSI), and tumour mutational burden (TMB) was discussed. Finally, 
the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 192 anti-cancer drugs 
were obtained from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database 
and their correlation with SHCBP1 was analyzed.
RESULTS: SHCBP1 was upregulated in most tumours showing a significant 
association with poor prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed SHCBP1 
relation to the immunity, cell cycle, and cancer pathway in various types of 
tumour. SHCBP1 expression also showed a positive correlation with 
tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and immunosuppressive genes including 
TGFBR1, PD-L1 and TGFB1 and so on. In addition, high expression of SHCBP1 in 
patients was associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumour drugs.
CONCLUSION: The present study confirms SHCBP1 as a poor prognostic marker of 
cancers. Its high expression is suggested to be involved in immunological 
resistance to a variety of anti-tumour drugs."
1426,"OBJECTIVE: The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) colorectal neoplasia differentially 
expressed (CRNDE) is considered a carcinogenic promoter in various human 
malignancies. However, the role and underlying mechanism of action of CRNDE 
during carcinogenesis in neuroblastoma remain unknown.
METHODS: CRNDE transcript levels were detected in neuroblastoma tissues and 
adjacent normal tissues. The effects of CRNDE overexpression and knockdown on 
the viability of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells were determined using the Cell 
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the role 
of CRNDE in apoptosis and the cell cycle in neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, the 
transwell assay was used to evaluate the role of CRNDE in the migration and 
invasion of tumor cells. The levels of ERK/MAPK pathway-related proteins were 
evaluated using western blotting. The in vivo role of CRNDE in tumor growth and 
apoptosis was evaluated in a xenograft mouse model of human neuroblastoma.
RESULTS: The relative expression of CRNDE was significantly higher in 
neuroblastoma tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, knockdown 
of CRNDE inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle 
arrest, whereas elevation of CRNDE promoted cell growth and inhibited apoptosis 
in neuroblastoma cells. In addition, depletion of CRNDE suppressed migration and 
invasion, whereas overexpression of CRNDE enhanced the migratory and invasive 
potential of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells. At the mechanistic level, western 
blotting showed that CRNDE exerted its oncogenic role by affecting the ERK/MAPK 
signaling pathway. Furthermore, animal experiments confirmed that CRNDE promotes 
tumor growth and inhibits apoptosis in neuroblastoma in vivo.
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that CRNDE plays a critical role in the 
proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of neuroblastoma by altering 
the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, representing a novel molecular target for the 
treatment of neuroblastoma."
1427,"OBJECTIVE: Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), which refers to the occurrence 
of ovarian insufficiency before the age of 40, is indicated by menstrual cycle 
changes as a precursor and is accompanied by menstrual disorders, elevated 
gonadotropin levels, and decreased estrogen levels. The incidence of POI is 
reportedly increasing worldwide and this disease markedly reduces the quality of 
life and affects the physical and mental health of patients. Treatment options 
for POI include hormone replacement therapy; however, its efficacy remains 
unsatisfactory. Therefore, exploring hormonal drugs with superior curative 
effects and clarifying the molecular mechanism underlying POI pathogenesis could 
afford new directions for POI therapy.
METHODS: 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and 
lactate dehydrogenase assays were used to detect the effects of melatonin (MT) 
on cell survival and mortality. Flow cytometry was performed to examine the 
effect of MT on apoptosis. The impact of MT on autophagosome formation was 
examined using electron microscopy, whereas the expression of autophagy-related 
proteins and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway-related proteins following MT intervention was detected 
by western blotting.
RESULTS: (1) MT exerted a protective effect on ovarian granulosa cells subjected 
to serum starvation. (2) MT inhibited serum starvation-induced apoptosis of 
ovarian granulosa cells. (3) MT inhibited serum starvation-induced autophagosome 
formation in ovarian granulosa cells. (4) MT inhibited the expression of 
autophagy-related proteins LC3II/I and Agt5. (5) MT suppressed autophagy in 
ovarian granulosa cells by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results demonstrate that MT can inhibit excessive 
autophagy in ovarian granulosa cells by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, 
thereby exerting its protective effect against POI."
1428,"OBJECTIVE: We intended to study the specific function of microRNA-126-5p 
(miR-126-5p) in myocardial infarction (MI) and its underlying mechanisms of 
action in hypoxia-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
METHODS: Expression of miR-126-5p and its target gene homeodomain interacting 
protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) was evaluated by Reverse transcription quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Flow 
cytometry and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays were used to observe cell 
apoptosis and viability. Luciferase reporter gene assay was prepared for 
verifying the regulatory relationship between miR-126-5p and HIPK2. The levels 
of oxidative stress biomarkers (SOD, ROS, and MDA) were determined using 
commercial assay kits. The inflammatory response in the cells was analyzed by 
ELISA.
RESULTS: MiR-126-5p expression upregulated in hypoxia-treated HUVECs compared to 
the untreated-HUVECs. Importantly, miR-126-5p knockdown suppressed 
hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis in HUVECs. In addition, the hypoxia-induced 
oxidative stress and inflammatory response were also significantly inhibited by 
miR-126-5p knockdown in HUVECs. Mechanically, miR-126-5p targets HIPK2. In 
rescue assay, HIPK2 knockdown reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-126-5p 
knockdown on hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory 
response in hypoxia-treated HUVECs.
CONCLUSION: MiR-126-5p targeted by HIPK2 regulates hypoxia induced endothelial 
injury in HUVECs, which indicated that miR-126-5p may be a molecular target for 
MI treatment."
1429,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regulatory effect and mechanism of 
methyltransferase-like protein 3 (METTL3)-mediated N6-methyladenosine 
methylation (m6A) on forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) levels and the proportion of 
regulatory T (Treg) cells in the peripheral blood of patients with asthma.
METHODS: Flow cytometry and ELISA were used to detect the differences in the 
proportions of Treg cells and serum interleukins (ILs) 4 and 7, respectively, in 
the peripheral blood between healthy individuals and patients with different 
asthma conditions. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western 
blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels, 
respectively, of METTL3 and Foxp3 in CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood 
samples of different groups. M6A blot and m6A coimmunoprecipitation-PCR were 
used to detect the global and Foxp3 mRNA m6A levels, respectively, in the 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells collected from the peripheral blood 
of patients with asthma were subjected to in vitro transfection to knockdown the 
METTL3 levels and observe changes in the Foxp3 mRNA, protein, m6A levels, and 
RNA stability. Flow cytometry and ELISA were used to detect the changes in the 
Treg cell proportion and IL-4 and IL-17 levels in the cell culture supernatant.
RESULTS: Compared with the healthy individuals, the ratio of Treg cells to 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells was significantly decreased and the Foxp3 mRNA and 
protein expression was downregulated in patients with asthma with disease 
progression. The Foxp3 mRNA and protein expression levels were positively 
correlated with the Treg cell proportion and negatively correlated with IL-17 
expression. The global and Foxp3 mRNA m6A levels were increased in the 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of patients with asthma. METTL3 expression was 
significantly higher in the peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of patients with 
asthma compared with healthy individuals. After METTL3 knockdown, the Foxp3 mRNA 
m6A level was reduced, and the stability of Foxp3 mRNA and protein expression 
was increased. YTHDF2 could bind to the m6A site in 3'UTR of Foxp3 mRNA. 
Knockdown of YTHDF2 regulated the level and stability of Foxp3 mRNA. METTL3 
knockdown reduced the ratio of Treg cells to CD4+ T cells and the IL-4 and IL-17 
secretion levels from CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with 
asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: High METTL3 expression in the peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of 
patients with asthma increased the m6A level and reduced the stability of Foxp3 
mRNA in a YTHDF2-dependent way, thereby reducing the expression of Foxp3 and the 
proportion of Treg cells."
1430,"OBJECTIVE: Chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells 
(BMSCs) plays an important role in osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Studies have 
reported the association of transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGF-β3) with 
chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In this study, the upstream mechanism and 
functions of TGF-β3 in chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs were explored.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometry was performed for the positive and negative 
MSC markers. Chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs was evaluated by Alcian blue 
staining. Gene expression and protein expression levels were measured by RT-qPCR 
and western blotting, respectively. Relationship between let-7a-3p and TGF-β3 
was confirmed using bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter and RNA 
pulldown assays. Subcellular distributions of TGF-β3 and let-7a-3p were 
determined by FISH. In this study, BMSCs were identified to possess the 
characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells. TGF-β3 was found to induce 
chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Mechanically, TGF-β3 was verified to be 
targeted by let-7a-3p. In rescue assays, let-7a-3p overexpression reversed the 
effects of TGF-β3 overexpression on chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs.
CONCLUSION: Let-7a-3p inhibits chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow 
mesenchymal stem cells by targeting TGF-β3."
1431,"OBJECTIVE: Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers are the most often 
diagnosed subtype of breast tumors, in which the development of tamoxifen 
resistance remains a major impediment. The effect of long non-coding RNA 
(lncRNA) on therapy resistance is beginning to emerge. The lncRNA 91H, a 
recently identified lncRNA involved in tumorigenesis, is also overexpressed in 
breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of 91H in the 
biological function and tamoxifen resistance of ER+ breast cancer cells.
METHODS: MCF-7 and T47D cells were transfected for 91H silence. CCK-8 assay was 
performed to examine cell viability and drug sensitivity. Cell cycle and 
apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Cell migration capacity was 
determined by wound healing assay. The protein level was analyzed by Western 
blotting.
RESULTS: MCF-7 and T47D cells with 91H knockdown exhibited lower capacities of 
cell proliferation and migration. In addition, knockdown of 91H resulted in 
significantly increased sensitivity to tamoxifen and a higher ratio of apoptosis 
induced by tamoxifen. Furthermore, the protein level of p-mTOR was notably 
inhibited through downregulating 91H expression. And the mTOR inhibitor together 
with tamoxifen presented synergistic effect on the inhibition of cell viability.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that 91H might serve as a potential target for 
ER+ breast cancer patients who have acquired tamoxifen resistance."
1432,"OBJECTIVE: Influenza pandemic of the human lung was caused by the Influenza A 
(H1N1) over 100 years ago in 1918, but it recurred in pandemic fashion in 2009. 
Understanding the pathobiology of this infectious agent in the human lung could 
lead to adjuvant therapies that are relatively non-toxic and reduce the 
mortality of the human host. Overall, our objective was to apply 
morphoproteomics to pulmonary lung sections from an autopsied victim so that we 
may better define its biology from the perspective of its interaction with the 
host and provide options for therapeutic targets.
METHODS: Morphoproteomic analysis from a case study of this Influenza A (H1N1) 
pulmonary infection included immunohistochemical probes to detect the 
expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS), CD163+ (M2 polarized 
monocytes/macrophages), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression as part 
of the host response to interaction with the Influenza A (H1N1) virus.
RESULTS: Representative sections of the Influenza A (H1N1) victim's lung showed: 
cytoplasmic expression of FAS in most of the sloughed and atypical alveolar 
pneumocytes; abundance of intra-alveolar and alveolar interstitial CD163+ 
macrophages/monocytes; and PD-L1 expression on occasional macrophages, and 
focally on collections of alveolar pneumocytes and the alveolar interstitium.
CONCLUSION: Morphoproteomics and microanatomical features coincide with the 
etiopathogenic features of pulmonary Influenza A (H1N1) infection and the host 
response. This plus data mining of the medical literature suggests that 
adjunctive, targeted therapy such as metformin and vitamin D3 could address the 
biology of Influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia, enhance the host immune response, and 
prevent its progression to a life-threatening, ventilator-dependent clinical 
situation."
1433,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative 
option for patients with hematological disorders and bone marrow failure 
syndromes. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity 
post-transplant. Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapies are efficacious in 
ameliorating GVHD but limited by variable suppressive capacities and the need 
for a high therapeutic dose. Here, we sought to expand Treg in vivo by 
expressing an orthogonal IL-2Rβ receptor (oIL2Rβ) that would selectively 
interact with orthogonal IL-2 (oIL2) cytokine and not wildtype IL2. To test 
whether the orthogonal system would preferentially drive donor Treg expansion, 
we used a murine MHC-disparate GVHD model of lethally irradiated BALB/c mice 
given T-cell depleted bone marrow from C57BL/6 (B6) mice alone, or together with 
B6Foxp3+GFP+ Treg or oIL2Rβ transduced Treg at low cell numbers that typically 
do not control GVHD with WT Treg. On day 2, B6 Tcons were injected to induce 
GVHD. Recipients were treated with PBS or oIL2 daily for 14 days, then 3 times 
weekly for an additional 14 days. Mice treated with oIL2Rβ Treg and oIL2 
compared to PBS had enhanced GVHD survival, in vivo selective expansion of 
Tregs, and greater suppression of Tcon expansion in secondary lymphoid organs, 
and intestines. Importantly, oIL2Rβ Treg maintained graft-versus-tumor (GVT) 
responses in two distinct tumor models (A20, MLL-AF9). These data demonstrate a 
novel approach to enhance the efficacy of Treg cell therapy in allo-HSCT using 
an oIL2/oIL2Rβ system that allows for selective in vivo expansion of Treg 
leading to GVHD protection and GVT maintenance."
1434,"Children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) with relapsed/refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) without complete metabolic response (CMR) 
before autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) have poor 
survival outcomes. CheckMate 744, a phase 2 study for CAYA (aged 5-30 years) 
with relapsed/refractory cHL, evaluated a risk-stratified, response-adapted 
approach with nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin (BV) followed by BV plus 
bendamustine for patients with suboptimal response. Risk stratification was 
primarily based on time to relapse, prior treatment, and presence of B symptoms. 
We present the primary analysis of the standard-risk cohort. Data from the 
low-risk cohort are reported separately. Patients received 4 induction cycles 
with nivolumab plus BV; those without CMR (Deauville score >3, Lugano 2014) 
received BV plus bendamustine intensification. Patients with CMR after induction 
or intensification proceeded to consolidation (high-dose chemotherapy/auto-HCT 
per protocol). Primary endpoint was CMR any time before consolidation. 
Forty-four patients were treated. Median age was 16 years. At a minimum 
follow-up of 15.6 months, 43 patients received 4 induction cycles (1 
discontinued); 11 of whom received intensification, 32 proceeded to 
consolidation. CMR rate was 59% after induction with nivolumab plus BV, and 94% 
any time before consolidation (nivolumab plus BV ± BV plus bendamustine). 
One-year PFS rate was 91%. During induction, 18% of patients experienced grade 
3/4 treatment-related adverse events. This risk-stratified, response-adapted 
salvage strategy had high CMR rates with limited toxicities in CAYA with 
relapsed/refractory cHL. Most patients did not require additional chemotherapy 
(bendamustine intensification). Additional follow-up is needed to confirm 
durability of disease control. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02927769."
1435,"Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are two 
uncommon haematologic autoimmune conditions that can rarely arise secondary to 
vaccination. Prior studies using the US Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) 
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) have demonstrated this 
infrequency, but contemporary data as well as comparison with current 
information regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has not been assessed. In this 
study, we reviewed VAERS database reports from 1990 to 2022 to characterize the 
incidence and clinical and laboratory findings of non-SARS-CoV-2-associated AIHA 
and ITP and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated AIHA and ITP. We discovered a total of 
863 AIHA and ITP reports following vaccination with 15 non-SARS-CoV-2 and four 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines submitted to the CDC VAERS database. AIHA and ITP reporting 
was low for both groups, with a large proportion excluded due to a lack of 
clinical details. ITP was reported the most frequently in both groups and was 
significantly more common with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination 
(p < 0.001) in the non-SARS-CoV-2 group. AIHA and ITP cases were higher in the 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine group, though ultimately still very infrequent. Autoimmune 
haematologic disease is vanishingly rare after immunization and rates are lower 
than in the general population according to passive reporting."
1436,"BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and 
function, diminishes life quality in elderly people. Improving the capacity of 
skeletal muscle differentiation is expected to counteract sarcopenia. However, 
the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle differentiation are complex, and 
effective therapeutic targets are largely unknown.
METHODS: The human Gene Expression Omnibus database, aged mice and primary 
skeletal muscle cells were used to assess the expression level of pyruvate 
dehydrogenase B (PDHB) in human and mouse aged state. d-Galactose ( 
d-gal)-induced sarcopenia mouse model and two classic cell models (C2C12 and 
HSkMC) were used to assess the myogenic effect of PDHB and the underlying 
mechanisms via immunocytochemistry, western blotting, quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction, RNA interference or overexpression, dual-luciferase 
reporter assay, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.
RESULTS: We identified that a novel target PDHB promoted myogenic 
differentiation. PDHB expression decreased in aged mouse muscle relative to the 
young state (-50% of mRNA level, P < 0.01) and increased during mouse and 
primary human muscle cell differentiation (+3.97-fold, P < 0.001 and +3.79-fold, 
P < 0.001). Knockdown or overexpression of PDHB modulated the expression of 
genes related to muscle differentiation, namely, myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) (-46%, 
P < 0.01 and -27%, P < 0.05; +1.8-fold, P < 0.01), myogenic differentiation 
(MyoD) (-55%, P < 0.001 and -34%, P < 0.01; +2.27-fold, P < 0.001), myogenin 
(MyoG) (-60%, P < 0.001 and -70%, P < 0.001; +5.46-fold, P < 0.001) and myosin 
heavy chain (MyHC) (-70%, P < 0.001 and -69%, P < 0.001; +3.44-fold, P < 0.001) 
in both C2C12 cells and HSkMC. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed 
that PDHB knockdown suppressed pyruvate metabolism (P < 0.001) and up-regulated 
ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (Arih2) (+7.23-fold, P < 0.001) in 
cellular catabolic pathways. The role of forkhead box P1 (FoxP1) (+4.18-fold, 
P < 0.001)-mediated Arih2 transcription was the key downstream regulator of PDHB 
in muscle differentiation. PDHB overexpression improved d-gal-induced muscle 
atrophy in mice, which was characterized by significant increases in grip 
strength, muscle mass and mean muscle cross-sectional area (1.19-fold to 
1.5-fold, P < 0.01, P < 0.05 and P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive results show that PDHB plays a sarcoprotective 
role by suppressing the FoxP1-Arih2 axis and may serve as a therapeutic target 
in sarcopenia."
1437,"In response to tissue injury, within seconds the ultra large glycoprotein, von 
Willebrand factor (VWF) is released from endothelial storage organelles 
(Weibel-Palade bodies) into the lumen of the blood vasculature where it leads to 
the recruitment of platelets. The marked size of VWF multimers represents an 
unprecedented burden on the secretory machinery of endothelial cells (ECs). ECs 
have evolved mechanisms to overcome this, most notably an actomyosin ring, that 
forms, contracts and squeezes out its unwieldy cargo. Inhibiting the formation 
or function of these structures represents a novel therapeutic target for 
thrombotic pathologies though characterising proteins associated with such a 
dynamic process has been challenging. We have combined APEX-2 proximity 
labelling with an innovative dual loss of function screen to identify proteins 
associated with actomyosin ring function. We show p21 activated kinase 2 (PAK2) 
recruits septin hetero-oligomers, a molecular interaction that forms a ring 
around exocytic sites. This cascade of events control actomyosin ring function 
aiding efficient exocytic release. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PAK2 
or septins led to inefficient release of VWF and a failure to form 
platelet-catching strings. This new molecular mechanism offers additional 
therapeutic targets for the control of thrombotic disease and is highly relevant 
to other secretory systems that employ exocytic actomyosin machinery."
1438,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the only 
curative treatment option for a number of hematological malignancies. Its 
therapeutic potential relies on the potency of donor T-cells to eliminate 
residual malignant cells, the so-called graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. 
Disease relapse remains the most frequent treatment failure and is associated 
with poor outcome. Therefore, it is inevitable to decipher mechanisms that 
weaken GvL. In recent years, studies in tumor biology have revealed that 
metabolic remodeling of the micromilieu can critically regulate immune 
responses. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to a metabolic 
condition known as oxidative stress, which can severely hamper T-cells. As of to 
date, only few studies from mainly preclinical models have demonstrated 
occurrence of oxidative stress after allo-SCT. Therefore, we sought out to 
investigate oxidative stress in a well-characterized group of allo-SCT patients 
and its impact on reconstituting T-cells. We identified high concentrations of 
serum 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) as an established biomarker for oxidative 
stress. 8-OHdG is one of the major products of DNA oxidation, which is normally 
rapidly removed. Following allo-SCT T-cells accumulated oxidative DNA damages. 
High cellular 8-ohdg content (8-ohdghi) was associated with signs of enhanced 
T-cell activation but also premature exhaustion. The 8-ohdghi T-cells' inability 
to efficiently target malignant cells or to produce cytotoxic Granzyme B and 
IFN-g was associated with a significantly increased relapse risk and a shorter 
overall survival. Taken together, our novel findings could give reason to focus 
on bolstering DNA repair in reconstituting T-cells as a mean to improve GvL 
efficacy."
1439,"Increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) and glycolysis have been 
established in pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, the effect of elevated mROS 
on glycolytic shift along with how increased glycolysis promotes hypoxic 
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) proliferation and vascular 
remodeling remain elusive. Here, we reported that hypoxia-induced mROS inhibit 
HIF-1α hydroxylation and further trigger PASMCs glycolytic switch through the 
upregulated HIF-1α/PDK1&2/p-PDH-E1α axis, which facilitates lactate accumulation 
and histone lactylation. Through H3K18la and HIF-1α ChIP-seq analysis, we found 
that the enhanced histone lactylation of HIF-1α targets, such as Bmp5, Trpc5, 
and Kit, promotes PASMCs proliferation. Knockdown of Pdk1&2 blunts lactate 
production, histone lactylation marks, and PASMCs proliferation. Moreover, 
pharmacological intervention with lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor diminishes 
histone lactylation and ameliorates PASMCs proliferation and vascular remodeling 
in hypoxic PH rats. Taken together, this study provides proof of concept for 
anti-remodeling therapy through lactate manipulation."
1440,"Enhancing yield during bacterial enzyme production could have positive economic 
and environmental impacts. For cell factories, such improvements in yields could 
potentially be obtained by fine-tuning the metabolic processes and their 
regulatory mechanisms for gene candidates. In pursuit of such candidates, we 
performed RNA-sequencing of two α-amylase producing Bacillus strains and predict 
hundreds of putative novel non-coding transcribed regions. Complex operons that 
are regulated by a wide variety of transcription factors, non-coding and 
structured RNAs add to the challenge of finding yield-affecting candidates. 
Surprisingly, we found that non-coding genomic regions are proportionally 
undergoing the highest changes in expression during fermentation (75% of novel 
RNA predictions had absolute logFC > 2). Since these classes of RNA are also 
understudied, we targeted the corresponding genomic regions with CRIPSRi 
knockdown to test for any potential impact on the yield. From differentially 
expressed annotations, including both novel candidate and prior annotated 
ncRNAs, we selected 53 non-coding candidates. The targeting with CRISPRi 
knockdowns transcription in a genomic region on both the sense and the antisense 
strand. Thus, the CRISPRi experiment cannot link causes for yield changes to the 
sense or antisense disruption. Nevertheless, we observed on several instances 
with strong changes in enzyme yield. The knockdown targeting the genomic region 
for a putative antisense RNA of the 3' UTR of the skfA-skfH operon led to a 21% 
increase in yield. In contrast, the knockdown targeting the genomic regions of 
putative antisense RNAs of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (ctaD), the sigma 
factor sigH, and the uncharacterized gene yhfT decreased yields by 31 to 43%. We 
discuss how the findings of this study can be further investigated to elucidate 
potential direct and indirect mechanisms on yield changes."
1441,"CRISPR activation and interference (CRISPRa/i) technology offers the 
unprecedented possibility of achieving regulated gene expression both in vitro 
and in vivo. The DNA pairing specificity of a nuclease dead Cas9 (dCas9) is 
exploited to precisely target a transcriptional activator or repressor in 
proximity to a gene promoter. This permits both the study of phenotypes arising 
from gene modulation for investigative purposes, and the development of 
potential therapeutics. As with virtually all other organ systems, the 
cardiovascular system can deeply benefit from a broader utilisation of 
CRISPRa/i. However, application of this technology is still in its infancy. 
Significant areas for improvement include the identification of novel and more 
effective transcriptional regulators that can be docked to dCas9, and the 
development of more efficient methods for their delivery and expression in vivo."
1442,"Ammonia is one of the most important aquatic environmental factors, which is of 
great concern. In order to evaluate the effect of ammonia on guppy (Poecilia 
reticulate), fish were exposed to increased concentrations (0, 12.50, 25.00, 
41.67, 62.50 mg/L) of ammonia for 48 h. After exposure, we measured the anxiety 
behavior, antioxidant enzymes and pro-inflammation genes (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) 
of guppy. The results showed that ammonia stress induced fish anxiety, which was 
manifested by the increased latency to enter the upper half and decreased time 
spent in upper half compared with control fish. The guppy showed oxidative 
stress after 48 h of ammonia stress as evidenced by decreases in the activities 
of antioxidant enzymes and an increase in lipid hydroperoxide content. With 
prolonged ammonia stress, the expressions of HSP70, HSP90, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 
mRNA at first had an increasing trend, and then decreased, all of which were 
significantly higher than the control levels at 12 h and 24 h after ammonia 
stress (P < 0.05). Ammonia significantly upregulated these genes mRNA levels 
after 48 h exposure, suggesting that heat shock proteins and innate immune 
system may try to protect cells from oxidative stress induced by ammonia stress. 
Our study showed that higher ammonia exposure induced oxidative stress in 
exposed fish, since inhibition of antioxidant enzymes activity and increases in 
lipid peroxidation, and inflammation occurred. Furthermore, the results will be 
helpful to understand the mechanism of ammonia toxicity in guppys."
1443,"PURPOSE: The optimal approach to incorporate radiotherapy (RT) in conjunction 
with CAR T-cell Therapy (CART) for relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (bNHL) remains unclear. This study documents the RT local control rate 
among patients who received bridging radiotherapy (BRT) prior to CART and 
compares it to those who received salvage radiotherapy (SRT) post CART. It 
further reports on a promising way to utilize SRT for post CART disease, and 
identifies predictors for RT in-field recurrence.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 83 patients with r/r bNHL who received CART 
and RT, either as BRT pre-CART infusion (n=35) or as SRT post-CART infusion 
(n=48), between 2018 and 2021. RT was defined as comprehensive (compRT) - 
treated all sites of active disease - or focal (focRT). Limited disease was 
defined as disease amenable to compRT, involving <5 active disease sites.
RESULTS: At time of RT, patients who received BRT prior to CART had bulkier 
disease sites (median diameter 8.7cm vs. 5.5cm; p=0.01) and were treated to 
significantly lower doses (median equivalent 2 Gy dose 23.3Gy vs. 34.5Gy, 
p=0.002), compared to SRT post CART. Among 124 total irradiated sites 
identified, 8/59 (13%) bridged-sites and 21/65 (32%) salvaged-sites experienced 
in-field recurrence translating to 1-year local control rate (LC) of 84% and 
62%, respectively (p=0.009). Patients with limited post-CART disease (n=37) who 
received compSRT (n=26) had better overall survival (51% vs. 12%; p=0.028), 
freedom from subsequent progression (31% vs. 0%; p<0.001) and freedom from 
subsequent event (19% vs. 0%; p=0.011) compared to patients with limited disease 
who received focSRT (n=11).
CONCLUSION: BRT followed by CART appears to be associated with improved LC 
compared to SRT in r/r bNHL. Nonetheless, SRT offers a promising salvage 
intervention for limited (<5 sites) relapsed post-CART disease if given 
comprehensively."
1444,"FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is a promising radiation technique that uses 
ultra-high doses of radiation to increase the therapeutic window of the 
treatment. FLASH-RT has been observed to provide normal tissue sparing at high 
dose rates and similar tumor control than conventional radiotherapy, yet the 
biological processes governing these radiobiological effects are still unknown. 
In this study, we sought to investigate the potential immune response generated 
by FLASH-RT in a high dose of proton therapy in an orthotopic glioma rat model. 
Thus, we cranially irradiated rats with a single high dose (25 Gy) using FLASH 
dose rate proton irradiation (257 ± 2 Gy/s) or conventional dose rate proton 
irradiation (4 ± 0.02 Gy/s). We first assessed the protective FLASH effect that 
resulted in our setup through behavioral studies in naïve rats. This was 
followed by a comprehensive analysis of immune cells in blood, healthy tissue of 
the brain and tumor microenvironment by flow cytometry. Proton FLASH-RT spared 
memory impairment produced by conventional high-dose proton therapy and induced 
a similar tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) recruitment. Additionally, a 
general neuroinflammation that was similar in both dose rates was observed. 
Overall, this study demonstrated a FLASH proton therapy offers a 
neuro-protective effect even at high doses while is able of mounting an 
effective lymphoid immune response in the tumor."
1445,"Selenium has good antitumor effects in vitro, but the hypoxic microenvironment 
in solid tumors makes its clinical efficacy unsatisfactory. We hypothesized that 
the combination with oxygen therapy might improve the treatment efficacy of 
selenium in hypoxic tumors through the changes of redox environment. In this 
work, two selenium compounds, Na2SeO3 and CysSeSeCys, were selected to 
interrogate their therapeutic effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under 
different oxygen levels. In tumor-bearing mice, both selenium compounds 
significantly inhibited the tumor growth, and combined with oxygen therapy 
further reduced the tumor volume about 50%. In vitro HepG2 cell experiments, 
selenium induced autophagy and delayed apoptosis under hypoxia (1% O2), while 
inhibited autophagy and accelerated apoptosis under hyperoxia (60% O2). We found 
that, in contrast to hypoxia, the hyperoxic environment facilitated the H2Se, 
produced by the selenium metabolism in cells, to be rapidly oxidized to generate 
H2O2, leading to inhibit the expression level of Nrf2 and to increase that of 
phosphorylation of p38 and MKK4, resulting in inhibiting autophagy and 
accelerating apoptosis. Once the Nrf2 gene was knocked down, selenium compounds 
combined with hyperoxia treatment would further activate the MAPK signaling 
pathway and further increase apoptosis. These findings highlight oxygen can 
significantly enhance the anti-HCC effect of selenium compounds through 
regulating the Nrf2 and MAPK signaling pathways, thus providing novel 
therapeutic strategy for the hypoxic tumors and pave the way for the application 
of selenium in clinical treatment."
1446,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases caused by pathologic misfolded tau 
protein aggregation in the nervous system. Population studies implicate EIF2AK3 
(eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3), better known as 
PERK (protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), as a genetic risk 
factor in several tauopathies. PERK is a key regulator of intracellular 
proteostatic mechanisms - Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and Integrated Stress 
Response (ISR). Previous studies found that tauopathy-associated PERK variants 
encoded functional hypomorphs with reduced signaling in vitro. But, it remained 
unclear how altered PERK activity led to tauopathy. Here, we chemically or 
genetically modulated PERK signaling in cell culture models of tau aggregation 
and found that PERK pathway activation prevented tau aggregation while 
inhibition exacerbated tau aggregation. In primary tauopathy patient brain 
tissues, we found that reduced PERK signaling correlated with increased tau 
neuropathology. We found that tauopathy-associated PERK variants targeted the ER 
luminal domain; and two of these variants damaged hydrogen bond formation. Our 
studies support that PERK activity protects against tau aggregation and 
pathology. This may explain why people carrying hypomorphic PERK variants have 
increased risk for developing tauopathies. Finally, our studies identify small 
molecule augmentation of PERK signaling as an attractive therapeutic strategy to 
treat tauopathies by preventing tau pathology."
1447,"OBJECTIVE: To unravel the differential transcriptomic behaviour of human 
androgenotes (AGs) and parthenogenotes (PGs) throughout the first cell cycles, 
analyze the differential expression of genes related to key biological 
processes, and determine the time frame for embryonic genome activation in AGs 
and PGs.
DESIGN: Laboratory Study.
SETTING: Private fertility clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Mature oocytes were retrieved from healthy donors and subjected to 
artificial oocyte activation using calcium ionophore and puromycin to generate 
PGs (n=6) or enucleated and subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection to 
generate AGs (n=10).
INTERVENTIONS: Uniparental constructs at different early stages of development 
were disaggregated into constituent single cells (we suggest the terms 
parthenocytes and androcytes) to characterize the single-cell transcriptional 
landscape using next-generation sequencing.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: Transcriptomic profiles comparison between different 
stages of early development in AGs and PGs.
RESULTS: The uniparental transcriptomic profiles at the first cell cycle showed 
68 downregulated and 26 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PGs 
compared to AGs. During the third cell cycle, we found 60 upregulated and 504 
downregulated DEGs in PGs compared to AGs. In the fourth cell cycle, 1771 
upregulated and 1171 downregulated DEGs were found in PGs compared to AGs. The 
AGs and PGs had reduced EGA profiles during the first three cell cycles, and a 
spike of EGA at the fourth cell cycle was observed in PGs.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic analysis of AGs and PGs revealed their complementary 
behaviour until the fourth cell cycle. AGs undergo a low wave of transcription 
during the first cell cycle, which reflects the paternal contribution to cell 
cycle coordination, mechanics of cell division and novel transcription 
regulation. Maternal transcripts are most prominent in the third and fourth cell 
cycles, with amplification of transcription related to morphogenic progression 
and embryonic developmental competence acquisition. Regarding EGA, in PGs, a 
primitive EGA begins at the one-cell stage, and gradually progresses until the 
four-cell stage, when crucial epigenetic reprogramming (through methylation) is 
upregulated. In addition, our longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic analysis 
challenges that the zygote and early-cleavage stages are the only totipotent 
entities, by revealing potential totipotency in cleavage-stage AGs and 
implications of paternal transcripts."
1448,"It has long been accepted that myotonia (muscle stiffness) in patients with 
muscle channelopathies is due to myotonic discharges (involuntary firing of 
action potentials). In a previous study, we identified a novel phenomenon in 
myotonic muscle: development of plateau potentials, transient depolarizations to 
near -35 mV lasting for seconds to minutes. In the current study we examined 
whether plateau potentials contribute to myotonia. A recessive genetic model 
(ClCadr mice) with complete loss of muscle chloride channel (ClC-1) function was 
used to model severe myotonia congenita with complete loss of ClC-1 function and 
a pharmacologic model using anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9 AC) was used to 
model milder myotonia congenita with incomplete loss of ClC-1 function. 
Simultaneous measurements of action potentials and myoplasmic Ca2+ from 
individual muscle fibers were compared to recordings of whole muscle force 
generation. In ClCadr muscle both myotonia and plateau potentials lasted 10s of 
seconds to minutes. During plateau potentials lasting 1-2 min, there was a 
gradual transition from high to low intracellular Ca2+, suggesting a transition 
in individual fibers from myotonia to flaccid paralysis in severe myotonia 
congenita. In 9 AC-treated muscles, both myotonia and plateau potentials lasted 
only a few seconds and Ca2+ remained elevated during the plateau potentials, 
suggesting plateau potentials contribute to myotonia without causing weakness. 
We propose, that in myotonic muscle, there is a novel state in which there is 
contraction in the absence of action potentials. This discovery provides a 
mechanism to explain reports of patients with myotonia who suffer from 
electrically silent muscle contraction lasting minutes."
1449,"BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is an important treatment 
that could offer a cure for lymphoma patients. However, advanced age is an 
important factor that determines eligibility and outcomes after ASCT. Over the 
past decade, attributed to improved supportive care, ASCT for older patients 
with increasing age has become more feasible.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we report the single center outcomes of older patients 
with lymphoma undergoing ASCT at Mayo Clinic Rochester to highlight its interval 
improvement over time and help to redefine the implication of ASCT in the CAR 
T-cell era.
STUDY DESIGN: A single center retrospective study describes characteristics and 
outcomes of older patients with lymphoma who underwent ASCT between 2000 and 
2021. The study reports various relevant transplant related outcomes including 
progression free survival, overall survival, relapse incidence and non-relapse 
mortality (NRM) in older patients with various lymphoma histologic subtypes. The 
main outcome is focusing on NRM which is defined as time from ASCT to 
non-lymphoma related death with relapse being a competing event.
RESULTS: of 492 patients aged ≥65 years old were analyzed. The median age at 
ASCT was 68.8 years. The most common indication for ASCT was diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma accounting for 59.3%. In multivariate analyses, patients 
undergoing ASCT in 2009-2021, performance status of zero and low Hematopoietic 
Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) (0-3) had a significantly lower NRM. 
Factors associated with OS included age, LDH, and HCT-CI.
CONCLUSION: The 1- year NRM in older patients was low at 6.0% in concordance 
with previous reports. Age should not be the only factor determining patients' 
ASCT eligibility. With the proper patient selection, ASCT remains a reasonable 
option for older patients with lymphoma."
1450,"BACKGROUND: Presence of depressive symptoms prior to hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant is a common experience with long-term impacts on survival.
OBJECTIVES: Using the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain 
Criteria framework, this study sought to characterize depressive symptoms in 
patients prior to transplant through exploratory factor analysis and determine 
whether depressive factors were significant predictors of long-term survival.
STUDY DESIGN: Individuals were included in the study if they were preparing to 
undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant and endorsed depressive symptoms 
measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Patients were scheduled to undergo 
transplant between 2005 and 2010. Survival analyses were conducted in 2022 to 
assess long-term outcomes. The primary outcomes were 1) exploring the factor 
structure of the Beck Depression Inventory-II and 2) conducing univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses of depression symptoms and known 
demographic and disease characteristics that impact survival.
RESULTS: Of the 695 participants included in the study, most were male, middle 
age (M age = 55.08, SD = 11.75), White, and married. Exploratory factor analysis 
revealed a four-factor structure consisting of ""Negative Valence Systems: 
Internalizing"" (e.g., worthlessness, guilt), ""Arousal and Threat"" (e.g., 
agitation, irritability), ""Arousal and Regulatory Systems"" (e.g., loss of 
energy, fatigue), and ""Negative Valence Systems: Externalizing"" (e.g., loss of 
pleasure, loss of interest). Univariate survival analyses found that age, 
gender, disease type, acute graft versus host disease, and Negative Valence 
Systems: Externalizing were significant predictors of survival. Transplant type, 
chronic graft versus host disease, performance status, and the other three 
depression factor structures were not significant in univariate models. In the 
multivariate model, older age (HR: 1.031, 95% CI: 1.021-1.041, p<.001) and 
presence of Negative Valence Systems: Externalizing symptoms (HR: 1.132, 95% CI: 
1.030-1.244, p=.010) were significant predictors of shorter survival. 
Additionally, individuals diagnosed with acute leukemia were significantly more 
likely to have shorter survival compared to other disease types including 
amyloidosis (HR: 0.362, 95% CI: 0.229-0.575, p<.001) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(HR: 0.526, 95% CI: 0.349-0.793, p=.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory factor analysis of depressive symptoms mapped well onto 
the Research Domain Criteria constructs. Loss of pleasure and loss of interest, 
two key components of depression, were predictive of shorter survival. 
Exploration of key components of depression rather than the total depression 
score may provide important prognostic information for long-term survivorship 
and may help inform future and more individualized care."
1451,"Environmentally harmful silicon cutting waste (SCW) generated during the 
production of silicon solar cells possesses a high reuse value. However, the 
presence of oxide surface and impurities restrict the Si-cores reuse. Herein, 
inspired by the structure and composition of SCW, designed a combined process 
consisting of vacuum sintering and alloying to reuse SCW into Al-Si alloy at a 
low cost. Vacuum sintering promotes the reduction of the oxide surface by 
Si-core. Oxygen content was decreased by 92.54 %, demonstrating the successful 
removal of the oxide surface. The discharge of reduction products contributes to 
the densification, and the Si-core has converged into dense Vac-ceramic (Si 
block), rendering a relative density of 96.17 %. More importantly, during the 
alloying process, the formation of Vac-ceramic dredges the mass transfer pathway 
from Si-core to Al melt. As a result, the Si utilization rate increased about 
seven times compared with the direct reuse of pristine SCW. Compared with 
commercial Al-Si alloys, the Al-Si alloys prepared by reusing silicon cutting 
waste in this work have satisfactory mechanical properties. The method has the 
prominent advantages of being protective-atmosphere-free, additive-free, and 
scalability, and may be a promising candidate for the silicon cutting waste 
purifying and reusing field."
1452,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized in part by the deterioration of dopaminergic neurons which leads 
to motor impairment. Although there is no cure for PD, the motor symptoms can be 
treated using dopamine replacement therapies including the dopamine precursor 
L-DOPA, which has been in use since the 1960's. However, neurodegeneration in PD 
is not limited to dopaminergic neurons, and many patients experience non-motor 
symptoms including cognitive impairment or neuropsychiatric disturbances, for 
which there are limited treatment options. Moreover, there are currently no 
treatments able to alter the progression of neurodegeneration. There are many 
therapeutic strategies being investigated for PD, including alternatives to 
L-DOPA for the treatment of motor impairment, symptomatic treatments for 
non-motor symptoms, and neuroprotective or disease-modifying agents. G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include the dopamine receptors, are 
highly druggable cell surface proteins which can regulate numerous intracellular 
signaling pathways and thereby modulate the function of neuronal circuits 
affected by PD. This review will describe the treatment strategies being 
investigated for PD that target GPCRs and their downstream signaling mechanisms. 
First, we discuss new developments in dopaminergic agents for alleviating PD 
motor impairment, the role of dopamine receptors in L-DOPA induced dyskinesia, 
as well as agents targeting non-dopamine GPCRs which could augment or replace 
traditional dopaminergic treatments. We then discuss GPCRs as prospective 
treatments for neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms in PD. Finally, we 
discuss the evidence pertaining to ghrelin receptors, β-adrenergic receptors, 
angiotensin receptors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, which have been 
proposed as disease modifying targets with potential neuroprotective effects in 
PD."
1453,"The last two decades have seen the emergence of three highly pathogenic 
coronaviruses with zoonotic origins, which prompted immediate attention to the 
underlying cause and prevention of future outbreaks. Intensification of camel 
husbandry in the Middle East has resulted in increased human-camel interactions, 
which has led to the spread of potentially zoonotic viruses with human spillover 
risks like MERS-coronavirus, camelpox virus, etc. Type-I interferons function as 
the first line of defense against invading viruses and are pivotal for limiting 
viral replication and immune-mediated pathologies. Seven novel dromedary camel 
interferon delta genes were identified and cloned. Functional characterization 
of this novel class of IFNs from the mammalian suborder tylopoda is reported for 
the first time. The camel interferon-delta proteins resemble the reported 
mammalian counterparts in sequence similarity, conservation of cysteines, and 
phylogenetic proximity. Prokaryotically expressed recombinant camel 
interferon-δ1 induced IFN-stimulated gene expression and also exerted antiviral 
action against camelpox virus, an endemic zoonotic virus. The pre-treatment of 
camel kidney cells with recombinant camel IFN-δ1 increased cell survival and 
reduced camelpox virus in a dose-dependent manner. The identification of novel 
IFNs from species with zoonotic spillover risk such as camels, and evaluating 
their antiviral effects in-vitro will play a key role in improving 
immunotherapies against viruses and expanding the arsenal to combat emerging 
zoonotic pathogens."
1454,"A modified KSOM for rat embryo culture (KSOM-R), which has enriched taurine, 
glycine, glutamic acid, and alanine, promoted rat embryo development in vitro. 
Since mice and rats share similar amino acid profiles in their female 
reproductive tracts, this study explored whether KSOM-R would also have a 
positive effect on mouse embryo development and if KSOM-R modifications could 
extend its shelf time at 2-8 °C for consistency. We first examined the effects 
of newly made (≤1 month at 2-8 °C) antibiotics-free KSOM-R (mKSOM-R), 
antibiotics-free KSOM (mKSOM) and KSOM on the development of in vivo or in vitro 
derived C57BL/6NJ zygotes. We then investigated the effect of extended shelf 
life (6 months at 2-8 °C) of mKSOM-R and mKOSM on the development of C57BL/6NJ 
mouse and Sprague Dawley (SD) rat embryos. The results showed that there were no 
significant differences in cleavage, blastocyst, and hatching rates of C57BL/6NJ 
embryos among the three freshly made media. After 6 months of storage at 2-8 °C, 
mKSOM-R and mKSOM were still able to support the development of in vivo 
C57BL/6NJ zygotes at comparable rates seen with newly made (≤1 month at 2-8 °C) 
KSOM (control) in terms of cleavage, blastocyst formation and hatching. There 
were also no significant differences in total cell numbers in day 4 blastocysts 
among the three groups. After surgical embryo transfers, C57BL/6NJ blastocysts 
cultured in mKSOM-R (6 months at 2-8 °C) and newly made (≤1 month at 2-8 °C) 
KSOM culture developed into live pups. These pups had no gross abnormalities in 
animal morphology and growth. SD zygotes cultured in mKSOM-R stored at 2-8 °C 
for 6 months developed at comparable rates in cleavage, blastocyst and hatching 
rates when compared to those cultured in newly made mKSOM-R (≤1 month at 
2-8 °C). The data showed that, although no significant beneficial effects were 
observed on mouse embryo development, mKSOM-R was able to support both mouse and 
rat embryo development in vitro. Additionally, mKSOM-R and mKSOM can be stored 
at 2-8 °C for at least 6 months without significantly compromising quality. This 
study suggests that it is possible to reduce the media inventory by using only 
mKSOM-R to culture both mouse and rat embryos, and quality media with extended 
shelf life can be made through modifications."
1455,"The anterior segment is a critical component of the visual system. Developing 
independent of the retina, the AS relies partially on cranial neural crest cells 
(cNCC) as its earliest progenitors. The cNCCs are thought to first adopt a 
periocular mesenchyme (POM) fate and subsequently target to the AS upon 
formation of the rudimentary retina. AS targeted POM is termed anterior segment 
mesenchyme (ASM). However, it remains unknown when and how the switch from cNCC 
to POM or POM to ASM takes place. As such, we sought to visualize the timing of 
these transitions and identify the regulators of this process using the 
zebrafish embryo model. Using two color fluorescence in situ hybridization, we 
tracked cNCC and ASM target gene expression from 12 to 24hpf. In doing so, we 
identified a tfap2a and foxC1a co-expression at 16hpf, identifying the earliest 
ASM to arrive at the AS. Interestingly, expression of two other key regulators 
of NCC, foxD3 and sox10 was not associated with early ASM. Functional analysis 
of tfap2a, foxD3 and sox10 revealed that tfap2a and foxD3 are both critical 
regulators of ASM specification and AS formation while sox10 was dispensable for 
either specification or development of the AS. Using genetic knockout lines, we 
show that in the absence of tfap2a or foxD3 function ASM cells are not 
specified, and subsequently the AS is malformed. Conversely, sox10 genetic 
mutants or CRISPR Cas9 injected embryos displayed no defects in ASM 
specification, migration or the AS. Lastly, using transcriptomic analysis, we 
show that GFP + cNCCs derived from Tg [foxD3:GFP] and Tg [foxC1b:GFP] share 
expression profiles consistent with ASM development whereas cNCCs isolated from 
Tg [sox10:GFP] exhibit expression profiles associated with vasculogenesis, 
muscle function and pigmentation. Taken together, we propose that the earliest 
stage of anterior segment mesenchyme (ASM) specification in zebrafish is 
approximately 16hpf and involves tfap2a/foxC1a positive cNCCs."
1456,"Dental Follicle Cells (DFCs) are somatic stem cells with a limited lifespan, but 
little is known about a possible mechanism of cellular senescence. Previous 
studies have shown that cellular senescence is associated with increased demand 
of glycolsis or the ""glycolytic metabotype"", which can be induced by activation 
of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased 
autophagy. This study examined the role of AMPK in inducing senescence in DFCs. 
During the induction of cellular senescence, AMPK activity was impaired, 
suggesting a negative impact on senescence induction. In line with this 
assumption, cellular senescence was induced upon inhibition of AMPK with a 
specific siRNA. In addition, after this inhibition, autophagy was also 
inhibited. Moreover, specific inhibition of autophagy promoted cellular 
senescence. However, inducers of AMPK such as metformin or AICAR surprisingly 
increased senescence in DFCs. Interestingly, autophagy was impaired after 
long-term induction of AMPK with AICAR and metformin. Moreover, activation of 
AMPK induces the consumption of glucose but decreases NAD/NADH ratio in DFCs 
that suggest not only ""glycolytic metabotype"" of DFCs but also Mitochondrial 
Dysfunction Associated Senescence (MiDAS). Both changes are highly associated 
with the induction of cellular senescence. Hence, both AMPK activation and 
inhibition promote the induction of cellular senecence of DFCs."
1457,"BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with poor 
prognosis, and new treatment options are urgently needed. About 34%-39% of 
primary TNBCs show a low expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2-low), which is a target for new anti-HER2 drugs. However, little is known 
about the frequency and the prognostic value of HER2-low in metastatic TNBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with TNBC from five 
European countries for this international, multicenter analysis. 
Triple-negativity had to be shown in a metastatic site or in the primary breast 
tumor diagnosed simultaneously or within 3 years before metastatic disease. 
HER2-low was defined as immunohistochemically (IHC) 1+ or 2+ without ERBB2 gene 
amplification. Survival probabilities were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier 
method, and multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox regression 
models.
RESULTS: In total, 691 patients, diagnosed between January 2006 and February 
2021, were assessable. The incidence of HER2-low was 32.0% [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 28.5% to 35.5%], with similar proportions in metastases (n = 265; 
29.8%) and primary tumors (n = 425; 33.4%; P = 0.324). The median overall 
survival (OS) in HER2-low and HER2-0 TNBC was 18.6 and 16.1 months, respectively 
(HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.83-1.19; P = 0.969). Similarly, in multivariable analysis, 
HER2-low had no significant impact on OS (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.79-1.13; P = 0.545). 
No difference in prognosis was observed between HER2 IHC 0/1+ and IHC 2+ tumors 
(HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.69-1.17; P = 0.414).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large international dataset of metastatic TNBC, the 
frequency of HER2-low was 32.0%. Neither in univariable nor in multivariable 
analysis HER2-low showed any influence on OS."
1458,"In the vision to realize a circular economy aiming for net carbon neutrality or 
even negativity, cell-free bioconversion of sustainable and renewable resources 
emerged as a promising strategy. The potential of in vitro systems is enormous, 
delivering technological, ecological, and ethical added values. Innovative 
concepts arose in cell-free enzymatic conversions to reduce process waste 
production and preserve fossil resources, as well as to redirect and assimilate 
released industrial pollutions back into the production cycle again. However, 
the great challenge in the near future will be the jump from a concept to an 
industrial application. The transition process in industrial implementation also 
requires economic aspects such as productivity, scalability, and 
cost-effectiveness. Here, we briefly review the latest proof-of-concept cascades 
using carbon dioxide and other C1 or lignocellulose-derived chemicals as 
blueprints to efficiently recycle greenhouse gases, as well as cutting-edge 
technologies to maturate these concepts to industrial pilot plants."
1459,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is identified as a promising 
target for cancer therapy. However, known NAMPT inhibitors are characterized by 
weak clinical efficacy and dose-dependent toxicity. There is an urgent need to 
develop new NAMPT intervention strategies. Using the proteolysis-targeting 
chimera (PROTAC) technology, we designed and synthesized a series of new von 
Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-recruiting NAMPT-targeting PROTACs. A highly potent NAMPT 
degrader (B3) was successfully identified, which displayed excellent degradation 
activity (DC50 < 0.17 nM, Dmax > 90%) and antiproliferative potency against 
A2780 cells (IC50 = 1.5 nM). PROTAC B3 induced NAMPT depletion in a 
concentration- and time-dependent manner through the ubiquitin-proteasome 
system. Particularly, PROTAC B3 achieved good plasma exposure levels via 
intravenous injection, gained potent tumor growth inhibition (TGI = 88.1%, 2 
μM/kg) in the xenograft model, and demonstrated good biosafety without undesired 
toxicities. This study provides a highly potent VHL-recruiting NAMPT degrader 
for the treatment of ovarian cancer."
1460,"Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are fundamental constituents of both the cell 
surface and extracellular matrix. By playing a key role in cell-cell and 
cell-matrix interactions, GAGs are involved in many physiological and 
pathological processes. To design GAG mimetics with similar therapeutic 
potential as the natural ones, the specific structural features, among them 
sulfate content, sulfation pattern, and chain length, should be considered. In 
the present study, we describe a sulfation method based on microwave radiation 
to obtain highly sulfated derivatives as GAG mimetics. The starting 
low-molecular-weight (LMW) derivative was prepared from the infernan 
exopolysaccharide, a highly branched naturally slightly sulfated 
heteropolysaccharide synthesized by the deep-sea hydrothermal vent bacterium 
Alteromonas infernus. LMW highly sulfated infernan derivatives obtained by 
conventional heating sulfation have already been shown to display GAG-mimetic 
properties. Here, the potential of microwave-assisted sulfation versus that of 
the conventional method to obtain GAG mimetics was explored. Structural analysis 
by NMR revealed that highly sulfated derivatives from the two methods shared 
similar structural features, emphasizing that microwave-assisted sulfation with 
a 12-fold shorter reaction time is as efficient as the classical one."

1462,"OBJECTIVES: Determine the frequency of actionable mutations in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) and their correlation with overall survival (OS) and the 
site of metastases.
METHODS: We performed a descriptive cross-sectional study at the Hospital de 
Especialidades Eugenio Espejo, Ecuador, between 2017 and 2020. Demographic, 
pathological, and molecular alterations in epidermal growth factor (EGFR), 
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1), Programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and clinical data detailed in patients' 
medical records with metastatic NSCLC were collected and analyzed. Seventy-nine 
stage IV patients had NSCLC; adenocarcinoma histology represents 56 (70.9%). The 
predominant mutation was in EGFR (22.8%); the most common variant was the 
deletion of exon 19 (72.2%). The most common metastatic site was in the 
contralateral lung (22.3%); however, this variable showed no significant 
correlation to the molecular markers (p=0.057). The overall survival (OS) and 
the status of molecular markers are not statistically significant (p=0.27). OS 
was better for non-mutated EGFR than for mutated EGFR (p=0.012). However, the 
frequency values are unrelated to contralateral lung metastasis or survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Our frequency mutations are concordant with those found in other 
studies in Latin America. EGFR was the most common biomarker mutation, and there 
was a better OS in EGFR non-mutated patient."
1463,"BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of N2 lymph node status of the resectable stage 
I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before surgery is crucial, while there 
is lack of corresponding method clinically.
PURPOSE: To develop and validate a model to quantitively predict the N2 lymph 
node metastasis in presurgical clinical stage I-II NSCLC using multiview 
radiomics and deep learning method.
METHODS: In this study, 140 NSCLC patients were enrolled in this retrospective 
study and randomly divided into training and test sets. Univariate and multiple 
analysis method were used step by step to establish the clinical model; Then a 
multiview radiomics modeling scheme was designed, in which the optimal input 
feature set was determined by subcategorizing radiomics features (C1: original; 
C2: LoG and C3: wavelet) and comparison of corresponding radiomics model. The 
minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) selection and the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used for the feature 
selection and construction of each radiomics model (Rad). Next, an end-to-end 
ResNet18 architecture and transfer learning techniques were designed to 
construct a deep learning model (DL). Subsequently, the screened clinical risk 
factors and constructed Rad and DL models were combined and compared and a 
nomogram was constructed. Finally, the diagnostic performance of all constructed 
models were evaluated and compared using receiver operating characteristic curve 
(ROC) analysis, Delong test, Calibration analysis, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and 
decision curves, respectively.
RESULTS: Carcinoma Embryonic Antigen level and spiculation were screened to make 
up the Clinical model, while 7 radiomics features in the optimal input feature 
set C2+C3 were selected to construct the Rad. DL was constructed by training on 
1.8 million natural images and small sample data of our N2 lymph node volume of 
interest (VOI) images. Except for the Clinical model, all other models showed 
good predictive accuracy and consistency in both training set and test set. DL 
(area under curve (AUC): 0.83) was better than Rad (AUC: 0.76) in predictive 
accuracy, but their difference was not significant (p = 0.45). The combined 
models showed better diagnostic performance than the model only clinical or 
image risk factors were used (AUC for Clinical, Rad+DL, Rad+Clinical, 
DL+Clinical, Rad+DL+Clinical were respectively 0.66, 0.86, 0.82, 0.86, 0.88). 
Finally, the Rad+DL+Clinical model with the best diagnostic performance was 
selected to draw the final nomogram for clinical use.
CONCLUSION: This study proposes a nomogram based on multiview radiomics, deep 
learning and clinical features that can be efficiently used to quantitively 
predict presurgical N2 diseases in patients with clinical stage I-II NSCLC. This

1464,"Synthetic biology uses genetically encoded devices and circuits to implement 
novel complex functions in living cells and organisms. A hallmark of these 
genetic circuits is the interaction among their individual parts, according to 
predefined rules, to process cellular information and produce a circuit output 
or response. As the number of individual components in a genetic circuit 
increases, so does the number of interactions needed to achieve the correct 
behavior, and hence, a greater need to fine-tune the levels of expression of 
each component. Transcriptional promoters play a key regulatory role in genetic 
circuits, as they influence the levels of RNA and proteins produced. In 
multicellular organisms, such as plants, they can also determine developmental, 
spatial, and tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. The 35S promoter from 
the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV 35S) is widely used in plant biotechnology to 
direct high levels of gene expression in a variety of plant species. We produced 
a library of 21 variants of the CaMV 35S promoter by introducing all single 
nucleotide substitutions to the promoter's TATA box sequence. We then 
characterized the activity of all variants in homozygous transgenic plants and 
showed that some of these variants have lower activity than the wild type in 
plants. These promoter variants could be used to fine-tune the behavior of 
synthetic genetic circuits in plants."
1465,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse is one of the most common and significant 
adverse events following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(allo-HCT). Downregulation of major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) surface 
expression on AML blasts may represent a mechanism of escape from the 
graft-versus-malignancy effect and facilitate relapse. We hypothesized that 
T-cell immunotherapies targeting AML antigens would upregulate MHC-II surface 
expression via localized release of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), a protein known to 
upregulate MHC-II expression via JAK-STAT signaling. We demonstrate that 
flotetuzumab (FLZ), a CD123xCD3 bispecific DART® molecule, and chimeric antigen 
receptor expressing T-cells (CAR-T) targeting CD123, CD33, or CD371 upregulate 
MHC-II surface expression in vitro on a THP-1 AML cell line with intermediate 
MHC-II expression and four primary AML samples from patients relapsing after HCT 
with low MHC-II expression. We additionally show that FLZ upregulates MHC-II 
expression in a patient-derived xenograft model and in relapsed/refractory AML 
patients treated with flotetuzumab in a clinical trial. Finally, we report that 
FLZ-induced MHC-II upregulation is mediated by IFN-γ. In conclusion, we provide 
evidence that T-cell immunotherapies targeting relapsed AML can kill AML via 
both MHC-independent mechanisms and by an MHC-dependent mechanism through local 
release of IFN-γ and subsequent upregulation of MHC-II expression."
1466,"INTRODUCTION: Autophagy is a highly conservative self-degradative process. It 
aims at elimination-impaired proteins and cellular organelles. Previous research 
confirmed the autophagy role in cancer pathogenesis.
AREAS COVERED: This article discusses the role of autophagy in the development 
of AML. Autophagy seems to be a 'double-sword' mechanism, hence, either its 
suppression or induction could promote neoplasm growth. This mechanism could 
also be the aim of the 'molecular targeted therapy'. Chemo- and radiotherapy 
induce cellular stress in neoplasm cells with subsequent autophagy suppression. 
Simultaneously, it is claimed that the autophagy suppression increases 
chemosensitivity 'in neoplastic cells. Some agents, like bortezomib, in turn 
could promote autophagy process, e.g., in AML (acute myeloid leukemia). However, 
currently there are not many studies focusing on the role of autophagy in 
patients suffering for AML. In this review, we summarize the research done so 
far on the role of autophagy in the development of AML.
EXPERT OPINION: The analysis of autophagy genes expression profiling in AML 
could be a relevant factor in the diagnostic process and treatment 
'individualization'. Autophagy modulation seems to be a relevant target in the 
oncological therapy - it could limit disease progression and increase the 
effectiveness of treatment."
1467,"Endothelin receptor A (ETA), a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is a 
promising tumor-associated antigen due to its close association with the 
progression and metastasis of many types of cancer, such as colorectal, breast, 
lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer. However, only small-molecule drugs have been 
developed as ETA antagonists with anticancer effects. In a previous study, we 
identified an antibody (AG8) with highly selective binding to human ETA through 
screening of a human naïve immune antibody library. Although both in vitro and 
in vivo experiments indicated that the identified AG8 had anticancer effects, 
there is a need for improvement in biochemical and physicochemical properties 
such as the ETA binding affinity, thermostability, and productivity. In this 
study, we engineered the framework regions of AG8 and isolated an anti-ETA 
antibody (MJF1) exhibiting significantly improved thermostability and ETA 
binding affinity. Subsequently, our previously isolated PFc29, an Fc variant 
with an enhanced pH-dependent human FcRn binding profile, was introduced to 
MJF1, and the resulting Fc-engineered anti-ETA antibody (MJF1-PFc29) inhibited 
the proliferation of tumor cells comparably to MJF1 and showed a 4.2-fold 
increased serum half-life in human FcRn transgenic mice. Moreover, MJF1-PFc29 
elicited higher tumor growth inhibition in colorectal cancer xenograft mice 
compared to MJF1. Our results demonstrate that the engineered human anti-ETA 
antibody MJF1-PFc29 has great therapeutic potential and high antitumor potency 
against various types of cancers including colorectal cancer."
1468,"Natamycin is a macrolide polyene antibiotic, characterized by a potent broad 
spectrum antifungal activity and low toxicity. However, it is not used for the 
treatment of systemic mycoses due to its low bioavailability and low solubility 
in aqueous solutions. In order to create new semisynthetic antifungal agents for 
treatment of mycoses, a series of water-soluble amides of natamycin were 
synthesized. Antifungal activities of natamycin derivatives were investigated 
against Candida spp., including a panel of Candida auris clinical isolates and 
filamentous fungi. Toxicity for mammalian cells was assayed by monitoring 
antiproliferative activity against human postnatal fibroblasts (HPF) and human 
embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). By comparing leakage of contents from 
ergosterol versus cholesterol containing vesicles, a ratio that characterizes 
the efficacy and safety of natamycin and its derivatives was determined (EI, 
efficiency index). Ability of all tested semisynthetic natamycines to prevent 
proliferation of the yeast Candida spp. cells was comparable or even slightly 
higher to those of parent antibiotic. Interestingly, amide 8 was more potent 
than natamycin (1) against all tested C. auris strains (MIC values 2 μg/mL vs 8 
μg/mL, respectively). Among 7 derivatives, amide 10 with long lipophilic side 
chains showed the highest EI and strong antifungal activity in vitro but was 
more toxic against HPF. In vivo experiments with amide 8 showed in vivo efficacy 
on a mouse candidemia model with a larger LD50/ED50 ratio in comparison to 
amphotericin B."
1469,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate treatment modalities of T4 larynx cancer in older adults 
using SEER-Medicare.
METHODS: The database was queried for patients aged 66 and older with 
nonmetastatic T4 laryngeal squamous cell cancer from 2006 to 2015. Treatment 
modalities compared were surgery plus chemoradiation (SCR), surgery plus 
radiation (SR), chemoradiation (CR), surgery (S), and radiation (R). 
Multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to explore the 
relationship of treatment modality and survival. Total cancer-related costs were 
calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 438 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients receiving CR 
or SR had similar CSS to SCR (HR 1.36 and HR 1.24, respectively). Those 
receiving S (HR 2.00) or R (HR 2.41) had significantly worse CSS. Similar 
findings were observed for OS. Cancer care-related costs were not significantly 
different but highest in SCR ($162215) and lowest in R ($121421).
CONCLUSION: Older patients with T4 larynx cancer had similar survival rates when 
treated with CR, SR, and SCR. Average total health care costs were not 
significantly different between modalities. Patients not eligible for 
triple-modality could consider these other treatment options."
1470,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is one of the 
leading causes of death in developing countries. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria 
(NTM) infections are rising and prey upon patients with structural lung diseases 
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis. All 
mycobacterial infections require lengthy treatment regimens with undesirable 
side effects. Therefore, new antimycobacterial compounds with novel mechanisms 
of action are urgently needed. Published indole-2-carboxamides (IC) with 
suggested inhibition of the essential transporter MmpL3 showed good potency 
against whole-cell M.tb, yet had poor aqueous solubility. This project focused 
on retaining the required MmpL3 inhibitory pharmacophore and increasing the 
molecular heteroatom percentage by reducing lipophilic atoms. We evaluated 
pyrrole, mandelic acid, imidazole, and acetamide functional groups coupled to 
lipophilic head groups, where lead acetamide-based compounds maintained high 
potency against mycobacterial pathogens, had improved in vitro ADME profiles 
over their indole-2-carboxamide analogs, were non-cytotoxic, and were determined 
to be MmpL3 inhibitors."
1471,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has comprehensive contributions to maintaining the normal 
operation and stability of organisms, and it also occurs in the wastewater 
environment and is related to the deterioration of foodstuffs. Therefore, 
developing high-sensitive detection techniques for tracing H2S is promising and 
meaningful. Inspired by this, a novel nopinone-based fluorescent probe NPS for 
the recognition of H2S was designed and synthesized with excellent sensitivity, 
low limit of detection (79 nM), good selectivity, and wide pH range (5-9). NPS 
could emit strong yellow fluorescence and its emission intensity showed a 
remarkable augmentation at 520 nm upon the supplement of H2S. Furthermore, the 
recognition mechanism of NPS for H2S was verified by the HRMS analysis, 1H NMR 
spectra titration, and DFT computation. What is more, NPS also had broad 
applications in the monitoring of real water samples, red wine, beer, and eggs 
samples, which showed its development prospect and value in environmental 
pollution, foodstuffs quality analysis fields. NPS also was applied to monitor 
trace exogenous H2S and bioimaging in living cells and zebrafish."
1472,"Recently, hyperbolic lattices that tile the negatively curved hyperbolic plane 
emerged as a new paradigm of synthetic matter, and their energy levels were 
characterized by a band structure in a four- (or higher-) dimensional momentum 
space. To explore the uncharted topological aspects arising in hyperbolic band 
theory, we here introduce elementary models of hyperbolic topological band 
insulators: the hyperbolic Haldane model and the hyperbolic Kane-Mele model; 
both obtained by replacing the hexagonal cells of their Euclidean counterparts 
by octagons. Their nontrivial topology is revealed by computing topological 
invariants in both position and momentum space. The bulk-boundary correspondence 
is evidenced by comparing bulk and boundary density of states, by modeling 
propagation of edge excitations, and by their robustness against disorder."
1473,"We report on a novel, noninvasive method applying Thomson scattering to measure 
the evolution of the electron beam energy inside a laser-plasma accelerator with 
high spatial resolution. The determination of the local electron energy enabled 
the in-situ detection of the acting acceleration fields without altering the 
final beam state. In this Letter we demonstrate that the accelerating fields 
evolve from (265±119)  GV/m to (9±4)  GV/m in a plasma density ramp. The 
presented data show excellent agreement with particle-in-cell simulations. This 
method provides new possibilities for detecting the dynamics of plasma-based 
accelerators and their optimization."
1474,"Cytoskeletal networks form complex intracellular structures. Here we investigate 
a minimal model for filament-motor mixtures in which motors act as depolymerases 
and thereby regulate filament length. Combining agent-based simulations and 
hydrodynamic equations, we show that resource-limited length regulation drives 
the formation of filament clusters despite the absence of mechanical 
interactions between filaments. Even though the orientation of individual 
remains fixed, collective filament orientation emerges in the clusters, aligned 
orthogonal to their interfaces."
1475,"Diffusion of proteins on length scales of their size is crucial for 
understanding the machinery of living cells. X-ray photon correlation 
spectroscopy (XPCS) is currently the only way to access long-time collective 
diffusion on these length scales, but radiation damage so far limits the use in 
biological systems. We apply a new approach to use XPCS to measure cage 
relaxation in crowded α-crystallin solutions. This allows us to correct for 
radiation effects, obtain missing information on long time diffusion, and 
support the fundamental analogy between protein and colloid dynamical arrest."
1476,"The Klein paradox consists in the perfect tunneling of relativistic particles 
through high potential barriers. It is responsible for the exceptional 
conductive properties of graphene. It was recently studied in atomic condensates 
and topological photonics and phononics. While in theory the perfect tunneling 
holds only for normal incidence, so far the angular dependence of the Klein 
tunneling and its strong variation with the barrier height were not measured 
experimentally. In this Letter, we capitalize on the versatility of atomic vapor 
cells with paraxial beam propagation and index patterning by electromagnetically 
induced transparency. We report the first experimental observation of perfect 
Klein transmission in a 2D photonic system (photonic graphene) at normal 
incidence and measure the angular dependence. Counterintuitively, but in 
agreement with the Dirac equation, we observe that the decay of the Klein 
transmission versus angle is suppressed by increasing the barrier height, a key 
result for the conductivity of graphene and its analogs."
1477,"In molecular simulation and fluid mechanics, the coupling of a particle domain 
with a continuum representation of its embedding environment is an ongoing 
challenge. In this Letter, we show a novel approach where the latest version of 
the adaptive resolution scheme (AdResS), with noninteracting tracers as 
particles' reservoir, is combined with a fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) solver. 
The resulting algorithm, supported by a solid mathematical model, allows for a 
physically consistent exchange of matter and energy between the particle domain 
and its fluctuating continuum reservoir. Numerical tests are performed to show 
the validity of the algorithm. Differently from previous algorithms of the same 
kind, the current approach allows for simulations where, in addition to density 
fluctuations, also thermal fluctuations can be accounted for, thus large complex 
molecular systems, as, for example, hydrated biological membranes in a thermal 
field, can now be efficiently treated."
1478,"The problem of predicting a protein's 3D structure from its primary amino acid 
sequence is a longstanding challenge in structural biology. Recently, approaches 
like alphafold have achieved remarkable performance on this task by combining 
deep learning techniques with coevolutionary data from multiple sequence 
alignments of related protein sequences. The use of coevolutionary information 
is critical to these models' accuracy, and without it their predictive 
performance drops considerably. In living cells, however, the 3D structure of a 
protein is fully determined by its primary sequence and the biophysical laws 
that cause it to fold into a low-energy configuration. Thus, it should be 
possible to predict a protein's structure from only its primary sequence by 
learning an approximate biophysical energy function. We provide evidence that 
alphafold has learned such an energy function, and uses coevolution data to 
solve the global search problem of finding a low-energy conformation. We 
demonstrate that alphafold'slearned energy function can be used to rank the 
quality of candidate protein structures with state-of-the-art accuracy, without 
using any coevolution data. Finally, we explore several applications of this 
energy function, including the prediction of protein structures without multiple 
sequence alignments."
1479,"The increased use of next-generation sequencing has expanded our understanding 
of the involvement and prevalence of mosaicism in genetic disorders. We describe 
a total of eleven cases: nine in which mosaic variants detected by genome 
sequencing (GS) and/or targeted gene panels (TGPs) were considered to be 
causative for the proband's phenotype, and two of apparent parental mosaicism. 
Variants were identified in the following genes: PHACTR1, SCN8A, KCNT1, CDKL5, 
NEXMIF, CUX1, TSC2, GABRB2, and SMARCB1. In addition, we identified one large 
duplication including three genes, UBE3A, GABRB3, and MAGEL2, and one large 
deletion including deletion of ARFGAP1, EEF1A2, CHRNA4, and KCNQ2. All patients 
were enrolled in the NYCKidSeq study, a research program studying the 
communication of genomic information in clinical care, as well as the clinical 
utility and diagnostic yield of GS for children with suspected genetic disorders 
in diverse populations in New York City. We observed variability in the 
correlation between reported variant allele fraction and the severity of the 
patient's phenotype, although we were not able to determine the mosaicism 
percentage in clinically relevant tissue(s). Although our study was not 
sufficiently powered to assess differences in mosaicism detection between the 
two testing modalities, we saw a trend toward better detection by GS as compared 
with TGP testing. This case series supports the importance of mosaicism in 
childhood-onset genetic conditions and informs guidelines for laboratory and 
clinical interpretation of mosaic variants detected by GS."
1480,"As an effective approach for materials synthesis, bipolar electrochemistry has 
been earning a renewed interest nowadays thanks to its unique features compared 
to conventional electrochemistry. Indeed, the wireless mode of electrode 
reactions and the generation of a gradient potential distribution above the 
bipolar electrode are among the most appealing qualities of bipolar 
electrochemistry. In particular, the gradient potential distribution is a highly 
attractive characteristic for the fabrication of surfaces with gradients in 
their chemical properties or molecular functionalities. Herein, we report the 
high-throughput electrosynthesis of gradient polypyrrole films by means of a new 
electrochemical cell design named the single-electrode electrochemical system 
(SEES). SEESs are made by attaching an inert plastic board with holes onto an 
indium tin oxide electrode, constructing multiple microelectrochemical cells on 
the same electrode. This type of arrangement enables parallel electrochemical 
reactions to be carried out simultaneously and controlled in a contactless 
manner by a single electrode. Several experimental conditions for polypyrrole 
film growth were extensively investigated. Furthermore, the gradient property of 
the polymer films was evaluated by thickness determination, surface morphology 
analysis, and contact angle measurements. The use of SEES has been demonstrated 
as a convenient and cost-effective strategy for high-throughput electrosynthesis 
and electroanalytical applications and has opened up a new door for gradient 
film preparation via a rapid condition screening process."
1481,"TNF mediates a variety of biological processes including cellular proliferation, 
inflammatory responses, and cell death and is therefore associated with numerous 
pathologies including autoinflammatory diseases and septic shock. The 
inflammatory and cell death responses to TNF have been studied extensively 
downstream of TNF-R1 and are believed to rely on the formation of 
proinflammatory complex I and prodeath complex II, respectively. We recently 
identified a similar multimeric complex downstream of TLR4, termed the 
TRIFosome, that regulates inflammation and cell death in response to LPS or 
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. We present evidence of a role for the TRIFosome 
downstream of TNF-R1, independent of TLR3 or TLR4 engagement. Specifically, 
TNF-induced cell death and inflammation in murine macrophages were driven by the 
TLR4 adaptor TRIF and the LPS co-receptor CD14, highlighting an important role 
for these proteins beyond TLR-mediated immune responses. Via immunoprecipitation 
and visualization of TRIF-specific puncta, we demonstrated TRIF- and 
CD14-dependent formation of prodeath and proinflammatory complexes in response 
to TNF. Extending these findings, in a murine TNF-induced sepsis model, TRIF and 
CD14 deficiency decreased systemic inflammation, reduced organ pathology, and 
improved survival. The outcome of TRIF activation was cell specific, because 
TNF-induced lethality was mediated by neutrophils and macrophages responding to 
TNF in a TRIF-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that in addition to their 
crucial role in TNF production, myeloid cells are central to TNF toxicity and 
position TRIF and CD14 as universal components of receptor-mediated immune 
responses."
1482,"It is urgent to develop more effective mRNA vaccines against the emerging severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants owing to the 
immune escape. Here, we constructed a novel mRNA delivery system [IC8/Mn lipid 
nanoparticles (IC8/Mn LNPs)]with high immunogenicity, via introducing a 
stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist [manganese (Mn)] based on a newly 
synthesized ionizable lipid (IC8). It was found that Mn can not only promote 
maturation of antigen-presenting cells via activating STING pathway but also 
improve mRNA expression by facilitating lysosomal escape for the first time. 
Subsequently, IC8/Mn LNPs loaded with mRNA encoding the Spike protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 Delta or Omicron variant (IC8/Mn@D or IC8/Mn@O) were prepared. Both 
mRNA vaccines induced substantial specific immunoglobulin G responses against 
Delta or Omicron. IC8/Mn@D displayed strong pseudovirus neutralization ability, 
T helper 1-biased immune responses, and good safety. It can be concluded that 
IC8/Mn LNPs have great potential for developing Mn-coordinated mRNA vaccines 
with robust immunogenicity and good safety."
1483,"Treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) requires lifelong daily therapy. 
However, suboptimal adherence to the existing daily therapy has led to the need 
for ultralong-acting antivirals. A lipophilic and hydrophobic ProTide was made 
by replacing the alanyl isopropyl ester present in tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 
with a docosyl phenyl alanyl ester, now referred to as M1TFV. NM1TFV and 
nanoformulated TAF (NTAF) nanocrystals were formulated by high-pressure 
homogenization. A single intramuscular injection of NM1TFV, but not NTAF, 
delivered at a dose of TFV equivalents (168 milligrams per kilogram) 
demonstrated monthslong antiviral activities in both HBV-transgenic and human 
hepatocyte transplanted TK-NOG mice. The suppression of HBV DNA in blood was 
maintained for 3 months. Laboratory experiments on HBV-transfected HepG2.2.15 
cells affirmed the animal results and the critical role of docosanol in the 
sustained NM1TFV antiviral responses. These results provide clear ""proof of 
concept"" toward an emerging therapeutic paradigm for the treatment and 
prevention of HBV infection."
1484,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) egress occurs by 
lysosomal exocytosis. We show that the Spike D614G mutation enhances Spike 
trafficking to lysosomes, drives Spike-mediated reprogramming of lysosomes, and 
reduces cell surface Spike expression by ~3-fold. D614G is not a human-specific 
adaptation. Rather, it is an adaptation to the earlier furin cleavage site 
insertion (FCSI) mutation that occurred at the genesis of SARS-CoV-2. While 
advantageous to the virus, furin cleavage of spike has deleterious effects on 
spike structure and function, inhibiting its trafficking to lysosomes and 
impairing its infectivity by the transmembrane serine protease 
2(TMPRSS2)-independent, endolysosomal pathway. D614G restores spike trafficking 
to lysosomes and enhances the earliest events in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, while 
spike mutations that restore SARS-CoV-2's TMPRSS2-independent infectivity 
restore spike's trafficking to lysosomes. Together, these and other results show 
that D614G is an intragenic suppressor of deleterious traits linked to the FCSI 
and lend additional support to the endolysosomal model of SARS-CoV-2 egress and 
entry."
1485,"The 26S proteasome recognizes thousands of appropriate protein substrates in 
eukaryotic cells through attached ubiquitin chains and uses its adenosine 
triphosphatase (ATPase) motor for mechanical unfolding and translocation into a 
proteolytic chamber. Here, we used single-molecule Förster resonance energy 
transfer measurements to monitor the conformational dynamics of the proteasome, 
observe individual substrates during their progression toward degradation, and 
elucidate how these processes are regulated by ubiquitin chains. Rapid 
transitions between engagement- and processing-competent proteasome 
conformations control substrate access to the ATPase motor. Ubiquitin chain 
binding functions as an allosteric regulator to slow these transitions, 
stabilize the engagement-competent state, and aid substrate capture to 
accelerate degradation initiation. Upon substrate engagement, the proteasome 
remains in processing-competent states for translocation and unfolding, except 
for apparent motor slips when encountering stably folded domains. Our studies 
revealed how ubiquitin chains allosterically regulate degradation initiation, 
which ensures substrate selectivity in a crowded cellular environment."
1486,"The molecular mechanisms that maintain cellular identities and prevent 
dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation remain mysterious. However, both 
processes are transiently used during animal regeneration. Therefore, organisms 
that regenerate their organs, appendages, or even their whole body offer a 
fruitful paradigm to investigate the regulation of cell fate stability. Here, we 
used Hydra as a model system and show that Zic4, whose expression is controlled 
by Wnt3/β-catenin signaling and the Sp5 transcription factor, plays a key role 
in tentacle formation and tentacle maintenance. Reducing Zic4 expression 
suffices to induce transdifferentiation of tentacle epithelial cells into foot 
epithelial cells. This switch requires the reentry of tentacle battery cells 
into the cell cycle without cell division and is accompanied by degeneration of 
nematocytes embedded in these cells. These results indicate that maintenance of 
cell fate by a Wnt-controlled mechanism is a key process both during homeostasis 
and during regeneration."
1487,"Epigenetic dysregulation of cell cycle is a hallmark of tumorigenesis in 
multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nonetheless, the 
epigenetic mechanisms underlying the aberrant cell cycle signaling and 
therapeutic response remain unclear. Here, we used an epigenetics-focused CRISPR 
interference screen and identified ACTR5 (actin-related protein 5), a component 
of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, to be essential for HCC tumor 
progression. Suppression of ACTR5 activated CDKN2A expression, ablated 
CDK/E2F-driven cell cycle signaling, and attenuated HCC tumor growth. 
Furthermore, high-density CRISPR gene tiling scans revealed a distinct 
HCC-specific usage of ACTR5 and its interacting partner IES6 compared to the 
other INO80 complex members, suggesting an INO80-independent mechanism of 
ACTR5/IES6 in supporting the HCC proliferation. Last, our study revealed the 
synergism between ACTR5/IES6-targeting and pharmacological inhibition of CDK in 
treating HCC. These results indicate that the dynamic interplay between 
epigenetic regulators, tumor suppressors, and cell cycle machinery could provide 
novel opportunities for combinational HCC therapy."
1488,"The bidirectional controller of the thermoregulatory center in the preoptic area 
(POA) is unknown. Using rats, here, we identify prostaglandin EP3 
receptor-expressing POA neurons (POAEP3R neurons) as a pivotal bidirectional 
controller in the central thermoregulatory mechanism. POAEP3R neurons are 
activated in response to elevated ambient temperature but inhibited by 
prostaglandin E2, a pyrogenic mediator. Chemogenetic stimulation of POAEP3R 
neurons at room temperature reduces body temperature by enhancing heat 
dissipation, whereas inhibition of them elicits hyperthermia involving brown fat 
thermogenesis, mimicking fever. POAEP3R neurons innervate sympathoexcitatory 
neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) via tonic (ceaseless) inhibitory 
signaling. Although many POAEP3R neuronal cell bodies express a glutamatergic 
messenger RNA marker, their axons in the DMH predominantly release 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and their GABAergic terminals are increased by 
chronic heat exposure. These findings demonstrate that tonic GABAergic 
inhibitory signaling from POAEP3R neurons is a fundamental determinant of body 
temperature for thermal homeostasis and fever."
1489,"Translation control is essential in balancing hematopoietic precursors and 
differentiation; however, the mechanisms underlying this program are poorly 
understood. We found that the activity of the major cap-binding protein eIF4E is 
unexpectedly regulated in a dynamic manner throughout erythropoiesis that is 
uncoupled from global protein synthesis rates. Moreover, eIF4E activity directs 
erythroid maturation, and increased eIF4E expression maintains cells in an early 
erythroid state associated with a translation program driving the expression of 
PTPN6 and Igf2bp1. A cytosine-enriched motif in the 5' untranslated region is 
important for eIF4E-mediated translation specificity. Therefore, selective 
translation of key target genes necessary for the maintenance of early erythroid 
states by eIF4E highlights a unique mechanism used by hematopoietic precursors 
to rapidly elicit erythropoietic maturation upon need."
1490,"The human adenosine A2B receptor (A2BR) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor 
that is involved in several major physiological and pathological processes 
throughout the body. A2BR recognizes its ligands adenosine and NECA with 
relatively low affinity, but the detailed mechanism for its ligand recognition 
and signaling is still elusive. Here, we present two structures determined by 
cryo-electron microscopy of A2BR bound to its agonists NECA and BAY60-6583, each 
coupled to an engineered Gs protein. The structures reveal conserved orthosteric 
binding pockets with subtle differences, whereas the selectivity or specificity 
can mainly be attributed to regions extended from the orthosteric pocket. We 
also found that BAY60-6583 occupies a secondary pocket, where residues V2506.51 
and N2737.36 were two key determinants for its selectivity against A2BR. This 
study offers a better understanding of ligand selectivity for the adenosine 
receptor family and provides a structural template for further development of 
A2BR ligands for related diseases."
1491,"CD73, a cell surface-bound nucleotidase, facilitates extracellular adenosine 
formation by hydrolyzing 5'-AMP to adenosine. Several studies have shown that 
CD73 plays an essential role in immune escape, cell proliferation and tumor 
angiogenesis, making it an attractive target for cancer therapies. However, 
there are limited clinical benefits associated with the mainstream enzymatic 
inhibitors of CD73, suggesting that the mechanism underlying the role of CD73 in 
tumor progression is more complex than anticipated, and further investigation is 
necessary. In this study, CD73 is found to overexpress in the cytoplasm of 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and promotes metastasis in a 
nucleotidase-independent manner, which cannot be restrained by the CD73 
monoclonal antibodies or small-molecule enzymatic inhibitors. Furthermore, CD73 
promotes the metastasis of PDAC by binding to the E3 ligase TRIM21, competing 
with the Snail for its binding site. Additionally, a CD73 transcriptional 
inhibitor, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is more effective 
than the CD73 blocking antibody for the treatment of PDAC metastasis. Diclofenac 
also enhances the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine in the spontaneous KPC 
(LSL-KrasG12D/+ , LSL-Trp53R172H/+ , and Pdx-1-Cre) pancreatic cancer model. 
Therefore, diclofenac may be an effective anti-CD73 therapy, when used alone or 
in combination with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimen, for metastatic PDAC."
1492,"This article is part of the Dendritic Cell Guidelines article series, which 
provides a collection of state-of-the-art protocols for the preparation, 
phenotype analysis by flow cytometry, generation, fluorescence microscopy, and 
functional characterization of mouse and human dendritic cells (DC) from 
lymphoid organs and various non-lymphoid tissues. Within this article, detailed 
protocols are presented that allow for the generation of single cell suspensions 
from human lymphohematopoietic tissues including blood, spleen, thymus, and 
tonsils with a focus on the subsequent analysis of DC via flow cytometry, as 
well as flow cytometric cell sorting of primary human DC. Further, prepared 
single cell suspensions as well as cell sorter-purified DC can be subjected to 
other applications including cellular enrichment procedures, RNA sequencing, 
functional assays, and many more. While all protocols were written by 
experienced scientists who routinely use them in their work, this article was 
also peer-reviewed by leading experts and approved by all co-authors, making it 
an essential resource for basic and clinical DC immunologists."
1493,"This article is part of the Dendritic Cell Guidelines article series, which

phenotype analysis by flow cytometry, generation, fluorescence microscopy, and 
functional characterization of mouse and human dendritic cells (DC) from 
lymphoid organs and various non-lymphoid tissues. Recent studies have provided 
evidence for an increasing number of phenotypically distinct conventional DC 
(cDC) subsets that on one hand exhibit a certain functional plasticity, but on 
the other hand are characterized by their tissue- and context-dependent 
functional specialization. Here, we describe a selection of assays for the 
functional characterization of mouse and human cDC. The first two protocols 
illustrate analysis of cDC endocytosis and metabolism, followed by guidelines 
for transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of cDC populations. Then, a 
larger group of assays describes the characterization of cDC migration in vitro, 
ex vivo, and in vivo. The final guidelines measure cDC inflammasome and antigen 
(cross)-presentation activity. While all protocols were written by experienced 
scientists who routinely use them in their work, this article was also 
peer-reviewed by leading experts and approved by all co-authors, making it an 
essential resource for basic and clinical DC immunologists."

1495,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has higher molecular heterogeneity and 
metastatic potential and the poorest prognosis. Because of limited therapeutics 
against TNBC, irradiation (IR) therapy is still a common treatment option for 
patients with lymph nodes or brain metastasis. Thus, it is urgent to develop 
strategies to enhance the sensitivity of TNBC tumors to low-dose IR. Here, the 
authors report that E3 ubiquitin ligase Ring finger protein 126 (RNF126) is 
important for IR-induced ATR-CHK1 pathway activation to enhance DNA damage 
repair (DDR). Mechanistically, RNF126 physically associates with the 
MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex and ubiquitinates MRE11 at K339 and K480 to 
increase its DNA exonuclease activity, subsequent RPA binding, and ATR 
phosphorylation, promoting sustained DDR in a homologous recombination 
repair-prone manner. Accordingly, depletion of RNF126 leads to increased genomic 
instability and radiation sensitivity in both TNBC cells and mice. Furthermore, 
it is found that RNF126 expression is induced by IR activating the 
HER2-AKT-NF-κB pathway and targeting RNF126 expression with dihydroartemisinin 
significantly improves the sensitivity of TNBC tumors in the brain to IR 
treatment in vivo. Together, these results reveal that RNF126-mediated MRE11 
ubiquitination is a critical regulator of the DDR, which provides a promising 
target for improving the sensitivity of TNBC to radiotherapy."
1496,"Organic semiconductor-microbial photosynthetic biohybrid systems show great 
potential in light-driven biosynthesis. In such a system, an organic 
semiconductor is used to harvest solar energy and generate electrons, which can 
be further transported to microorganisms with a wide range of metabolic pathways 
for final biosynthesis. However, the lack of direct electron transport proteins 
in existing microorganisms hinders the hybrid system of photosynthesis. In this 
work, we have designed a photosynthetic biohybrid system based on transmembrane 
electron transport that can effectively deliver the electrons from organic 
semiconductor across the cell wall to the microbe. Biocompatible organic 
semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots) are used as photosensitizers to construct a 
ternary synergistic biochemical factory in collaboration with Ralstonia eutropha 
H16 (RH16) and electron shuttle neutral red (NR). Photogenerated electrons from 
Pdots promote the proportion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
(NADPH) through NR, driving the Calvin cycle of RH16 to convert CO2 into 
poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), with a yield of 21.3 ± 3.78 mg/L, almost 3 times 
higher than that of original RH16. This work provides a concept of an integrated 
photoactive biological factory based on organic semiconductor polymer 
dots/bacteria for valuable chemical production only using solar energy as the 
energy input."
1497,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare malignancy with a high 
prevalence in China. This study aimed to characterize the ICC tissues' bacterial 
metagenomics signature and explore its antitumor potential for cancer. In this 
study, 16S rRNA sequencing was carried out on 99 tissues to characterize the 
features of intratumoral microbiota, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) and multilevel validation. The presence of microbial DNA in tissues 
was determined using staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A Gram-positive aerobic bacterium, 
identified as Staphylococcus capitis, was cultured from fresh tissues. 
Meanwhile, scRNA-seq showed that intratumoral bacteria could be present in 
multiple cell types. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we identified a total of 
2,320,287 high-quality reads corresponding to 4,594 OTU (operational taxonomic 
units) sequences. The most abundant bacterial orders include Burkholderiales, 
Pseudomonadales, Xanthomonadales, Bacillales and Clostridiales. Alpha and Beta 
diversity analysis revealed specific features in different tissues. In addition, 
the content of Paraburkholderia fungorum was significantly higher in the 
paracancerous tissues and negatively correlated with CA199 (Carbohydrate 
antigen199) levels. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that 
P. fungorum possesses an antitumor activity against tumors. Metabolomics and 
transcriptomics showed that P. fungorum could inhibit tumor growth through 
alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. We determined the characteristic 
profile of the intratumoral microbiota and the antitumor effect of P. fungorum 
in ICC."
1498,"In the summer of 2021, we held a community workshop at the International 
Congress of Arabidopsis Research (ICAR) aimed at early career researchers and 
focused on values-based lab leadership. Here, we elaborate on ideas emerging 
from the workshop that we hope will allow current and future group leaders to 
reflect on and adjust to the rapidly evolving nature of the academic scientific 
enterprise."
1499,"Vacuum deposition is a solvent-free method suitable for growing thin films of 
metal halide perovskite (MHP) semiconductors. However, most reports of 
high-efficiency solar cells based on such vacuum-deposited MHP films incorporate 
solution-processed hole transport layers (HTLs), thereby complicating prospects 
of industrial upscaling and potentially affecting the overall device stability. 
In this work, we investigate organometallic copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and 
zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) as alternative, low-cost, and durable HTLs in 
all-vacuum-deposited solvent-free formamidinium-cesium lead triodide 
[CH(NH2)2]0.83Cs0.17PbI3 (FACsPbI3) perovskite solar cells. We elucidate that 
the CuPc HTL, when employed in an ""inverted"" p-i-n solar cell configuration, 
attains a solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of up to 13.9%. 
Importantly, unencapsulated devices as large as 1 cm2 exhibited excellent 
long-term stability, demonstrating no observable degradation in efficiency after 
more than 5000 h in storage and 3700 h under 85 °C thermal stressing in N2 
atmosphere."
1500,"During 3D bioprinting, when the gravitational force exceeds the buoyant force, 
cell sedimentation will be induced, resulting in local cell concentration change 
and cell aggregation which affect the printing performance. This paper aims at 
studying and quantifying cell aggregation and its effects on the droplet 
formation process during inkjet-based bioprinting and cell distribution after 
inkjet-based bioprinting. The major conclusions of this study are as follows: 
(1) Cell aggregation is a significant challenge during inkjet-based bioprinting 
by observing the percentage of individual cells after different printing times. 
In addition, as polymer concentration increases, the cell aggregation is 
suppressed. (2) As printing time and cell aggregation increase, the ligament 
length and droplet velocity generally decrease first and then increase due to 
the initial increase and subsequent decrease of the viscous effect. (3) As the 
printing time increases, both the maximum number of cells within one microsphere 
and the mean cell number have a significant increase, especially for low polymer 
concentrations such as 0.5% (w/v). In addition, the increased rate is the 
highest using the lowest polymer concentration of 0.5% (w/v) because of its 
highest cell sedimentation velocity."
1501,"In peripheral blood, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) contains circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA), which indicates molecular abnormalities in metastatic breast tumor 
tissue. The sequencing of cfDNA of Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients 
allows assessment of therapy response and noninvasive treatment. In the proposed 
study, clinically significant alterations in PIK3CA and TP53 genes associated 
with MBC resulting in a missense substitution of His1047Arg and Arg282Trp from 
an next-generation sequencing-based multi-gene panel were reported in a cfDNA of 
a patient with MBC. To investigate the impact of the reported mutation, we used 
molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, network analysis, and pathway 
analysis. Molecular Docking analysis determined the distinct binding pattern 
revealing H1047R-ATP complex has a higher number of Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and 
binding affinity with a slight difference compared to the PIK3CA-ATP complex. 
Following, molecular dynamics simulation for 200 ns, of which H1047R-ATP complex 
resulted in the instability of PIK3CA. Similarly, for TP53 mutant R282W, the 
zinc-free state (apo) and zinc-bounded (holo) complexes were investigated for 
conformational change between apo and holo complexes, of which the holo complex 
mutant R282W was unstable. To validate the conformational change of PIK3CA and 
TP53, 80% mutation of H1047R in the kinase domain of p110α expressed 
ubiquitously in PIK3CA protein that alters PI3K pathway, while R282W mutation in 
DNA binding helix (H2) region of P53 protein inhibits the transcription factor 
in P53 pathway causing MBC. According to our findings, the extrinsic (hypoxia, 
oxidative stress, and acidosis); intrinsic factors (MYC amplification) in PIK3CA 
and TP53 mutations will provide potential insights for developing novel 
therapeutic methods for MBC therapy."
1502,"Identifying effective reversal agents overcoming multidrug resistance with 
causal mechanisms from an efflux pump protein is of vital importance for 
enhanced tumor chemotherapy in clinic. To achieve this end, we construct a metal 
cluster-based probe, named clusterbody, to develop flow sorting-assisted 
single-cell mass spectrometry analysis. This clusterbody synthesized by 
biomimetic mineralization possesses an antibody-like property to selectively 
recognize an efflux pump protein. The intrinsic red fluorescence emission of the 
clusterbody facilitates fluorescence-activated high-throughput cell sorting of 
subpopulations with different multidrug resistance levels. Furthermore, based on 
the accurate formula of the clusterbody, the corresponding protein abundance at 
the single-cell level is determined through detecting gold content via precise 
signal amplification by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass 
spectrometry. Therefore, the effect of reversal agent treatment overcoming 
multidrug resistance is evaluated in a quantitative manner. This work opens a 
new avenue to identify reversal agents, shedding light on developing combined or 
synergetic tumor therapy."
1503,"Diaryl alcohol moieties are widespread in pharmaceuticals. Existing methods for 
the synthesis of diaryl alcohols require the use of pre-functionalized benzylic 
alcohols, aromatic aldehydes, or ketones as starting materials. Herein, the 
first convergent paired electrochemical approach to the direct hydroxylarylation 
of unactivated benzylic carbons (sp3/sp2/sp) is proposed. This protocol features 
direct functionalization of unactivated benzylic C(sp3)-H bonds and benzylic 
sp2/sp-carbons, mild conditions (open air, room temperature), an environmentally 
friendly procedure (without any external catalyst/mediator/additive), and direct 
access to sterically hindered alcohols from inexpensive and readily available 
alkyl/alkenyl/alkynylbenzenes. Mechanistic studies, including divided-cell 
experiments, isotope labeling, radical trapping, electron paramagnetic 
resonance, reaction kinetics, and cyclic voltammetry, strongly support the 
proposed radical-radical cross-coupling between transient ketyl radicals and 
persistent radical anions. Gram-scale synthesis and diversification of drug 
derivatives have visualized the tremendous potential of this protocol for 
practical applications."
1504,"Nonflammable eutectic solvents show great potential to enhance the 
concentrations of the redox-active materials and the cell voltages for redox 
flow batteries (RFBs). Herein, we report a promising redox-active eutectic 
electrolyte (1.5 M total redox species) with viologen and ferrocene derivatives 
where both of the redox reactions are reversible with a maximum open-circuit 
voltage of 1.35 V and an energy density of 15.1 Wh L-1, which is relevant to 
large-scale energy storage. The charge-discharge (from 75 to 25% state of 
charge) characteristics in a flow cell (0.15 M negolyte and 0.3 M posolyte) 
showed that it can be cycled with consistent discharge capacity for 12 h (19 
cycles), beyond which pressure-driven crossover between the posolyte and 
negolyte reservoirs leads to capacity decay. This study points to promising new 
directions toward eutectic electrolyte development for RFBs where we demonstrate 
increasing the polarity, functionalizing the redox molecules, and separating 
redox intermediates to prevent undesired side reactions can make improvements in 
operating cell voltage, energy density, and cyclability."
1505,"The use of digital image analysis and count regression models contributes to the 
reproducibility and rigor of histological studies in cardiovascular research. 
The use of formalized computer-based quantification strategies of histological 
images essentially removes potential researcher bias, allows for higher analysis 
throughput, and enables easy sharing of formalized quantification tools, 
contributing to research transparency and data transferability. Moreover, the 
use of count regression models rather than ratios in statistical analysis of 
cell population data incorporates the extent of sampling into analysis and 
acknowledges the non-gaussian nature of count distributions. Using 
quantification of proliferating cardiomyocytes in embryonic murine hearts as an 
example, we describe how these improvements can be implemented using open-source 
artificial intelligence-based image analysis tools and novel count regression 
models to efficiently analyze real-life data."
1506,"Diabetes increases the risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Greater 
hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after stroke is associated with vasoregression 
and cognitive decline in male diabetic rats. Iron chelator deferoxamine (DFX) 
prevents vasoregression and improves outcomes. While diabetic female rats 
develop greater HT, its impact on post-stroke cerebrovascularization and 
cognitive outcomes remained unknown. We hypothesized that diabetes mediates 
pathological neovascularization, and DFX attenuates post-stroke cerebrovascular 
remodeling and improves neurological outcomes in female diabetic rats. Female 
control and diabetic animals were treated with DFX or vehicle for 7 days after 
stroke. Vascular indices, microglial activation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
integrity were evaluated on Day 14. Results from diabetic female rats were 
partially compared to our previously published findings in male counterparts. 
Hemin-induced programmed cell death was studied in male and female brain 
microvascular endothelial cell lines (BMVEC). There was no vasoregression after 
stroke in either control or diabetic female animals. DFX prevented 
diabetes-mediated gliovascular remodeling and compromised BBB integrity while 
improving memory function in diabetes. Comparisons of female and male rats 
indicated sex differences in cognitive and vascular outcomes. Hemin mediated 
ferroptosis in both male and female BMVECs. DFX improved survival but had 
differential effects on ferroptosis signaling in female and male cells. These 
results suggest that stroke and associated HT do not affect 
cerebrovascularization in diabetic female rats, but iron chelation may provide a 
novel therapeutic strategy in the prevention of post-stroke memory impairment in 
females with diabetes via the preservation of gliovascular integrity and 
improvement of endothelial cell survival."
1507,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy is increasingly 
recognized as a promising novel therapeutic concept in inflammatory and 
autoimmune diseases, in particular in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). As 
IL-2 is indispensable for the growth and survival of regulatory T cells (Treg), 
deficiency of this regulatory cytokine plays a significant role in immune 
dysregulation and breach of tolerance in SLE. Recovery of Treg activity by 
low-dose IL-2 therapy directly interferes with the immune pathology in SLE and 
thus can be considered a targeted treatment approach with a unique and 
physiological mode of action.
RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, the pathophysiological rationales behind the 
concept of low-dose IL-2 therapy in SLE will be explained and major advances in 
translational research and the clinical development of low-dose IL-2 therapy 
focusing on the results from two recent, randomized and placebo-controlled phase 
2 trials will be highlighted.
SUMMARY: Several clinical studies including two recent randomized trials have 
proven the very good safety profile of low-dose IL-2 therapy and its capability 
to selectively recover and expand the Treg population in patients with active 
SLE. Given the emerging evidence for the clinical potential of low-dose IL-2 
therapy in SLE, these studies strongly confirm the pathophysiological concept 
behind this targeted therapeutic approach in SLE and provide a robust basis for 
establishing further in-depth and confirmatory clinical trials testing the 
application of low-dose IL-2 in SLE and other autoimmune diseases."
1508,"Immunological agents that supplement or modulate the host immune response have 
proven to have powerful therapeutic potential, although this modality is less 
explored against bacterial pathogens. We describe the application of a bacterial 
binding protein to re-engage the immune system toward pathogenic bacteria. More 
specifically, a hapten was conjugated to a protein expressed by Ixodes 
scapularis ticks, called I. scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein (IAFGP), that has 
high affinity for the d-alanine residue on the bacterial peptidoglycan. We 
showed that a fragment of this protein retained high surface binding affinity. 
Moreover, conjugation of a hapten to this peptide led to the display of haptens 
on the cell surface of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Hapten 
display then induced the recruitment of antibodies and promoted uptake of 
bacterial pathogens by immune cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility 
in using cell wall binding agents as the basis of a class of bacterial 
immunotherapies."
1509,"Broadly congruent mirror neurons, responding to any grasp movement, and strictly 
congruent mirror neurons, responding only to specific grasp movements, have been 
reported in single-cell studies with primates. Delineating grasp properties in 
humans is essential to understand the human mirror neuron system with 
implications for behavior and social cognition. We analyzed electrocorticography 
data from a natural reach-and-grasp movement observation and delayed imitation 
task with 3 different natural grasp types of everyday objects. We focused on the 
classification of grasp types from high-frequency broadband mirror activation 
patterns found in classic mirror system areas, including sensorimotor, 
supplementary motor, inferior frontal, and parietal cortices. Classification of 
grasp types was successful during movement observation and execution intervals 
but not during movement retention. Our grasp type classification from combined 
and single mirror electrodes provides evidence for grasp-congruent activity in 
the human mirror neuron system potentially arising from strictly congruent 
mirror neurons."
1510,"Data from transgenic rodent models suggest that glucagon acts as an insulin 
secretagogue by signalling through the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor (GLP1R) 
present on β-cells. However, its net contribution to physiologic insulin 
secretion in humans is unknown. To address this question, we studied 
non-diabetic individuals in 2 separate experiments. Each subject was studied on 
2 occasions in random order. In the first experiment, during a hyperglycemic 
clamp, glucagon was infused at 0.4ng/kg/min, increasing by 0.2ng/kg/min every 
hour for 5 hours. On one day exendin-9,39 (300pmol/kg/min) was infused to block 
GLP1R, while on the other saline was infused. The insulin secretion rate (ISR) 
was calculated by nonparametric deconvolution from plasma concentrations of 
C-peptide. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and glucose disappearance (Rd) 
were measured using the tracer-dilution technique. Glucagon concentrations, by 
design, did not differ between study days. Integrated ISR was lower during 
exendin-9,39 infusion (213 ± 26 vs. 191 ± 22 nmol per 5 hr, saline vs. 
exendin-9,39 respectively, p = 0.02). In the separate experiment, exendin-9,39 
infusion, compared to saline infusion, also decreased the β-cell secretory 
response to a 1mg glucagon bolus. These data show that in non-diabetic humans, 
glucagon partially stimulates the β-cell through GLP1R."
1511,"A series of small-molecule YEATS4 binders have been discovered as part of an 
ongoing research effort to generate high-quality probe molecules for emerging 
and/or challenging epigenetic targets. Analogues such as 4d and 4e demonstrate 
excellent potency and selectivity for YEATS4 binding versus YEATS1,2,3 and 
exhibit good physical properties and in vitro safety profiles. A new X-ray 
crystal structure confirms direct binding of this chemical series to YEATS4 at 
the lysine acetylation recognition site of the YEATS domain. Multiple analogues 
engage YEATS4 with nanomolar potency in a whole-cell nanoluciferase 
bioluminescent resonance energy transfer assay. Rodent pharmacokinetic studies 
demonstrate the competency of several analogues as in vivo-capable binders."
1512,"BACKGROUND: The extracellular matrix (ECM) has many functions, such as 
segregating tissues, providing support, and regulating intercellular 
communication. Cartilage-derived ECM (CECM) can be prepared via consecutive 
processes of chemical decellularization and enzyme treatment. The purpose of 
this study was to improve and treat osteoarthritis (OA) using porcine knee 
articular CECM.
METHODS: We assessed the rheological characteristics and pH of CECM solutions. 
Furthermore, we determined the effects of CECM on cell proliferation and 
cytotoxicity in the chondrocytes of New Zealand rabbits. The inhibitory effect 
of CECM on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced cellular apoptosis was assessed 
using New Zealand rabbit chondrocytes and human synoviocytes. Finally, we 
examined the in vivo effects of CECM on inflammation control and cartilage 
degradation in an experimental OA-induced rat model. The rat model of OA was 
established by injecting monosodium iodoacetate into the intra-articular knee 
joint. The rats were then injected with CECM solution. Inflammation control and 
cartilage degradation were assessed by measuring the serum levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines and C-telopeptide of type II collagen and performing a 
histomorphological analysis.
RESULTS: CECM was found to be biocompatible and non-immunogenic, and could 
improve cell proliferation without inducing a toxic reaction. CECM significantly 
reduced cellular apoptosis due to TNF-α, significantly improved the survival of 
cells in inflammatory environments, and exerted anti-inflammatory effects.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CECM is an appropriate injectable material 
that mediates OA-induced inflammation."
1513,"Diabetic wound treatment has posed a significant challenge in clinical practice. 
As a kind of cell-derived nanoparticles, extracellular vesicles produced by 
adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC-EVs) have been reported to be potential agents 
for diabetic wound treatment. However, ADSC-EV yield is insufficient to meet the 
demands of clinical therapy. In this study, a novel method involving the use of 
low-intensity ultrasound stimulation on ADSCs is developed to promote EV 
secretion for clinical use. A proper low-intensity ultrasound stimulation 
parameter which significantly increases ADSC-EV quantity has been found. In 
addition, EVs secreted by ADSCs following low-intensity ultrasound stimulation 
(US-EVs) are enriched in wound healing-related miRNAs. Moreover, US-EVs promote 
the biological functions of fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells in 
vitro, and promote diabetic wound healing in db/db mice in vivo through 
re-epithelialization, collagen production, cell proliferation, keratinocyte 
differentiation and migration, and angiogenesis. This study proposes 
low-intensity ultrasound stimulation as a new method for promoting significant 
EV secretion by ADSCs and for improving the diabetic wound-healing potential of 
EVs, which will meet the clinical needs for these nanoparticles. The production 
of extracellular vesicles of adipose-derived stem cells is obviously promoted by 
a low-intensity ultrasound stimulation method, and the biological effects of 
promoting diabetic wound healing were markedly increased in vitro and in vivo."
1514,"Lepechinia meyenii is a medicinal plant specialized in the biosynthesis of 
different types of antioxidants including the diterpenes carnosic (CA) acid and 
carnosol (CS). Herein we present the results of plant tissue culture approaches 
performed in this medicinal plant with particular emphasis on the generation and 
evaluation of a cell suspension system for CA and CS production. The effect of 
sucrose concentration, temperature, pH, and UV-light exposure was explored. In 
addition, diverse concentrations of microbial elicitors (salicylic acid, 
pyocyanin, Glucanex, and chitin), simulators of abiotic elicitors (polyethylene 
glycol and NaCl), and biosynthetic precursors (mevalonolactone, geranylgeraniol, 
and miltiradiene/abietatriene) were evaluated on batch cultures for 20 days. 
Miltiradiene/abietatriene obtainment was achieved through a metabolic 
engineering approach using a recombinant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . 
Our results suggested that the maximum accumulation (Acc max ) of CA and CS was 
mainly conferred to stimuli associated with oxidative stress such as UV-light 
exposure (Acc max , 6.2 mg L -1 ) polyethylene glycol (Acc max , 6.5 mg L -1 ) 
NaCl (Acc max , 5.9 mg L -1 ) which simulated drought and saline stress, 
respectively. Nevertheless the bacterial elicitor pyocyanin was also effective 
to increase the production of both diterpenes (Acc max , 6.4 mg L -1 ). 
Outstandingly, the incorporation of upstream biosynthetic precursors such as 
geranylgeraniol and miltiradiene/abietatriene, generated the best results with 
Acc max of 8.6 and 16.7 mg L -1 , respectively. Optimized batch cultures 
containing 100 mg L -1 geranylgeraniol, 50 mg L -1 miltiradiene/abietatriene 
(95:5%) and 5 g L -1 polyethylene glycol treated with 6 min UV light pulse 
during 30 days resulted in Acc max of 26.7 mg L -1 for CA and 17.3 mg L -1 for 
CS on days 18-24. This strategy allowed to increase seven folds the amounts of 
CA and CS in comparison with batch cultures without elicitation (Acc max 4.3 mg 
L -1 )."
1515,"Most information used to evaluate diabetic statuses is collected at a special 
time-point, such as taking fasting plasma glucose test and providing a limited 
view of individual's health and disease risk. As a new parameter for 
continuously evaluating personal clinical statuses, the newly developed 
technique ""continuous glucose monitoring"" (CGM) can characterize glucose 
dynamics. By calculating the complexity of glucose time series index (CGI) with 
refined composite multi-scale entropy analysis of the CGM data, the study showed 
for the first time that the complexity of glucose time series in subjects 
decreased gradually from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose regulation 
and then to type 2 diabetes (P for trend < 0.01). Furthermore, CGI was 
significantly associated with various parameters such as insulin 
sensitivity/secretion (all P < 0.01), and multiple linear stepwise regression 
showed that the disposition index, which reflects β-cell function after 
adjusting for insulin sensitivity, was the only independent factor correlated 
with CGI (P < 0.01). Our findings indicate that the CGI derived from the CGM 
data may serve as a novel marker to evaluate glucose homeostasis."
1516,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that mainly occurs in East 
and Southeast Asia. Although patients benefit from the main NPC treatments 
(e.g., radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy), persistent and recurrent 
diseases still occur in some NPC patients. Therefore, investigating the 
pathogenesis of NPC is of great clinical significance. In the present study, 
replication factor c subunit 4 (RFC4) is a key potential target involved in NPC 
progression via bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the expression and 
mechanism of RFC4 in NPC were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Our results 
revealed that RFC4 was more elevated in NPC tumor tissues than in normal 
tissues. RFC4 knockdown induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and inhibited NPC cell 
proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, HOXA10 was confirmed as a 
downstream target of RFC4, and the overexpression of HOXA10 attenuated the 
silencing of RFC4-induced cell proliferation, colony formation inhibition, and 
cell cycle arrest. For the first time, this study reveals that RFC4 is required 
for NPC cell proliferation and may play a pivotal role in NPC tumorigenesis."
1517,"Infertility is experienced by 8%-12% of adults in their reproductive period 
globally and has become a prevalent concern. Besides routine therapeutic 
methods, stem cells are rapidly being examined as viable alternative therapies 
in regenerative medicine and translational investigation. Remarkable progress 
has been made in understanding the biology and purpose of stem cells. The 
affected pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are 
further studied for their possible use in reproductive medicine, particularly 
for infertility induced by premature ovarian insufficiency and azoospermia. 
Accordingly, this study discusses current developments in the use of some kinds 
of MSCs such as adipose-derived stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells, umbilical 
cord MSCs, and menstrual blood MSCs. These methods have been used to manage 
ovarian and uterine disorders, and each technique presents a novel method for 
the therapy of infertility."
1518,"CRIB motif-containing barley RIC157 is a novel ROP scaffold protein that 
interacts directly with barley RACB, promotes susceptibility to fungal 
penetration, and colocalizes with RACB at the haustorial neck. Successful 
obligate pathogens benefit from host cellular processes. For the biotrophic 
ascomycete fungus Blumeria hordei (Bh) it has been shown that barley RACB, a 
small monomeric G-protein (ROP, Rho of plants), is required for full 
susceptibility to fungal penetration. The susceptibility function of RACB 
probably lies in its role in cell polarity, which may be co-opted by the 
pathogen for invasive ingrowth of its haustorium. However, how RACB supports 
fungal penetration success and which other host proteins coordinate this process 
is incompletely understood. RIC (ROP-Interactive and CRIB-(Cdc42/Rac Interactive 
Binding) motif-containing) proteins are considered scaffold proteins which can 
interact directly with ROPs via a conserved CRIB motif. Here we describe a 
previously uncharacterized barley RIC protein, RIC157, which can interact 
directly with RACB in planta. We show that, in the presence of constitutively 
activated RACB, RIC157 shows a localization at the cell periphery/plasma 
membrane, whereas it otherwise localizes to the cytoplasm. RIC157 appears to 
mutually stabilize the plasma membrane localization of the activated ROP. During 
fungal infection, RIC157 and RACB colocalize at the penetration site, 
particularly at the haustorial neck. Additionally, transiently overexpressed 
RIC157 renders barley epidermal cells more susceptible to fungal penetration. We 
discuss that RIC157 may promote fungal penetration into barley epidermal cells 
by operating probably downstream of activated RACB."
1519,"BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammatory response could affect many systems. Cardiac 
dysfunction develops due to cardiovascular system damage and could be mortal. 
Selenium is a trace element that can be used as a dietary supplement and has 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. This study aims 
to evaluate the protective effects of selenium on cardiovascular damage via 
silenced information regulator 1 (SIRT1)/p53 and cytochrome C (Cyt-c)/ caspase-3 
(Cas-3) pathways.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into 4 groups as 
control, LPS (0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally(i.p.), 2-7 days) and LPS + Selenium 
(LPS-0.1 mg/kg, i.p., 2-7 days, selenium - 100 µg/kg, i.p., 1-7 days) and 
selenium (100 µg/kg, i.p., 1-7 days) group. On the 8th day of the experiment, 
rats were sacrificed. Blood samples and half of the left ventricles were 
collected for biochemical and genetic analysis. The remaining left ventricles 
and aorta were taken for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. In the 
LPS group myocardial hemorrhages, hyperemia, and endothelial cell loss were 
observed. Also, Cas-3 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expressions; 
creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α), ischemia modified albumin (IMA), total oxidant status 
(TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) levels; p53, Cyt-c, Cas-3 mRNA expressions 
increased while total antioxidant status (TAS) levels, glutathione peroxidase 
(GPx) activity, SIRT1 mRNA expression decreased. Selenium treatment reversed all 
these changes.
CONCLUSION: Selenium showed protective effects on cardiovascular injury via 
regulating SIRT1/p53 and Cyt-c/Cas-3 pathways. This study enlightened the 
possible usage of selenium on cardiotoxicity."
1520,"Recently, nucleic acid drugs have been considered as promising candidates in 
treatment of various diseases, especially cancer. Because of developing 
resistance to conventional chemotherapy, use of genetic tools in cancer therapy 
appears inevitable. siRNA is a RNAi tool with capacity of suppressing target 
gene. Owing to overexpression of oncogenic factors in cancer, siRNA can be used 
for suppressing those pathways. This review emphasizes the function of siRNA in 
treatment of breast tumor. The anti-apoptotic-related genes including Bcl-2, 
Bcl-xL and survivin can be down-regulated by siRNA in triggering cell death in 
breast cancer. STAT3, STAT8, Notch1, E2F3 and NF-κB are among the factors with 
overexpression in breast cancer that their silencing by siRNA paves the way for 
impairing tumor proliferation and invasion. The oncogenic mechanisms in drug 
resistance development in breast tumor such as lncRNAs can be suppressed by 
siRNA. Furthermore, siRNA reducing P-gp activity can increase drug 
internalization in tumor cells. Because of siRNA degradation at bloodstream and 
low accumulation at tumor site, nanoplatforms have been employed for siRNA 
delivery to suppress breast tumor progression via improving siRNA efficacy in 
gene silencing. Development of biocompatible and efficient nanostructures for 
siRNA delivery can make milestone progress in alleviation of breast cancer 
patients."
1521,"Slowing aging can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. In particular, 
eliminating senescent cells is a promising approach to slow aging. Previous 
studies found that both cells from older animals and senescent cells have noisy 
gene expression. Here, we performed a large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing 
time course to understand how transcriptional heterogeneity develops among 
senescent cells. We found that cells experiencing senescence-inducing oxidative 
stress rapidly adopt one of two major transcriptional states. One senescent cell 
state is associated with stress response, and the other is associated with 
tissue remodeling. We did not observe increased stochastic gene expression. This 
data is consistent with the idea that reproducible, limited, distinct, and 
coherent transcriptional states exist in senescent cell populations. These 
physiologically distinct senescent cell subtypes may each affect the aging 
process in unique ways and constitute a source of heterogeneity in aging."
1522,"Oxidative stress and inflammation are the key players in the toxic manifestation 
of sporadic Parkinson's disease and zinc (Zn)-induced dopaminergic 
neurodegeneration. A synthetic superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, tempol, and a 
naturally occurring antioxidant, silymarin protect against oxidative 
stress-mediated damage. The study intended to explore the effects of tempol and 
silymarin against Zn-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Exposure to Zn 
produced neurobehavioral deficits and striatal dopamine depletion. Zn reduced 
glutathione content and glutathione-S-transferase activity and increased lipid 
peroxidation, superoxide dismutase activity, and level of pro-inflammatory 
mediators [nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), 
interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)]. Zn also attenuated the 
expression of tyrosine hydoxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 
(VMAT-2), mitochondrial B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and procaspase-3 and 9 
proteins and number of TH-positive neurons. Conversely, Zn elevated the 
expression of dopamine transporter (DAT) and mitochondrial Bcl-2-associated X 
(Bax) protein along with mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Administration of 
tempol significantly alleviated Zn-induced motor impairments, dopamine 
depletion, reduction in TH expression, and loss of TH-positive neurons similar 
to silymarin. Silymarin mitigated Zn-induced oxidative stress and inflammation 
and restored the expression of dopamine transporters and levels of pro-apoptotic 
proteins akin to tempol. The results demonstrate that both tempol and silymarin 
protect against Zn-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss through the suppression of 
oxidative stress and inflammation."
1523,"Although 2,4-DNP is claimed to promote fast weight reduction, it is also related 
with an intolerable high risk of serious side effects to various tissues. On the 
other hand, it is known to have neuroprotective effects. These different effects 
of 2,4-DNP may be due to the administration conditions. For this reason, in this 
study, it was aimed for the first time to clarify the oxidative changes that 
occur in the brain during the use of 2,4-DNP, depending on the dose, time and 
gender. For this purpose, 60 Wistar rats (30 male, 30 female) were divided into 
ten groups: control groups, short-term/long-term groups and low dose/high dose 
groups. Except for the control groups, 2,4-DNP was administered to the other 
groups by oral gavage. End of the experiment, thiobarbituric acid-reactive 
substances (TBARs), glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NOx) and ascorbic acid (AA) 
levels were measured in the brain tissues of sacrificed animals. 2,4-DNP 
administration showed attenuation impact on oxidative stress depending on both 
dose, time and gender. It can be said that it is more beneficial in terms of 
neuroprotection, especially in the short-term and male groups. In conclusion, 
our findings suggest that, depending on the dose, time, and gender, 2,4-DNP may 
be beneficial in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."
1524,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major cause of poor 
hemodynamic reconstitution outcomes after myocardial infarction or circulatory 
arrest. Currently, the search for effective therapeutic agents and tools is a 
focus of research in the field of myocardial I/R injury. Resveratrol (Res) has 
been extensively studied in recent years because of its good cardiovascular 
therapeutic effects, but its specific mechanism of action has not been fully 
elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of 
interaction between myocardial I/R injury and Res in vitro and in vivo. In our 
in vivo study, we used PI/TUNEL staining and western blotting to detect relevant 
necroptotic key molecules such as RIP1, RIP3 and p-MLKL/MLKL to observe 
myocardial necroptosis. The extent of myocardial injury was determined using 
hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride 
(TTC) staining as well as serum levels of CK-MB and LDH and echocardiography. In 
the in vitro study, cellular injury was assessed by CCK-8 and cell supernatant 
LDH levels. In addition, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection to 
knock down YAP, a key effector molecule of the Hippo pathway, to validate the 
molecular mechanism of action by which Res exerts myocardial protection. The 
localization of YAP in H9c2 cardiomyocytes was examined using 
immunofluorescence. Our data demonstrated that Res could ameliorate myocardial 
I/R-induced necroptosis by modulating the Hippo pathway, and that the beneficial 
effect of Res might be associated with nuclear translocation of the 
transcriptional regulator YAP."
1525,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that destroys 
joint cartilage and causes disability. Synovial inflammation, with angiogenesis, 
is an early event in the progression of the disease. Angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) is 
a cytokine with both inflammatory and angiogenic effects. Many genes can 
influence RA susceptibility and disease activity. The aim is to assess the 
relationship between ANGPT2 gene polymorphism (rs3020221) and RA. The study was 
a case-control study that included 212 RA patients and 238 age-and 
gender-matched healthy volunteers. RA disease activity was assessed using the 
Disease Activity Score 28 index. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive 
protein, rheumatoid factor, and antibody to cyclic citrullinated peptide were 
measured. ANGPT2 rs3020221 C > T SNP genotyping was done using real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The TT genotype was more frequently represented 
in RA patients than in healthy controls (18.9% and 7.1%, respectively, p < 
0.001) and increased the chance of developing RA four-fold, as compared to other 
genotypes (OR = 4.00, 95% CI = 2.09-7.63) (p < 0.001). The CT genotype was 
associated with elevated levels of the inflammatory markers ESR and CRP in RA 
patients (p = 0.012 and 0.037, respectively) as well as the DAS28 ESR Score (p < 
0.001). The presence of the T allele either under the dominant model (for 
genotypes CT and TT) or the recessive model (for the genotype TT) predicts RA 
disease. Assessment of ANGPT2 gene polymorphism is useful to predict the 
patients with susceptibility to RA. The presence of T allele increased the risk 
of developing RA disease by two folds."
1526,"A few protein kinases and phosphatases regulate tau protein phosphorylation and 
an imbalance in their enzyme activity results in tau hyper-phosphorylation. 
Aberrant tau phosphorylation causes tau to dissociate from the microtubules and 
clump together in the cytosol to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which lead 
to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and other tauopathies. Hence, targeting hyperphosphorylated tau protein is 
a restorative approach for treating neurodegenerative tauopathies. The 
cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk5) and the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β) have 
both been implicated in aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation. The limited transport 
of drugs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for reaching the central nervous 
system (CNS) thus represents a significant problem in the development of drugs. 
Drug delivery systems based on nanocarriers help solve this problem. In this 
review, we discuss the tau protein, regulation of tau phosphorylation and 
abnormal hyperphosphorylation, drugs in use or under clinical trials, and 
treatment strategies for tauopathies based on the critical role of tau 
hyperphosphorylation in the pathogenesis of the disease. Pathology of 
neurodegenerative disease due to hyperphosphorylation and various therapeutic 
approaches including nanotechnology for its treatment."
1527,"Most fast synaptic inhibitions in the mammalian brain are mediated by GABAA 
receptors (GABAARs). An appropriate level of GABAAR expression at the cell 
surface is essential for neurodevelopment and the efficacy of GABAergic synaptic 
transmission. We previously reported that brefeldin A-inhibited GDP/GTP exchange 
factor 1 (BIG1), a binding partner of GABAARs, plays an important role in 
trafficking GABAARs to the cell surface. However, its regulatory mechanisms 
remain unknown. In the present study, we identified a new cellular protein, 
14-3-3ζ, which can interact with the β subunit of GABAARs and BIG1 both in vitro 
and in vivo and colocalizes in the soma, dendrites, and axons of hippocampal 
neurons. Overexpression of 14-3-3ζ-WT increased the surface expression of BIG1 
in dendrites and axons, as well as the binding of BIG1 with GABAAR. Depleted 
14-3-3ζ with efficacious siRNA attenuated the interaction between BIG1 and 
GABAARs and resulted in significant decreases in the surface expression levels 
of BIG1 and GABAAR. GABAAR agonist treatment increased the expression levels of 
BIG1 and 14-3-3ζ on the surface, indicating that 14-3-3ζ is involved in 
regulating BIG1-mediated GABAAR surface expression. Depletion of BIG1 or 14-3-3ζ 
significantly decreased GABAAR expression at the cell surface and suppressed the 
GABA-gated influx of chloride ions. These data indicate that the combination of 
14-3-3ζ and BIG1 is required for GABAAR membrane expression. Our results provide 
a potential promising therapeutic target for neurological disorders involving 
GABAergic synaptic transmission."
1528,"As the most prevalent brain tumor, glioma is malignant with poor prognostic 
outcomes. As a result, it is of great importance to detect biomarkers for glioma 
diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we determined grade-based characteristic 
gene clusters with gradual expression following grade change, including 1479 
down- and 526 up-regulated genes. Combined interaction among proteins 
originating from these genes was analyzed, and hub genes were exhibited after 
GSEA enrichment, containing 12 and 11 genes which were correlated with 
prognostic outcomes, named as unfavorable and favorable gene sets, respectively. 
The GSVA score of each gene set was calculated and divided into high/low groups; 
we observed that cases in the low score group had better outcomes than the high 
score group based on the GSVA of the unfavorable set, while with favorable GSVA 
score, the low group had poorer outcomes than the high group. Eventually, we 
compared a variety of infiltrating immune cells between low/high GSVA subgroup, 
showing various immune cell types (B cell naive, activated mast cells, resting 
CD4 memory T cell, and so on) with opposite proportion. And interestingly, these 
cell types also accounted for a contrary percentage between unfavorable and 
favorable conditions. In conclusion, these two hub gene sets are of good 
importance as an evaluation system for clinical grade classification and 
prognosis prediction."
1529,"OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia involves several mechanisms, including age-related 
changes, nutritional deficiencies, and inflammation, and is associated with 
unfavorable clinical outcomes. However, the significance of skeletal muscle 
index (SMI) and immune-nutritional status for patients with early-stage 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This retrospective study was 
performed to investigate associations between preoperative SMI based on computed 
tomography (CT) at the L1 level and immune-nutritional status, and whether these 
factors correlated with surgical outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 386 patients with stage I-II NSCLC who 
underwent curative anatomical pulmonary resection. SMI was assessed on CT at the 
L1 level and patients were divided into low-SMI (n = 97) and high-SMI (n = 289) 
groups. We examined the significance of SMI for postoperative outcomes and 
evaluated correlations between SMI and clinical characteristics, including 
immune-nutritional status.
RESULTS: Low SMI was significantly associated with body mass index and geriatric 
nutritional risk index. Five-year overall survival rate was significantly lower 
in the low-SMI group (66.0%) than in the high-SMI group (82.2%, P = 0.004). 
Multivariate analysis revealed SMI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.850; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.091-3.135; P = 0.022) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) (HR 
2.031; 95% CI 1.231-3.352; P = 0.006) as independent predictors of overall 
survival. Low SMI correlated significantly with postoperative complications 
(P = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Low preoperative SMI based on CT at the L1 level appears associated 
with poor prognosis and postoperative complications among patients with 
early-stage NSCLC. PNI is also an independent prognostic factor for surgical 
outcomes."
1530,"RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that introduces changes in RNA 
sequences encoded by nuclear, mitochondrial, or plastid genomes. To understand 
the research progress of plant RNA editing, we comprehensively analyze the 
articles on plant RNA editing from 2001 to 2022 through bibliometric methods. 
Nucleic Acids Research, Plant Journal and Plant cell are the journals that 
deserve attention with their high production, total local citation scores 
(TLCS), and h-indexes. The USA, China, and Germany are the top three countries 
with highly productive publications. Ulm University, Cornell University, and 
Chinese Acad Sci are excellent cooperative institutions with a high level of 
influence in the field, and KNOOP V and TAKENAKA M are good partnership. Plant 
RNA editing researches concentrate on the subject categories of Biochemistry & 
Molecular Biology, Plant Sciences, Genetics & Heredity, etc. Plant mitochondria, 
genome editing and messenger-RNA may be the research hotspots in the future. The 
main plant RNA editing research tools are JACUSA, SPRINT, and REDO, and the main 
databases are REDIdb, PED, and dbRES. At present, the research streams are (1) 
RNA editing sites; (2) Pentapeptide repeat protein (PPR) involved in RNA 
editing; (3) RNA editing factors. Overall, this article summarizes the research 
overview of plant RNA editing until 2022 and provides theoretical implications 
for its possible future directions."
1531,"In this study, a biological conduit, consisting of an adipocyte-derived 
mesenchymal stem cell (AdMSCs) sheet and amniotic membrane (AM), was designed 
for the reconstruction of peripheral nerve defects. To evaluate the effect of 
the produced conduit on neural regeneration, a 10-mm sciatic nerve defect was 
created in rats, and experiments were carried out on six groups, i.e., sham 
control group (SC), negative control group (NC), nerve autograft group (NG), the 
biological conduit (AdMSCs + AM) group, the commercial PGA tube conduit (PGA) 
group, and the conduit only consisting of AM (AM) group. The effects of 
different nerve repair methods on the peripheral nerve and gastrocnemius muscle 
were evaluated by functional, histological, and immunohistochemical tests. When 
the number of myelinated axons was compared between the groups of AdMSCs + AM 
and PGA, it was higher in the AdMSCs + AM group (p < 0.05). The percentage of 
gastrocnemius collagen bundle area of AdMSCs + AM group was found to be 
statistically lower than the PGA group (p < 0.05). The muscle fiber diameter of 
AdMSCs + AM group was lower than that of the NG group, but significantly higher 
than that of the PGA group and the AM group (p < 0.001). Muscle weight index was 
significantly higher in the AdMSCs + AM group compared to the PGA group (p < 
0.05). It was observed that nerve regeneration was faster in the AdMSCs + AM 
group, and there was an earlier improvement in pin-prick score and sciatic 
functional index compared to the PGA group and the AM group. In conclusion, the 
biological conduit prepared from the AdMSCs sheet and AM is regarded as a new 
biological conduit that can be used as an alternative treatment method to nerve 
autograft in clinical applications."
1532,"Annelid chaetae are extracellular chitinous structures that are formed in an 
extracellular epidermal invagination, the chaetal follicle. The basalmost cell 
of this follicle, the chaetoblast, serves like a 3D-printer as it dynamically 
shapes the chaeta. During chaetogenesis apical microvilli of the chaetoblast 
form the template for the chaeta, any structural details result from modulating 
the microvilli pattern. This study describes this process in detail in the model 
organism Platynereis dumerilii and clarifies some aspects of chaetogenesis in 
its close relative Nereis vexillosa, the first annelid in which the 
ultrastructure of chaetogenesis had been described. Nereid species possess 
compound chaetae characteristic for numerous subgroups of errant annelids. The 
distal most section of these chaetae is movable; a hinge connects this part of 
the chaeta to the shaft. Modulation of the microvilli and differences in their 
structure, diameter and number of microvilli, and their withdrawal and 
reappearance determine the shape of these compound chaetae. Chaetal structure 
and pattern also change during life history. While larvae possess a single type 
of chaeta (in addition to internal aciculae), juveniles and adults possess two 
types of chaetae that are replaced by large paddle-shaped chaetae in swimming 
epitokous stages. Chaetogenesis is a continuous process that lasts during the 
entire lifespan. The detailed developmental sequence of chaetae and their site 
of formation are very similar within species and species groups. We expect that 
similarity results from a conserved gene regulatory network making this an 
optimal system to test the phylogenetic affinity of taxa and the homology of 
their chaetae."
1533,"The generation and growing of de novo hair follicles is the most daring hair 
replacement approach to treat alopecia. This approach has been explored at least 
since the 1960s without major success. Latest in the 1980s, the realization that 
the mesenchymal compartment of hair follicles, the dermal papilla (DP), is the 
crucial signaling center and element required for fulfilling this vision of hair 
follicle engineering, propelled research into the fibroblasts that occupy the 
DP. However, working with DP fibroblasts has been stubbornly frustrating. 
Decades of work in understanding the nature of DP fibroblasts in vitro and in 
vivo have led to the appreciation that hair follicle biology is complex, and the 
dermal papilla is an enigma. Functional DP fibroblasts tend to aggregate in 2D 
culture, while impaired DP cells do not. This fact has stimulated recent 
approaches to overcome the hurdles to DP cell culture by mimicking their natural 
habitat, such as growing DP fibroblasts in three dimensions (3D) by their 
self-aggregation, adopting 3D matrix scaffold, or bioprinting 3D 
microstructures. Furthermore, including keratinocytes in the mix to form hair 
follicle-like composite structures has been explored but remains a far cry from 
a useful and affordable method to generate human hair follicles in sufficient 
quantity and quality in a practical time frame for patients. This suggests that 
the current strategies may have reached their limitations in achieving 
successful hair follicle bioengineering for clinical applications. Novel 
approaches are required to overcome these barriers, such as focusing on 
embryonic cell types and processes in combination with emerging techniques."
1534,"The common practice of freezing meniscal allograft tissue is limited due to the 
formation of damaging ice crystals. Vitrification, which eliminates the 
formation of damaging ice crystals, may allow the mechanical properties of 
meniscal allograft tissue to be maintained during storage and long-term 
preservation. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the 
differences between fresh, frozen, and vitrified porcine lateral menisci 
examining compressive mechanical properties in the axial direction. Unconfined 
compressive stress-relaxation testing was conducted to quantify the mechanical 
properties of fresh, frozen and vitrified porcine lateral menisci. The 
compressive mechanical properties investigated were peak and equilibrium stress, 
secant, instantaneous and equilibrium modulus, percent stress-relaxation, and 
relaxation time constants from three-term Prony series. Frozen menisci exhibited 
inferior compressive mechanical properties in comparison with fresh menisci 
(significant differences in peak and equilibrium stress, and secant, 
instantaneous and equilibrium modulus) and vitrified menisci (significant 
differences in peak stress, and secant and instantaneous modulus). 
Interestingly, fresh and vitrified menisci exhibited comparable compressive 
mechanical properties (stress, modulus and relaxation parameters). These 
findings are significant because (1) vitrification was successful in maintaining 
mechanical properties at values similar to fresh menisci, (2) compressive 
mechanical properties of fresh menisci were characterized providing a baseline 
for future research, and (3) freezing affected mechanical properties confirming 
that freezing should be used with caution in future investigations of meniscal 
mechanical properties. Vitrification was superior to freezing for preserving 
compressive mechanical properties of menisci which is an important advance for 
vitrification as a preservation option for meniscal allograft transplantation."
1535,"Orf virus (ORFV) causes an acute, contagious, skin disease of sheep and goats 
which is economically important. The objectives of this study were to identify 
ORFV and to explore its pathological and phylogenetic profiles in 350 goats and 
91 sheep of 14 districts of Punjab, Pakistan, from July 2020 to July 2021. Skin 
scrapings (total no. of samples = 441) of suspected animals were subjected to 
polymerase chain reactions, phylogenetic analysis, and pathological 
observations. The partial length of GIF/IL-2 gene (408 bp) was successfully 
amplified in 58/441 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of GIF/IL2 gene showed that 
the study isolates belonged to ORFV-cluster I, together with the viruses 
reported in India and China. Pakistan ORFV isolates were shared 97.6-98.7% 
nucleotide and 97.6-100% amino acid identities with the reference strain 
(NC_005336). Moreover, Chinese ORFV-isolates were detected unique multiple amino 
acid substitutions (F11L, Q21H, D27N, I46V, N49S, N82D, D103N, S129G) with study 
isolates. Naturally infected animals were anorexic, emaciated, dull, and 
depressed. The macroscopic lesions included multifocal to coalescing, ulceration 
followed by proliferative papules, pustules, and crust formation on the 
epidermis of gums, lips, mouth commissure, muzzles, nose, and udder. 
Histopathological examination revealed hyperplasia, anastomosing rete ridges 
formation and degenerative changes, including spongiosis and vacuolation of 
epidermal cells. Keratinocytes exhibited eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion 
bodies with pyknotic and karyorrhexis nuclei. This is the first report on 
molecular characterization of ORFV from Pakistan, with insight into its 
pathogenesis and comparative analysis of pathological alterations and genetic 
diversity between ORFV strains reported in different geographical areas."
1536,"BACKGROUND: An imbalance of adipokines, hormones secreted by white adipose 
tissue, is suggested to play a role in the immunopathology of multiple sclerosis 
(MS). In people with MS (PwMS) of the same age, we aimed to determine whether 
the adipokines adiponectin, leptin, and resistin are associated with MS disease 
severity. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate whether these adipokines mediate 
the association between body mass index (BMI) and MS disease severity.
METHODS: Adiponectin, resistin, and leptin were determined in serum using ELISA. 
288 PwMS and 125 healthy controls (HC) were included from the Project Y cohort, 
a population-based cross-sectional study of people with MS born in the 
Netherlands in 1966, and age and sex-matched HC. Adipokine levels and BMI were 
related to demographic, clinical and disability measures, and MRI-based brain 
volumes.
RESULTS: Adiponectin levels were 1.2 fold higher in PwMS vs. HC, especially in 
secondary progressive MS. Furthermore, we found a sex-specific increase in 
adiponectin levels in primary progressive (PP) male patients compared to male 
controls. Leptin and resistin levels did not differ between PwMS and HC, 
however, leptin levels were associated with higher disability (EDSS) and 
resistin strongly related to brain volumes in progressive patients, especially 
in several grey matter regions in PPMS. Importantly, correction for BMI did not 
significantly change the results.
CONCLUSION: In PwMS of the same age, we found associations between adipokines 
(adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) and a range of clinical and radiological 
metrics. These associations were independent of BMI, indicating distinct 
mechanisms."
1537,"Evolutionary dynamics allows us to understand many changes happening in a broad 
variety of biological systems, ranging from individuals to complete ecosystems. 
It is also behind a number of remarkable organizational changes that happen 
during the natural history of cancers. These reflect tumour heterogeneity, which 
is present at all cellular levels, including the genome, proteome and phenome, 
shaping its development and interrelation with its environment. An intriguing 
observation in different cohorts of oncological patients is that tumours exhibit 
an increased proliferation as the disease progresses, while the timescales 
involved are apparently too short for the fixation of sufficient driver 
mutations to promote explosive growth. Here, we discuss how phenotypic 
plasticity, emerging from a single genotype, may play a key role and provide a 
ground for a continuous acceleration of the proliferation rate of clonal 
populations with time. We address this question by combining the analysis of 
real-time growth of non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells (N-H460) together with 
stochastic and deterministic mathematical models that capture proliferation 
trait heterogeneity in clonal populations to elucidate the contribution of 
phenotypic transitions on tumour growth dynamics."
1538,"Wheat is one of the most important food sources on Earth. MicroRNAs (miRNA) play 
important roles in wheat productivity. To identify wheat miRNAs, we constructed 
and sequenced sRNA libraries from leaves and roots of two wheat cultivars 
(RAC875 and Kukri) with many different traits. Given that available miRNA wheat 
complement in the plant-specific database PmiREN ( https://pmiren.com ) does not 
include root tissues and root-associated miRNAs might thus be missing, we 
performed first the prediction of novel miRNAs using the sRNAbench tool. We 
found a total of 150 putatively novel miRNA genes with expression of both arms 
from 289 unique mature sequences and nearly 30% of all miRNA reads in roots 
corresponded to novel miRNAs. In contrast, this figure in leaves dropped to 
under 3%, confirming the undersampling of roots in the complement of known 
miRNAs. By using 120 publicly available wheat datasets, 598 Zea mays small RNA 
libraries, 64 plant species genomes, wheat degradome library, and functional 
enrichment analysis, a subset of novel miRNAs were confirmed as bona-fide 
miRNAs. Of the total 605 miRNAs identified in this study inclusive of 316 known 
miRNAs, 528 miRNAs were shared by both cultivars, 429 miRNAs were shared by both 
root tissues and 329 miRNAs were shared by both leaf tissues. In addition, 32 
miRNAs were specific to Kukri while 45 miRNAs were specific to RAC875. These 
miRNAs had diverse functions, such as regulation of gene transcription, protein 
translation, energy metabolism, and cell cycle progression. Our data provide a 
genome-wide miRNA expression profile in these two wheat cultivars and help 
functional studies of wheat genomics."
1539,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is an immunologically vulnerable tumor 
entity, and immune checkpoint inhibitors are now widely used to treat patients 
with advanced disease. Whether and to what extent immune responses in ccRCC are 
shaped by genetic alterations, however, is only beginning to emerge. In this 
proof-of-concept study, we performed a detailed correlative analysis of the 
mutational and immunological landscapes in a series of 23 consecutive kidney 
cancer patients. We discovered that a high infiltration with CD8 + T cells was 
not dependent on the number of driver mutations but rather on the presence of 
specific mutational events, namely pathogenic mutations in PTEN or BAP1. This 
observation encouraged us to compare mechanisms of T cell suppression in the 
context of four different genetic patterns, i.e., the presence of multiple 
drivers, a PTEN or BAP1 mutation, or the absence of detectable driver mutations. 
We found that ccRCCs harboring a PTEN or BAP1 mutation showed the lowest level 
of Granzyme B positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). A multiplex 
immunofluorescence analysis revealed a significant number of CD8 + TILs in the 
vicinity of CD68 + macrophages/monocytes in the context of a BAP1 mutation but 
not in the context of a PTEN mutation. In line with this finding, direct 
interactions between CD8 + TILs and CD163 + M2-polarized macrophages were found 
in BAP1-mutated ccRCC but not in tumors with other mutational patterns. While an 
absence of driver mutations was associated with more CD8 + TILs in the vicinity 
of FOXP3 + Tregs and CD68 + monocytes/macrophages, the presence of multiple 
driver mutations was, to our surprise, not found to be strongly associated with 
immunosuppressive mechanisms. Our results highlight the role of genetic 
alterations in shaping the immunological landscape of ccRCC. We discovered a 
remarkable heterogeneity of mechanisms that can lead to T cell suppression, 
which supports the need for personalized immune oncological approaches."
1540,"Cancer immunotherapy relies on improving T cell effector functions against 
malignancies, but despite the identification of several key transcription 
factors (TFs), the biological functions of these TFs are not entirely 
understood. We developed and utilized a novel, clinically relevant murine model 
to dissect the functional properties of crucial T cell transcription factors 
during anti-tumor responses. Our data showed that the loss of TCF-1 in CD8 T 
cells also leads to loss of key stimulatory molecules such as CD28. Our data 
showed that TCF-1 suppresses surface NKG2D expression on naïve and activated CD8 
T cells via key transcriptional factors Eomes and T-bet. Using both in vitro and 
in vivo models, we uncovered how TCF-1 regulates critical molecules responsible 
for peripheral CD8 T cell effector functions. Finally, our unique genetic and 
molecular approaches suggested that TCF-1 also differentially regulates 
essential kinases. These kinases, including LCK, LAT, ITK, PLC-γ1, P65, ERKI/II, 
and JAK/STATs, are required for peripheral CD8 T cell persistent function during 
alloimmunity. Overall, our molecular and bioinformatics data demonstrate the 
mechanism by which TCF-1 modulated several critical aspects of T cell function 
during CD8 T cell response to cancer. Summary Figure: TCF-1 is required for 
persistent function of CD8 T cells but dispensable for anti-tumor response. 
Here, we have utilized a novel mouse model that lacks TCF-1 specifically on CD8 
T cells for an allogeneic transplant model. We uncovered a molecular mechanism 
of how TCF-1 regulates key signaling pathways at both transcriptomic and protein 
levels. These key molecules included LCK, LAT, ITK, PLC-γ1, p65, ERK I/II, and 
JAK/STAT signaling. Next, we showed that the lack of TCF-1 impacted phenotype, 
proinflammatory cytokine production, chemokine expression, and T cell 
activation. We provided clinical evidence for how these changes impact GVHD 
target organs (skin, small intestine, and liver). Finally, we provided evidence 
that TCF-1 regulates NKG2D expression on mouse naïve and activated CD8 T cells. 
We have shown that CD8 T cells from TCF-1 cKO mice mediate cytolytic functions 
via NKG2D."
1541,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the deadliest form of urological cancer and is 
projected to be the fourth most common neoplasm in the USA in males by 2040. In 
addition to the current poor prognosis with 5-year survival rates hardly 
reaching 15%, the prevalence of resistance to currently available systemic 
therapies has also established an urgent need to develop new treatment 
regimen(s) for advanced RCC. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is the first 
identified ubiquitin-like modifier and has been intensively studied for its 
central role in innate immunity against intracellular pathogens. However, in 
this study, we identified ISG15 as a novel tumor-associated antigen and 
prognostic marker in RCC. Further, we therapeutically targeted elevated ISG15 
expression by means of a Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-based vaccine, designated 
Lm-LLO-ISG15, in both subcutaneous and orthotopic RCC mouse models. Treatment 
with Lm-LLO-ISG15 resulted in an influx of tumor-infiltrating effector T cells 
and significant anti-tumor efficacy in both subcutaneous and orthotopic RCC 
tumor models. Treatment with Lm-LLO-ISG15 also generated a robust 
interferon-gamma response and attracted a larger pool of polyfunctional T cells 
into the tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy of 
Lm-LLO-ISG15 in RCC is comparable to that of anti-PD-1 and sunitinib, the 
current frontline therapies for RCC patients. Collectively, our work illustrates 
that targeting ISG15 in RCC with a CTL-based immunotherapy such as Lm-LLO-ISG15 
is a promising and potentially translatable therapeutic strategy to enhance 
survival in RCC patients."
1542,"BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BCa) has a high incidence and recurrence rate 
worldwide. So far, there is no noninvasive detection of BCa therapy and 
prognosis based on urine multi-omics. Therefore, it is necessary to explore 
noninvasive predictive models and novel treatment modalities for BCa.
METHODS: First, we performed protein analysis of urine from five BCa patients 
and five healthy individuals using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Combining multi-omics data to mine particular and 
sensitive molecules to predict BCa prognosis. Second, urine proteomics data were 
combined with TCGA transcriptome data to select differential genes that were 
specifically highly expressed in urine and tissues. Further, the Lasso equation 
was used to screen specific molecules to construct a noninvasive prediction 
model of BCa. Finally, natural compounds of specific molecules were selected by 
combined network pharmacology and molecular docking to complete molecular 
structure docking.
RESULTS: A noninvasive predictive model was constructed using PSMB5, P4HB, 
S100A16, GET3, CNP, TFRC, DCXR, and MPZL1, specific molecules screened by 
multi-omics, and clinical features, which had good predictive value at 1, 3, and 
5 years of prediction. High expression of these target genes suggests a poor 
prognosis in patients with BCa, and they were mainly involved in cell adhesion 
molecules and the IGF pathway. In addition, the corresponding drugs and natural 
compounds were selected by network pharmacology, and the molecular structure 
7NHT of PSMB5 was found to be well docked to Ellagic acid, a natural compound in 
Hetaoren that we found. The 3D structure 6I7S of P4HB was able to bind to 
Stigmasterol in Shanzha stably, and the structure 6WRV of TFRC as an iron 
transport carrier was also able to bind to Stigmasterol in Shanzha stably. The 
structures 1WOJ, 3D3W, and 6IGW of CNP, DCXR, and MPZL1 can also play an 
important role in combination with the natural compounds (S)-Stylopine, 
Kryptoxanthin, and Sitosterol in Maqianzi, Yumixu, and Laoguancao.
CONCLUSION: The noninvasive prediction model based on urinomics had excellent 
potential in predicting the prognosis of patients with BCa. The multi-omics 
screening of specific molecules combined with pharmacology and compound 
molecular docking can promote the research and development of novel drugs."
1543,"We aim to research the molecular mechanism of lncRNA NEAT1 in the activation of 
astrocytes in a cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model. Mouse model of 
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was constructed, and shNEAT1 was 
transfected. The infarct area, brain water content, and neurological deficiency 
were detected. Immunofluorescence detection and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) assay were processed to detect glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP) expression. Astrocyte cells were cultured for oxygen-glucose 
deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD)/re-oxygenation model construction. After 
treatment by shNEAT1, miR-488-3p mimic, miR-488-3p inhibitor, Q-PCR assay, 
western blot and ELISA were undertaken to detect the expressions of NEAT1, 
miR-488-3p, RAC1, inflammatory cytokines, RAC1 and GFAP. Dual luciferase 
reporter assay and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were used 
to verify the binding of NEAT1, miR-488-3p and RAC1. The expression of NEAT1 in 
brain tissue was significantly higher than that in Sham operation group. 
Knockdown of NEAT1 inhibited the brain damage caused by middle cerebral artery 
occlusion (MCAO) treatment, reduced the inflammatory response, and suppressed 
the activation of astrocytes. By constructing an in vitro OGD/R cell model, it 
was found that NEAT1 knockdown also inhibited the activation of astrocytes 
caused by OGD/R. Knockdown of NEAT1 caused the up-regulation of miR-488-3p and 
the down-regulation of RAC1. Knockdown of miR-488-3p or over-expression of RAC1 
reversed the inhibitory effect of shNEAT1 on OGD/R-induced astrocyte activation. 
Over-expression of NEAT1 in cerebral ischemic stroke promotes activation of 
astrocytes by modulation miR-488-3p/RAC1, which is proved in vitro. Our study 
may provide a new idea for the diagnosis and treatment of MCAO."
1544,"In Leishmania mexicana, the protease gp63 has been documented as the protein 
responsible for cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. The present work aimed to obtain 
a monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing this protein without blocking the 
COX-like enzymatic activity. The antibody produced by the selected hybridoma was 
named D12 mAb. The antigen recognized by the D12 mAb was characterized by the 
determination of COX activity associated with immune complexes in the presence 
of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA) using the commercial Activity Assay Abcam 
kit. LSM-SMS analysis validated the identity of the antigen associated with the 
D12 mAb as the L. mexicana protease gp63. Confocal microscopy assays with the 
D12 mAb detected, by cross-recognition, similar proteins in other protozoan 
parasites. COX-like molecules are located in vesicular structures, homogeneously 
distributed throughout the cytoplasm in amastigotes (intracellular infectious 
phase) and promastigotes of L. mexicana, and trophozoites of Entamoeba 
histolytica, Acanthamoeba castellanii, and Naegleria fowleri. However, in 
Giardia duodenalis trophozoites, the distribution of the COX-like molecule was 
also in perinuclear areas. In comparison, in Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes, 
the distribution was mainly observed in the plasma membrane. Structural analyses 
of COX-2-like antigens revealed continuous and discontinuous epitopes for B 
cells, which could be relevant in the cross-reaction of D12 mAb with the 
analyzed parasites. These results indicate that the D12 mAb against the L. 
mexicana gp63 also recognizes a COX-like molecule in several protozoan 
parasites, suggesting that this D12 mAb could potentially be used in combined 
therapies against infectious diseases."
1545,"OBJECTIVE: Pleckstrin homology domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 
phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) is linked to various pathological states. However, 
whether PHLPP2 mediates diabetic retinopathy is unaddressed. This work explored 
the biological function of PHLPP2 in modulating high glucose (HG)-elicited 
damage of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), an in vitro model for studying diabetic 
retinopathy.
METHODS: Mouse RGCs were treated with HG to establish a cell model. PHLPP2 was 
silenced by transfecting specific shRNAs targeting PHLPP2. RT-qPCR, 
immunoblotting, CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, and ELISA were carried 
out.
RESULTS: Significant increases in PHLPP2 levels were observed in cultured RGCs 
exposed to HG. The severe damages evoked by HG to RGCs were remarkably weakened 
in PHLPP2-silenced RGCs, including improved cell survival, attenuated cell 
apoptosis, repressed oxidative stress, and prohibited proinflammatory response. 
The silencing of PHLPP2 strengthened the activation of Nrf2 in HG-treated RGCs 
via modulation of the Akt-GSK-3β axis. Interruption of the Akt-GSK-3β axis 
reversed PHLPP2-silencing-elicited Nrf2 activation. The protective effects of 
PHLPP2 silencing on HG-induced injury of RGCs were diminished by Nrf2 
inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: The loss of PHLPP2 was beneficial for HG-injured RGCs through the 
effect on the Akt-GSK-3β-Nrf2 pathway. This work suggests a possible role of 
PHLPP2 in diabetic retinopathy."
1546,"Dendrite growth and side reactions of Zn metal anodes remain unresolved 
obstacles for practical application of aqueous Zn ion batteries. Herein, a 
two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic heterostructure with controlled thickness 
was constructed as a protective layer for a Zn metal anode. The reduction of 
uniformly distributed polyoxometalate in the layer causes a negative charge 
density gradient, which can accelerate zinc ion transfer, homogenize zinc 
deposition, and shield sulfates at the electrode interface, while the exposed 
hydrophobic alkyl chain of the layer can isolate the direct contact of water 
with the Zn anode. As a result of the synergetic effect, this 2D 
organic-inorganic heterostructure enables high Zn plating/stripping 
reversibility, with high average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.97% for 3700 
cycles at 2 mA cm-2. Under high Zn utilization conditions, a high areal-capacity 
full cell with hundreds of cycles was demonstrated."
1547,"The elevated glutathione (GSH) level in cancer cells contributes to the poor 
response to chemotherapy and necessitates the use of maximum tolerated drug 
doses, leading to myriad side effects. We have developed a biocompatible and 
fluorescently trackable nanosystem, iron(III)-bound nanocarbonaceous polyphenol 
(FeNCP), to modulate the available GSH pool in cancer cells for synergistic 
effects in treatments with a cytotoxic anticancer drug, doxorubicin (Dox). This 
nanosystem was designed using a nanoscale carbon system as a platform to 
generate a GSH-responsive gallic acid-iron complex. The effective interaction 
between FeNCP and GSH was probed in PBS (pH 7.4) and cell lysates using UV-Vis, 
fluorescence spectrophotometry, 1H NMR, flow cytometry, and confocal and 
transmission electron microscopic studies. The concurrent treatment of cancer 
cells with subcytotoxic FeNCP and Dox leads to dose reduction indices of Dox of 
∼6.1 for HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) and 6.7 for B16F0 (melanoma) to kill 
∼50% of the cell population, which is suggestive of the requirement of a 
multifold lower dose of Dox. Notably, this combination was relatively more 
cytotoxic toward cancer cell lines than the model normal cell line, Vero. The 
increased reactive oxygen species levels in combinatorial treatment reveal that 
FeNCP serves as a potential candidate for modulating glutathione activity and 
potentiating cytotoxic effects of Dox. The intelligent multifold design of this 
nanosystem might enable the applicability in optical detection of GSH and 
imaging-assisted surgery in the future, in addition to the potential to advance 
treatment regimens in anticancer chemotherapy."
1548,"Medical dressings play an important role in the field of tissue engineering 
owing to their ability to accelerate the process of wound healing. Great efforts 
have been made to fabricate wound dressings with distinctive features for 
promoting wound healing. However, most of the current synthesis methods either 
generate dressings of uniform size or involve complex fabrication techniques, 
thus limiting their commercialization for the personalized dressings. We report 
here a dressing, which presents a paradigm shift in the design of the dressing 
from uniform films to a micro-patterned film. The hypothesis driving the design 
is the ability of the 3D patterns to provide an efficient transient matrix 
filling the depth of the wound rather than just providing a barrier and slight 
re-epithelialization. We demonstrate the use of the digital light processing 3D 
printing technique to generate micro-pyramid-decorated wound healing dressings 
with individualized design and with bio-compatible gelatin methacryloyl to 
contact the wounded areas. In addition to providing better adhesion to the 
migratory cells, the micro-pyramids also enable covalent conjugation of heparin, 
providing capability to sequester endogenous growth factors (GFs). Based on 
these advantages, the developed dressing not only adheres strongly to the wound 
bed but also promotes the treatment of a rat wound model by utilizing the power 
of endogenous GFs for tissue regeneration. Thus, it is believed that the 
developed dressing can break through the limitation of traditional wound 
treatment and be an ideal candidate for wound healing."
1549,"Low-molecular-weight hydrogels are attractive scaffolds for drug delivery 
applications because of their modular and facile preparation starting from 
inexpensive molecular components. The molecular design of the hydrogelator 
results in a commitment to a particular release strategy, where either 
noncovalent or covalent bonding of the drug molecule dictates its rate and 
mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach using a 
reaction-coupled gelator to tune drug release in a facile and user-defined 
manner by altering the reaction pathway of the low-molecular-weight gelator 
(LMWG) and drug components through an acylhydrazone-bond-forming reaction. We 
show that an off-the-shelf drug with a reactive handle, doxorubicin, can be 
covalently bound to the gelator through its ketone moiety when the addition of 
the aldehyde component is delayed from 0 to 24 h, or noncovalently bound with 
its addition at 0 h. We also examine the use of an l-histidine methyl ester 
catalyst to prepare the drug-loaded hydrogels under physiological conditions. 
Fitting of the drug release profiles with the Korsmeyer-Peppas model 
corroborates a switch in the mode of release consistent with the reaction 
pathway taken: increased covalent ligation drives a transition from a Fickian to 
a semi-Fickian mode in the second stage of release with a decreased rate. 
Sustained release of doxorubicin from the reaction-coupled hydrogel is further 
confirmed in an MTT toxicity assay with MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We 
demonstrate the modularity and ease of the reaction-coupled approach to prepare 
drug-loaded self-assembled hydrogels in situ with tunable mechanics and drug 
release profiles that may find eventual applications in macroscale drug 
delivery."
1550,"In recent years, Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) has 
emerged as a flexible method that enables semi-automated volume ultrastructural 
imaging. We present a toolset for adherent cells that enables tracking and 
finding cells, previously identified in light microscopy (LM), in the FIB-SEM, 
along with the automatic acquisition of high-resolution volume datasets. We 
detect the underlying grid pattern in both modalities (LM and EM), to identify 
common reference points. A combination of computer vision techniques enables 
complete automation of the workflow. This includes setting the coincidence point 
of both ion and electron beams, automated evaluation of the image quality and 
constantly tracking the sample position with the microscope's field of view 
reducing or even eliminating operator supervision. We show the ability to target 
the regions of interest in EM within 5 µm accuracy while iterating between 
different targets and implementing unattended data acquisition. Our results 
demonstrate that executing volume acquisition in multiple locations autonomously 
is possible in EM."
1551,"Septins are cytoskeletal proteins conserved from algae and protists to mammals. 
A unique feature of septins is their presence as heteromeric complexes that 
polymerize into filaments in solution and on lipid membranes. Although animal 
septins associate extensively with actin-based structures in cells, whether 
septins organize as filaments in cells and if septin organization impacts septin 
function is not known. Customizing a tripartite split-GFP complementation assay, 
we show that all septins decorating actin stress fibers are octamer-containing 
filaments. Depleting octamers or preventing septins from polymerizing leads to a 
loss of stress fibers and reduced cell stiffness. Super-resolution microscopy 
revealed septin fibers with widths compatible with their organization as paired 
septin filaments. Nanometer-resolved distance measurements and single-protein 
tracking further showed that septin filaments are membrane bound and largely 
immobilized. Finally, reconstitution assays showed that septin filaments mediate 
actin-membrane anchoring. We propose that septin organization as octamer-based 
filaments is essential for septin function in anchoring and stabilizing actin 
filaments at the plasma membrane."
1552,"Continuing advances in proteomics highlight the ubiquity and biological 
importance of proteoforms─proteins with varied sequence, splicing, or 
distribution of post-translational modifications (PTMs). The preeminent example 
is histones, where the PTM pattern encodes the combinatorial language 
controlling the DNA transcription central to life. While the proteoforms with 
distinct PTM compositions are distinguishable by mass, the isomers with permuted 
PTMs commonly coexisting in cells generally require separation before 
mass-spectrometric (MS) analyses. That was accomplished on the bottom-up and 
middle-down levels using chromatography or ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), but 
proteolytic digestion obliterates the crucial PTM connectivity information. 
Here, we demonstrate baseline IMS resolution of intact isomeric proteoforms, 
specifically the acetylated H4 histones (11.3 kDa). The proteoforms with a 
single acetyl moiety on five alternative lysine residues (K5, K8, K12, K16, K20) 
known for distinct functionalities in vivo were constructed by two-step native 
chemical ligation and separated using trapped IMS at the resolving power up to 
350 on the Bruker TIMS/ToF platform. Full resolution for several pairs was 
confirmed using binary mixtures and by unique fragments in tandem MS employing 
collision-induced dissociation. This novel capability for top-down proteoform 
characterization is poised to open major new avenues in proteomics and 
epigenetics."
1553,"The Notch signaling pathway is an important regulator in fate decisions and 
immune responses of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). However, the function of Notch 
signaling in ILCs in acute coronary syndrome is still not fully elucidated. 
Thirty-one unstable angina pectoris (UAP) patients, 21 acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) patients, and 20 controls were included in this study. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated. The mRNA expression 
levels of Notch receptors and ligands were measured by real-time PCR, while ILC 
subsets were measured by flow cytometry. Lin- cells were purified and stimulated 
with γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI). ILC subsets, transcription factors, and 
secreted cytokines were assessed. Notch receptor and ligand mRNA levels were 
elevated in PBMCs and peripheral lin- cells from AMI patients. There was no 
significant difference in total lin-CD45+CD161+CD127+ ILC frequency among three 
groups. The CRTH2-CD117- ILC1 subset was down-regulated, while the CRTH2+ ILC2 
subset was up-regulated in AMI patients. The CRTH2-CD117+ ILC3 subpopulation was 
comparable among the three groups. ILC1% was negatively correlated with Notch1 
and Notch2 in AMI patients. Inhibition of Notch signaling pathway by GSI induced 
elevations in ILC1 frequency, T-bet mRNA expression, and interferon-γ secretion 
and reduced ILC2 frequency, GATA3 mRNA levels, and interleukin-5/interleukin-13 
production by lin- cells from AMI patients. The current data indicated that 
activation of Notch signaling pathway might contribute to ILC1-to-ILC2 shift in 
peripheral blood in AMI patients."
1554,"Neuropathic pain arises from injuries to the nervous system. It affects 20% of 
the adult US population and poses a major socioeconomic burden yet remains 
exceedingly difficult to treat. Current therapeutic approaches have limited 
efficacy and a large side effect profile that impedes their ability to treat 
neuropathic pain effectively. Preclinical research over the last 30 yr has 
established the critical role that pro-inflammatory neuro-immune cell 
interactions have in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain arising 
from various etiologies. Pro-inflammatory neuro-immune cell interactions also 
underlie the development of adverse side effects of opioids and the loss of 
their efficacy to treat pain. Evidence from work in our lab and others in 
preclinical animal models have shown that signaling from the bioactive 
sphingolipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), through the S1P receptor subtype 1 
(S1PR1) modulates neuro-immune cell interactions. Here, we discuss how targeting 
S1P/S1PR1 signaling with S1PR1 antagonists already Food and Drug 
Administration-approved or in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis can provide 
a viable pharmacotherapeutic approach to reduce neuro-immune cell inflammatory 
signaling and potentially treat patients suffering neuropathic pain and the 
adverse effects of opioids."
1555,"Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), which play an important role in tumor initiation 
and progression, have been identified in many cancers. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS) 
is an organosulfur compound extracted from garlic with anticancer activities. 
Nanog is a transcription factor responsible for maintaining the stemness of 
CSCs, but its role in the DATS-induced attenuation of renal CSC properties is 
unknown. In this study, renal CSCs were enriched from human renal cancer cell 
lines 786-O and ACHN cultured in a serum-free medium (SFM). The properties of 
CSCs were analyzed by evaluating the ability of the cells in sphere formation 
and measuring the expression of stem cell markers. We found that downregulation 
of Nanog inhibited renal CSC properties. DATS suppressed renal CSC activities by 
reducing tumorsphere formation, decreasing stem cell markers including Nanog, 
CD44, ALDH1A1, and Oct4, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. 
We further revealed that overexpression of Nanog reversed the suppressive 
effects of DATS on renal CSCs. Taken together, our results demonstrated that 
DATS inhibited renal CSCs by suppressing Nanog. These novel findings suggested 
that, through Nanog targeting, DATS can potentially be used as an anti-tumor 
agent for renal cancer."
1556,"Five versions of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii reference genome have been 
produced over the last two decades. Here we present version 6, bringing 
significant advances in assembly quality and structural annotations. 
PacBio-based chromosome-level assemblies for two laboratory strains, CC-503 and 
CC-4532, provide resources for the plus and minus mating type alleles. We 
corrected major misassemblies in previous versions and validated our assemblies 
via linkage analyses. Contiguity increased over ten-fold and >80% of filled gaps 
are within genes. We used Iso-Seq and deep RNA-seq datasets to improve 
structural annotations, and updated gene symbols and textual annotation of 
functionally characterized genes via extensive manual curation. We discovered 
that the cell wall-less classical reference strain CC-503 exhibits genomic 
instability potentially caused by deletion of the helicase RECQ3, with major 
structural mutations identified that affect >100 genes. We therefore present the 
CC-4532 assembly as the primary reference, although this strain also carries 
unique structural mutations and is experiencing rapid proliferation of a Gypsy 
retrotransposon. We expect all laboratory strains to harbor gene-disrupting 
mutations, which should be considered when interpreting and comparing 
experimental results. Collectively, the resources presented here herald a new 
era of Chlamydomonas genomics and will provide the foundation for continued 
research in this important reference organism."
1557,"The rarity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) poses a great challenge to their 
clinical application as reliable ""liquid biopsy"" markers for cancer diagnosis. 
Meanwhile, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) led to a reduced 
efficiency in capturing cells with lost or downregulated epithelial cell 
adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expressions. In this study, we proposed an integrated, 
highly efficient strategy for heterogeneous CTC capture and portable detection 
from the blood of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. First, the 
cellulose wrinkled hydrogel with excellent biocompatibility and high specific 
area was employed as the biointerface to capture heterogeneous CTCs with an 
improved capture efficiency in virtue of dual targeting against epithelial and 
mesenchymal ones. Meanwhile, the strategy of glucometer readout was introduced 
for the quantification of captured CTCs on the same hydrogel interface by a 
detection probe, Au-G-MSN-Apt, which was fabricated via entrapping glucose into 
the amino group functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) framework 
sealed by l-cysteine modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and then linked with 
dual aptamers of EpCAM and Vimentin. The number of captured CTCs on the hydrogel 
could be reflected according to the portable glucose meter (PGM) readings. 
Moreover, it was found that the captured cells maintained a higher viability on 
the hydrogel and could be in situ recultured without releasing from the 
substrate. Finally, this integrated strategy was successfully applied to inspect 
the correlations between the number of heterogeneous CTCs in the blood of NSCLC 
patients with disease stage and whether there was distant metastasis."
1558,"Different classes of Imidazopyridine i.e., Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, 
Imidazo[1,5-a] pyridine, Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, have shown versatile 
applications in various fields. In this review, we have concisely presented the 
usefulness of the fluorescent property of imidazopyridine in different fields 
such as imaging tools, optoelectronics, metal ion detection, etc. Fluorescence 
mechanisms such as excited state intramolecular proton transfer, photoinduced 
electron transfer, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, intramolecular charge 
transfer, etc. are incorporated in the designed fluorophore to make it for 
fluorescent applications. It has been widely employed for metal ion detection, 
where selective metal ion detection is possible with triazole-attached 
imidazopyridine, β-carboline imidazopyridine hybrid, quinoline conjugated 
imidazopyridine, and many more. Also, other popular applications involve organic 
light emitting diodes and cell imaging. This review shed a light on recent 
development in this area especially focusing on the optical properties of the 
molecules with their usage which would be helpful in designing application-based 
new imidazopyridine derivatives."
1559,"Combination therapy is a promising strategy for confronting the complexity of 
cancer. However, experimental exploration of the vast space of potential drug 
combinations is costly and unfeasible. Therefore, computational methods for 
predicting drug synergy are much needed for narrowing down this space, 
especially when examining new cellular contexts. Here, we thus introduce 
CCSynergy, a flexible, context aware and integrative deep-learning framework 
that we have established to unleash the potential of the Chemical Checker 
extended drug bioactivity profiles for the purpose of drug synergy prediction. 
We have shown that CCSynergy enables predictions of superior accuracy, 
remarkable robustness and improved context generalizability as compared to the 
state-of-the-art methods in the field. Having established the potential of 
CCSynergy for generating experimentally validated predictions, we next 
exhaustively explored the untested drug combination space. This resulted in a 
compendium of potentially synergistic drug combinations on hundreds of cancer 
cell lines, which can guide future experimental screens."
1560,"The atmospheric oxidation of chemicals has produced many new unpredicted 
pollutants. A microwave plasma torch-based ion/molecular reactor (MPTIR) 
interfacing an online mass spectrometer has been developed for creating and 
monitoring rapid oxidation reactions. Oxygen in the air is activated by the 
plasma into highly reactive oxygen radicals, thereby achieving oxidation of 
thioethers, alcohols, and various environmental pollutants on a millisecond 
scale without the addition of external oxidants or catalysts (6 orders of 
magnitude faster than bulk). The direct and real-time oxidation products of 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and p-phenylenediamines from the MPTIR match 
those of the long-term multistep environmental oxidative process. Meanwhile, two 
unreported environmental compounds were identified with an MPTIR and measured in 
the actual water samples, which demonstrates the considerable significance of 
the proposed device for both predicting the environmental pollutants (non-target 
screening) and studying the mechanism of atmospheric oxidative processes."
1561,"BACKGROUND: Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have received considerable 
attention as a means of transporting pharmacologically active molecules into 
living cells without damaging the cell membrane, and thus hold great promise as 
future therapeutics. Recently, several machine learning-based algorithms have 
been proposed for predicting CPPs. However, most existing predictive methods do 
not consider the agreement (disagreement) between similar (dissimilar) CPPs and 
depend heavily on expert knowledge-based handcrafted features.
RESULTS: In this study, we present SiameseCPP, a novel deep learning framework 
for automated CPPs prediction. SiameseCPP learns discriminative representations 
of CPPs based on a well-pretrained model and a Siamese neural network consisting 
of a transformer and gated recurrent units. Contrastive learning is used for the 
first time to build a CPP predictive model. Comprehensive experiments 
demonstrate that our proposed SiameseCPP is superior to existing baseline models 
for predicting CPPs. Moreover, SiameseCPP also achieves good performance on 
other functional peptide datasets, exhibiting satisfactory generalization 
ability."
1562,"Transcriptional enhanced associate domains (TEADs) are transcription factors 
that bind to cotranscriptional activators like the yes-associated protein (YAP) 
or its paralog transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). 
TEAD·YAP/TAZ target genes are involved in tissue and immune homeostasis, organ 
size control, tumor growth, and metastasis. Here, we report isoindoline and 
octahydroisoindole small molecules with a cyanamide electrophile that forms a 
covalent bond with a conserved cysteine in the TEAD palmitate-binding cavity. 
Time- and concentration-dependent studies against TEAD1-4 yielded second-order 
rate constants kinact/KI greater than 100 M-1 s-1. Compounds inhibited YAP1 
binding to TEADs with submicromolar IC50 values. Cocrystal structures with TEAD2 
enabled structure-activity relationship studies. In mammalian cells, compounds 
suppressed CTGF mRNA levels and inhibited TEAD1-4 transcriptional activity with 
submicromolar IC50 values. Inhibition of TEAD binding to YAP1 in mammalian cells 
was also observed. Several compounds inhibited the cell viability of sarcoma, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and breast cancer cells with 
single-digit micromolar IC50 values."
1563,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of pulmonary fibrosis remain 
unknown, and effective treatments have not yet been developed. It has been shown 
that oxidative stress is involved in lung fibrosis. Oxidized diacylglycerol 
(DAG) produced by oxidative stress is thought to play an important role in lung 
fibrosis. This study assessed the effect of oxidized DAG in an animal model of 
pulmonary fibrosis induced by aspiration of bleomycin (BLM) into the lungs. The 
inhibitory effect of ebselen on pulmonary fibrosis was also investigated. In 
lung fibrotic tissue induced by BLM, an increase in lipid peroxides and collagen 
accumulation was observed. Moreover, the levels of oxidized DAG, which has 
strong protein kinase C (PKC) activation activity, were significantly increased 
over time following the administration of BLM. Western blotting showed that 
phosphorylation of PKCα and δ isoforms was increased by BLM. Oral administration 
of ebselen significantly suppressed the increase in oxidized DAG induced by BLM 
and improved lung fibrosis. PKCα and δ phosphorylation were also significantly 
inhibited. The mRNA expression of α-smooth muscle actin and collagen I (marker 
molecules for fibrosis), as well as the production of transforming growth 
factor-β and tumor necrosis factor-α(a potentially important factor in the 
fibrotic process), were increased by BLM and significantly decreased by ebselen. 
The administration of BLM may induce lipid peroxidation in lung tissue, while 
the oxidized DAG produced by BLM may induce overactivation of PKCα and δ, 
resulting in the induction of lung fibrosis."
1564,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are utilized in a variety of clinical 
settings for the management of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer (mNSCLC). While any organ may be subject to immune-related adverse events 
(irAEs) as a consequence of ICI therapy, hematological irAEs are uncommon. We 
describe a scenario involving a patient with oncogene-addicted mNSCLC who 
experienced the rare, life-threatening complication of hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and cytokine release syndrome following the receipt of 
the IMPower150 regimen (carboplatin/paclitaxel/atezolizumab/bevacizumab) after 
progression on initial tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Malignancy-associated 
HLH, while previously described, is more typically associated with hematological 
rather than solid cancers and has only very recently been reported among 
patients receiving ICIs. While identification of hemophagocytosis on bone marrow 
examination is pathognomonic, this feature is not essential for confirming a 
diagnosis of HLH. Prompt recognition of suspicious laboratory and clinical 
features by medical oncologists and engagement with other relevant disciplines 
is hence critical to ensure optimal management of the condition."
1565,"Interleukin-34 (IL-34) is a cytokine that plays important roles at steady state 
and in diseases. The induced or inhibited expression of IL-34 by stimuli has 
been deeply investigated. However, the regulation of IL-34 basal expression is 
largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate whether IL-34 
expression is regulated by a general transcription factor Specificity Protein 1 
(Sp1) at transcription level. By using bioinformatic software, four putative 
Sp1-binding sites overlapping GC boxes were found in the core promoter region of 
IL-34. Alignment of the core promoter sequences of mammalian IL-34 showed GC 
box-C (-62/-57) and D (-11/-6) were conserved in some mammals. Luciferase assay 
results showed that only deletion of GC box-C (-62/-57) significantly reduced 
luciferase activities of IL-34 core promoter in SH-SY5Y cells. By using 
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), it was found that Sp1 specifically 
interacted with GC box-C sequence CCCGCC (-62/-57) in the core promoter of 
IL-34. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), it was discovered that Sp1 
bound to the core promoter of IL-34 in living cells. In addition, silencing of 
Sp1 expression by its specific siRNA reduced IL-34 mRNA and protein levels 
significantly in SH-SY5Y cells. Likewise, IL-34 expression was inhibited in a 
dose-dependent manner by a Sp1 inhibitor Plicamycin. Furthermore, silencing of 
Sp1 also downregulated mRNA and protein expression of IL-34 in GES-1 and 293T 
cell lines, suggesting that IL-34 transcription regulated by Sp1 was not 
cell-type specific. Taken together, these results indicate that Sp1 controls the 
basal level of IL-34 transcription."
1566,"Interactions of heavy metals with charged mineral surfaces control their 
mobility in the environment. Here, we investigate the adsorption of Y(III) onto 
the orthoclase (001) basal plane, the former as a representative of rare earth 
elements and an analogue of trivalent actinides and the latter as a 
representative of naturally abundant K-feldspar minerals. We apply in situ 
high-resolution X-ray reflectivity to determine the sorption capacity and 
molecular distribution of adsorbed Y species as a function of the Y3+ 
concentration, [Y3+], at pH 7 and 5. With [Y3+] ≥ 1 mM at pH 7, we observe an 
inner-sphere (IS) sorption complex at a distance of ∼1.5 Å from the surface and 
an outer-sphere (OS) complex at 3-4 Å. Based on the adsorption height of the IS 
complex, a bidentate, binuclear binding mode, in which Y3+ binds to two terminal 
oxygens, is proposed. In contrast, mostly OS sorption is observed at pH 5. The 
observed maximum Y coverage is ∼1.3 Y3+/AUC (AUC: area of the unit cell = 111.4 
Å2) for all the investigated pH values and Y concentrations, which is in the 
expected range based on the estimated surface charge of orthoclase (001)."
1567,"Intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins has increased advantages over 
current small-molecule drugs and gene therapies, especially in therapeutic 
efficacies for a broad spectrum of diseases. Hence, developing the protein 
therapeutics approach provides a needed alternative. Here, we designed a 
mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-mediated protein delivery approach and 
demonstrated effective intracellular delivery of the denatured superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) protein, overcoming the delivery challenges and achieving higher 
enzymatic activity than native SOD-conjugated MSNs. The denatured SOD-conjugated 
MSN delivery strategy provides benefits of reduced size and steric hindrance, 
increased protein flexibility without distorting its secondary structure, 
exposure of the cell-penetrating peptide transactivator of transcription for 
enhanced efficient delivery, and a change in the corona protein composition, 
enabling cytosolic delivery. After delivery, SOD displayed a specific activity 
around threefold higher than in our previous reports. Furthermore, the in vivo 
biosafety and therapeutic potential for neuron therapy were evaluated, 
demonstrating the biocompatibility and the effective antioxidant effect in 
Neuro-2a cells that protected neurite outgrowth from paraquat-induced reactive 
oxygen species attack. This study offers an opportunity to realize the druggable 
possibility of cytosolic proteins using MSNs."
1568,"Fibrosis is an important pathological process in the development of 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and the activation of hepatic stellate 
cell (HSC) is a central event in liver fibrosis. However, the transcriptomic 
change of activated HSCs (aHSCs) and resting HSCs (rHSCs) in NASH patients has 
not been assessed. This study aimed to identify transcriptomic signature of HSCs 
during the development of NASH and the underlying key functional pathways. 
NASH-associated transcriptomic change of HSCs was defined by single cell 
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, and those top up-regulated genes were 
identified as NASH-associated transcriptomic signatures. Those functional 
pathways involved in the NASH-associated transcriptomic change of aHSCs were 
explored by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and functional 
enrichment analyses. Key regulators were explored by upstream regulator analysis 
and transcription factor enrichment analysis. scRNA-seq analysis identified 
numerous differentially expressed genes in both rHSCs and aHSCs between NASH 
patients and healthy controls. Both scRNA-seq analysis and in-vivo experiments 
showed the existence of rHSCs (mainly expressing a-SMA) in the normal liver and 
the increased aHSCs (mainly expressing Collagen 1) in the fibrosis liver 
tissues. NASH-associated transcriptomic signature of rHSC (NASHrHSCsignature) 
and NASH-associated transcriptomic signature of aHSC (NASHaHSCsignature) were 
identified. WGCNA revealed the main pathways correlated with transcriptomic 
change of aHSCs. Several key upstream regulators and transcription factors of 
determining the functional change of aHSCs in NASH were identified. This study 
developed a useful transcriptomic signature with the potential in assessing the 
fibrosis severity in the development of NASH. This study also identified the 
main pathways in the activation of HSCs during the development of NASH."
1569,"Fragaria nubicola, known as Tibetan strawberry, is an edible plant possessing 
various health-promoting effects. However, its functional compositions were 
rarely studied. In this work, monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors in this 
plant were rapidly screened using the enzyme-functionalized magnetic 
nanoparticles coupled with UPLC-QTOF-MS. Two inhibitors, 
quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide-6″-methyl ester (1) and 
kaempferol-3-O-β-d-glucuronide-6″-methyl ester (2), were identified from this 
plant with the IC50 values of 19.44 ± 1.17 and 22.63 ± 1.78 μM, respectively. 
Enzyme kinetic analysis and molecular docking were carried out to investigate 
the mechanism of inhibition. Contents of both compounds as well as those of 
total phenolics and flavonoids were quantified to be 24.76 ± 1.26, 35.59 ± 1.17, 
837.67 ± 10.62, and 593.46 ± 10.37 μg/g, respectively. In addition, both 
compounds exhibited significant neuroprotective effects on 
6-hydroxydopamine-induced PC12 cells. This is the first report on the 
neuroprotective components of F. nubicola, suggesting its potential for 
developing neuroprotective functional food."
1570,"The dominant method for generating Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that 
produce high titers of biotherapeutic proteins utilizes selectable markers such 
as dihydrofolate reductase (Dhfr) or glutamine synthetase (Gs), alongside 
inhibitory compounds like methotrexate (MTX) or methionine sulfoximine (MSX), 
respectively. Recent work has shown the importance of asparaginase (Aspg) for 
growth in media lacking glutamine-the selection medium for Gs-based selection 
systems. We generated a Gs/Aspg double knockout CHO cell line and evaluated its 
utility as a novel dual selectable system via co-transfection of Gs-Enbrel and 
Aspg-Enbrel plasmids. Using the same selection conditions as the standard Gs 
system, the resulting cells from the Gs/Aspg dual selection showed substantially 
improved specific productivity and titer compared to the standard Gs selection 
method, however, with reduced growth rate and viability. Following adaptation in 
selection medium, the cells improved viability and growth while still achieving 
~5-fold higher specific productivity and ~3-fold higher titer than Gs selection 
alone. We anticipate that with further optimization of culture medium and 
selection conditions this approach would serve as an effective addition to 
workflows for the industrial production of recombinant biotherapeutics. This

1571,"While the intermittent gating of ion channels has been well studied for decades, 
dynamics of the action of secondary transporters, another major pathway for ion 
transmembrane transports, remains largely unexplored in living cells. Herein, 
intermittent blinking of the spontaneous bioluminescence (BL) from single native 
bacteria, P. phosphoreum, was reported, investigated and attributed to the 
intermittent gating of sodium/proton antiporters (NhaA) between the active and 
inactive conformations. Each gating event caused the rapid depolarization and 
recovery of membrane potential within several seconds, accompanying with the 
apparent BL blinking due to the transient inhibitions on the activity of the 
respiratory chain. Temperature-dependent measurements further obtained an 
activation energy barrier of the conformational change of 20.3 kJ/mol."
1572,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of non-coding, covalently uninterrupted 
loop transcripts, most of which remain to be functionally characterized. Here, 
we identified circPDIA4 as an oncogenic circRNA in gastric cancer. Clinically, 
circPDIA4 was significantly upregulated in malignant tissues and associated with 
poor survival of gastric cancer patients. The biogenesis of circPDIA4 was 
mediated by the RNA binding protein Quaking, which bound intron 2 and 4 of PDIA4 
pre-mRNA to promote backsplicing of exons 3 and 4. Elevated expression of 
circPDIA4 promoted distant metastasis in various mouse xenograft models in vivo 
and accelerated cancer cell invasion in vitro. CircPDIA4 functioned through 
distinct oncogenic mechanisms in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Cytoplasmic 
circPDIA4 bound to ERK1/2 and sustained hyper-activation of the MAPK pathway by 
preventing DUSP6-mediated ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Notably, circPDIA4 depletion 
enhanced the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to ERK inhibitors. In the 
nucleus, circPDIA4 interacted with DHX9 as a decoy and repressed its inhibitory 
functions on circRNA biogenesis to boost expression of multiple oncogenic 
circRNAs, which promoted gastric cancer progression. These findings reveal a 
dual tumor-promoting mechanism for circPDIA4 by regulating oncogenic circRNA 
biogenesis and increasing MAPK activity. CircPDIA4 should be investigated 
further as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in gastric 
cancer."
1573,"Near-infrared circularly polarized light is attractive for wide-ranging 
applications. However, high-performance near-infrared circularly polarized light 
is challenging to realize. Here, we show that left-handed chiral photonic 
cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films produced from ultrasonicated suspensions 
enable right-handed circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor 
of -0.330 in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II). We present a theoretical 
analysis of the adverse effect of structural defects and luminescence intensity 
heterogeneity on the right-handed circularly polarized luminescence glum inside 
the bandgap and the occurrence of left-handed circularly polarized luminescence 
at the band edges. We demonstrate the potential of the chiral photonic CNC films 
with NIR-II circularly polarized light for cancer cell discrimination. The 
present work identifies key scientific questions in CNC-based circularly 
polarized luminescence materials research."
1574,"BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cutaneous malignancy. 
Multiple risk factors are associated in the development of BCC, with ultraviolet 
light and genetics playing major roles.
AIMS: The departments of dermatology, medical oncology, ophthalmology, 
otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery, plastic surgery, and radiation 
oncology of the Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center, Manila, Philippines, have 
convened and formulated consensus statements on the diagnosis and management of 
BCC patients seen in the institution.
CONCLUSION: The summary of the recommendations is: (1) Surgery is the treatment 
of choice for BCC. The range of margins (2-4 mm) depends on the type of BCC. (2) 
Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is indicated for high risk BCC. (3) Topical 
treatment with imiquimod or 5-flourouracil (5-FU) may be used for superficial 
BCC. (4) Destructive methods (cryotherapy, curettage and electrodessication, 
photodynamic therapy) may be used for low risk BCC. (5) Medical and/or radiation 
therapy is advised for cases where surgery is contraindicated or tumor is not 
amenable to surgery. Metastasis of this malignancy is rare. Follow-up, which may 
continue up until 2 years, is recommended for high risk BCC."
1575,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR), a common condition in the westernized world, 
is suggested to be more immunologically complex than the archetypical 'Th2' 
inflammation. New approaches are needed to decode this complexity.
AIMS/OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explored a novel histology-based analysis for 
circulating blood leukocyte profiling in 16 patients with seasonal AR outside 
and during the pollen season.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Leukocytes were purified with minimal ex-vivo artefacts, 
embedded into agarose-paraffin pellets for immunohistochemistry-based immune 
cell profiling. Blood leukocyte mapping was performed.
RESULTS: Samples collected during the pollen season had statistically increased 
eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and CD8+ T-lymphocytes compared to the 
off-season baseline. In contrast, no change was observed for CD20+ B-lymphocytes 
and CD3+ T-lymphocytes. Subclassification of CD4+ T-helper cells demonstrated a 
parallel and significant expansion of Th2 and Th17-cells during the pollen 
season, while Th1-cells remained unchanged. Whereas absolute basophils numbers 
were unaltered, the basophil markers GATA2 and CPA3 increased during the pollen 
season.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This study introduces a novel and applicable 
method for systemic immune cell screening and provides further evidence of 
complex and parallel Th2 and Th17-immune signatures in seasonal AR. It also 
forwards GATA2 and CPA3 as potential biomarkers for ongoing allergic 
inflammation."
1576,"The analysis of whole genomes of pan-cancer data sets provides a challenge for 
researchers, and we contribute to the literature concerning the identification 
of robust subgroups with clear biological interpretation. Specifically, we 
tackle this unsupervised problem via a novel rank-based Bayesian clustering 
method. The advantages of our method are: the integration and quantification of 
all uncertainties related to both the input data and the model; the 
probabilistic interpretation of final results to allow straightforward 
assessment of the stability of clusters leading to reliable conclusions; and the 
transparent biological interpretation of the identified clusters, since each 
cluster is characterized by its top-ranked genomic features. We applied our 
method to RNA-seq data from cancer samples from 12 tumor types from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas. We identified a robust clustering that mostly reflects tissue of 
origin, but also includes pan-cancer clusters. Importantly, we identified three 
pan-squamous clusters composed of a mix of lung squamous cell carcinoma, head 
and neck squamous carcinoma and bladder cancer, with different biological 
functions over-represented in the top genes that characterize the three 
clusters. We also found two novel subtypes of kidney cancer that show different 
prognosis, and we reproduced known subtypes of breast cancer. Taken together, 
our method allows identification of robust and biologically meaningful clusters 
of pan-cancer samples."
1577,"To discover novel fungicidal agrochemicals for treating wheat scab, 39 novel 
camphor sulfonohydrazide/sulfonamide derivatives 4a-4t and 6a-6s were designed 
and synthesized. In the in vitro antifungal/antioomycete assay, compounds 4g, 
4n, and 4o displayed significant inhibitory activities against Fusarium 
graminearum, Botryosphaeria dothidea, and Phytophthora capsici. Among them, 4n 
exhibited the best antifungal activity against F. graminearum with an EC50 value 
of 0.41 mg/L, which was at the same level as that of pydiflumetofen. The in vivo 
experiment revealed that 4n presented excellent protective and curative efficacy 
toward F. graminearum. In the antifungal mechanism study, 4n could increase the 
cell membrane permeability and reduce the exopolysaccharide and ergosterol 
content of F. graminearum. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that 4n could significantly damage 
the surface morphology and the cell ultrastructure of mycelia to interfere with 
the growth of F. graminearum. Furthermore, 4n exhibited potent succinate 
dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitory activity in vitro with an IC50 value of 3.94 μM, 
which was equipotent to pydiflumetofen (IC50 = 4.07 μM). The molecular dynamics 
simulation and docking study suggested that compound 4n could well occupy the 
active site and form strong interactions with the key residues of SDH. The 
above-mentioned results demonstrated that the title camphor 
sulfonohydrazide/sulfonamide derivatives could be promising lead compounds for 
further succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide development."

1579,"We investigated SNPs in alternative oxidase (AOX) genes and their connection to 
ecotype origins (climate, altitude and rainfall) by using genomic data sets of 
Arabidopsis and rice populations from 1190 and 90 ecotypes, respectively. 
Parameters were defined to detect non-synonymous SNPs in the AOX ORF, which 
revealed amino acid (AA) changes in AOX1c, AOX1d and AOX2 from Arabidopsis and 
AOX1c from rice in comparison to AOX references from Columbia-0 and Japonica 
ecotypes, respectively. Among these AA changes, Arabidopsis AOX1c_A161E&G165R 
and AOX1c_R242S revealed a link to high rainfall and high altitude, 
respectively, while all other changes in Arabidopsis and rice AOX were connected 
to high altitude and rainfall. Comparative 3D modeling showed that all mutant 
AOX presented structural differences in relation to the respective references. 
Molecular docking analysis uncovered lower binding affinity values between AOX 
and the substrate ubiquinol for most of the identified structures compared to 
their reference, indicating better enzyme-substrate binding affinities. Thus, 
our in silico data suggest that the majority of the AA changes found in the 
available ecotypes will confer better enzyme-subtract interactions and thus 
indicate environment-related, more efficient AOX activity. This article is

1580,"AIMS: Chronic alcohol misuse could cause alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM), and the 
specific mechanisms remained largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore 
the effects of endogenous ceramides on chronic ethanol-induced myocardial injury 
or cell loss (e.g. necroptosis).
METHODS: We established chronic alcohol intoxication models in vivo (male 
C57BL/6 mice) and in vitro (H9c2 cardiomyoblasts). The ceramide profiles were 
analyzed in mice myocardium and cultured cardiomyocytes. Further research on the 
role of ceramides and underlying signaling pathways was carried out in H9c2 
cells.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The ceramide profiles analysis revealed increased long 
and very long-chain ceramides in alcoholic myocardium and ethanol-treated 
cardiomyocytes. Next, we proved that endogenous ceramide inhibition could reduce 
necroptosis and alleviate cardiomyocytes injury as suggested by decreased levels 
of p-RIPK1, p-RIPK3 and p-MLKL proteins and cardiac injury factors expression. 
Furthermore, we found that lysosomal dysfunction also contributed to 
alcohol-induced cardiac damage and inhibiting ceramide biosynthesis could 
repaired this to some extent. Cells studies with exogenous C6 ceramide confirmed 
the pleotropic roles of ceramide in myocardial damage by causing both 
necroptosis and lysosomal dysfunction. Finally, our data suggested that 
lysosomal dysfunction could sensitize cardiomyocytes to induction of necroptosis 
due to the restriction on degradation of RIPK1/RIPK3 proteins. In conclusion, 
chronic ethanol treatment boosted myocardial ceramide synthesis in animal hearts 
and cultured cardiomyocytes. Moreover, ceramides exerted crucial roles in the 
intrinsic signaling pathways of alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity. Targeting 
ceramide biosynthesis to simultaneously attenuate necroptosis and lysosomal 
dysfunction might be a novel strategy for preventing alcoholic cardiotoxicity."
1581,"Hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) is caused by urate crystals that get deposited in 
the kidney and contribute to renal fibrosis. Uric acid (UA) has been proven to 
directly cause renal mesangial cell oxidative stress and fibrosis in the 
pathogenesis of HN. Some antioxidants can be used as chemopreventive agents of 
HN. Hibiscus sabdariffa leaf extracts (HLE), rich in polyphenol, have been shown 
to possess hypoglycemic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, antiatherosclerotic, and 
anticancer effects. The aim of the study is to examine the inhibitory effect of 
HLE and its main component ellagic acid (EA) on renal fibrosis. In vitro, mouse 
renal glomerular mesangial SV40MES13 cells pretreated with UA were demonstrated 
to trigger obvious morphological changes and viability loss, as well as affect 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activities. Noncytotoxic doses of HLE and EA 
abolished the UA-induced cell injury and MMP-2/9 secretion. In addition, HLE and 
EA exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on the UA-treated cells 
with a reduction in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) production. Next, 
the UA-activated pro-fibrotic factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, 
and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) were inhibited by HLE or EA. 
Mechanistic assays indicated that antifibrotic effects of HLE might be mediated 
via TGF-β/Smad signaling, as confirmed by the transfection of Smad7 siRNA. In 
vivo, HLE and EA supplementations significantly alleviated HN development, which 
may result from inhibiting adenine-induced TGF-β production accompanying 
oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as fibrogenesis. Our data imply that 
EA-enriched HLE regulates the TGF-β/Smad signaling, which in turn led to reduced 
renal mesangial cell injury and fibrosis in HN and provided a new mechanism for 
its nephroprotective activity."
1582,"AIMS: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a global health problem caused, 
among other factors, by oxidative stress from the formation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). One important source of ROS is microsomal ethanol metabolism 
catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), which is induced by chronic ethanol 
consumption. Inhibition of CYP2E1 by clomethiazole (CMZ) decreases oxidative 
stress in cell cultures and improves ALD in animal studies. Our study aimed to 
assess the benefits of a CYP2E1 inhibitor (clomethiazole) in detoxification of 
patients with ALD.
METHODS: Open label, randomized controlled clinical trial to study whether 
CYP2E1 inhibition improves ALD in the patients with alcohol use disorders 
admitted for alcohol detoxification therapy (ADT). Patients had to have a serum 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity exceeding twice the upper normal limit 
at time of admission and be non-cirrhotic defined by fibroscan value <12 kPa. 
Sixty patients were randomly assigned to ADT with either CMZ or clorazepate 
(CZP) for 7-10 days in a 1:1 ratio. The chlorzoxazone test of CYP2E1 activity 
was performed at enrolment and at 2 points during the study.
RESULTS: ADT improved hepatic steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter) in 
both groups significantly. A trend towards a greater improvement in hepatic fat 
content during ADT (-21.5%) was observed in the CMZ group (252 ± 48 dB/m vs. 
321 ± 38 dB/m; P < 0.0001) compared with the CZP group (-13.9%; 273 ± 38 dB/m 
vs. 317 ± 39 dB/m; P < 0.0001). As already reported, serum AST (P < 0.004) and 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities (P < 0.0006) significantly decreased 
in CMZ patients as compared with patients on CZP by the end of hospitalization. 
A significant correlation was found between AST (P = 0.023), ALT (P = 0.009), 
GGT (P = 0.039) and CAP.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that CMZ improves clinical biomarkers for 
ALD in humans most likely due to its inhibitory effect on CYP2E1. Because of its 
addictive potential, CMZ can only be given for a short period of time and 
therefore other CYP2E1 inhibitors to treat ALD are needed."
1583,"INTRODUCTION: The implications of infiltrative compared to non-infiltrative 
growth of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on the tumor stroma and immune 
cell landscape are unknown. This is of clinical importance, because infiltrative 
BCCs, in contrast to other BCC subtypes, are more likely to relapse after 
surgery and radiotherapy.
METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study analyzed 38 BCCs collected from 
2018 to 2021. In the first cohort (n=28) immune cells were characterized by 
immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence staining for CD3, CD8, 
CD68, Foxp3, and α-SMA protein expression. In the second cohort (n=10) with 
matched characteristics (age, sex, location, and BCC subtype), inflammatory 
parameters, including TGF-β1, TGF-β2, ACTA2, IL-10, IL-12A, and Foxp3, were 
quantified via RT-qPCR after isolating mRNA from BCC tissue samples and

RESULTS: Infiltrative BCCs showed significantly increased levels of α-SMA 
expression in fibroblasts (p=0.0001) and higher levels of Foxp3+ (p=0.0023) and 
CD3+ (p=0.0443) T-cells compared to non-infiltrative BCCs. CD3+ (p=0.0171) and 
regulatory T-cells (p=0.0026) were significantly increased in α-SMA positive 
tumor stroma, whereas CD8+ T-cells (p=0.1329) and CD68+ myeloid cells (p=0.2337) 
were not affected. TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 correlated significantly with ACTA2/α-SMA 
mRNA expression (p=0.020, p=0.005).
CONCLUSION: Infiltrative growth of BCCs shows a myofibroblastic stroma 
differentiation and is accompanied by an immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1584,"Applying the emerging molecular networking strategy, an uncommon cembranoid 
orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5-fused scaffold, an unusual 
eunicellane-type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, 
ximaolides M and N (7 and 8), along with nine known terpenoids 3-6 and 9-13 were 
isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum. The structure and 
absolute configuration of all new compounds were established by a combination of 
spectroscopic data, X-ray diffraction analysis, and/or quantum chemical 
computational approaches. The plausible biogenetic relationship among these 
skeletally different terpenoids was proposed and discussed. In in vitro 
bioassay, new compound 7 exhibited a remarkable inhibitory activity against 
protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) with the IC50 value of 8.06 μM. In 
addition, compounds 4 and 10 displayed significant inhibitory effects on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages 
cells with the IC50 values of 19.13 and 16.45 μM, respectively. Compound 9 
showed interesting cytotoxicity against H1975, MDA-MB231, A549, and H1299 cancer 
cell lines with IC50 values of 31.59, 34.96, 43.87, and 27.93 μM, respectively."
1585,"In vivo, cells collectively migrate in a variety of developmental and 
pathological contexts. Coordinated epithelial rotation represents a unique type 
of collective cell migrations, which has been modeled in vitro under spatially 
confined conditions. Although it is known that the coordinated rotation depends 
on intercellular interactions, the contribution of E-cadherin, a major cell-cell 
adhesion molecule, has not been directly addressed on two-dimensional (2D) 
confined substrates. Here, using well-controlled fibronectin-coated surfaces, we 
tracked and compared the migratory behaviors of MDCK cells expressing or lacking 
E-cadherin. We observed that wild-type MDCK II cells exhibited persistent and 
coordinated rotations on discoidal patterns, while E-cadherin knockout cells 
migrated in a less coordinated manner without large-scale rotation. Our 
comparison of the collective dynamics between these two cell types revealed a 
series of changes in migratory behavior caused by the loss of E-cadherin, 
including a decreased global migration speed, less regularity in quantified 
coordination and increased average density of topological defects. Taken 
together, these data demonstrate that spontaneous initiation of collective 
epithelial rotations depends on E-cadherin under 2D discoidal confinements. This

1586,"BACKGROUND: Anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) is an uncommon malignancy with a 
rising incidence that has a high cure rate in its early stages. There is an 
unmet need for a reliable method to monitor response to treatment and assist in 
surveillance. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing has shown great promise in 
other solid tumors for monitoring disease progression and detecting relapse in 
real time. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and use of personalized 
and tumor-informed ctDNA testing in SCCA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed real-world data from 251 patients (817 plasma 
samples) with stages I-IV SCCA, collected between 11/5/19 and 5/31/22. The tumor 
genomic landscape and feasibility of ctDNA testing was examined for all 
patients. The prognostic value of longitudinal ctDNA testing was assessed in 
patients with clinical follow-up (N = 37).
RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed PIK3CA as the most commonly 
mutated gene, and no associations between mutations and stage. Anytime ctDNA 
positivity and higher ctDNA levels (MTM/mL) were associated with metastatic 
disease (P = .004). For 37 patients with clinical follow-up, median follow-up 
time was 21.0 months (range: 4.1-67.3) post-diagnosis. For patients with stages 
I-III disease, anytime ctDNA-positivity after definitive treatment was 
associated with reduced DFS (HR: 28.0; P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of personalized and 
tumor-informed ctDNA testing as an adjunctive tool in patients with SCCA as well 
as potential use for detection of molecular/minuteimal residual disease, and 
relapse during surveillance. Prospective studies are needed to better evaluate 
the use of ctDNA testing in this indication."
1587,"OBJECTIVE: Neutrophils are important in host defense. However, neutrophils are 
also linked to inflammation and organ damage. The purpose of this study was to 
assess whether markers of neutrophil activation are increased in polymyalgia 
rheumatica.
METHODS: Levels of immune complexes (IC), calprotectin, and neutrophil 
extracellular traps (NETs) were measured in plasma of healthy individuals 
(n = 30) and patients with PMR (n = 60), at flare and upon treatment with 
glucocorticoids using ELISA. Plasma-mediated neutrophil activation was assessed 
in presence of an FcγRIIA inhibitory antibody (IV.3).
RESULTS: Plasma levels of calprotectin and NETs were elevated in PMR 
(p < 0.001). Mechanistically, neutrophil activation was driven by ICs, present 
in plasma, able to up-regulate neutrophil activation markers CD66b and CD11b 
(p < 0.0001) in an FcγRIIA-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Of note, circulating 
levels of IC correlated with plasma induced CD66b and CD11b (r = 0.51, 
p = 0.004, and r = 0.46, p = 0.01 respectively) and decreased after 
glucocorticoid therapy.In contrast to NETs, calprotectin significantly decreased 
after glucocorticoid therapy (p < 0.001) and was higher in PMR without 
overlapping giant cell arteritis (GCA) compared to patients with overlapping 
disease (p = 0.014). Interestingly, musculoskeletal involvement was associated 
with elevated levels of calprotectin before initiation of glucocorticoid therapy 
(p = 0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil activation, including NET formation, is increased in 
PMR, through IC-mediated engagement of FcγRIIA. Clinically, neutrophil 
activation is associated with musculoskeletal involvement, with calprotectin, 
but not NETs, being a biomarker of treatment response in PMR patients. In all, 
IC-mediated neutrophil activation is a central process in PMR pathogenesis 
identifying potential novel therapeutic targets (FcγRIIA), as well as soluble 
markers for disease monitoring (calprotectin)."
1588,"SUMMARY: In many modern bioinformatics applications, such as statistical 
genetics, or single-cell analysis, one frequently encounters datasets which are 
orders of magnitude too large for conventional in-memory analysis. To tackle 
this challenge, we introduce SIMBSIG, a highly scalable Python package which 
provides a scikit-learn-like interface for out-of-core, GPU-enabled similarity 
searches, principal component analysis, and clustering. Due to the PyTorch 
backend it is highly modular and particularly tailored to many data types with a 
particular focus on biobank data analysis.

1589,"OBJECTIVES: Rituximab has become the cornerstone of induction treatment in 
ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). B cell depletion may increase the risk of 
hypogammaglobulinemia, potentially leading to severe infections. This study aims 
to assess factors associated with hypogammaglobulinemia in AAV patients treated 
with rituximab.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included AAV patients treated with 
rituximab induction in 14 European centers. Severe adverse events (SAEs) were 
defined as episodes requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics, 
malignancies, or death. Linear and logistic regression were used to identify 
predictors of IgG levels and of the risk of hypogammaglobulinemia, defined as 
IgG ≤7 g/l at 6 months.
RESULTS: The study included 227 patients. IgG levels at 6 months were lower than 
baseline (p< 0.001). Patients requiring intravenous antibiotics during the first 
6 months had lower IgG levels at 6 months (p= 0.004). Age (β [95%CI]: -0.23 
[-0.38;-0.08] per 10 years, p= 0.003), oral glucocorticoid dose at induction (β 
[95%CI]:-0.37[-0.51;-0.24] per sqrt-transformed mg prednisone, p< 0.001) and 
concomitant use of intravenous glucocorticoid pulses (β 
[95%CI]:-0.88[-1.73;-0.02], p= 0.044) were associated with IgG levels at 
6 months. Hypogammaglobulinemia was identified in 97 (42.7%) patients. In 
multivariable logistic regression, factors associated with the risk of 
hypogammaglobulinemia were age (OR [95%CI]: 1.46 [1.15; 1.86] per 10 years, p= 
0.002) and oral glucocorticoid dose at induction (OR [95%CI]: 1.52[1.23; 1.89] 
per 10 mg prednisone, p< 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In AAV patients treated with rituximab, hypogammaglobulinemia at 
6 months after induction is common, and lower IgG levels are associated with 
serious infections. The risk of hypogammaglobulinemia in these patients 
increases with age and higher glucocorticoid doses."

evaluating red cell concentrate transfusion are limited. We retrospectively 
studied 285 newly diagnosed HL patients who received first-line adriamycin, 
bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine (ABVD) treatment at 
Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. HIV prevalence in the cohort was 39.5% and 
74.2% of patients had advanced stage HL. Patient prognosis was scored using the 
HL International Prognostic Score (IPS-7) and HL IPS-3. Seventy (24.6%) patients 
were transfused with a median of 2 (IQR 1-5) units per patient. Compared to 
HIV-negative patients, more HIV-positive patients were transfused (14.1% vs. 
40.4%, p < .001) and received more units, median 2 (IQR 1-3) vs. 3 (IQR 2-5), 
p = .035. HL IPS-7 (OR 2.1, p < .001) and HL IPS-3 (OR 2.6, p < .001) were 
independently associated with transfusion. HL IPS-7, HL IPS-3, and HIV 
positivity remained associated with transfusion after adjusting for covariates. 
For patients with newly diagnosed HL, HL IPS-7, HL IPS-3, and HIV status

1591,"Due to its high metastatic potential, malignant melanoma is one of the deadliest 
skin cancers. In melanoma as well as in other cancers, acidification of the 
tumor microenvironment (= TME, inverse pH-gradient) is a well-known driver of 
tumor progression and metastasis. Membrane-bound receptors, such as the 
proton-sensitive GPCR (pH-GPCR) GPR4, are considered as potential initiators of 
the signaling cascades relevant to malignant transformation. In this study, we 
investigated the pH-dependent migration of GPR4 wildtype/overexpressing 
SK-Mel-28 cells by using an impedance-based electrical wounding and migration 
assay and classical Boyden chamber experiments. Migration of GPR4 overexpressing 
SK-Mel-28 cells was enhanced in a range of pH 6.5 - pH 7.5 as compared to 
controls in the impedance-based electrical wounding and migration assay. In 
Boyden chamber experiments, GPR4 overexpression only increased migration at pH 
7.5 in a Matrigel-free setup, but not at pH 6.5. Results indicate that GPR4 is 
involved in the migration of melanoma cells, especially in the tumor periphery, 
and that this process is affected by pH in the TME."
1592,"BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized 
by hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone diseases, with or without neurological 
symptoms. Plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a highly sensitive and specific 
biomarker for GD, has been used for diagnosis and monitoring the response to 
treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective treatment for the 
non-neurologic symptoms of GD. Neuronopathic GD (type 2 and 3) accounts for 
60%-70% of the Asian affected population.
METHODS: We explored combination therapy of ERT followed by hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) and its long-term outcomes in patients with GD type 
3 (GD3).
RESULTS: Four patients with GD3 and one with GD type 1 (GD1) underwent HSCT. The 
types of donor were one matched-related, one matched-unrelated, and three 
haploidentical. The age at disease onset was 6-18 months and the age at HSCT was 
3.8-15 years in the patients with GD3. The latest age at follow-up was 
8-22 years, with a post-HSCT duration of 3-14 years. All patients had successful 
HSCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in one patient. The enzyme 
activities were normalized at 2 weeks post HSCT. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations became 
lower than the pathological value. All of the patients are still alive and 
physically independent. Most of them (4/5) returned to school. None of the 
patients with GD3 had seizures or additional neurological symptoms after HSCT, 
but showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: ERT followed by HSCT could be considered as an alternative 
treatment for patients with GD3 who have a high risk of fatal neurological 
progression."
1593,"With the increasing incidence of cancer worldwide, the prevention and treatment 
of cancer have garnered considerable scientific attention. Traditional 
chemotherapeutic drugs are highly toxic and associated with substantial side 
effects; therefore, there is an urgent need for developing new therapeutic 
agents. Dietary phytochemicals are important in tumor prevention and treatment 
because of their low toxicity and side effects at low concentrations; however, 
their exact mechanisms of action remain obscure. DNA damage is mainly caused by 
physical or chemical factors in the environment, such as ultraviolet light, 
alkylating agents and reactive oxygen species that cause changes in the DNA 
structure of cells. Several phytochemicals have been shown inhibit the 
occurrence and development of tumors by inducing DNA damage. This article 
reviews the advances in phytochemical research; particularly regarding the 
mechanisms related to DNA damage and provide a theoretical basis for future 
chemoprophylaxis research."
1594,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic persistent intestinal disorder, 
with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease being the most common. However, the 
physio-pathological development of IBD is still unknown. Therefore, research on 
the etiology and treatment of IBD has been conducted using a variety of 
approaches. Short-chain fatty acids such as 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) are known 
to have various physiological activities. In particular, the production of 3-HB 
by the intestinal microflora is associated with the suppression of various 
inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated whether 
poly-D-3-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB), a polyester of 3-HB, is degraded by 
intestinal microbiota and works as a slow-release agent of 3-HB. Further, we 
examined whether PHB suppresses the pathogenesis of IBD models. As long as a PHB 
diet increased 3-HB concentrations in the feces and blood, PHB suppressed weight 
loss and histological inflammation in a dextran sulfate sodium-induced IBD 
model. Furthermore, PHB increased the accumulation of regulatory T cells in the 
rectum without affecting T cells in the spleen. These results indicate that PHB 
has potential applications in treating diseases related to the intestinal 
microbiota as a sustained 3-HB donor. We show for the first time that 
biodegradable polyester exhibits intestinal bacteria-mediated bioactivity toward 
IBD. The use of bioplastics, which are essential materials for sustainable 
social development, represents a novel approach to diseases related to 
dysbiosis, including IBD."

1598,"Self-assembled DNA nanocages are among the most promising candidates for 
bioimaging and payload delivery into cells. DNA nanocages have great potential 
to efficiently address drug resistance and nucleic acid delivery problems due to 
precise control of their shape and size, and excellent biocompatibility. 
Although DNA nanostructures demonstrate some cellular uptake, because they bear 
a highly negative charge, the uptake of tetrahedral nanostructures is hindered 
by electrostatic repulsion. In this study, we describe a method to enhance the 
cellular uptake of DNA nanostructures using a binary system containing DNA and a 
positively charged head group with a hydrophobic lipid chain containing lipids 
for cellular internalization. Here we represent the functionalization of a model 
cage, DNA tetrahedron (TD) with a cationic lipid, 
N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA). Atomic 
force microscopy (AFM) and other standard characterization techniques were used 
to explore the co-assembly of the DNA tetrahedron and DOTMA. We revealed a 
simple confocal microscopy-based approach to show the enhancement in the 
cellular uptake of DNA nanocages. This new method will find multiple 
applications in delivery applications such as gene transfection, drug delivery 
and targeted bioimaging."
1599,"Cerium oxide (CeO2) is a well-known antioxidant with the ability to scavenge 
reactive oxygen species due to its unique electronic structure and chemical 
properties. Although many methods to enhance the antioxidant activity of 
CeO2have been reported, its antioxidant activity is still not high enough, and 
some enhancement effects are limited by the material concentration. There are 
also some CeO2obtained with high antioxidant activity at high concentrations, 
which is not conducive to the application of biomedicine. Therefore, it is 
urgent to obtain CeO2material with low cell cytotoxicity, high antioxidant 
activity and wide application range. In this work, rod-like metal organic 
framework derived CeO2(CeO2-MOF) was prepared by a simple method. Compared with 
the CeO2nanorods prepared by hydrothermal method, it shows better antioxidant 
activity compared with the CeO2nanorods prepared by hydrothermal method. 
Moreover, the advantage of CeO2-MOF's antioxidant activity is not affected by 
the hydroxyl radical and material concentrations The reason why CeO2-MOF has 
higher antioxidant activity should be attributed to its higher Ce3+content and 
larger specific surface area. In addition, CeO2-MOF also exhibits low 
cytotoxicity to HeLa cells and PC12 cellsin vitro. The strategy of using MOF as 
a structural and compositional material to create CeO2provides a new method to 
explore highly efficient and biocompatible CeO2for practical applications."
1600,"Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing has been considered as a mature strategy to 
mimic the hierarchical microarchitectures in native extracellular matrix (ECM). 
Most of the EHD-printed scaffolds possess single-dimensional fibrous structures, 
which cannot mimic the multi-dimensional architectures for enhanced cellular 
behaviors. Here we developed a two-nozzle EHD printing system to fabricate 
hybrid scaffolds involving submicron and microscale features. The polyethylene 
oxide- polycaprolactone (PEO-PCL) submicron fibers were fabricated via 
solution-based EHD printing with a width of 527 ± 56 nm. The PCL microscale 
fibers were fabricated via melt-based EHD printing with a width of 11.2 ± 2.3μm. 
The hybrid scaffolds were fabricated by printing the submicron and microscale 
fibers in a layer-by-layer manner. The microscale scaffolds were utilized as a 
control group. Rat myocardial cells (H9C2 cells) were cultured on the two kinds 
of scaffolds for the culturing period of 1, 3 and 5 d. Biological results 
indicated that H9C2 cells showed enhanced adhesion and proliferation behaviors 
on the hybrid scaffold than those on the pure microscale scaffold. This work 
offers a facile and scalable strategy to fabricate multiscale synthetic 
scaffolds, which might be further explored to regulate cellular behaviors in the 
fields of tissue regeneration and biomedical engineering."
1601,"Development of efficient anhydrous proton-conducting materials would expand the 
operational temperature ranges of hydrogen fuels cells (HFCs) and eliminate 
their dependence on maintaining sufficient hydration levels to function 
efficiently. Protic ionic liquids (PILs), which have high ionic densities and 
low vapor pressures, have emerged as a potential material for proton conducting 
layers in HFCs. In this work, we investigate proton transport via the Grotthuss 
mechanism in 1-ethylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide 
([C2HIm][TFSI]) protic ionic liquids with added imidazole (Im0) using ab initio 
molecular dynamics. In particular, we vary the composition of the systems 
studied from pure [C2HIm][TFSI] to those where the mole fraction of Im0 is 0.67. 
Given the large difference in pKa between C2HIm+ and HTFSI, TFSI- does not 
accept acidic protons from C2HIm+; conversely, imidazolium (HIm+) and C2HIm+ 
have very similar pKa values, and thus Im0 can readily accept protons. We find 
that the unprotonated nitrogen on Im0 dominates solvation of the labile protons 
on C2HIm+ and other Im0 species, resulting in formation of robust imidazole 
wires. Given the amphoteric nature of Im0, i.e. its ability to accept and donate 
protons, these wires provide conduits along which protons can rapidly traverse 
via the Grotthuss mechanism, thereby greatly increasing the proton coefficient 
of self-diffusion. We find that the average length of the wires increases with 
added Im0, and thus as the mole fraction of Im0 increases so too does the proton 
diffusion constant. Lastly, we analyze our trajectories to determine the energy 
and time scales associated with proton transfer."

convergence, accuracy and efficiency. Simulations were performed for a benchmark 
problem with the Beeler-Reuter cell model on a truncated ellipsoid approximating 
the left ventricle including a localized stimulation. For this configuration, we 
provide a reference solution for the transmembrane potential. We found a 
semi-implicit approach with state variable interpolation to be the most

1603,"BACKGROUND: The auditory tube (AT), an osteocartilaginous channel, connects the 
nasopharynx to the middle ear cavity. At the nasopharyngeal opening of the AT, 
there are dense collections of submucosal glands. In a recent article, Valstar 
et al. proposed these nasopharyngeal tubal glands conglomerate as salivary 
glands, which starkly contrasts with their previously known anatomy for being a 
component of the respiratory tract. This study examines the contesting views 
regarding the taxonomical categorization of the nasopharyngeal tubal glands.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AT glands in context were examined in human cadavers 
grossly, and microscopically using routine and special (Hematoxylin and Eosin 
[H&E] and Periodic acid-Schiff [PAS] respectively), as well as 
immunohistochemical (for alpha-SMA and salivary amylase) staining methods and 
compared with the major and minor salivary glands and the submucosal glands in 
the trachea. Further, a biochemical analysis was performed to detect the 
presence of salivary amylase in the oral and nasopharyngeal secretions of the 
four living human subjects, representing major salivary glands and tubal glands, 
respectively.
RESULTS: The submucosal seromucous glands with a surface lining of respiratory 
epithelium were observed at the nasopharyngeal end of AT. The cells in the tubal 
glands showed cytoplasmic positivity for alpha-SMA, which indicated the presence 
of the myoepithelial cells; however, this expression was significantly lower 
than in the seromucous submucosal glands within the trachea. Salivary 
alpha-amylase was undetectable in the cadaveric tissue samples. Moreover, the 
amylase level in the nasopharyngeal swabs was negligible compared to the oral 
swabs.
CONCLUSION: The anatomical location along the respiratory tract, the presence of 
respiratory epithelium in the overlying mucosa, their morpho-functional 
resemblance to the seromucous glands in the trachea, and the absence of salivary 
amylase strongly indicate that the tubal glands are taxonomically different from 
the salivary glands. Given the available evidence, their existing recognition as 
a part of the respiratory tract and an integral component of the AT seems more 
appropriate."
1604,"Safety assessment of carbon nanomaterials is of paramount importance since they 
are on the frontline for applications in sensing, bioimaging and drug delivery. 
The biocompatibility and safety of functionalized nanodiamonds (NDs) are here 
addressed through the study of the pro-inflammatory response of RAW-264.7 
macrophages exposed to new nanodiamonds@corrole hybrids. The corrole unit 
selected is as a prototype for a hydrophobic organic molecule that can function 
as a NIR fluorophore reporter, an optical sensor, a photodynamic therapy agent 
or a photocatalyst. The new functional nanohybrids containing detonated 
nanodiamonds (NDs) were obtained through esterification using carboxylated NDs 
and glycol corroles. The success of the covalent functionalization via 
carbodiimide activation was confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS), Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The UV-vis 
absorption and emission spectra of the hybrids are additive with respect to the 
corrole features. The cellular uptake, localization, cell viability and effects 
on immune cell activation of the new hybrids and of the precursors were 
carefully investigated using RAW-264.7 macrophages. Overall results showed that 
the ND@corrole hybrids had no pro-inflammatory effects on the RAW-264.7 
macrophage cell line, making them an ideal candidate for a wide range of 
biomedical applications."

high mortality that threaten the health of women worldwide. Circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) are a new class of noncoding RNAs that participate in the biological 
processes of various tumors, but the regulatory roles of circRNAs in TNBC have 
not been fully elucidated. In this study, the expression and characterization of 
circDUSP1 was detected via quantitative real-time PCR, nuclear-cytoplasmic 
fractionation assay, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Then, in vitro and 
in vivo functional experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of 
circDUSP1 in TNBC. The interaction among circDUSP1, miR-761, DACT2 were 
confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, and RNA 
immunoprecipitation experiments. We identified the circRNA named circDUSP1 that 
was inversely correlated with tumorigenesis and progression in TNBC. 
Overexpression of circDUSP1 significantly attenuated cell proliferation, 
migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, while increased the 
sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. In-depth mechanism analysis indicated 
that circDUSP1 acts as an endogenous sponge of miR-761 to reduce its suppression 
on target gene DACT2 expression in TNBC. Upregulation of miR-761 or 
downregulation of DACT2 partially reversed the biological process of TNBC and 
the prognosis of paclitaxel affected by circDUSP1. Taken together, our findings 
revealed a role for the regulation of the miR-761/DACT2 axis by circDUSP1 in the 
biological process of TNBC. These results provided new insights into the 
biological mechanism and targeted therapy of TNBC."
1606,"Endometrial carcinoma is a common gynecological malignant tumor, small nucleolar 
RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in cancer development. However, researches on the 
roles of snoRNAs in endometrial carcinoma are limited. The expression levels of 
snoRNAs in endometrial cancer tissues were analyzed using The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) database. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and plasmids were used 
for transfection. Moreover, CCK-8, EdU, wound-healing assay, transwell, cell 
apoptosis, western blotting, and xenograft model were employed to examine the 
biological functions of related molecules. real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect 
messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Including bioinformatics, fluorescence 
in situ hybridization, RNA pulldown, actinomycin D and RTL-P assays were also 
carried out to explore the molecular mechanism. Analysis of data from TCGA 
showed that the expression level of small nucleolar RNA, C/D box 60 (SNORD60) in 
endometrial cancer tissues is observably higher than that in normal endometrial 
tissues. Further research suggested that SNORD60 played a carcinogenic role both 
in vitro and in vivo, and significantly upregulated the expression of PIK3CA. 
However, the carcinogenic effects can be reversed by knocking down fibrillarin 
(FBL) or PIK3CA. SNORD60 forms complexes by binding with 2'-O-methyltransferase 
fibrillarin, thus catalyzes the 2'-O-methylation (Nm) modification of PIK3CA 
mRNA and modulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, so as to promote the 
development of endometrial cancer. In short, SNORD60 might become a new 
biomarker for the therapy of endometrial cancer in the future and provide new 
strategies for diagnosis and treatment."
1607,"Glutamine addiction is an important phenotype displayed in some types of cancer. 
In these cells, glutamine depletion results in a marked reduction in the 
aggressive cancer phenotype. Mesothelioma is an extremely aggressive disease 
that lacks effective therapy. In this study, we show that mesothelioma tumors 
are glutamine addicted suggesting that glutamine depletion may be a potential 
therapeutic strategy. We show that glutamine restriction, by removing glutamine 
from the medium or treatment with inhibitors that attenuate glutamine uptake 
(V-9302) or conversion to glutamate (CB-839), markedly reduces mesothelioma cell 
proliferation, spheroid formation, invasion, and migration. Inhibition of the 
SLC1A5 glutamine importer, by knockout or treatment with V-9302, an SLC1A5 
inhibitor, also markedly reduces mesothelioma cell tumor growth. A relationship 
between glutamine utilization and YAP1/TEAD signaling has been demonstrated in 
other tumor types, and the YAP1/TEAD signaling cascade is active in mesothelioma 
cells and drives cell survival and proliferation. We therefore assessed the 
impact of glutamine depletion on YAP1/TEAD signaling. We show that glutamine 
restriction, SLC1A5 knockdown/knockout, or treatment with V-9302 or CB-839, 
reduces YAP1 level, YAP1/TEAD-dependent transcription, and YAP1/TEAD target 
protein (e.g., CTGF, cyclin D1, COL1A2, COL3A1, etc.) levels. These changes are 
observed in both cells and tumors. These findings indicate that mesothelioma is 
a glutamine addicted cancer, show that glutamine depletion attenuates YAP1/TEAD 
signaling and tumor growth, and suggest that glutamine restriction may be useful 
as a mesothelioma treatment strategy."
1608,"Monoallelic or biallelic RAD51C germline mutations results in chromosome 
instability disorders such as fanconi anemia (FA) and cancers. The bona fide 
function of RAD51C is to assist RAD51 nucleoprotein filament onto single strand 
DNA to complete Homologous Recombination (HR) repair. In addition to HR repair, 
the role of RAD51C in DNA replication is emerging when replication forks are 
transiently or irreversibly stalled. We identified novel RAD51C variants of 
uncertain significance (VUS) from breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and gastric 
cancer patients and functionally characterized the effect of these variants in 
replication fork protection and double-strand breaks (DSB's) repair. In RAD51C 
deficient chinese hamster CL-V4B cells, expression of RAD51C F164S, A87E, L134S 
and E49K variants heightened sensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC), etoposide and 
PARP inhibition. Differently, expression of a subset RAD51C variants R24L, R24W, 
and R212H displayed mild sensitivity to MMC, etoposide and PARP inhibition. 
Further functional characterization of a subset of variants revealed that Rad51C 
F164S, A87E, L134S and E49K variants displayed reduced RAD51 foci formation and 
increased overall nuclear single strand DNA levels in the presence of 
replication stress. Additionally, DNA fiber assay revealed that RAD51C F164S, 
A87E, L134S and E49K variants displayed defective replication fork protection 
upon prolonged fork stalling. Investigations using patient-derived 
lymphoblastoid cell line carrying heterozygous RAD51C L134S variant showed an 
impairment in RAD51 chromatin association and replication fork protection, 
suggestive of deleteriousness of this VUS variant. Overall, our findings provide 
more insights into molecular roles of RAD51C in replication fork integrity 
maintenance and in DSB repair. Disclosure Summary The authors report no relevant 
conflicts of interest in this work."
1609,"The effective treatment for periodontitis is to completely and sustainedly 
eradicate the bacterial pathogens from the complex periodontal pockets. Local 
sustained-release antibiotics as a complementary treatment after scaling and 
root planning can sustainedly combat bacterial pathogens in the periodontal 
pockets to help treat the disease, but the increasing concern of bacterial 
resistance limits its future use. Here, we reported a local antibacterial system 
based on microsized multifunctional Ag-TiO2-x encapsulated in alginate (ATA) 
microspheres. We confirmed that ATA displayed strong photothermally enhanced 
dual enzyme-mimicking (peroxidase-like and catalase-like) activities and weak 
photocatalytic activity under 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, which 
could boost the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2 in the 
presence of low-level H2O2. As a result, the ATA/H2O2/NIR system exhibited 
efficient antibacterial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis and 
Streptococcus gordonii in both planktonic and biofilm forms. With the help of 
ROS, ATA could release Ag+ in concentrations sufficient to inhibit periodontal 
pathogens as well. Moreover, the in situ-generated oxygen was supposed to 
alleviate the local hypoxic environment and would help downregulate the 
lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammatory response of periodontal stem cells. The 
in vivo rat periodontitis treatment results demonstrated that the ATA/H2O2/NIR 
system reduced the bacterial load, relieved inflammation, and improved tissue 
healing. Our work developed a new local prolonged bactericidal and oxygenation 
system for enhanced periodontitis. Avoiding the usage of antibiotics and 
nanomaterials, this strategy showed great promise in adjunctive periodontitis 
treatment and also in other biomedical applications."
1610,"Cell traction mediates the biochemical and mechanical interactions between the 
cell and its extracellular matrix (ECM). Traction force microscopy (TFM) is a 
powerful technique for quantitative cellular scale traction analysis. However, 
it is challenging to characterize macromolecular scale traction events with 
current TFM due to the limited sampling density and algorithmic precision. In 
this article, we introduce a super-resolution TFM by utilizing a novel substrate 
surface modification method. Our TFM technique achieved a spatial resolution 
comparable to fluorescence microscopy and precision comparable to the rupture 
force of an integrin-ligand bond. Correlated imaging of TFM with fluorescence 
microscopy demonstrated that the residing paxillin highly correlated with 
traction while α5 integrin was located differently. Time-lapse TFM imaging 
captured a transient traction variation as the adhesion protein passed by. Thus, 
the novel super-resolution TFM benefits the studies on cellular biochemical and 
mechanical interactions."
1611,"In this paper, we experimentally investigate the influence of the flow rate on 
the trajectory of ovoid and filamentous bacterial cells of E. coli in a low 
aspect ratio pinch flow fractionation device. To that aim, we vary the Reynolds 
number over two orders of magnitude, while monitoring the dynamics of the cells 
across our device. At low flow rates, filamentous cells adopt several rotational 
motions in the pinched segment, which are induced both by the shear rate and by 
their close interactions with the nearest wall. As a result, the geometrical 
centre of the filamentous cells deviates towards the centre of the channel, 
which increases their effective sorting diameter depending on the length of 
their major axis as well as on the rotational mode they adopt in the pinch. As 
the flow rate increases, particles are forced to align vertically in the pinch, 
in the direction of the main shear gradient, which reduces the amplitude of the 
lateral deviation generated by their rotation. The trajectory of the particles 
in the expansion is directly determined by their position at the pinch outlet. 
As a consequence, the position of the filamentous cells at the outlet of the 
device strongly depends on the flow rate as well as on the length of their major 
axis. Based on these observations we optimized the flow conditions to 
successfully extract an ultra high purity sample of filamentous cells from a 
solution containing mainly ovoid cells."
1612,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown after ischemic stroke exacerbates brain 
injury and BBB senescence can cause severe neurological deficits in aged 
ischemic stroke population. Recent evidence reveals that inducible pluripotent 
stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (iPSC-sEVs) possess phenomenal 
antisenescence capability. However, whether iPSC-sEVs can rejuvenate BBB 
senescence to improve stroke outcomes in aged mice remains unknown. Here, we 
showed that long-term treatment with iPSC-sEVs alleviated aging-induced BBB 
senescence in aged mice. In aged stroke mice, iPSC-sEVs significantly mitigated 
BBB integrity damage, reduced the following infiltration of peripheral 
leukocytes, and decreased the release of pro-inflammatory factors from the 
leukocytes, which ultimately inhibited neuronal death and improved 
neurofunctional recovery. Mechanism studies showed that iPSC-sEVs could activate 
the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and up-regulate sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) 
in senescent endothelial cells. Blocking the activation of eNOS abolished 
iPSC-sEV-mediated rejuvenation of BBB senescence and the protection of BBB 
integrity. Proteomics results demonstrated that iPSC-sEVs were enriched with 
bioactive factors including AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) and calmodulin 
(CALM) to activate the eNOS-Sirt1 axis. Further investigation showed that AKT1 
and CALM inhibitors blocked iPSC-sEV-afforded activation of the eNOS-Sirt1 axis 
in senescent endothelial cells. Taken together, iPSC-sEVs can protect against 
ischemic stroke in aged mice by rejuvenating BBB senescence, partially, through 
delivering AKT1 and CALM to activate eNOS-Sirt1 axis, which indicates that 
iPSC-sEVs treatment is an effective alternative to treat ischemic stroke in the 
aged population."
1613,"Apical hook is a simple curved structure formed at the upper part of hypocotyls 
when dicot seeds germinate in darkness. The hook structure is transient but 
essential for seedlings' survival during soil emergence due to its efficient 
protection of the delicate shoot apex from mechanical injury. As a superb model 
system for studying plant differential growth, apical hook has fascinated 
botanists as early as the Darwin age, and significant advances have been 
achieved at both the morphological and molecular levels to understand how apical 
hook development is regulated. Here, we will mainly summarize the research 
progresses at these two regards. We will also briefly compare the growth 
dynamics between apical hook and hypocotyl gravitropic bending at early seed 
germination phase, with the aim to deduce certain consensus on their 
connections. Finally, we will outline the remaining questions and future 
research perspectives for apical hook development. This article is protected by

1614,"OBJECTIVES: Compared with the general population, patients with sickle cell 
disease (SCD) typically have substantially reduced life expectancies. It is 
unclear whether SCD patients who acquire COVID-19 have higher rates of 
complications and mortality than the general population. We sought to elucidate 
COVID-19 presentation and outcomes in patients with SCD.
METHODS: Using retrospective chart review, we evaluated demographic 
characteristics, presenting symptoms, chest imaging findings, blood transfusion 
requirements, need for mechanical ventilation or pressor support, medication 
administration (including remdesivir and dexamethasone), and survival among 
individuals with SCD hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 2020 to December 
2021.
RESULTS: Among 72 SCD patients, increased pain was the most common presenting 
symptom followed by cough, fever, and dyspnea. Thirty-seven (44%) received 
simple transfusion and 14 (17%) underwent exchange transfusion. Lung imaging 
findings suggestive of COVID-19 were observed in 27 (37%) patients; 21 (29%) 
patients were treated with remdesivir and 26 (35%) received dexamethasone. Three 
patients (4%) required mechanical ventilation and pressor support; all three 
died from COVID complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain is the most common presenting symptom in SCD patients with 
COVID-19. We observed a mortality rate higher than that among the general 
population among patients who required mechanical ventilation and pressor 
support."
1615,"INTRODUCTION: In view of other candidate proteins from the cathepsin family of 
proteases holding great potential in being targeted during cancer therapy, the 
importance of Cathepsin B (CtsB) stands out as being truly exceptional. Based on 
its contribution to oncogenesis, its intimate connection with regulating 
apoptosis and modulating extracellular and intracellular functions through its 
secretion or compartmentalized subcellular localization, collectively highlight 
its complex molecular involvement with a myriad of normal and pathological 
regulatory processes. Despite its complex functional nature, CtsB is emerging as 
one of the few cathepsin proteases that has been extensively researched to yield 
tangible outcomes for cancer therapy.
AREAS COVERED: In this article, we review the scientific literature which has 
justified or shaped the importance of CtsB expression in cancer progression, 
from the perspective of highlighting a paradigm that is rapidly changing from 
basic research towards a broader clinical and translational context.
EXPERT OPINION: In doing so, we detail its maturation as a diagnostic marker 
through describing the development of CtsB-specific Activity-Based Probes, the 
rapid evolution of these towards a new generation of Prodrugs, and the 
evaluation of these in model systems for their therapeutic potential as 
anti-cancer agents in the clinic."
1616,"Emerging evidence has suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) have vital 
functions during the initiation and progression of various diseases. However, 
circRNA potential mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) are largely unknown. 
Here, we sought to investigate the role and underlying regulatory mechanism of 
circ0104103 in CRC. circ0104103 was validated by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Gain- and 
loss-of-function assays in cell lines and mouse xenograft models were utilized 
to investigate the effects of circ0104103 in CRC. RNA pull-down assays, RNA 
immunoprecipitation assays, bioinformatics analyses, RNA fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) and luciferase reporter assays were used to elucidate the 
potential mechanism of circ0104103 in CRC. We identified circ0104103, which is 
strongly downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. Functional studies 
revealed that circ0104103 inhibited CRC cell growth, migration and invasion both 
in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circ0104103 binds to HuR, a functional 
RNA-binding protein (RBP) commonly expressed in CRC. HuR binds to the 3'UTR of 
LACTB mRNA to facilitate stabilization and increase its expression. Moreover, 
circ0104103 was verified as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) via negative 
regulation of miR-373-5p to increase LACTB expression, resulting in inhibiting 
the occurrence and progression of CRC. Taken together, our study revealed that 
circ0104103 acts as a tumour suppressor and may be a novel biomarker and 
therapeutic target in CRC."
1617,"High glycolytic activity of cancer cells leads to lactic acidosis (LA) in the 
tumor microenvironment. LA is not merely a consequence of metabolic activities, 
but also has functional roles in metabolic reprogramming and cancer progression. 
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells exhibit a high dependency on glycolysis for 
survival and growth, but the specific effects of LA on cellular characteristics 
remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that long-term LA (LLA) reprograms the 
metabolic phenotype of CCA cells from glycolytic to oxidative, and enhances 
their migratory activity. In CCA cell culture, short-term LA (SLA, 24 h) showed 
a growth inhibitory effect, while extended LA exposure for more than two weeks 
(LLA) led to enhanced cell motility. Coincidentally, LLA enhanced the 
respiratory capacity with an increase in mitochondrial mass. Inhibition of 
mitochondrial function abolished LLA-induced cell motility, suggesting that 
metabolic remodeling affects the phenotypic outcomes. RNA-sequencing analysis 
revealed that LLA upregulated genes associated with cell migration and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), 
which encodes a pro-EMT-secreted protein. Inhibition of THBS1 resulted in the 
suppression of both LLA-induced cell motility and respiratory capacity. 
Moreover, high THBS1 expression was associated with poor survival in patients 
with CCA. Collectively, our study suggests that the increased expression of 
THBS1 by LLA promotes phenotypic alterations leading to CCA progression."
1618,"Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells suppress inflammation and are essential for the 
maintenance of tissue homeostasis. A growing appreciation of tissue-specific 
Treg functions has built interest in leveraging the endogenous suppressive 
mechanisms of these cells into cellular therapeutics in organ-specific diseases. 
Notably, Treg cells play a critical role in maintaining the intestinal 
environment. As a barrier site, the gut requires Treg cells to mediate 
interactions with the microbiota, support barrier integrity, and regulate the 
immune system. Without fully functional Treg cells, intestinal inflammation and 
microbial dysbiosis ensue. Thus, there is a particular interest in developing 
Treg cellular therapies for intestinal inflammatory disease, such as 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). This article reviews some of the critical 
pathways that are dysregulated in IBD, Treg cell mechanisms of suppression, and 
the efforts and approaches in the field to develop these cells as a cellular 
therapy for IBD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1619,"Cyclodextrins are a group of naturally occurring oligosaccharides that have 
widely been studied and applied in pharmaceutical formulations forming inclusion 
complexes with a broad variety of drugs exhibiting different hydrophilicity as 
well as molecular weights. Grafting aliphatic chains onto native cyclodextrins 
renders them amphiphilic and enables self-assembly into supramolecular 
structures that have already been explored for drug delivery. Based on the 
possibility of controlling the inherent physicochemical properties by modifying 
their chemical structure, amphiphilic cyclodextrin conjugates hold a great 
potential to become a drug delivery platform adaptable to the individual needs 
of specific active drug molecules. In this work, a library of amphiphilic 
cyclodextrin derivatives was synthesized by conjugating aliphatic chains of 
different lengths to native β-cyclodextrin via thioether or ester bonds. Upon 
nanoprecipitation, the synthesized amphiphilic cyclodextrin derivatives 
spontaneously self-assembled into nanosized supramolecular structures with a 
monodisperse size distribution. We systematically investigated the relationship 
between the molecular structure of the amphiphilic cyclodextrin derivatives and 
the corresponding self-assembly into nanosystems as well as the encapsulation of 
model drugs with different physicochemical properties. Encapsulation 
efficiencies up to 97% and pH-dependent release profiles were achieved. We found 
that both the aliphatic chain length and the linker molecule determine the 
respective self-assembly and drug encapsulation mechanism of the individual 
system. The colloidal stability and biocompatibility with human cells of all 
derivatives were proven. Consequently, amphiphilic cyclodextrin conjugates 
provide a drug delivery platform with tailor-made control over physicochemical 
properties and high drug encapsulation efficiency for a broad range of drug 
molecules, thus offering great potential for the development of future 
therapeutics with improved therapeutic efficiency."
1620,"The use of small molecule kinase inhibitors, which target specific enzymes that 
are overactive in cancer cells, has revolutionized cancer patient treatment. To 
treat some types of breast cancer, CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, have 
been developed that target the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor 
suppressor gene. Acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors may be due to 
activation of the AKT pro‑survival signaling pathway that stimulates several 
processes, such as growth, metastasis and changes in metabolism that support 
rapid cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to investigate 
whether targeting ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), a downstream target of AKT, may 
combine with CDK4/6 inhibition to inhibit tumorigenesis. The present study 
determined that ACLY is activated in breast and pancreatic cancer cells in 
response to palbociclib treatment and AKT mediates this effect. Inhibition of 
ACLY using bempedoic acid used in combination with palbociclib reduced cell 
viability in a panel of breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. This effect was 
also observed using breast cancer cells grown in 3D cell culture. 
Mechanistically, palbociclib inhibited cell proliferation, whereas bempedoic 
acid stimulated apoptosis. Finally, using Transwell invasion assays and 
immunoblotting, the present study demonstrated that ACLY inhibition blocked cell 
invasion, when used alone or in combination with palbociclib. These data may 
yield useful information that could guide the development of future therapies 
aimed at the reduction of acquired resistance observed clinically."
1621,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a frequent malignant tumor of the 
kidney which has a dismal prognosis. At present, targeted therapies and 
immunotherapy have achieved significant results; however, the overall survival 
rate of patients with ccRCC remains unacceptably poor. It is therefore necessary 
to find novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets for ccRCC. It has been reported 
that enolase 2 (ENO2) is an oncogene, although its function in the immune 
microenvironment and in the growth of ccRCC has yet to be fully elucidated. The 
present study analyzed the data of patients with ccRCC both from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, and from 
clinical samples obtained from Third Affiliated Hospital of the Second Military 
Medical University to investigate the role of ENO2 in the progression of ccRCC 
and the correlation between ENO2 and certain clinical features. It was found 
that the expression of ENO2 was elevated both in patients with ccRCC retrieved 
from the GEO and TCGA databases and in clinical ccRCC samples obtained from 
Third Affiliated Hospital of the Second Military Medical University. In 
addition, the prognosis of patients was poorer when ENO2 was highly expressed. 
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirmed 
that ENO2 participated in the regulation of various pathways in ccRCC. In vitro 
experiments including Cell Counting Kit‑8 cell proliferation assay, Transwell 
and Matrigel assays confirmed that ENO2 could promote the proliferation and 
migration of ccRCC cells. Furthermore, a number of immunosuppressive indicators 
were identified that positively correlated with ENO2 expression. In conclusion, 
the present study revealed that ENO2 expression promotes the proliferation, 
invasion and migration of ccRCC cells, and may serve as a novel predictor to 
evaluate prognosis and the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade treatment for 
patients with ccRCC."
1622,"EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been successfully used in lung 
cancer treatment. Nevertheless, tumor cells may develop resistant phenotypes in 
the tumor microenvironment after a period of treatment with any generation of 
EGFR TKIs. Macrophages play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis and development. At 
the same time, macrophages renew continuously, and their polarized phenotype 
changes dynamically. Although macrophage polarization is generally considered to 
be involved in secondary resistance, it would be time consuming if renewed 
macrophages would only protect tumor cells from drug attacks after polarization. 
It is unclear how dynamic renewal of macrophage contributes to acquired 
resistance. By using two co‑culture approaches, the present study modeled two 
types of renewal of macrophages: Migrated macrophages (Mm) and locally 
self‑renewal resident macrophages (Mr). The EGFR‑mutant lung cancer cell line 
PC‑9 was induced to develop resistance to gefitinib in these co‑culture 
approaches and without macrophages co‑culture. PC‑9 cells induced in Mm 
co‑culture recovered fast from gefitinib attack, and formed the gefitinib 
resistant (GR) subline PC‑9/Mm/GR with the strongest resistant ability. 
PC‑9/Mm/GR cells exhibited epithelial characteristics, including stable 
expression of EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR, insulin‑like growth factor 1 receptor, 
TGF‑βII receptor and E‑cadherin. PC‑9 cells induced in Mr co‑culture and those 
without co‑culture developed similar weak resistance to gefitinib. TGF‑β 
secretion was inhibited when PC‑9 cells were in Mr co‑culture, but not in Mm 
co‑culture. Macrophages were not polarized in either co‑culture type. The 
present findings suggested that macrophages may affect resistance acquirement by 
different renewal modes. Mm could promote resistance acquirement by stabilizing 
tumor cell phenotypes, which would happen before polarization. It would be 
helpful to monitor the response to EGFR‑TKIs and design novel treatment 
strategies if macrophages from two renewal modes were distinguished effectively."
1623,"The function of human dicarbonyl/L‑xylulose reductase (DCXR) in the 
pathophysiology of breast cancer is yet to be elucidated. The present study 
aimed to investigate the function of DCXR in glycolysis and the cell cycle of 
breast cancer cells with respect to cell proliferation. Differential expressed 
DCXR was identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and verified in 
clinical breast cancer tissue. DCXR silencing and overexpression were induced by 
RNA interference and lentiviral vectors, respectively. Cell cycle progression, 
proliferation and glycolytic activity of breast cancer cells were detected by 
flow cytometry, Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and chemical methods, respectively. 
Tumorigenicity was detected using nude mice xenograft models. The expression of 
DCXR was increased in TCGA breast cancer database and the function of DCXR was 
enriched in 'glycolysis' and 'cell cycle'. Further analysis using clinical 
breast cancer samples confirmed upregulation of DCXR. The silencing of DCXR 
suppressed proliferation and cell cycle progression of breast cancer cells and 
significantly decreased the capacity for glycolysis, thereby demonstrating the 
effect of DCXR on the function of breast cancer cells. Similar conclusions were 
obtained in DCXR overexpressing cells; notably, DCXR overexpression promoted 
proliferation, cell cycle progression at S phase and glycolysis. 
2‑Deoxy‑D‑glucose inhibited the effect of DCXR on the proliferation and cell 
cycle progression of breast cancer cells. The present study revealed that DCXR 
regulated breast cancer cell cycle progression and proliferation by increasing 
glycolysis activity and thus may serve as an oncogene for breast cancer."
1624,"Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor types and the leading 
cause of cancer‑associated death worldwide. Different types of lung cancer 
exhibit differences in terms of pathophysiology and pathogenesis, and also 
treatment and prognosis. Accumulating evidence has indicated that circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) are abnormally expressed among different types of lung cancer and 
confer important biological functions in progression and prognosis. However, 
studies comparing different circRNAs in lung cancer subtypes are scarce. 
Furthermore, circRNAs have an important role in drug resistance and are related 
to clinicopathological features in lung cancer. Summaries of the association of 
circRNAs with drug resistance are also scarce in the literature. The present 
study outlined the biological functions of circRNAs and focused on 
discriminating differential circRNA patterns and mechanisms in three different 
types of lung cancer. The emerging roles of circRNAs in the resistance to 
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy were also 
highlighted. Understanding these aspects of circRNAs sheds light on novel 
physiological and pathophysiological processes of lung cancer and suggests the 
application of circRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as 
therapeutic resistance."
1625,"Many biological membranes present an asymmetric lipid distribution between the 
two leaflets that is known as the transbilayer lipid asymmetry. This asymmetry 
is essential for cell survival and its loss is related to apoptosis. In 
mammalian and yeast cells, ATP-dependent transport of lipids to the cytosolic 
side of the biological membranes, carried out by so-called lipid flippases, 
contributes to the transbilayer lipid asymmetry. Most of these lipid flippases 
belong to the P4-ATPase protein family, which is also present in plants. In this 
review, we summarize the relatively scarce literature concerning the presence of 
transbilayer lipid asymmetry in different plant cell membranes and revise the 
potential role of lipid flippases of the P4-ATPase family in generation and/or 
maintenance of this asymmetry."
1626,"Ras‑related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1), a member of the Rac family of 
guanosine triphosphate phosphohydrolases, has been suggested to be a regulator 
of myocardial injury during ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Whether microRNAs 
(miRs) are involved in the regulation of the aforementioned process remains to 
be elucidated. In the present study, an in vitro model of H9C2 cardiomyocytes 
was used to establish the overexpression of RAC1 following hypoxia and 
reoxygenation (H/R). Overexpression of RAC1 in H/R‑cultured cardiomyocytes could 
lead to cellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and facilitate 
the induction of apoptosis of H9C2 cardiomyocytes during H/R. Subsequent 
bioinformatic analysis indicated that RAC1 was the target of miRNA‑194‑5p. 
Further experiments showed that miR‑194‑5p attenuated the accumulation of 
cellular ROS and alleviated the induction of apoptosis of H9C2 cardiomyocytes 
caused by H/R, which was accompanied by the reduction in the expression levels 
of the RAC1 protein. Taken together, these results indicated that upregulation 
of miR‑194‑5p may function as a self‑regulated cardioprotective response against 
RAC1‑mediated ROS accumulation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Exogenous 
administration of miR‑194‑5p may be a novel target to ameliorate I/R 
injury‑induced myocardial apoptosis."
1627,"In mammalian cells, phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed between the 
outer and inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. The maintenance of asymmetric 
phospholipid distribution has been demonstrated to be required for a wide range 
of cellular functions including cell division, cell migration, and signal 
transduction. However, we recently reported that asymmetric phospholipid 
distribution is disrupted in Drosophila cell membranes, and this unique 
phospholipid distribution leads to the formation of highly deformable cell 
membranes. In addition, it has become clear that asymmetry in the trans-bilayer 
distribution of phospholipids is disturbed even in living mammalian cells under 
certain circumstances. In this article, we introduce our recent studies while 
focusing on the trans-bilayer distribution of phospholipids, and discuss the 
cellular functions of (a)symmetric biological membranes."
1628,"A rare example of a structurally characterized metal quinoline complex was 
prepared using a non-covalent quinoline-based proteasome inhibitor (Quin1), and 
a related complex bearing an inactive quinoline ligand (Quin2) was also 
synthesized. The quinolines are prepared by a one-pot procedure involving 
titanium-catalyzed alkyne iminoamination and are bound to ruthenium by reaction 
with CpRu(NCMe)3+ PF6- in CH2Cl2. The arene of the quinoline is η6-bonded to the 
ruthenium metal center. The kinetics of quinoline displacement were 
investigated, and reactivity with deuterated solvents follows the order 
acetonitrile > DMSO > water. Quinolines with more methyl groups on the arene are 
more kinetically stable, and RuCp(Quin1)+ PF6- (1), which has two methyl groups 
on the arene, is stable for days in DMSO. In contrast, a very similar complex 
(2) made with Quin2 having no methyl groups on the arene was readily displaced 
by DMSO. Both 1 and 2 are stable in 9 : 1 water/DMSO for days with no measurable 
displacement of the quinoline. The cytotoxicity of the quinolines, their 
CpRu+-complexes, and CpRu(DMSO)3+ PF6- was investigated towards two multiple 
myeloma cell lines: MC/CAR and RPMI 8226. To determine whether the activity of 
the complexes was related to the nature of the quinoline ligands, two 
structurally similar quinoline ligands with vastly different biological 
properties were investigated. Quin1 is a cytotoxic proteasome inhibitor, whereas 
Quin2 is not a proteasome inhibitor and showed no discernable cytotoxicity. The 
ruthenium complexes showed poor cellular proteasome inhibition. However, both 1 
and 2 showed good cytotoxicity towards RPMI 8226 and MC/CAR, with 1 being 
slightly more cytotoxic. For example, 1 has a CC50 = 2 μM in RPMI 8226, and 2 
has a CC50 = 5 μM for the same cell line. In contrast, CpRu(DMSO)3+ PF6- was 
quite active towards MC/CAR with CC50 = 2.8 μM but showed no discernible 
cytotoxicity toward RPMI 8226. The mechanism of action responsible for the 
observed cytotoxicity is not known, but the new Ru(Cp)(Quin)+ PF6- complexes do 
not cross-link DNA as found for platinum-based drugs. It is concluded that the 
Ru(Cp)(Quin)+ PF6- complexes remain intact in the cellular assays and constitute 
a new class of cytotoxic metal complexes."
1629,"In confined channels in low Reynolds number flow, droplets drift perpendicular 
to the flow, moving across streamlines. The phenomenon has proven useful for 
understanding microfluidic droplet separation, drug delivery vehicle 
optimization, and single-cell genomic amplification. Particles or droplets 
undergo several migration mechanisms including wall migration, hydrodynamic 
diffusion, and migration down gradients of shear. In simple shear flow only wall 
migration and hydrodynamic diffusion are present. In parabolic flow, droplets 
also move down gradients of shear. The resulting separation depends on 
parameters including particle size and stiffness, concentration, and flow rate. 
Computational methods can incorporate these effects in an exact manner to 
predict margination phenomena for specific systems, but do not generate a 
descriptive parametric dependence. In this paper, we present a scaling model 
that elucidates the parametric dependence of margination on emulsion droplet 
size, volume fraction, shear rate and suspending fluid viscosity. We 
experimentally measure the droplet depletion layer of silicone oil droplets and 
compare the results to theoretical scaling behavior that includes hydrodynamic 
diffusion and wall migration with and without an added shear-gradient migration. 
Results demonstrate the viability and limitations of applying a simple scaling 
behavior to experimental systems to describe parametric dependence. Our 
conclusions open the possibility for parametric descriptions of migration with 
broad applicability to particle and droplet systems."
1630,"Eukaryotic cells have evolved membrane-bound organelles, including the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, mitochondria, peroxisomes, chloroplasts (in 
plants and green algae) and lysosomes/vacuoles, for specialized functions. 
Organelle quality control and their proper interactions are crucial both for 
normal cell homeostasis and function and for environmental adaption. Dynamic 
turnover of organelles is tightly controlled, with autophagy playing an 
essential role. Autophagy is a programmed process for efficient clearing of 
unwanted or damaged macromolecules or organelles, transporting them to vacuoles 
for degradation and recycling and thereby enhancing plant environmental 
plasticity. The specific autophagic engulfment of organelles requires activation 
of a selective autophagy pathway, recognition of the organelle by a receptor, 
and selective incorporation of the organelle into autophagosomes. While some of 
the autophagy machinery and mechanisms for autophagic removal of organelles is 
conserved across eukaryotes, plants have also developed unique mechanisms and 
machinery for these pathways. In this review, we discuss recent progress in 
understanding autophagy regulation in plants, with a focus on autophagic 
degradation of membrane-bound organelles. We also raise some important 
outstanding questions to be addressed in the future."
1631,"Cytotoxic immune cells, including T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) 
cells, are essential components of the host response against tumors. CTLs and NK 
cells secrete granzyme A (GzmA) upon recognition of cancer cells; however, there 
are very few tools that can detect physiological levels of active GzmA with high 
spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we report the rational design of the 
near-infrared fluorogenic substrates for human GzmA and mouse GzmA. These 
activity-based probes display very high catalytic efficiency and selectivity 
over other granzymes, as shown in tissue lysates from wild-type and GzmA 
knock-out mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the probes can image how 
adaptive immune cells respond to antigen-driven recognition of cancer cells in 
real time."
1632,"Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death for women in low-resource 
settings. The World Health Organization recommends that cervical cancer 
screening programs incorporate HPV DNA testing, but available tests are 
expensive, require laboratory infrastructure, and cannot be performed at the 
point-of-care. We developed a two-dimensional paper network (2DPN), 
hybrid-capture, signal amplification assay and a point-of-care sample 
preparation protocol to detect high-risk HPV DNA from exfoliated cervical cells 
within an hour. The test does not require expensive equipment and has an 
estimated cost of <$3 per test without the need for batching. We evaluated 
performance of the paper HPV DNA assay with short synthetic and genomic HPV DNA 
targets, HPV positive and negative cellular samples, and two sets of clinical 
samples. The first set of clinical samples consisted of 16 biobanked, 
provider-collected cervical samples from a study in El Salvador previously 
tested with careHPV and subsequently tested in a controlled laboratory 
environment. The paper HPV DNA test correctly identified eight of eight 
HPV-negative clinical samples and seven of eight HPV-positive clinical samples. 
We then performed a field evaluation of the paper HPV DNA test in a hospital 
laboratory in Mozambique. Cellular controls generated expected results 
throughout field testing with fully lyophilized sample preparation and 2DPN 
reagents. When evaluated with 16 residual self-collected cervicovaginal samples 
previously tested by the GeneXpert HPV assay (""Xpert""), the accuracy of the HPV 
DNA paper test in the field was reduced compared to testing in the controlled 
laboratory environment, with positive results obtained for all eight 
HPV-positive samples as well as seven of eight HPV-negative samples. Further 
evaluation showed reduction in performance was likely due in part to increased 
concentration of exfoliated cells in the self-collected clinical samples from 
Mozambique compared with provider-collected samples from El Salvador. Finally, a 
formal usability assessment was conducted with users in El Salvador and 
Mozambique; the assay was rated as acceptable to perform after minimal training. 
With additional optimization for higher cell concentrations and inclusion of an 
internal cellular control, the paper HPV DNA assay offers promise as a low-cost, 
point-of-care cervical cancer screening test in low-resource settings."
1633,"INTRODUCTION: Raised dermal scars including hypertrophic, keloid and 
scalp-associated fibrosing Folliculitis Keloidalis Nuchae (FKN) are fibrotic 
disorders that mostly occur following cutaneous injury. They are characterized 
by increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, primarily excessive collagen 
type 1 production by hyperproliferative fibroblasts. The intensity of ECM 
deposition is proportional to the severity of fibrosis as such; with 
hypertrophic scars being less fibrotic, compared with keloids and FKN. Due to a 
lack of suitable study models, therapy for raised dermal scars remains 
ill-defined.
AIM: Studies have not fully elucidated the immunological cues in cutaneous 
fibrosis, hence the desired effect of several immune related therapies including 
regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines are yet to be elucidated. In this 
review, we will discuss the importance of immune factors in the pathogenesis of 
raised dermal scarring.
METHODS: We provide an up-to-date comprehensive review of the literature, from 
PubMed, Scopus, and other search engines to describe the immunological factors 
associated with raised dermal scarring.
RESULTS: Importance of immune cells including mast cells, macrophages, 
lymphocytes, and relevant molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth 
factors, antibodies, transcription factors and other immune-associated molecules 
as well as immune factors and tissue lymphoid aggregates with raised dermal 
scarring will be presented. Growing body of evidence points to a shift from 
proinflammatory Th1 response to regulatory/anti-inflammatory Th2 response is 
linked to fibrogenesis in raised dermal scarring.
CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of immune and associated molecular markers 
will enable better understanding of their potential as possible therapeutic, 
diagnostic and theragnostic targets in fibrotic raised dermal scarring."
1634,"BACKGROUND: The study aims to clarify the association of sarcopenia with 
perioperative and postoperative complications in oral cavity squamous cell 
carcinoma (OCSCC) patients undergoing curative surgery and to understand the 
reasons causing the poor oncologic outcomes for OCSCC.
METHODS: We conducted a propensity score matching study to investigate the 
association of perioperative and postoperative outcomes in OCSCC patients with 
sarcopenia and without sarcopenia. A retrospective analysis of a large national 
data set from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database was conducted. At least two 
claims for patients with a principal diagnosis of sarcopenia within the 12-month 
preoperative period were defined as the criteria for sarcopenia diagnosis 
(ICD-10-CM code M62.84). Sarcopenia was diagnosed through the measurement of low 
muscle strength and low muscle mass by any one of the patient's attending 
orthopaedic physician, rehabilitation physician, family medicine specialist or 
geriatrician. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the 
perioperative, and postoperative major complications.
RESULTS: Our final cohort included 16 293 patients with OCSCC (10 862 and 5 431 
in the sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups, respectively) who were eligible for 
further analysis. The sarcopenia group was 10.40% female and 89.60% male, and 
the nonsarcopenia group was 9.74% female and 90.26% male. The mean 
age ± standard deviation (SD) were 56.44 ± 11.14 and 56.22 ± 11.29 for 
sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups. OCSCC patients with sarcopenia undergoing 
curative surgery had a significantly higher blood transfusion rate and volume; 
longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay; higher postoperative 
30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
[1.07, 1.56]) and rates of pneumonia (aOR: 1.34, 95% CI [1.20, 1.50]), acute 
renal failure (aOR: 1.45, 95% CI [1.12, 1.87]) and septicaemia (aOR: 1.29, 95% 
CI [1.15, 1.45]); higher postoperative first-year mortality (aOR: 1.18, 95% CI 
[1.13, 1.51]) and rates of pneumonia (aOR: 1.43, 95% CI [1.30, 1.56]), acute 
myocardial infarction (aOR: 1.52, 95% CI [1.06, 2.18]) and septicaemia (aOR: 
1.29, 95% CI [1.15, 1.45]).
CONCLUSIONS: OCSCC patients with sarcopenia might exhibit more perioperative and 
surgical complications than those without sarcopenia."
1635,"Diffusion process at the electrode/electrolyte interphase drives the 
performances of the lithium-sulfur battery, and activated carbon (AC) can 
remarkably vehicle ions and polysulfide species throughout the two-side 
liquid/solid region of the interphase. We reveal original findings such as the 
values of the diffusion coefficient at various states of charge of the Li-S 
battery using a highly-porous AC, its notable dependence on the adopted 
techniques, and the correlation of the diffusion trend with the reaction 
mechanism. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray energy dispersive 
spectroscopy (EDS) identify in the carbon derived from bio-residues heteroatoms 
such as N, S, O and P which can increase the polarity of the C framework. The 
transport properties are achieved by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique 
(GITT). The study reveals Li+-diffusion coefficient (DLi+) depending on the 
technique, and values correlated with the cell state of the charge. EIS, CV and 
GITT show DLi+ within 10-7-10-8 cm2 s-1, 10-8-10-9 cm2 s-1, and 10-6-10-12 cm2 
s-1, respectively, dropping down at the fully discharged state and rising up 
upon charge. GITT allows the evaluation of DLi+ during the process and evidences 
the formation of lowly conducting media upon discharge. The sulfur composite 
delivers in Li-cell a specific capacity ranging from 1300 mAh g-1 at 0.1C to 700 
mAh g-1 at 2C with S loading of 2 mg cm-2, and from 1000 to 800 mAh g-1 at 0.2C 
when S loading is raised to 6 mg cm-2."
1636,"Benzamide (BZA), a small molecule that can freely cross cell membranes and bind 
to melanin, has served as an effective targeting group for melanoma 
theranostics. In this study, a novel pyridine-based BZA dimer (denoted as H-2) 
was labeled with 68Ga ([68Ga]Ga-H-2) for positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging of malignant melanomas. [68Ga]Ga-H-2 was obtained with high 
radiochemical yield (98.0 ± 2.0%) and satisfactory radiochemical purity 
(>95.0%). The specificity and affinity of [68Ga]Ga-H-2 were confirmed in 
melanoma B16F10 cells and in vivo PET imaging of multiple tumor models (B16F10 
tumors, A375 melanoma, and lung metastases). Monomeric [68Ga]Ga-H-1 was prepared 
as a control radiotracer to verify the effects of the molecular structure on 
pharmacokinetics. The values of the lipid-water partition coefficient of 
[68Ga]Ga-H-2 and [68Ga]Ga-H-1 demonstrated hydrophilicity with log P = -2.37 ± 
0.07 and -2.02 ± 0.09, respectively. PET imaging and biodistribution showed a 
higher uptake of [68Ga]Ga-H-2 in B16F10 primary and metastatic melanomas than 
that in A375 melanomas. However, the relatively low uptake of monomeric 
[68Ga]Ga-H-1 in B16F10 tumors and high accumulation in nontarget organs resulted 
in poor PET imaging quality. This study demonstrates the synthesis and 
preclinical evaluation of the novel pyridine-based BZA dimer [68Ga]Ga-H-2 and 
indicates that the dimer tracer has promising applications in malignant 
melanoma-specific PET imaging because of its high uptake and long-time retention 
in malignant melanoma."
1637,"BACKGROUND: The metalloprotease ADAMTS-7 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 
with thrombospondin type 1 motif 7) is a novel locus associated with human 
coronary atherosclerosis. ADAMTS-7 deletion protects against atherosclerosis and 
vascular restenosis in rodents.
METHODS: We designed 3 potential vaccines consisting of distinct B cell epitopic 
peptides derived from ADAMTS-7 and conjugated with the carrier protein KLH 
(keyhole limpet hemocyanin) as well as aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. 
Arterial ligation or wire injury was used to induce neointima in mice, whereas 
ApoE-/- and LDLR-/- (LDLR [low-density lipoprotein receptor]) mice fed a 
high-fat diet were applied to assess atherosclerosis. In addition, coronary 
stent implantation was performed on vaccine-immunized Bama miniature pigs, 
followed by optical coherence tomography to evaluate coronary intimal 
hyperplasia.
RESULTS: A vaccine, ATS7vac, was screened out from 3 candidates to effectively 
inhibit intimal thickening in murine carotid artery ligation models after 
vaccination. As well, immunization with ATS7vac alleviated neointima formation 
in murine wire injury models and mitigated atherosclerotic lesions in both 
hyperlipidemic ApoE-/- and LDLR-/- mice without lowering lipid levels. 
Preclinically, ATS7vac markedly impeded intimal hyperplasia in swine stented 
coronary arteries, but without significant immune-related organ injuries. 
Mechanistically, ATS7vac vaccination produced specific antibodies against 
ADAMTS-7, which markedly repressed ADAMTS-7-mediated COMP (cartilage oligomeric 
matrix protein) and TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) degradation and subsequently 
inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell migration but promoted 
re-endothelialization.
CONCLUSIONS: ATS7vac is a novel atherosclerosis vaccine that also alleviates 
in-stent restenosis. The application of ATS7vac would be a complementary 
therapeutic avenue to the current lipid-lowering strategy for atherosclerotic 
disease."
1638,"BACKGROUND: NDRG-1 (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1) is a member of NDRG 
family that plays essential roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and 
stress responses. Although the expression of NDRG1 is regulated by fluid shear 
stress, its roles in vascular biology remain poorly understood. The purpose of 
the study is to determine the functional significance of NDRG1 in vascular 
inflammation and remodeling.
METHODS AND RESULTS: By using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western 
blot, and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that the expression of NDRG1 is 
markedly increased in cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells and in human and 
mouse atherosclerotic lesions. To determine the role of NDRG1 in endothelial 
activation, we performed loss-of-function studies using NDRG1 short hairpin RNA. 
Our results demonstrate that NDRG1 knockdown by lentivirus bearing NDRG1 short 
hairpin RNA substantially attenuates both IL-1β and TNF-α (tumor necrosis 
factor-α)-induced expression of cytokines/chemokines and adhesion molecules. 
Intriguingly, inhibition of NDRG1 also significantly attenuates the expression 
of procoagulant molecules, such as PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 
1) and TF (tissue factor), and increases the expression of TM (thrombomodulin) 
and t-PA (tissue-type plasminogen activator), thus exerting potent 
antithrombotic effects in endothelial cells. Mechanistically, we showed that 
NDRG1 interacts with orphan Nur77 (nuclear receptor) and functionally inhibits 
the transcriptional activity of Nur77 and NF-κB (nuclear factor Kappa B) in 
endothelial cells. Moreover, in NDRG1 knockdown cells, both cytokine-induced 
mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, c-Jun phosphorylation, and AP-1 
(activator protein 1) transcriptional activity are substantially inhibited. 
Neointima and atherosclerosis formation induced by carotid artery ligation and 
arterial thrombosis were markedly attenuated in endothelial cell-specific NDRG1 
knockout mice compared with their wild-type littermates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results for the first time identify NDRG1 as a critical 
mediator implicated in regulating endothelial inflammation, thrombotic 
responses, and vascular remodeling, and suggest that inhibition of NDRG1 may 
represent a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammatory vascular diseases, such 
as atherothrombosis and restenosis."
1639,"Platelet hyperactivation could lead to various cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular diseases, while epidemiological analyses have found that 
long-term tea drinking could prevent and restrain cardiovascular diseases. 
Existing studies have shown that catechins, especially epigallocatechin gallate 
(EGCG), are the main functional factors of tea in alleviating thrombosis, which 
could inhibit arterial thrombosis and platelet aggregation induced by a variety 
of agonists. However, their structure-activity relationship and the underlying 
mechanisms are still unclear. Based on the above background, this study took six 
typical catechins as research objects, constructed platelet activation models 
with different inducers, and explored the inhibitory effects and potential 
mechanisms of catechins with different structures on platelet aggregation 
through flow cytometry, immunoblotting, cell spreading, and other experiments. 
It was found that ester catechins could inhibit platelet aggregation induced by 
adenosine diphosphate (ADP), while epigallocatechin (EGC) with three hydroxyls 
on the B ring in non-ester catechins was also able to effectively inhibit 
platelet aggregation. Our data suggested that gallic acyl on the C ring and 
three hydroxyls on the B ring were the main functional groups affecting the 
antithrombotic effect of catechins, and the effect of gallic acyl on platelets 
was significantly stronger than that of the hydroxyl."
1640,"The increased proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributes 
to the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. The intermediate conductance 
calcium-activated potassium (IKCa ) channel plays a critical role in VSMC 
proliferation by raising the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+ ]i ), 
but the underlying mechanism is still not unclear. Here we investigated the 
cooperation between IKCa and transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) 
channels in mediating extracellular Ca2+ entry, which in turn activates 
downstream Ca2+ signalling in the regulation of VSMC proliferation using 
serum-induced cell proliferation model. Serum-induced cell proliferation was 
accompanied with up-regulation of IKCa expression and an increase in [Ca2+ ]i . 
Serum-induced cell proliferation and increase in [Ca2+ ]i were suppressed by 
IKCa inhibition with TRAM-34 or IKCa knockdown. Serum-induced cell proliferation 
was strongly reduced by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA or 
intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA-AM and, additionally, by TRPC1 knockdown. 
Moreover, the increase in [Ca2+ ]i induced by serum or by IKCa activation with 
1-EBIO was attenuated by TRPC1 knockdown. Finally, serum induced ERK1/2 
activation, which was attenuated by treatment with TRAM-34 or BAPTA-AM, as well 
as TRPC1 knockdown. Consistently, serum-induced cell proliferation was 
suppressed by ERK1/2 inhibition with PD98059. Taken together, these results 
suggest that the IKCa and TRPC1 channels cooperate in mediating Ca2+ influx that 
activates the ERK1/2 pathway to promote cell proliferation, thus providing new 
mechanistic insights into VSMC proliferation."
1641,"BACKGROUND: Targeting of the apelin-apelin receptor (Apj) system may serve as a 
useful therapeutic intervention for the management of chronic kidney disease 
(CKD)-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. We investigated the roles and efficacy of 
the apelin-Apj system in CKD-induced skeletal muscle atrophy.
METHODS: The 5/6-nephrectomized mice were used as CKD models. AST-120, a 
charcoal adsorbent of uraemic toxins (8 w/w% in diet), or apelin (1 μmol/kg) was 
administered to CKD mice to investigate the mechanism and therapeutic potential 
of apelin on CKD-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. The effect of indoxyl sulfate, 
a uraemic toxin, or apelin on skeletal muscle atrophy was evaluated using mouse 
myoblast cells (C2C12 cells) in vitro.
RESULTS: Skeletal muscle atrophy developed over time following nephrectomy at 
12 weeks, as confirmed by a significant increase of atrogin-1 and myostatin mRNA 
expression in the gastrocnemius (GA) muscle and a decrease of lower limb 
skeletal muscle weight (P < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). Apelin 
expression in GA muscle was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and elabela, 
another Apj endogenous ligand, tended to show a non-significant decrease at 
12 weeks after nephrectomy. Administration of AST-120 inhibited the decline of 
muscle weight and increase of atrogin-1 and myostatin expression. Apelin and 
elabela expression was slightly improved by AST-120 administration but Apj 
expression was not, suggesting the involvement of uraemic toxins in endogenous 
Apj ligand expression. The administration of apelin at 1.0 μmol/kg for 4 weeks 
to CKD mice suppressed the increase of atrogin-1 and myostatin, increased apelin 
and Apj mRNA expression at 30 min after apelin administration and significantly 
ameliorated weight loss and a decrease of the cross-sectional area of hindlimb 
skeletal muscle.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated for the first time the association of the 
Apj endogenous ligand-uraemic toxin axis with skeletal muscle atrophy in CKD and 
the utility of therapeutic targeting of the apelin-Apj system."
1642,"BACKGROUND: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the deadliest form of lung cancer 
but lacks targeted therapies.
METHODS: We studied the effect of the natural product mistletoe lectin (ML) in 
pre-clinical models of SCLC, focusing on cell lines with amplification of the 
myc family oncogenes C-myc and N-myc.
RESULTS: We found that ML treatment inhibits growth of SCLC cell lines in 
culture and induces apoptosis. ML treatment also decreases the expression of the 
amplified myc proteins. Over-expression of either C-myc or N-myc results in 
enhanced SCLC cell sensitivity to ML. In a mouse xenograft model of SCLC, 
treatment with ML results in decreased tumor growth over 4 weeks with evidence 
of increased apoptosis in tumors from treated animals.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our results demonstrate that ML exhibits therapeutic 
potential in SCLC, that is at least partially dependent on myc protein 
expression."
1643,"Qinba selenium mushroom is a mushroom belonging to the Basidiomycetes family, 
which is believed to have anti- oxidant, anti-tumoral and anti-mutagenic 
activities. However, the efficacy of Qinba selenium mushroom against multiple 
myeloma has not been confirmed. The present study aimed to investigate the 
apoptotic effect of FA-2-b-β, the selenium mushroom extract from Qinba on 
multiple myeloma (MM) cells. The MM RPMI-8226 cells were treated with FA-2-b-β 
at different concentrations and time points. MM RPMI-8226 cell proliferation and 
apoptosis were detected by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Annexin 
V/propidium iodide (PI) assay, RT-QPCR and western blotting analyses were 
performed to determine the proteins and pathways involved. The results of the 
present study demonstrated that FA-2-b-β has high anti-proliferative activities 
and strong pro-apoptotic effects on MM RPMI-8226 cells, and its pharmacological 
effects on proliferation changes occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 
In addition, we found that FA-2-b-β was able to induce cell apoptosis and 
promote cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In summary, the results illustrate the 
involvement of FA-2-b-β in mediating G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MM 
RPMI-8226 cells, which suggested that FA-2-b-β might have therapeutic potential 
against multiple myeloma as an effective compound, and may provide useful 
information for the development of a novel therapeutic target in this area."
1644,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This short review is intended to highlight the potential role 
of inflammation as a key pathological driver, rather than a mere consequence, of 
nephrolithiasis. Although there is clearly a strong likelihood that the 
relationship is bidirectional, and that kidney stone-triggered inflammation can 
establish a vicious cycle of tissue injury and stone formation.
RECENT FINDINGS: These consist of data from both recent preclinical and clinical 
studies demonstrating the importance of inflammation in models of stone disease 
and in kidney tissue from patients with nephrolithiasis, and as a potential 
driver of disease recurrence and a suitable treatment target. In particular, the 
role of immune cells and their relationship to the NLRP3 inflammasome is 
becoming clearer, as well as the potential contribution to tissue injury and 
stone formation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and 
interleukin-18.
SUMMARY: This concept is not new and raises the possibility that targeting 
inflammation directly may prove to be a novel and suitable means of treatment 
for at least some types of kidney stone, and in certain clinical settings, both 
acutely and as prevention, especially in those patients experiencing recurrent 
stone episodes and/or who have a well defined metabolic cause such as uric acid 
or calcium oxalate stones."
1645,"Several studies have suggested a strong interaction between the circadian clock 
and lipid metabolism in mammals. The circadian clock is driven by endogenous 
cyclic gene expression patterns, commonly referred to as clock genes, and 
transcription-translation negative feedback loops. Clock genes regulate the 
transcription of some lipid metabolism-related genes; however, the relationship 
between the circadian clock and triglyceride (TG) accumulation at the cellular 
level remains unclear. Here, we evaluated rhythms of intracellular TG 
accumulation levels as well as the expression of clock genes and lipid 
metabolism-related genes for 54 h in mouse and bovine adipose-derived cell 
cultures. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report 
demonstrating that TG accumulation exhibits diurnal variations, with the pattern 
differing among cell types. Furthermore, we found that expression of clock genes 
and corresponding lipid metabolism-related genes exhibited circadian rhythms. 
Our results suggest that the cellular clock regulates lipid metabolism-related 
genes to relate circadian rhythms of TG accumulation in each cell type. We 
anticipate that the amount of fat stored depends on the timing of the supply of 
glucose-the precursor of fat. The findings of this study will contribute to the 
advancement of chrono-nutrition."
1646,"Vitrification and warming can trigger premature meiosis in immature porcine 
oocytes. Our aim was to compare the efficacies of two meiotic inhibitors, 
dibutyryl-cAMP and roscovitine for the meiosis synchronization during in vitro 
maturation (IVM) of porcine oocytes vitrified at the germinal vesicle (GV) 
stage. We first compared the efficacy of 1 mM dibutyryl-cAMP and 25 μM 
roscovitine on meiotic arrest during the first 22 h of IVM. Dibutyryl-cAMP could 
maintain the GV stage in 83.5% of oocytes; however, roscovitine was even more 
effective (96.6%), whereas only 17.4% of the oocytes remained at the GV stage 
without these additives. Temporal meiotic arrest for 22 h by roscovitine did not 
reduce the percentage of oocytes reaching the Metaphase II stage during 
subsequent IVM. However, after parthenogenetic stimulation or in vitro 
fertilization, subsequent embryo development to the blastocyst stage was 
compromised after roscovitine treatment, whereas dibutyryl-cAMP improved the 
percentage of blastocyst development. In conclusion, dibutyryl-cAMP could 
derogate but not completely prevent premature meiosis in vitrified oocytes, 
whereas roscovitine could more efficiently prevent it. However, for embryo 
production, the use of roscovitine was disadvantageous, whereas the use of 
dibutyryl-cAMP was beneficial."
1647,"Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is the main cause of type 2 diabetes, and 
mitochondria play a key role. Ginsenoside CK is the main active compound of 
ginseng with a variety of therapeutic effects, but few studies have reported on 
its mechanism towards skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Here, we found that CK 
significantly increased skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, thereby alleviating 
hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the effects of CK on skeletal 
muscle were associated with an improved mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics 
balance and fatty acid oxidation. In fatty acid (FA)-induced C2C12 cells, CK 
promoted the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane to improve glucose 
uptake and glycogen synthesis and also enhanced the mitochondrial quality. CK 
ameliorated the damaged mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which was based 
on mitophagy activation. After the knockdown of mitophagy-related receptors, we 
found that DRP1/PINK1 was the key pathway of CK-induced mitophagy. These 
findings indicated that ginsenoside CK is a promising lead compound against 
diabetes."
1648,"INTRODUCTION: The pathogenesis of infectious kidney stones is poorly understood. 
Bacteria have been implicated in promoting infectious stones via urease 
production, however there is mounting evidence indicating the relationship is 
more complex. The aim of our study was to characterize suspected biotic and 
abiotic extrinsic factors which may modulate the formation of infectious stones.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A high-throughput experimental model with Griffith's 
artificial urine was used to test a wide variety of urinary modulators and 
cytoplasmic enzymes present in crude cell free extracts (CFE) from bacterial 
strains to investigate how they impact struvite and calcium phosphate crystal 
production. Crystal formation was evaluated with spectrophotometry and growth 
curve analysis. Light microscopy and SEM/EDX was used for crystal structure and 
composition identification.
RESULTS: The acidic urinary modulators used in this study prevented crystal 
formation, whereas osteopontin had a significant inhibitory effect. Addition of 
CFE from Proteus mirabilis 175A and 177A resulted in calcium phosphate and 
struvite crystals. Interestingly, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca 
produced crystals including calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate, respectively. 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa had no urease production detected and produced calcium 
phosphate crystals.
DISCUSSION: Urinary modulators can have a wide variety of effects on infectious 
stone formation and the role of pH is important but does not guarantee robust 
crystal formation. Bacterial strains can produce calcium oxalate, calcium 
phosphate and struvite stones with and without urease activity.
CONCLUSION: Various urinary modulators appear to influence the process and are 
worthy of further evaluation as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent 
infection-related urinary stone formation. Stones formed from urinary tract 
infections may be a result of multiple encoded metabolic pathways and 
discovering these would improve our understanding of the stone-bacterial 
relationship."
1649,"OBJECTIVES: The immune dysregulation during SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to 
worsen immune homeostasis after recovery. Patients with hematological 
malignancies with COVID-19 have changes both in the innate and adaptive immune 
responses. Little is known about the severity of immune dysfunction following 
recovery from COVID-19 in hematological patients.
METHODS: Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the lymphocyte subsets 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by FACS Canto II in 55 patients, 
including 42 with hematological malignancies 4-6 weeks after COVID-19.
RESULTS: Hematological COVID-19 convalescents had deep reduction in CD3+ T 
cells, including helper T cells (CD3+CD4+), naïve helper T cells 
(CD3+CD4+CD45RA+) and memory CD4+ T cells among with extremely low levels of 
Treg cells and decreased expression of both TCRα/β and TCRγ/δ. Severe immune 
dysregulation in hematological convalescents was expressed by increased 
activation of T lymphocytes, both as elevated levels of activated T cells 
(CD3+HLA-DR+) and activated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a profound impairment of the adaptive immune 
response in hematological convalescents which might be a result of persistent 
activation of T cells. Convalescents with lymphoid malignancies showed more 
pronounced depletion of key T lymphocytes subpopulations in creating an 
effective adaptive response and immune memory. This article is protected by

1650,"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles derived from the endosomal compartment, 
which are released by all kinds of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. These 
vesicles contain a variety of biomolecules that differ both in quantity and type 
depending on the origin and cellular state. Exosomes are internalized by 
recipient cells, delivering their content and thus contributing to cell-cell 
communication in health and disease. During infections exosomes may exert a dual 
role, on one hand, they can transmit pathogen-related molecules mediating 
further infection and damage, and on the other hand, they can protect the host 
by activating the immune response and reducing pathogen spread. Selective 
packaging of pathogenic components may mediate these effects. Recently, 
quantitative analysis of samples by omics technologies has allowed a deep 
characterization of the proteins, lipids, RNA, and metabolite cargoes of 
exosomes. Knowledge about the content of these vesicles may facilitate their 
therapeutic application. Furthermore, as exosomes have been detected in almost 
all biological fluids, pathogenic or host-derived components can be identified 
in liquid biopsies, making them suitable for diagnosis and prognosis. This 
review attempts to organize the recent findings on exosome composition and 
function during viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections, and their 
contribution to host defense or to pathogen spread. Moreover, we summarize the 
current perspectives and future directions regarding the potential application 
of exosomes for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes."
1651,"The effect of the toxicant 2,3',4,4',6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-119) on the 
growth, chlorophyll content, and PSII activity of C. sorokiniana cells was 
investigated. A strong negative effect of the toxicant was observed at PCB 
concentration of 0.05 μg mL-1 , when culture growth ceased, chlorophyll strongly 
bleached, and cell death occurred. The use of original highly sensitive 
fluorimeter to measure three types of high-resolution chlorophyll fluorescence 
kinetics allowed us to detect an initial dramatic decrease in the activity of 
primary photosynthetic reactions, followed by their almost complete recovery at 
the end of the incubation period when most cells were dead. The study of the 
distribution of individual cells in culture in terms of Fv /Fm parameter, which 
reflects the quantum yield of PSII photochemistry, revealed the existence of 
2-3% of cells retaining high Fv/Fm (> 0.7) in the presence of the toxicant. The 
treated cultures were able to resume growth after prolonged incubation in fresh 
medium. The high sensitivity fluorescence methods used made it possible to 
identify stress-resistant cells which maintain high photosynthetic activity in 
the presence of lethal doses of toxic substances; these cells provide recovery 
of the population after stress."
1652,"Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a main active component of propolis and a 
flavonoid, is one of the natural products that has attracted attention in recent 
years. CAPE, which has many properties such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-fungal, has shown many pharmacological 
potentials, including protective effects on multiple organs. Interestingly, 
molecular docking studies showed the possibility of binding of CAPE with 
replication enzyme. In addition, it was seen that in order to increase the 
binding security of the replication enzyme and CAPE, modifications can be made 
at three sites on the CAPE molecule, which leads to the possibility of the 
compound working more powerfully and usefully to prevent the proliferation of 
cancer cells and reduce its rate. Also, it was found that CAPE has an inhibitory 
effect against the main protease enzyme and may be effective in the treatment of 
SARS-CoV-2. This review covers in detail the importance of CAPE in alternative 
medicine, its pharmacological value, its potential as a cancer 
anti-proliferative agent, its dual role in radioprotection and 
radiosensitization, and its use against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
1653,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) provides a permeable barrier between the 
nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. In a subset of NPC constituents that regulate meiosis 
in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we found that nucleoporin Nup132 
(homolog of human Nup133) deficiency resulted in transient leakage of nuclear 
proteins during meiosis I, as observed in the nup132 gene-deleted mutant. The 
nuclear protein leakage accompanied the liberation of the small ubiquitin-like 
modifier (SUMO)-specific ubiquitin-like protease 1 (Ulp1) from the NPC. Ulp1 
retention at the nuclear pore prevented nuclear protein leakage and restored 
normal meiosis in a mutant lacking Nup132. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry 
analysis, we identified DNA topoisomerase 2 (Top2) and RCC1-related protein 
(Pim1) as the target proteins for SUMOylation. SUMOylation levels of Top2 and 
Pim1 were altered in meiotic cells lacking Nup132. HyperSUMOylated Top2 
increased the binding affinity at the centromeres of nup132 gene-deleted meiotic 
cells. The Top2-12KR sumoylation mutant was less localized to the centromeric 
regions. Our results suggest that SUMOylation of chromatin-binding proteins is 
regulated by the NPC-bound SUMO-specific protease and is important for the 
progression of meiosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1654,"To explore the role of autophagic flux in the increased susceptibility of the 
experimental diabetic heart to ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, we 
established STZ-induced diabetic mice and performed I/R. In vitro, neonatal 
mouse cardiomyocytes were subjected to high glucose and hypoxia/reoxygenation 
challenge to mimic diabetic I/R injury. We found that experimental diabetes 
aggravated I/R-induced injury than compared with nondiabetic mice. Autophagic 
flux was impaired in I/R hearts, and the impairment was exacerbated in diabetic 
mice subjected to I/R with defective autophagosome formation and clearance. 
Calpains, calcium-dependent thiol proteases, were upregulated and highly 
activated after I/R of diabetes, while calpain inhibition attenuated cardiac 
function and cell death and partially restored autophagic flux. The expression 
levels of Atg5 and LAMP2, two crucial autophagy-related proteins, were 
significantly degraded in diabetic I/R hearts, alterations that were associated 
with calpain activation and could be reversed by calpain inhibition. 
Co-overexpression of Atg5 and LAMP2 reduced myocardial injury and normalized 
autophagic flux. In conclusion, experimental diabetes exacerbates autophagic 
flux impairment of cardiomyocytes under I/R stress, resulting in worse 
I/R-induced injury. Calpain activation and cleavage of Atg5 and LAMP2 at least 
partially account for the deterioration of autophagic flux impairment."
1655,"OBJECTIVE: The incidence of women entering into pregnancy with BMI indicating 
overweight or obesity is rising with concurrent increases in adverse 
complications such as gestational diabetes. Although several studies have 
examined the compositional changes to the microbiome across BMI classifications, 
there has been no investigation regarding changes in microbial function during 
pregnancy.
METHODS: A total of 105 gastrointestinal microbiome biospecimens were used in 
this analysis. Biospecimens were sequenced by using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 
shotgun metagenomics platform.
RESULTS: Findings indicate an enrichment in microbiota from the phylum 
Firmicutes across all pregravid BMI groups with a decrease in α diversity in 
groups with BMI indicating obesity or overweight compared with a group with BMI 
indicating normal weight (p = 0.02). More specifically, women with BMI 
indicating obesity or overweight had enrichment in Bifidobacterium bifidum and 
B. adolescentis. Women with BMI > 25 kg/m2 had a higher abundance of microbiota 
that support biotin synthesis and regulate epithelial cells in the lower 
gastrointestinal tract. These epithelial cells are responsible for host 
adaptability to dietary lipid variation and caloric absorption.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that there are differences in microbial 
composition and function between BMI groups. Future research should consider how 
these changes contribute to specific clinical outcomes during pregnancy."
1656,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a transcription-associated protein involved 
in controlling the cell cycle and is often deregulated in stress conditions. 
CDK9 is being studied as a well-known druggable target for developing effective 
therapeutics against a wide range of cancer, cardiac dysfunction and 
inflammatory diseases. Owing to the significance of CDK9 in the etiology of 
hematological and solid malignancies, its structure, biological activity, 
regulation and its pharmacological inhibition are being explored for therapeutic 
management of cancer. We employed a structure-based virtual high-throughput 
screening of bioactive compounds from the IMPPAT database to discover potential 
bioactive inhibitors of CDK9. The preliminary results were obtained from the 
Lipinski criteria, ADMET parameters and sorting compounds without any PAINS 
patterns. Subsequently, binding affinity and selectivity analyses were used to 
find effective CDK9 hits. This screening resulted in the identification of two 
natural compounds, Glabrene and Guggulsterone with high affinity and specificity 
for the CDK9 binding site. Both compounds exhibit drug-like characteristics, as 
projected by ADMET analysis, physicochemical data and PASS evaluation. Both 
compounds preferentially bind to the ATP-binding pocket of CDK9 and interact 
with functionally important residues. Further, the dynamics and consistency of 
CDK9 interaction with Glabrene and Guggulsteron were evaluated through all-atom 
molecular dynamic (MD) simulations which suggested the stability of both 
complexes. The results might be deployed to introduce novel CDK9 inhibitors that 
may treat life-threatening diseases, including cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy

1657,"The control of intracellular membrane trafficking by Rho GTPases is central to 
cellular homeostasis. How specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 
and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) locally balance GTPase activation in this 
process is nevertheless largely unclear. By performing a microscopy-based RNAi 
screen we here identify the RhoGEF protein Solo as a functional counterpart of 
DLC3, a RhoGAP protein with established roles in membrane trafficking. 
Biochemical, imaging and optogenetics assays further uncover Solo as a novel 
regulator of endosomal RhoB. Remarkably, we find that Solo and DLC3 control not 
only the activity but also total protein levels of RhoB in an antagonistic 
manner. Together, the results of our study uncover the first functionally 
connected RhoGAP-RhoGEF pair at endomembranes, placing Solo and DLC3 at the core 
of endocytic trafficking."
1658,"A practical method to access amino-isocoumarins catalyzed by a Rh(III) complex 
through redox-neutral C-H/O-H annulation has been disclosed. The use of 
N-functionalized cyclic carbonates is crucial to facilitate the catalytic 
turnover, and a broad spectrum of amino-isocoumarin derivatives were prepared 
with satisfactory yields. Amino-isocoumarin estrone conjugated with a 
selenocyano functionality was identified to be nearly four times as active as 
the marketed drug abiraterone against T47D cancer cells."
1659,"Sulfated host glycans (mucin O-glycans and glycosaminoglycans [GAGs]) are 
critical nutrient sources and colonisation factors for Bacteroidetes of the 
human gut microbiota (HGM); a complex ecosystem comprising essential 
microorganisms that coevolved with humans to serve important roles in pathogen 
protection, immune signalling, and host nutrition. Carbohydrate sulfatases are 
essential enzymes to access sulfated host glycans and are capable of exquisite 
regio- and stereo-selective substrate recognition. In these enzymes, the common 
recognition features of each subfamily are correlated with their genomic and 
environmental context. The exo-acting carbohydrate sulfatases are attractive 
drug targets amenable to small-molecule screening and subsequent engineering, 
and their high specificity will help elucidate the role of glycan sulfation in 
health and disease. Inhibition of carbohydrate sulfatases provides potential 
routes to control Bacteroidetes growth and to explore the influence of host 
glycan metabolism by Bacteroidetes on the HGM ecosystem. The roles of 
carbohydrate sulfatases from the HGM organism Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and 
the soil isolated Pedobacter heparinus (P. heparinus) in sulfated host glycan 
metabolism are examined and contrasted, and the structural features underpinning 
glycan recognition and specificity explored."
1660,"Lung and breast cancers are among the most common cancers. In the present work, 
initially, 6-bromo-; and 6-chloro-3-hydroxychromone compounds were prepared. In 
the next step, a series of 8-bromo-; and 8-chloro-dihyropyrano[3,2-b]chromene 
derivatives were synthesized by one-pot three component reaction of these two 
compounds, aromatic aldehydes, and ethyl cyanoacetate in the presence of 
triethylamine in EtOH at reflux conditions. The synthesized compounds were 
tested for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against A549 (lung cancer) and 
MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines. It was found that some compounds have high to 
moderate cytotoxicity, which makes them potential candidates for further 
studies. This study can be the basis for further studies to design and synthesis 
potent anticancer compounds and investigating their mechanism of action."
1661,"In this study, a series of hydrazide-hydrazone derivatives (3a-3u) were 
synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer activities against prostate 
cancer cell line (PC-3), breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), colon cancer cell line 
(HT-29) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using MTT assay. In 
particular, compound 3h having a pyrrole ring was found to be the most potent 
derivative with IC50 = 1.32, 2.99, 1.71 µM against PC-3, MCF-7, HT-29 cancer 
cell lines respectively using paclitaxel as a standard compound. Furthermore, 
compound 3h was subjected to further biological studies such as caspase-3 
activity and Annexin-V assay to evaluate their inhibitory potentials. The 
activity results displayed that compound 3h increased caspase-3 activation and 
the number of cells to early apoptosis. The additional studies like 
pharmacokinetics, bioavailability scores and drug-likeness properties were also 
evaluated. The in silico pharmacokinetics predictions displayed that the 
bioavailability of these compounds may be high."
1662,"Several multicomponent synthetic approaches were elaborated for plenty of novel 
nitrogen or oxygen heterocycles containing a phosphonate or a phosphine oxide 
moiety. All multicomponent reactions were optimized through a model reaction in 
respect of the heating mode, molar ratio of the starting materials, atmosphere, 
catalyst, temperature, reaction time and solvent applied, and then, the extended 
preparation of small libraries of structurally-related compounds was performed. 
Most of the reactions could be considered as ""green syntheses"", as they were 
carried out in the absence of any catalyst and/or solvent using microwave (MW) 
irradiation or even at ambient temperature. The scaling-up of a MW-assisted 
synthesis was also elaborated in a continuous flow MW system. Altogether more 
than 150 heterocyclic organophosphorus compounds were synthesized, among them 
several derivatives showed moderate or promising activity against the HL-60 cell 
line and Bacillus subtilis bacteria."
1663,"Key homeostasis providing cells in the central nervous system (CNS) are 
astrocytes, which belong to the class of cells known as atroglia, a highly 
heterogeneous type of neuroglia and a prominent element of the brain defence. 
Diseases evolve due to altered homeostatic state, associated with 
pathology-induced astroglia remodelling represented by reactive astrocytes, 
astroglial atrophy and astrodegeneration. These features are hallmarks of most 
infectious insults, mediated by bacteria, protozoa and viruses; they are also 
prominent in the systemic infection. The COVID-19 pandemic revived the focus 
into neurotropic viruses such as SARS-CoV2 (Coronaviridae) but also the 
Flaviviridae viruses including tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) and Zika virus 
(ZIKV) causing the epidemic in South America prior to COVID-19. Astrocytes 
provide a key response to neurotropic infections in the CNS. Astrocytes form a 
parenchymal part of the blood-brain barrier, the site of virus entry into the 
CNS. Astrocytes exhibit aerobic glycolysis, a form of metabolism characteristic 
of highly morphologically plastic cells, like cancer cells, hence a suitable 
milieu for multiplication of infectious agent, including viral particles. 
However, why the protection afforded by astrocytes fails in some circumstances 
is an open question to be studied in the future."
1664,"Pollen tube attraction is a key event of sexual reproduction in flowering 
plants. In the ovule, two synergid cells neighboring the egg cell control pollen 
tube arrival via the active secretion of attractant peptides such as AtLURE1 and 
XIUQIU from the filiform apparatus facing toward the micropyle. Distinctive cell 
polarity together with longitudinal F-actin and microtubules are hallmarks of 
the synergid cell in various species, though the functions of these cellular 
structures are unclear. In this study we used genetic and pharmacological 
approaches to indicate the roles of cytoskeletal components in filiform 
apparatus formation and pollen tube guidance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Genetic 
inhibition of microtubule formation reduced invaginations of the plasma membrane 
but did not abolish micropylar AtLURE1.2 accumulation. By contrast, the 
expression of a dominant-negative form of ACTIN8 induced disorganization of the 
filiform apparatus and loss of polar AtLURE1.2 distribution toward the filiform 
apparatus. Interestingly, after pollen tube reception, F-actin became unclear 
for a few hours in the persistent synergid cell, which may be involved in 
pausing and resuming pollen tube attraction during early polytubey block. Our 
data suggest that F-actin plays a central role in maintaining cell polarity and 
in mediating male-female communication in the synergid cell."
1665,"Mycorrhizal fungi form mutually beneficial interactions with a wide range of 
terrestrial plants. During this symbiosis, the associated fungus provides 
mineral nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, to its host plant in 
exchange of photosynthesis-derived carbohydrates. Genome sequencing of 
mycorrhizal fungi has shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and 
ectomycorrhizal fungi have a restricted set of plant-cell wall degrading enzymes 
(PCWDE) genes, while orchid and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi have an extended PCWDE 
repertoire similar to soil decomposers and wood-decay fungi. On the other hand, 
mycorrhizal fungi have retained a substantial set of carbohydrate active enzymes 
(CAZymes) acting on microbial polysaccharides. Functional analysis has shown 
that several of the remaining PCWDEs are involved in the fungal root 
colonization and establishment of the symbiotic interface. In this review, we 
highlight the current knowledge on the evolution and function of PCWDEs in 
mycorrhizal fungi."
1666,"In preclinical drug testing, human muscle tissue models are critical to 
understanding the complex physiology, including drug effects in the human body. 
This study reports that a multilayering approach to cell sheet-based engineering 
produces an engineered human muscle tissue with sufficient contractile force 
suitable for measurement. A thermoresponsive micropatterned substrate regulates 
the biomimetic alignment of myofiber structures enabling the harvest of the 
aligned myofibers as a single cell sheet. The functional muscle tissue is 
produced by layering multiple myofiber sheets on a fibrin-based gel. This gel 
environment promotes myofiber maturation, provides the tissue an elastic 
platform for contraction, and allows the attachment of a measurement device. 
Since this multilayering approach is effective in enhancing the contractile 
ability of the muscle tissue, this muscle tissue generates a significantly high 
contractile force that can be measured quantitatively. The multilayered muscle 
tissue shows unidirectional contraction from electrical and chemical 
stimulation. In addition, their physiological responses to representative drugs 
can be determined quantitatively in real time by changes in contractile force 
and fatigue resistance. These physiological properties indicate that the 
engineered muscle tissue can become a promising tissue model for preclinical in 
vitro studies in muscle physiology and drug discovery."
1667,"NK cells are known for their potent ability to kill stressed cells, whereas host 
cells infected with intracellular bacteria may also be benefit from the 
selective killing function of NK cells and survive. The mechanism of how NK 
cells protect host cells infected with intracellular bacteria is still unclear. 
Here, we discovered that decidual NK cells can not only eliminate intracellular 
bacteria which infected trophoblasts, but can also synthesize more lipids and 
transport lipids to trophoblasts to avoid their apoptosis. Mechanically, NK 
cells synthesize more lipids accompanied by increasing expression of 
apolipoprotein APOD. Lipids in NK cells can be delivered to trophoblast cells 
through APOD, maintaining adequate lipid droplet content and lipid metabolism 
homeostasis in trophoblasts. Blocking the APOD receptor LRP1 abolished lipid 
transport from NK cells to trophoblasts, and the reduction of lipid droplets 
caused by bacterial infection in trophoblast cells could not be restored, 
culminating in cell apoptosis. Our study provides new evidence for the immune 
surveillance and protective effect of NK cells on embryos during early 
pregnancy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1668,"Ustilago maydis expresses a number of proteases during its pathogenic lifecycle. 
Some of the proteases including both intracellular and extracellular ones have 
previously been shown to influence the virulence of the pathogen. However, any 
role of secreted proteases in the sporulation process of U. maydis have not been 
explored earlier. In this study we have investigated the biological function of 
one such secreted protease, Ger1 belonging to aspartic protease A1 family. An 
assessment of the real time expression of ger1 revealed an infection specific 
expression of the protein especially during late phases of infection. We also 
evaluated any contribution of the protein in the pathogenicity of the fungus. 
Our data revealed an involvement of Ger1 in the sporulation and spore 
germination processes of U. maydis. Ger1 also showed positive influence on the 
pathogenicity of the fungus and accordingly the ger1 deletion mutant exhibited 
reduced pathogenicity. The study also demonstrated the protease activity 
associated with Ger1 to be essential for its biological function. Fluorescence 
microscopy of maize plants infected with U. maydis cells expressing 
Ger1-mcherry-HA also revealed that Ger1 is efficiently secreted within maize 
apoplast. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1669,"Rhizodeposition is the export of organic compounds from plant roots to the soil. 
Carbon allocation towards rhizodeposition has to be balanced with allocation for 
other physiological functions, which depend on both newly assimilated and stored 
nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC). To test whether the exudation of primary 
metabolites scales with plant NSC status, we studied diurnal dynamics of NSC and 
amino acid (AA) pools and fluxes within the plant and the rhizosphere. These 
diurnal dynamics were measured in the field and under hydroponic controlled 
conditions. Further, C-limiting treatments offered further insight into the 
regulation of rhizodeposition. The exudation of primary metabolites fluctuated 
diurnally. The diurnal dynamics of soluble sugars (SS) and AA concentrations in 
tissues coincided with exudate pool fluctuations in the rhizosphere. SS and AA 
pools in the rhizosphere increased with NSC and AA pools in the roots. C 
starvation treatments offset the balance of exudates: AA exudate content in the 
rhizosphere significantly decreased while SS exudate content remained stable. 
Our results suggest that rhizodeposition is to some extent controlled by plant 
C:N status. We propose that SS exudation is less controlled than AA exudation 
because N assimilation depends on controlled C supply while SS exudation relies 
to a greater extent on passive diffusion mechanisms. This article is protected

1670,"Mass transport through nanopores occurs in various natural systems, including 
the human body. For example, ion transport across nerve cell membranes plays a 
significant role in neural signal transmission, which can be significantly 
affected by the electrolyte and temperature conditions. To better understand and 
control the underlying nanoscopic transport, it is necessary to develop 
multiphysical transport models as well as validate them using enhanced 
experimental methods for facile nanopore fabrication and precise nanoscale 
transport characterization. Here, we report a nanopore-integrated microfluidic 
platform to characterize ion transport in the presence of electrolyte and 
temperature gradients; we employ our previous self-assembled particle membrane 
(SAPM)-integrated microfluidic platform to produce various nanopores with 
different pore sizes. Subsequently, we quantify pore-size-dependent ionic 
transport by measuring the short circuit current (SCC) and open circuit voltage 
(OCV) across various nanopores by manipulating the electrolyte and temperature 
gradients. We establish three simple theoretical models that heavily depend on 
pore size, electrolyte concentration, and temperature and subsequently validate 
them with the experimental results. Finally, we anticipate that the results of 
this study would help clarify ion transport phenomena at low-temperature 
conditions, not only providing a fundamental understanding but also enabling 
practical applications of cryo-anesthesia in the near future."
1671,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of deferasirox (DFX) by comparison with 
deferoxamine (DFO) in managing iron overload in patients with sickle cell 
anaemia (SCA).
METHODS: Online databases were systematically searched for studies published 
from January 2007 to July 2022 that had investigated the efficacy of DFX 
compared with DFO in managing iron overload in patients with SCA.
RESULTS: Of the 316 articles identified, three randomized clinical trials met 
the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of liver tissue iron concentration (LIC) 
showed that iron overload was not significantly higher in the DFX group compared 
with DFO group (WMD, -1.61 mg Fe/g dw (95% CI -4.42 to 1.21). However, iron 
overload as measured by serum ferritin was significantly lower in DFO compared 
with DFX group (WMD, 278.13 µg/l (95% CI 36.69 to 519.57). Although 
meta-analysis was not performed on myocardial iron concentration due to 
incomplete data, the original report found no significant difference between DFX 
and DFO.
CONCLUSION: While limited by the number of studies included in this 
meta-analysis, overall, the results tend to show that DFX was as effective as 
DFO in managing iron overload in patients with SCA."
1672,"BACKGROUND: Humans with inactivating mutations in growth hormone receptor (GHR) 
have lower rates of cancer, including prostate cancer. Similarly, mice with 
inactivating Ghr mutations are protected from prostatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia in the C3(1)/TAg prostate cancer model. However, gaps in clinical 
relevance in those models persist. The current study addresses these gaps and 
the ongoing role of Ghr in prostate cancer using loss-of-function and 
gain-of-function models.
METHODS: Conditional Ghr inactivation was achieved in the C3(1)/TAg model by 
employing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre and a prostate-specific Cre. In parallel, a 
transgenic GH antagonist was also used. Pathology, proliferation, and gene 
expression of 6-month old mouse prostates were assessed. Analysis of The Cancer 
Genome Atlas data was conducted to identify GHR overexpression in a subset of 
human prostate cancers. Ghr overexpression was modeled in PTEN-P2 and TRAMP-C2 
mouse prostate cancer cells using stable transfectants. The growth, 
proliferation, and gene expression effects of Ghr overexpression was assessed in 
vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Loss-of-function for Ghr globally or in prostatic epithelial cells 
reduced proliferation and stratification of the prostatic epithelium in the 
C3(1)/TAg model. Genes and gene sets involved in the immune system and 
tumorigenesis, for example, were dysregulated upon global Ghr disruption. 
Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed higher GHR expression in human 
prostate cancers with ERG-fusion genes or ETV1-fusion genes. Modeling the GHR 
overexpression observed in these human prostate cancers by overexpressing Ghr in 
mouse prostate cancer cells with mutant Pten or T-antigen driver genes increased 
proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Ghr overexpression 
regulated the expression of multiple genes oppositely to Ghr loss-of-function 
models.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss-of-function and gain-of-function Ghr models, including 
prostatic epithelial cell specific alterations in Ghr, altered proliferation, 
and gene expression. These data suggest that changes in GHR activity in human 
prostatic epithelial cells play a role in proliferation and gene regulation in 
prostate cancer, suggesting the potential for disrupting GH signaling, for 
example by the FDA approved GH antagonist pegvisomant, may be beneficial in 
treating prostate cancer."
1673,"The ATP-Binding Cassette G2 (ABCG2) is an efflux transporter expressed in the 
apical membrane of cells from a large number of tissues, directly affecting 
bioavailability, tissue accumulation and secretion into milk of both xenobiotics 
and endogenous compounds. The aim of this work was to characterize the role of 
ABCG2 in the systemic distribution and secretion into milk of melatonin and its 
main metabolites, 6-hydroxymelatonin and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. For this purpose, 
we first showed that these three molecules are transported by this transporter 
using in vitro transepithelial assays with MDCK-II polarized cells transduced 
with different species variants of ABCG2. Secondly, we tested the in vivo effect 
of murine Abcg2 in the systemic distribution of melatonin and its metabolites 
using wild-type and Abcg2-/- mice. Our results show that after oral 
administration of melatonin, the plasma concentration of melatonin metabolites 
in Abcg2-/- mice was between 1.5 and 6-fold higher compared to the wild-type 
mice. We also evaluated in these animals differences in tissue accumulation of 
melatonin metabolites. The most relevant differences between both types of mice 
were found for small intestine and kidney (>6-fold increase for 
6-sulfatoxymelatonin in Abcg2-/- mice). Finally, melatonin secretion into milk 
was also affected by the murine Abcg2 transporter, with a 2-fold higher milk 
concentration in wild-type compared with Abcg2-/- lactating female mice. In 
addition, melatonin metabolites showed a higher milk-to-plasma ratio in 
wild-type mice. Overall, our results show that the ABCG2 transporter plays a 
critical role in the biodistribution of melatonin and its main metabolites, 
thereby potentially affecting their biological and therapeutic activity. This

1674,"Clear cell papillary renal cell tumor (CCPRCT) is a distinct clinical entity 
with characteristic pathological features and non-aggressive clinical behavior. 
Diagnostically challenging cases present when there are immunomorphological 
findings of CCPRCT associated with heterogeneous morphologies, aggressive 
histological features, and advanced pathological stages-so-called CCPRCT-like 
tumors. In this report, we describe a heterogeneous, multifocal renal tumor with 
immunomorphological characteristics of CCPRCT but with associated aggressive 
features such as sarcomatoid and necrotic areas, perirenal and sinus fat 
involvement, and most notably, lymph node metastasis composed entirely of 
classic CCPRCT morphology and immunophenotype. Immunohistochemical and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization studies did not support a translocation renal 
cell carcinoma. Molecular analyses did not identify common mutations or 
chromosomal abnormalities seen in clear cell renal cell carcinoma or 
ELOC-mutated renal cell carcinoma. This case highlights that rare renal cell 
tumors remain difficult to classify and the distinction between CCPRCT and 
CCPRCT-like tumors remains to be better defined."
1675,"Glucose oxidase (GOD) has a wide range of applications in biosensing and cancer 
treatment as a result of its unique biocatalytic properties. More importantly, 
GOD could synergistically enhance the cancer therapeutic effect when combined 
with other cancer therapeutic strategies. However, the interaction of GOD with a 
cancer therapeutic agent has not been well-studied. Herein, the thermodynamic 
properties of the interaction between black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) and 
GOD were systematically elucidated, and the dose-dependent conformational and 
enzymatic activity changes of BPQDs on GOD were quantitatively and qualitatively 
analyzed. The results indicated that the stoichiometric ratio of BPQDs to GOD 
was approximately 1:1. In particular, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular 
dichroism spectra, and Fourier transform infrared spectra have synergistically 
studied the changes in secondary and tertiary conformations of GOD induced by 
BPQDs. Higher doses of BPQDs resulted in a loose structure of GOD but still 
maintained the native conformation and preserved effective enzymatic activity, 
effectively catalyzing the production of H2O2 from glucose in a cell. The 
interaction mechanism between BPQDs and GOD provides a theoretical basis for the 
design of GOD-based multimodal synergistic cancer therapy and its clinical 
translation analysis."
1676,"We intended to identify favourable metabolite(s) and pharmacological 
mechanism(s) of gut microbiota (GM) for liver regeneration (LR) through network 
pharmacology. We utilized the gutMGene database to obtain metabolites of GM, and 
targets associated with metabolites as well as LR-related targets were 
identified using public databases. Furthermore, we performed a molecular docking 
assay on the active metabolite(s) and target(s) to verify the network 
pharmacological concept. We mined a total of 208 metabolites in the gutMGene 
database and selected 668 targets from the SEA (1,256 targets) and STP (947 
targets) databases. Finally, 13 targets were identified between 61 targets and 
the gutMGene database (243 targets). Protein-protein interaction network 
analysis showed that AKT1 is a hub target correlated with 12 additional targets. 
In this study, we describe the potential microbe from the microbiota (E. coli), 
chemokine signalling pathway, AKT1 and myricetin that accelerate LR, providing 
scientific evidence for further clinical trials."
1677,"Tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research 
interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco-friendly 
features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene 
derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four 
well-defined regioisomers (trans-2, trans-3, trans-4 and e) of 
diethylmalonate-C60 bisadduct are isolated and well-characterized. The 
well-defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real 
structure-dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the 
chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but 
also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial 
contacts. As a result, the devices with trans-2, trans-3, trans-4, and e as ETLs 
yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59% and 10.55%, respectively, which are 
higher than that of the as-prepared DCBA-based (10.28%) device. Notably, the 
trans-3-based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, 
representing one of the best-performing TPSCs. This article is protected by

1678,"Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is treated as a homogeneous disease, although the 
expression of NEUROD1, ASCL1, POU2F3, and YAP1 identifies distinct molecular 
subtypes. The MYC oncogene, amplified in SCLC, was recently shown to act as a 
lineage-specific factor to associate subtypes with histological classes. Indeed, 
MYC-driven SCLCs show a distinct metabolic profile and drug sensitivity. To 
disentangle their molecular features, we focused on the co-amplified PVT1, 
frequently overexpressed and originating circular (circRNA) and chimeric RNAs. 
We analyzed hsa_circ_0001821 (circPVT1) and PVT1/AKT3 (chimPVT1) as examples of 
such transcripts, respectively, to unveil their tumorigenic contribution to 
SCLC. In detail, circPVT1 activated a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic 
program when over-expressed in lung cells, and knockdown of chimPVT1 induced a 
decrease in cell growth and an increase of apoptosis in SCLC in vitro. Moreover, 
the investigated PVT1 transcripts underlined a functional connection between MYC 
and YAP1/POU2F3, suggesting that they contribute to the transcriptional 
landscape associated with MYC amplification. In conclusion, we have uncovered a 
functional role of circular and chimeric PVT1 transcripts in SCLC; these 
entities may prove useful as novel biomarkers in MYC-amplified tumors. This

1679,"Since the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as crucial regulators of 
immune tolerance against self-antigens, these cells have become a promising tool 
for the induction of donor-specific tolerance in transplantation medicine. The 
therapeutic potential of increasing in vivo Treg numbers for a favorable Treg to 
Teff cell ratio has already been demonstrated in several sophisticated 
pre-clinical models and clinical pilot trials. In addition to improving cell 
quantity, enhancing Treg function utilizing engineering techniques led to 
encouraging results in models of autoimmunity and transplantation. Here we aim 
to discuss the most promising approaches for Treg-enhancing therapies, starting 
with adoptive transfer approaches and ex vivo expansion cultures (polyclonal vs. 
antigen-specific), followed by selective in vivo stimulation methods. 
Furthermore, we address next generation concepts for Treg function enhancement 
(CARs, TRUCKs, BARs) as well as the advantages and caveats inherit to each 
approach. Finally, this review will discuss the clinical experience with Treg 
therapy in ongoing and already published clinical trials, however, data on 
long-term results and efficacy is still very limited and many questions that 
might complicate clinical translation remain open. Here, we discuss the hurdles 
for clinical translation and elaborate on current Treg based therapeutic options 
as well as their potencies for improving long-term graft survival in 
transplantation."
1680,"We present a new strategy for self-adjuvanting vaccine development that has 
different types of covalently-linked immunostimulants as the carrier molecule. 
Using Tn antigen as the model, a three-component vaccine (MPLA-Tn-KRN7000) 
containing the TLR4 ligand MPLA and the iNKT cell agonist KRN7000 was designed 
and synthesized. This expands fully synthetic self-adjuvanting vaccine studies 
that use a single carrier to one with two different types of carriers. The 
corresponding two-component conjugate vaccines Tn-MPLA, Tn-KRN7000 and Tn-CRM197 
were also synthesized, as controls. The immunological evaluation found that 
MPLA-Tn-KRN7000 elicits robust Tn-specific and T cell-dependent immunity. The 
antibodies specifically recognized, bound to and exhibited complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity against Tn-positive cancer cells. In addition, MPLA-Tn-KRN7000 
increased the survival rate and survival time of tumor-challenged mice, and 
surviving mice reject further tumor attacks without any additional treatment. 
Compared to the glycoprotein vaccine Tn-CRM197, the two-component conjugate 
vaccines, Tn-MPLA and Tn-KRN7000, and the physical mixture of Tn-MPLA and 
Tn-KRN7000, MPLA-Tn-KRN7000 showed the most effect at combating tumor cells both 
in vitro and in vivo. The comparison of immunological studies in wild-type and 
TLR4 knockout mice, along with the test of binding affinity to CD1d protein 
suggests that the covalently linked MPLA-KRN7000 immunostimulant induces a 
synergistic activation of TLR4 and iNKT cell that improves the immunogenicity of 
Tn. This work demonstrates that MPLA-Tn-KRN7000 has the potential to be a 
vaccine candidate and provides a new direction for fully synthetic vaccine 
design."
1681,"Chemoresistance remains a major obstacle to successful treatment of triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC). Identification of druggable vulnerabilities is an 
important aim for TNBC therapy. Here, we report that SERCA2 expression 
correlates with TNBC progression in human patients, which promotes TNBC cell 
proliferation, migration and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, SERCA2 interacts 
with LC3B via LIR motif, facilitating WIPI2-independent autophagosome formation 
to induce autophagy. Autophagy-mediated SERCA2 degradation induces SERCA2 
transactivation through a Ca2+/CaMKK/CREB-1 feedback. Moreover, we found that 
SERCA2-targeting small molecule RL71 enhances SERCA2-LC3B interaction and 
induces excessive autophagic cell death. The increase in SERCA2 expression 
predisposes TNBC cells to RL71-induced autophagic cell death in vitro and 
in vivo. This study elucidates a mechanism by which TNBC cells maintain their 
high autophagy activity to induce chemoresistance, and suggests increased SERCA2 
expression as a druggable vulnerability for TNBC."
1682,"We report the inverse association between the expression of androgen receptor 
(AR) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) in a cohort of patients with metastatic 
castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We also discovered that AR 
represses the IL-1β gene by binding an androgen response element (ARE) half-site 
located within the promoter, which explains the IL-1β expression in AR-negative 
(ARNEG) cancer cells. Consistently, androgen-depletion or AR-pathway inhibitors 
(ARIs) de-repressed IL-1β in ARPOS cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. The 
AR transcriptional repression is sustained by histone de-acetylation at the 
H3K27 mark in the IL-1β promoter. Notably, patients' data suggest that DNA 
methylation prevents IL-1β expression, even if the AR-signaling axis is 
inactive. Our previous studies show that secreted IL-1β supports metastatic 
progression in mice by altering the transcriptome of tumor-associated bone 
stroma. Thus, in prostate cancer patients harboring ARNEG tumor cells or treated 
with ADT/ARIs, and with the IL-1β gene unmethylated, IL-1β could condition the 
metastatic microenvironment to sustain disease progression."
1683,"Circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and lipid mediators were 
extracted from human red blood cells and quantified using liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method encompassed 13 
different PUFAs and lipid mediators, however, due to instrument capability only 
five were confidently quantified (EPA, ALA, AA, DHA, and LA). The extraction 
focused on free polyunsaturated fatty acids since they have a strong correlation 
with health in humans. The study design was a secondary analysis of the OPPERA-2 
study of chronic overlapping pain conditions in adults. The data included are: 
a) raw LC-MS/MS data (.raw); b) processed data (.xlsx) including chromatographic 
peak area for each compound and a concentration (ng/mL) based on external 
calibration with internal standardization using pure analytical grade standards 
and heavy-isotope labeled internal standards; c) study participant demographics 
and phenotypes (.xlsx). This dataset consisting of circulating PUFA quantities 
measured in 605 humans has been made publicly available for analysis and

1684,"A 66-year-old woman presented to a tertiary referral centre with a diagnosis of 
limbal stem cell deficiency secondary to multiple treatments for primary 
acquired melanosis (PAM) by her referring ophthalmologists. She was known with 
primary acquired melanosis with severe atypia of the right eye which had been 
treated with several excisions, cryotherapy and topical chemotherapy. She had 
PAM over 360° of alternating intensity. Throughout the follow-up period, she 
developed a cataract and subsequent a retinal detachment for which she underwent 
a phacovitrectomy on the right eye. There was no nodule present nor did the 
routine lymph nodes inspection show any enlargement. No abnormalities were 
observed on intranasal examination. Seven years after the last excision, a 
metastasis to the spine (Th3) was diagnosed. A complete systemic work-up and a 
pathological examination did not show any alternative primary melanoma in the 
body. The original histological material was reviewed again by an 
ophthalmopathologist. After a new round of stains and immunohistochemistry, the 
presence of atypical melanocytes in both the epithelium and stroma were found in 
a scar region leading to a renewed conclusion that the PAM in question was 
actually the primary melanoma."
1685,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrate that titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 
NPs) are an effective source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic 
therapy and radionuclide stimulated dynamic therapy (RaST). Unfortunately 
tracking the in vivo distribution of TiO2 NPs noninvasively remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: Given the use of gadolinium (Gd) chelates as effective contrast 
agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study aims to (1) develop 
hybrid TiO2-Gd NPs that exhibit high relaxivity for tracking the NPs without 
loss of ROS generating capacity; and (2) establish a simple colorimetric assay 
for quantifying Gd loading and stability.
METHODS: A chelate-free, heat-induced method was used to load Gd onto TiO2 NPs, 
which was coated with transferrin (Tf). A sensitive colorimetric assay and 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to determine Gd 
loading and stability of the TiO2-Gd-Tf NPs. Measurement of the relaxivity was 
performed on a 1.4 T relaxometer and a 4.7 T small animal magnetic resonance 
scanner to estimate the effects of magnetic field strength. ROS was quantified 
by activated dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescence. Cell uptake of 
the NPs and RaST were monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Both 3 T and 4.7 T 
scanners were used to image the in vivo distribution of intravenously injected 
NPs in tumor-bearing mice.
RESULTS: A simple colorimetric assay accurately determined both the loading and 
stability of the NPs compared with the expensive and complex ICP-MS method. 
Coating of the TiO2-Gd NPs with Tf stabilized the nanoconstruct and minimized 
aggregation. The TiO2-Gd-Tf maintained ROS-generating capability without 
inducing cell death at a wide range of concentrations but induced significant 
cell death under RaST conditions in the presence of F-18 radiolabeled 
2-fluorodeoxyglucose. The longitudinal (r1 = 10.43 mM-1s-1) and transverse (r2 = 
13.43 mM-1s-1) relaxivity of TiO2-Gd-Tf NPs were about twice and thrice, 
respectively, those of clinically used Gd contrast agent (Gd-DTPA; r1 = 3.77 
mM-1s-1 and r2 = 5.51 mM-1s-1) at 1.4 T. While the r1 (8.13 mM-1s-1) reduced to 
about twice that of Gd-DTPA (4.89 mM-1s-1) at 4.7 T, the corresponding r2 (87.15 
mM-1s-1) increased by a factor 22.6 compared to Gd-DTPA (r2 = 3.85). MRI of 
tumor-bearing mice injected with TiO2-Gd-Tf NPs tracked the NPs distribution and 
accumulation in tumors.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that Arsenazo III colorimetric assay can 
substitute ICP-MS for determining the loading and stability of Gd-doped TiO2 
NPs. The new nanoconstruct enabled RaST effect in cells, exhibited high 
relaxivity, and enhanced MRI contrast in tumors in vivo, paving the way for in 
vivo MRI-guided RaST."

1688,"BACKGROUND: Recently, the in vitro blood brain barrier (BBB) models derived from 
human pluripotent stem cells have been given extensive attention in therapeutics 
due to the implications it has with the health of the central nervous system. It 
is essential to create an accurate BBB model in vitro in order to better 
understand the properties of the BBB and how it can respond to inflammatory 
stimulation and be passed by targeted or non-targeted cell therapeutics, more 
specifically extracellular vesicles.
METHODS: Brain-specific pericytes (iPCs) were differentiated from iPSK3 cells 
using dual SMAD signaling inhibitors and Wnt activation plus fibroblast growth 
factor 2 (FGF-2). The derived cells were characterized by immunostaining, flow 
cytometry and RT-PCR. In parallel, blood vessels organoids were derived using 
Wnt activation, BMP4, FGF2, VEGF and SB431542. The organoids were replated and 
treated with retinoic acid to enhance the blood brain barrier (BBB) features in 
the differentiated brain endothelial cells (iECs). Co-culture was performed for 
the iPCs and iECs in transwell system and 3-D microfluidics channels.
RESULTS: The derived iPCs expressed common markers PDGFRb and NG2, as well as 
brain-specific genes FOXF2, ABCC9, KCNJ8, and ZIC1. The derived iECs expressed 
common endothelial cell markers CD31, VE-cadherin, as well as BBB-associated 
genes BRCP, GLUT-1, PGP, ABCC1, OCLN, SLC2A1. The co-culture of the two cell 
types responded to the stimulation of amyloid β42 oligomers by the upregulation 
of expression of TNFa, IL6, NFKB, Casp3, SOD2 and TP53. The co-culture also 
showed the property of trans-endothelial electrical resistance. The 
proof-of-concept vascularization strategy was demonstrated in a 3-D 
microfluidics-based device.
CONCLUSION: The derived iPCs and iECs have brain-specific properties and the 
co-culture of iPCs and iECs provides an in vitro BBB model that show 
inflammatory response. This study has significance in establishing 
micro-physiological systems for neurological disease modeling and drug 
screening."

1690,"Background. This experimental study sought to assess the biocompatibility of 
Resil, an experimental epoxy resin-based sealer, in comparison with AH26 and 
AH-Plus sealers in rats. Methods. Twelve male Wistar rats weighing 400 to 500 
grams were evaluated in this experimental study. Four polyethylene tubes 
containing Resil, AH-Plus, AH26 sealers, and an empty tube were implanted 
subcutaneously in rats. The degree of inflammation, type of inflammatory cells 
present, foreign body reaction, quality of connective tissue, and presence of 
fibrotic capsule were evaluated histopathologically at 7 and 30 days after 
implanting the tubes to assess the biocompatibility of sealers. Data were 
analyzed using the Chi-square test. Results. At 7 days, the degree of 
inflammation in Resil group was almost similar to AH26 group, and 66.7% of rats 
showed moderate inflammation. AH-Plus group showed less inflammation than Resil 
and AH26 (50% of rats showed low degree of inflammation), At 30 days, the 
inflammatory status of all groups was the same, and 83.3% of rats showed very 
low degree of inflammation. The inflammatory response during the experiment 
decreased from day 7 to day 30 in all groups. The neutrophil count (P=0.00), 
fibrotic capsule (P=0.01) and the amount of granulation tissue (P=0.05) 
significantly decreased from day 7 to day 30 in Resil group. Conclusion. Resil 
sealer showed appropriate biocompatibility at 7 and 30 days after subcutaneous 
implantation in rats, comparable to AH26 and AH-Plus. Clinical studies are 
required to confirm these results."

1692,"Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are a subclass of glycolipids made of a glycan and a 
ceramide that, in turn, is composed of a sphingoid base moiety and a fatty acyl 
group. GSLs represent the vast majority of glycolipids in eukaryotes, and as an 
essential component of the cell membrane, they play an important role in many 
biological and pathological processes. Therefore, they are useful targets for 
the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods for human diseases. 
Since sphingosine was first described by J. L. Thudichum in 1884, several 
hundred GSL species, not including their diverse lipid forms that can further 
amplify the number of individual GSLs by many folds, have been isolated from 
natural sources and structurally characterized. This review tries to provide a 
comprehensive survey of the major GSL species, especially those with distinct 
glycan structures and modification patterns, and the ceramides with unique 
modifications of the lipid chains, that have been discovered to date. In 
particular, this review is focused on GSLs from eukaryotic species. This review 
has listed 251 GSL glycans with different linkages, 127 glycans with unique

1693,"INTRODUCTION: Brain metastases (BM) severely affect the prognosis and quality of 
life of patients with NSCLC. Recently, molecularly targeted agents were found to 
have promising activity against BM in patients with NSCLC whose primary tumors 
carry ""druggable"" mutations. Nevertheless, it remains critical to identify 
specific pathogenic alterations that drive NSCLC-BM and that can provide novel 
and more effective therapeutic targets.
METHODS: To identify potentially targetable pathogenic alterations in NSCLC-BM, 
we profiled somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) in 51 matched pairs of 
primary NSCLC and BM samples from 33 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 18 
patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, we performed 
multiregion copy number profiling on 15 BM samples and whole-exome sequencing on 
40 of 51 NSCLC-BM pairs.
RESULTS: BM consistently had a higher burden of SCNAs compared with the matched 
primary tumors, and SCNAs were typically homogeneously distributed within BM, 
suggesting BM do not undergo extensive evolution once formed. By comparing focal 
SCNAs in matched NSCLC-BM pairs, we identified putative BM-driving alterations 
affecting multiple cancer genes, including several potentially targetable 
alterations in genes such as CDK12, DDR2, ERBB2, and NTRK1, which we validated 
in an independent cohort of 84 BM samples. Finally, we identified putative 
pathogenic alterations in multiple cancer genes, including genes involved in 
epigenome editing and 3D genome organization, such as EP300, CTCF, and STAG2, 
which we validated by targeted sequencing of an independent cohort of 115 BM 
samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the most comprehensive genomic 
characterization of NSCLC-BM available to date, paving the way to functional 
studies aimed at assessing the potential of the identified pathogenic 
alterations as clinical biomarkers and targets."
1694,"Background: Fibrous tumors are rare tumors of mesenchymal origin arising in the 
serosal surfaces within the body. Although commonly seen in adults, solitary 
fibrous tumors rarely occur in children. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry 
are the methods of choice for diagnosing solitary fibrous tumors. Case Report: A 
2-year-old male presented with a swelling over the umbilicus for the prior 8 
months. The umbilical mass was excised and sent for histopathologic examination. 
The skin-covered greyish soft tissue mass measured 6 × 5.5 × 4.5 cm, and the cut 
surface showed a homogenous greyish growth. On microscopic examination, a 
predominantly well-circumscribed encapsulated tumor was noted, with spindle 
shaped cells arranged in a haphazard manner and ectatic vascular channels. The 
cells were immunoreactive for CD34 and signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 6 (STAT6) and negative for smooth muscle actin, desmin, myogenin, 
MyoD1, CD99, epithelial membrane antigen, and beta-catenin. Conclusion: The aim 
of this case is to make clinicians aware of the umbilicus as a rare site of 
solitary fibrous tumor in children and the diagnostic importance of STAT6."
1695,"Background: Osteopetrosis includes a variety of rare inherited skeletal 
disorders characterized by increased bone density and thickness. It has 
different clinical forms, including infantile autosomal recessive, intermediate 
autosomal recessive, and late-onset autosomal dominant forms. Intermediate 
autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (IARO) displays high variability. Case Report: 
A 10-year-old male presented to our pediatrics emergency department with 
abdominal distension, low-grade fever, and swelling of the right maxilla with 
associated discharge. His local physician had treated the lesion with drainage 
and aspiration of pus without improvement. Examination revealed pallor, 
hepatosplenomegaly, poor dentition, and dental caries. Eye examination showed 
reduced visual acuity, absent color vision, nystagmus, and bilateral optic nerve 
atrophy. Laboratory investigations showed anemia and thrombocytopenia. 
Radiography yielded classic features of osteopetrosis. Detailed intraoral 
examination revealed an area of exposed necrotic bone in the alveolar region of 
the right maxilla, leading to a diagnosis of IARO with underlying osteomyelitis. 
The intraoral wound was treated with bismuth iodoform paraffin paste dressing, 
and the infection was treated with antibiotics. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were 
managed supportively by transfusion of packed red blood cells and platelets. 
Conclusion: IARO commonly presents with multiple fractures, so the absence of 
fractures in our patient was unusual. Studies evaluating the intermediate 
variant are meager; hence, documenting its various presentations is essential to 
aid physicians in making early diagnoses. Osteomyelitis of the jaws is a feared 
complication in these patients. Therefore, practitioners need to be cautious of 
infections of dental origin."
1696,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) provokes an early 
injury response, partially represented by dynamic changes in inflammatory 
markers. TAVR greatly benefits the elderly and we aimed to determine whether 
increased inflammatory markers post-TAVR in octagenerians were different than 
their younger counterparts and whether it was associated with adverse clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent 
transfemoral TAVR from January 2010 to December 2021 were enrolled. Total white 
blood cells (WBC) count and subpopulation dynamics were evaluated.
RESULTS: Five-hundred and seven patients were finally included in the study, 65% 
of these patients were 80 or more years old (54% female, median age 84 [82-87]) 
years, with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. In patients aged above 80 years 
(patients ≥ 80), we noticed significant kinetic changes in the WBC and their 
differential cellular subpopulations (P < 0.0001) between admission and early 
days post-procedure. This was evident by a significant increase in total WBC 
(median 7.1 to 9.4) and absolute neutrophil count (median 4.7 to 7.4), 
neutrophil-lymphocyte (NL) ratio (median 2.82 to 7.21), and a meaningful 
decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (median 1.5 to 1.0). Implantation of 
self-expandable valves (SEVs) was associated with a more pronounced inflammatory 
response than balloon-expandable valves (BEVs). Higher WBC and neutrophil counts 
were associated with higher mortality and major vascular complications at 30 
days, in addition, higher neutrophil counts and NL ratios were found to be 
correlated to arrhythmia at 30 days with P values of 0.04 and 0.028, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first description of a differential age-related 
inflammatory response in patients after TAVR, which shows an association between 
inflammatory markers post procedure and clinical outcome. Nevertheless, survival 
rates were similar in the elderly population and in younger patients, despite 
the presence of comorbid conditions."
1697,"BACKGROUND: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a compensated response to 
various stimuli and is considered a key risk factor for heart failure. 
7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is a flavonoid derivative that acts as a 
small-molecule brain-derived neurotrophic factor mimetic. The present study 
aimed to explore the potential role of 7,8-DHF in cardiac hypertrophy.
METHODS: Kunming mice and H9c2 cells were exposed to transverse aortic 
constriction or isoproterenol (ISO) with or without 7,8-DHF, respectively. 
F-actin staining was performed to calculate the cell area. Transcriptional 
levels of hypertrophic markers, including ANP, BNP, and β-MHC, were detected. 
Echocardiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and transmission electron 
microscopy were used to examine the cardiac function, histology, and 
ultrastructure of ventricles. Protein levels of mitochondria-related factors, 
such as adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), were detected.
RESULTS: 7,8-DHF inhibited compensated and decompensated cardiac hypertrophy, 
diminished the cross-sectional area, and alleviated the mitochondrial disorders 
of cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, 7,8-DHF reduced the cell size and repressed the 
mRNA levels of the hypertrophic markers of ISO-treated cardiomyocytes. In 
addition, 7,8-DHF activated AMPK and PGC-1α signals without affecting the 
protein levels of mitochondrial dynamics-related molecules. The effects of 
7,8-DHF were eliminanted by Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 7,8-DHF inhibited cardiac hypertrophy 
and mitochondrial dysfunction by activating AMPK signaling, providing a 
potential agent for the treatment of pathological cardiac hypertrophy."
1698,"Red blood cells (RBCs) clump together under low flow conditions in a process 
called RBC aggregation, which can alter RBC perfusion in a microvascular 
network. As elevated RBC aggregation is commonly associated with cardiovascular 
and inflammatory diseases, a better understanding of aggregation is essential. 
Unlike RBC aggregation in polymer solutions which can be well explained by 
polymer depletion theory, plasma-mediated RBC aggregation has features that best 
match explanations with cross-bridging mechanisms. Previous studies have 
demonstrated the dominant role of fibrinogen (Fg) in promoting aggregate 
formation and recent cell-force spectroscopy (CFS) experiments on interacting 
RBC doublets in plasma have reported an inverse relationship between 
disaggregation force and the adhesive contact area between RBCs. This has led 
investigators to revisit the hypothesis of inter-RBC cross-bridging which 
involves cross-bridge migration under interfacial tension during the forced 
disaggregation of RBC aggregates. In this study, we developed the cross-bridge 
migration model (CBMM) in plasma that mechanistically represents the migrating 
cross-bridge hypothesis. Transport of mobile Fg cross-bridges (mFg) was 
calculated using a convection-diffusion transport equation with our novel 
introduction of convective cross-bridge drift that arises due to intercellular 
friction. By parametrically transforming the diffusivity of mFg in the CBMM, we 
were able to match experimental observations of both RBC doublet formation 
kinematics and RBC doublet disaggregation forces under optical tweezers tension. 
We found that non-specific cross-bridging promotes spontaneous growth of 
adhesion area between RBC doublets whereas specific cross-bridging tends to 
prevent adhesion area growth. Our CBMM was also able to correlate Fg 
concentration shifts from healthy population blood plasma to SLE (lupus) 
condition blood plasma with the observed increase in doublet disaggregation 
forces for the RBC doublets in SLE plasma."
1699,"Publisher: BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 virus that has been causing a severe pandemic worldwide for more than 
2 years, is characterized by a high heterogeneity of clinical presentations and 
evolution and, particularly, by a varying severity of respiratory involvement. 
This study aimed to analyze the diversity and taxonomic composition of the gut 
microbiota at hospital admission, in order to evaluate its association with 
COVID-19 outcome. In particular, the association between gut microbiota and a 
combination of several clinical covariates was analyzed in order to characterize 
the bacterial signature associate to mild or severe symptoms during the 
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: V3–V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 
97 rectal swabs from a retrospective cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients 
was employed to study the gut microbiota composition. Patients were divided in 
two groups according to their outcome considering the respiratory supports they 
needed during hospital stay: (i) group “mild,” including 47 patients with a good 
prognosis and (ii) group “severe,” including 50 patients who experienced a more 
severe disease due to severe respiratory distress that required non-invasive or 
invasive ventilation. Identification of the clusters of bacterial population 
between patients with mild or severe outcome was assessed by PEnalized LOgistic 
Regression Analysis (PELORA).
RESULTS: Although no changes for Chao1 and Shannon index were observed between 
the two groups a significant greater proportion of Campylobacterota and 
Actinobacteriota at phylum level was found in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 
infection who developed a more severe disease characterized by respiratory 
distress requiring invasive or non-invasive ventilation. Clusters have been 
identified with a useful early potential prognostic marker of the disease 
evolution.
DISCUSSION: Microorganisms residing within the gut of the patients at hospital 
admission, were able to significantly discriminate the clinical evolution of 
COVID-19 patients, in particular who will develop mild or severe respiratory 
involvement. Our data show that patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 with mild or 
severe symptoms display different gut microbiota profiles which can be exploited 
as potential prognostic biomarkers paving also the way to new integrative 
therapeutic approaches."
1700,"Class A rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are by far the 
largest class of GPCRs, and are integral membrane proteins that are used by 
various cells to convert extracellular signals into intracellular responses. 
Initially, class A GPCRs were believed to function as monomers, but a growing 
body of evidence has emerged to suggest that these receptors can function as 
homo- and heterodimers, and undergo functional crosstalk to influence the 
actions of agonists or antagonists acting at each receptor. This review will 
focus on the angiotensin type 1 (AT1 ) and type 2 (AT2 ) receptors, as well as 
relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1); which have their unique 
characteristics, but have been demonstrated to undergo some level of interaction 
when appropriately co-expressed, that influences the function of each receptor. 
In particular, this receptor functional crosstalk will be discussed in the 
context of fibrosis, the tissue scarring that results from a failed 
wound-healing response to injury, and which is a hallmark of chronic disease and 
related organ dysfunction."
1701,"COVID-19 appeared in December 2019, needing efforts of science. Besides, a range 
of light therapies (PDT, Ultraviolet UV, Laser) has shown scientific 
alternatives to conventional decontamination therapies. METHODS: Investigating 
the efficacy of light-based therapies for environment decontamination against 
SARS-CoV2, a PRISMA systematic review of Phototherapies against SARS-CoV or 
MERS-CoV species discussing changes in viral RT-PCR was done. After searching 
MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS we have found studies about cell cultures 
irradiation (18), blood components irradiation (10), N95 masks decontamination 
(03), inanimate surface decontamination (03), aerosols decontamination (03), 
hospital rooms irradiation (01) with PDT, LED, and UV therapy. The best quality 
results showed an effective low time and dose UV irradiation for environments 
and inanimate surfaces without human persons as long as the devices have safety 
elements dependent on the surfaces, viral charge, humidity, radiant exposure. To 
interpersonal contamination in humans, PDT or LED therapy seems very promising 
and are encouraged."
1702,"Species of the tribe Delphinieae (Ranunculaceae) have long been the focus of 
morphological, ecological and evolutionary studies due to their highly 
specialized, nearly zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetrical) spiral flowers with 
nested petal and sepal spurs and reduced petals. The mechanisms underlying the 
development and evolution of Delphinieae flowers, however, remain unclear. Here, 
by conducting extensive phylogenetic, comparative transcriptomic, expression, 
and functional studies, we clarified the evolutionary histories, expression 
patterns, and functions of floral organ identity and symmetry genes in 
Delphinieae. We found that duplication and/or diversification of APETALA3-3 
(AP3-3), AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6), CYCLOIDEA (CYC) and DIVARICATA (DIV) lineage 
genes was tightly associated with the origination of Delphinieae flowers. 
Specifically, an AGL6-lineage member (such as the Delphinium ajacis AGL6-1a) 
represses sepal spur formation and petal development in the lateral and ventral 
parts of the flower while determining petal identity redundantly with AGL6-1b. 
By contrast, two CYC2-like genes, CYC2b and CYC2a, define the dorsal and 
lateral-ventral identities of the flower, respectively, and form complex 
regulatory links with AP3-3, AGL6-1a and DIV1. Therefore, duplication and 
diversification of floral symmetry genes, as well as co-option of the duplicated 
copies into the pre-existing floral regulatory network, have been key for the 
origin of Delphinieae flowers."
1703,"Naturally-derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing 
nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery 
applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds 
to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds 
with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue 
regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical sized bone defects 
cannot heal on its own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in 
scaffold-mediated healing of cranial bone defects remain largely unknown. Here 
we report mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)-coated microribbon (μRB) 
scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting 
immunomodulation. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses were used to confirm 
successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. 
We demonstrate MSCM coating promotes Mφ polarization towards regenerative 
phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell 
differentiation in vitro and in vivo. MSCM primed with pro-inflammatory 
cytokines enhances regenerative immune response and promotes MSC osteogenesis. 
When combined with a low dosage of BMP-2, primed MSCM coating further 
accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results 
establish cell membrane-coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for 
treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be 
broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration 
of multiple tissue types. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1704,"Approximately 50-55% of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) patients 
have MYC oncogenic pathway activation. As MYC is not directly targetable, we 
have analyzed molecular pathways enriched in MYC-high HGSOC tumors to identify 
potential therapeutic targets. Here, we report that MYC-high HGSOC tumors show 
enrichment in genes controlled by NRF2, antioxidant signaling pathway along with 
increased thioredoxin redox activity. Treatment of MYC-high HGSOC tumors cells 
with FDA-approved thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) inhibitor auranofin resulted 
in significant growth suppression and apoptosis in MYC-high HGSOC cells in 
vitro, and also significantly reduced tumor growth in a MYC-high HGSOC 
patient-derived tumor xenograft. We found that auranofin treatment inhibited 
glycolysis in MYC-high cells via oxidation-induced GAPDH inhibition. 
Interestingly, in response to auranofin-induced glycolysis inhibition, MYC-high 
HGSOC cells switched to glutamine metabolism for survival. Depletion of 
glutamine with either glutamine starvation or glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor 
CB-839 exerted synergistic anti-tumor activity with auranofin in HGSOC cells and 
OVCAR-8 cell line xenograft. These findings suggest that applying a combined 
therapy of GLS1 inhibitor and TrxR1 inhibitor could effectively treat MYC-high 
HGSOC patients."
1705,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interleukin-23 (IL-23) and its receptor are important 
drug targets for the treatment of auto-inflammatory diseases. IL-23 binds to a 
receptor complex composed of two single transmembrane spanning proteins IL23R 
and IL12Rβ1. In this study we aimed to gain further understanding of how ligand 
binding induces signalling of IL-23 receptor complexes using the proximity-based 
techniques of NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT) and Bioluminescence Resonance 
Energy Transfer (BRET).
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: To monitor the formation of IL-23 receptor complexes, we 
developed a split luciferase (NanoBiT) assay whereby heteromerization of 
receptor subunits can be measured through luminescence. The affinity of NanoBiT 
complemented complexes for IL-23 was measured using NanoBRET and 
cytokine-induced signal transduction was measured using a phospho-STAT3 
AlphaLISA assay.
KEY RESULTS: NanoBiT measurements demonstrated that IL-23 receptor complexes 
formed to an equal degree in the presence and absence of ligand. NanoBRET 
measurements confirmed that these complexes bound IL-23 with a picomolar binding 
affinity. Measurement of STAT3 phosphorylation demonstrated that pre-formed 
IL-23 receptor complexes induced signalling following ligand binding. It was 
also demonstrated that synthetic ligand-independent signalling could be induced 
by high affinity (HiBit) but not low affinity (SmBit) NanoBiT crosslinking of 
the receptor N-terminal domains.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results indicate that receptor complexes 
form prior to ligand binding and are not sufficient to induce signalling alone. 
Our findings indicate that IL-23 induces a conformational change in heteromeric 
receptor complexes, to enable signal transduction. These observations have 
direct implications for drug discovery efforts to target the IL-23 receptor."
1706,"Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) is a gaseous signaling molecule involved in numerous 
physiological processes in plants, including gas exchange with the environment 
through the regulation of stomatal pore width. Guard cells are pairs of 
specialized epidermal cells that delimit stomatal pores and have a higher 
mitochondrial density and metabolic activity than their neighboring cells. 
However, there is no clear evidence on the role of mitochondrial activity in 
stomatal closure induction. In this work, we showed that the 
mitochondrial-targeted H2S donor AP39 induces stomatal closure in a 
dose-dependent manner. Experiments using inhibitors of the mitochondrial 
electron transport chain (mETC) or insertional mutants in cytochrome c (CYTc) 
indicated that the activity of mitochondrial CYTc and/or complex IV are required 
for AP39-dependent stomatal closure. By using fluorescent probes and 
genetically-encoded biosensors we reported that AP39 hyperpolarized the 
mitochondrial inner potential (ψm) and increased cytosolic ATP, cytosolic 
hydrogen peroxide levels, and oxidation of the glutathione pool in guard cells. 
These findings showed that mitochondrial-targeted H2S donors induce stomatal 
closure, modulate guard cell mitochondrial ETC activity, the cytosolic energetic 
and oxidative status, pointing to an interplay between mitochondrial H2S, 
mitochondrial activity, and stomatal closure."
1707,"Thrombosis remains a major problem in our society, manifesting across multiple 
demographic groups and with high associated morbidity and mortality. Thrombus 
development is the result of a complex mechanism in which multiple cell types 
and soluble factors play a crucial role. One cell that has gained the most 
attention in recent years is the neutrophil. This key member of the innate 
immune system can form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to 
activating stimuli in circulation. NETs form a scaffold for thrombus formation, 
both initiating the process and stabilizing the final product. As the first 
responders of the host immune system, neutrophils have the flexibility to 
recognize a variety of molecules and can quickly interact with a range of 
different cell types. This trait makes them sensitive to exogenous stimuli. NET 
formation in response to pathogens is well established, leading to 
immune-mediated thrombus formation or immunothrombosis. NETs can also be formed 
during sterile inflammation through the activation of neutrophils by fellow 
immune cells including platelets, or activated endothelium. In chronic 
inflammatory settings, NETs can ultimately promote the development of tissue 
fibrosis, with organ failure as an end-stage outcome. In this review, we discuss 
the different pathways through which neutrophils can be activated toward NET 
formation and how these processes can result in a shared outcome: thrombus 
formation. Finally, we evaluate these different interactions and mechanisms for 
their potential as therapeutic targets, with neutrophil-targeted therapies 
providing a future approach to treating thrombosis. In contrast to current 
practices, such treatment could result in reduced pathogenic blood clot 
formation without increasing the risk of bleeding."
1708,"BACKGROUND Schwannoma is an uncommon benign tumor that develops from Schwann 
cells in the peripheral nervous system; 25-50% of such tumors occur in the head 
and neck. A rare variety of schwannoma, known as an ancient schwannoma, exhibits 
calcification, cystic degeneration, hemorrhage, myxoid stroma, pleomorphism, and 
nuclear hyperchromatism. Such characteristics may contribute to this tumor being 
incorrectly diagnosed as malignant. Almost all reported intra-oral ancient 
schwannomas behave innocuously. CASE REPORT A 20-year-old man presented to the 
oral surgery clinic with a right facial swelling that began a few months before. 
CT and MRI were performed and showed a well-defined cystic lesion anterior to 
the right masseter muscle, located in the subcutaneous area and measuring 
28×24×20 mm. No extension to the surrounding tissues nor any other similar 
lesions were seen. Microscopic examination revealed an encapsulated nodular mass 
with cystic cavities, hemorrhage, and variably distributed myxoid and hyalinized 
stroma. The tumor demonstrated 2 distinct cell distributions: hypercellular 
areas (Antoni A) and myxoid hypocellular areas (Antoni B). Focal areas in 
high-power magnification showed atypical cells with hyperchromatic and 
pleomorphic nuclei. The tumor cells showed diffuse positivity for S-100 in IHC. 
The diagnosis of ancient schwannoma was made. At 1-year follow-up, there was no 
evidence of nerve injury or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS One more case of oral 
ancient schwannoma is added to the literature. This is the first reported in 
Saudi Arabia. It is prudent to be familiar with the degenerative and cytologic 
alterations of ancient schwannoma, as this may limit the likelihood of 
misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of this benign tumor, with an excellent 
prognosis."
1709,"The aim of this paper was to explore the role and mechanism of circHIPK3 in 
unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA). The expression of circHIPK3 
and miR-30a-3p mRNA in URSA villous tissues was detected by quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction. The effects of circHIPK3 on the proliferation and 
migration of villous trophoblasts were analysed by MTTassay and scratch assay. 
Hoechst/PI staining was used to detect the effect of circHIPK3 on villous 
trophoblast apoptosis. The binding of circHIPK3 to miR-30a-3p and miR-30a-3p to 
Wnt2 was analysed by dual-luciferase assay. When URSA occurred, the expression 
level of circHIPK3 was downregulated, while the expression level of miR-30a-3p 
was upregulated in villous trophoblasts. Inhibition of circHIPK3 in villous 
trophoblasts can reduce the proliferation and migration of villous trophoblasts 
while promoting their apoptosis. The dual-luciferase assay showed that circHIPK3 
was able to interact with miR-30a-3p and increased the miR-30a-3p expression 
after inhibition of circHIPK3, and if miR-30a-3p was also inhibited it was able 
to reverse the effect of circHIPK3 on villous trophoblast proliferation and 
migration. It was demonstrated by prediction and dual-luciferase assay that 
miR-30a-3p binds to Wnt2, and when miR-30a-3p and Wnt2 are inhibited 
simultaneously, it has an inhibitory effect on the proliferation and migration 
process of villous trophoblasts. Downregulation of circHIPK3 expression in URSA 
leads to increased expression of miR-30a-3p, which in turn inhibits the 
expression of target gene Wnt2 and exerts a weakening effect on the 
proliferation and migration process of trophoblasts, thereby decreasing 
trophoblast invasiveness and shallow placental implantation, which in turn leads 
to recurrent spontaneous abortion."
1710,"Pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is the rarest in its group and 
accounts for only 2.5-5% of all the diagnosed cardiomyopathies in children. It 
is a relentless disease with poor prognosis, and heart transplantation is the 
only long-term treatment option. The aetiology of pediatric RCM varies and 
includes conditions such as endomyocardial fibrosis, storage disorder (Fabry's 
disease, MPS), drugs, radiation, post-cardiac transplantation and genetic. 
Genetic causes encompasses mutations in sarcomeric (troponin I and T, actin, 
myosin and titin) and nonsarcomeric protein-coding genes (Desmin, RSK2, lamin 
A/C and bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3)). Inheritance of RCM could be 
autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked. Here, we report a case of 
RCM in an adolescent girl, who was symptomatic with palpitations and 
breathlessness on exertion. The patient showed presence of rare variants in FLNC 
(c.5707G>A; p.Glu1903Lys) and BAG3 genes (c.610G>A; p.Gly204Arg). These two 
variants were detected individually in asymptomatic father and mother, 
respectively. FLNC gene codes for gamma filamin. These filamin proteins play 
important role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcomere. BAG3 is 
the main component of the chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) pathway. 
Mutant FLNC leads to the formation of protein aggregates which are cleared by an 
active protein quality control system including CASA pathway. For further 
verification, in silico protein-protein interaction was performed using online 
software and tools. The results showed evident interaction between FLNC and BAG3 
with significant binding score (-826.6) between them."
1711,"Cholesteatoma of the middle ear is a common disease in otolaryngology that is 
receiving increasing attention. It is estimated that over 5 million people 
around the world are suffering from middle ear cholesteatoma. The yearly 
frequency of middle ear cholesteatoma is detailed as 9.2 per 100,000 in adults 
and 3 per 100,000 in children. Without timely discovery and intervention, 
cholesteatomas can become perilously large and attack intratemporal structures, 
coming about in various intra- and extracranial complications. So far, no 
practical nonsurgical treatments are available. Although multiple hypotheses 
exist, research directions are relatively consistent, focusing on cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, and bone destruction. Recently, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) 
especially miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, have received increasing attention 
because of their key roles in gene expression, cell cycle regulation, and the 
development of many diseases. Although ncRNAs are not involved in protein 
translation, they are abundant in the genome, with only approximately 2% of 
genes encoding proteins and the remaining approximately 98% encoding ncRNA. The 
purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding 
the specific role of ncRNA in middle ear cholesteatoma."
1712,"Fundamental key processes in viral infection cycles generally occur in distinct 
cellular sites where both viral and host factors accumulate and interact. These 
sites are usually termed viral replication organelles, or viral factories (VF). 
The generation of VF is accompanied by the synthesis of viral proteins and 
genomes and involves the reorganization of cellular structure. Recently, 
rVSV-ΔG-spike (VSV-S), a recombinant VSV expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein, was developed as a vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2. By combining 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tomography studies and immuno-labeling 
techniques, we investigated the infection cycle of VSV-S in Vero E6 cells. 
RT-real-time-PCR results show that viral RNA synthesis occurs 3-4 h post 
infection (PI), and accumulates as the infection proceeds. By 10-24 h PI, TEM 
electron tomography results show that VSV-S generates VF in multi-lamellar 
bodies located in the cytoplasm. The VF consists of virus particles with various 
morphologies. We demonstrate that VSV-S infection is associated with 
accumulation of cytoplasmatic viral proteins co-localized with dsRNA (marker for 
RNA replication) but not with ER membranes. Newly formed virus particles 
released from the multi-lamellar bodies containing VF, concentrate in a vacuole 
membrane, and the infection ends with the budding of particles after the fusion 
of the vacuole membrane with the plasma membrane. In summary, the current study 
describes detailed 3D imaging of key processes during the VSV-S infection cycle."
1713,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused 
the pandemic that began late December 2019. The co-expression of SARS-CoV-2 
structural proteins in cells could assemble into several types of virus-like 
particles (VLPs) without a viral RNA genome. VLPs containing S proteins with the 
structural and functional properties of authentic virions are safe materials to 
exploit for virus-cell entry and vaccine development. In this study, to generate 
SARS-CoV-2 VLPs (SCoV2-SEM VLPs) composed of three structural proteins including 
spike (S), envelop (E) protein and membrane (M) protein, a tri-cistronic vector 
expression system was established in a cell line co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 S, E 
and M proteins. The SCoV2-SEM VLPs were harvested from the cultured medium, and 
three structure proteins were confirmed by Western blot assay. A negative-stain 
TEM assay demonstrated the size of the SCoV2-SEM VLPs with a diameter of about 
90 nm. To further characterize the infectious properties of SCoV2-SEM VLPs, the 
VLPs (atto647N-SCoV2-SEM VLPs) were fluorescence-labeled by conjugation with 
atto-647N and visualized under confocal microscopy at a single-particle 
resolution. The results of the infection assay revealed that atto647N-SCoV2-SEM 
VLPs attached to the surface of the HEK293T cells at the pre-binding phase in a 
ACE2-dependent manner. At the post-infection phase, atto647N-SCoV2-SEM VLPs 
either fused with the cellular membrane or internalized into the cytoplasm with 
mCherry-rab5-positive early endosomes. Moreover, fusion with the cellular 
membrane and the internalization with early endosomes could be inhibited by the 
treatment of camostat (a pharmacological inhibitor of TMPRSS2) and 
chlorpromazine (an endocytosis inhibitor), respectively. These results 
elucidated that SCoV2-SEM VLPs behave similarly to the authentic live SARS-CoV-2 
virus, suggesting that the development of SCoV2-SEM VLPs provide a realistic and 
safe experimental model for studying the infectious mechanism of SARS-CoV-2."
1714,"The incidence of high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV)-driven head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is on the rise globally. HR-HPV-driven HNSCC 
displays molecular and clinical characteristics distinct from HPV-uninvolved 
cases. Therapeutic strategies for HR-HPV-driven HNSCC are under investigation. 
HR-HPVs encode the oncogenes E6 and E7, which are essential in tumorigenesis. 
Meanwhile, involvement of E6 and E7 provides attractive targets for developing 
new therapeutic regimen. Here we will review some of the recent advancements 
observed in preclinical studies and clinical trials on HR-HPV-driven HNSCC, 
focusing on nanotechnology related methods. Materials science innovation leads 
to great improvement for cancer therapeutics including HNSCC. This article 
discusses HPV-E6 or -E7- based vaccines, based on plasmid, messenger RNA or 
peptide, at their current stage of development and testing as well as how 
nanoparticles can be designed to target and access cancer cells and activate 
certain immunology pathways besides serving as a delivery vehicle. 
Nanotechnology was also used for chemotherapy and photothermal treatment. Short 
interference RNA targeting E6/E7 showed some potential in animal models. Gene 
editing by CRISPR-CAS9 combined with other treatments has also been assessed. 
These advancements have the potential to improve the outcome in HR-HPV-driven 
HNSCC, however breakthroughs are still to be awaited with nanomedicine playing 
an important role."
1715,"The recent development and mass administration of Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines allowed for disease control, 
reducing hospitalizations and mortality. Most of these vaccines target the 
SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein antigens, culminating with the production of 
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that disrupt the attachment of the virus to ACE2 
receptors on the host cells. However, several studies demonstrated that the NAbs 
typically rise within a few weeks after vaccination but quickly reduce months 
later. Thus, multiple booster administration is recommended, leading to 
vaccination hesitancy in many populations. Detecting serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 NAbs 
can instruct patients and healthcare providers on correct booster strategies. 
Several in vitro diagnostics kits are available; however, their high cost 
impairs the mass NAbs diagnostic testing. Recently, we engineered an ACE2 
mimetic that interacts with the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-2 S 
protein. Here we present the use of this engineered mini-protein (p-deface2 mut) 
to develop a detection assay to measure NAbs in patient sera using a competitive 
ELISA assay. Serum samples from twenty-one patients were tested. Nine samples 
(42.8%) tested positive, and twelve (57.1%) tested negative for neutralizing 
sera. The data correlated with the result from the standard commercial assay 
that uses human ACE2 protein. This confirmed that p-deface2 mut could replace 
human ACE2 in ELISA assays. Using bacterially expressed p-deface2 mut protein is 
cost-effective and may allow mass SARS-CoV-2 NAbs detection, especially in 
low-income countries where economical diagnostic testing is crucial. Such 
information will help providers decide when a booster is required, reducing 
risks of reinfection and preventing the administration before it is medically 
necessary."
1716,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has a restricted 
tropism for macrophages and CD163 is a key receptor for infection. In this 
study, the PRRSV strain NCV1 was passaged on MARC-145 cells for 95 passages, and 
two plaque-clones (C1 and C2) were randomly selected for further analysis. The 
C1 virus nearly lost the ability to infect porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), 
as well as porcine kidney cells expressing porcine CD163 (PK15-pCD163), while 
the C2 virus replicates well in these two cell types. Pretreatment of MARC-145 
cells with an anti-CD163 antibody nearly blocked C1 virus infection, indicating 
that the virus still required CD163 to infect cells. The C1 virus carried four 
unique amino acid substitutions: three in the nonstructural proteins and a K160I 
in GP2. The introduction of an I160K substitution in GP2 of the C1 virus 
restored its infectivity in PAMs and PK15-pCD163 cells, while the introduction 
of a K160I substitution in GP2 of the low-passaged, virulent PRRSV strain NCV13 
significantly impaired its infectivity. Importantly, pigs inoculated with the 
rNCV13-K160I mutant exhibited lower viremia levels and lung lesions than those 
infected with the parental rNCV13. These results demonstrated that the K160 
residue in GP2 is one of the key determinants of PRRSV tropism."
1717,"HIV vaccine mediated efficacy, using an expanded live attenuated recombinant 
varicella virus-vectored SIV rSVV-SIVgag/env vaccine prime with adjuvanted 
SIV-Env and SIV-Gag protein boosts, was evaluated in a female rhesus macaques 
(RM) model against repeated intravaginal SIV challenges. Vaccination induced 
anti-SIV IgG responses and neutralizing antibodies were found in all vaccinated 
RMs. Three of the eight vaccinated RM remained uninfected (vaccinated and 
protected, VP) after 13 repeated challenges with the pathogenic SIVmac251-CX-1. 
The remaining five vaccinated and infected (VI) macaques had significantly 
reduced plasma viral loads compared with the infected controls (IC). A 
significant increase in systemic central memory CD4+ T cells and mucosal CD8+ 
effector memory T-cell responses was detected in vaccinated RMs compared to 
controls. Variability in lymph node SIV-Gag and Env specific CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cell cytokine responses were detected in the VI RMs while all three VP RMs had 
more durable cytokine responses following vaccination and prior to challenge. VI 
RMs demonstrated predominately SIV-specific monofunctional cytokine responses 
while the VP RMs generated polyfunctional cytokine responses. This study 
demonstrates that varicella virus-vectored SIV vaccination with protein boosts 
induces a 37.5% efficacy rate against pathogenic SIV challenge by generating 
mucosal memory, virus specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies, and 
polyfunctional T-cell responses."
1718,"The nerve necrosis virus (NNV), a pathogen of viral nervous necrosis disease in 
several important mariculture economic fish species, causes economic loss. Its 
nonstructural protein B2 encoded by the sub-genomic RNA3 affects the 
amplification of the virus. In this study, the B2 protein was recombinantly 
expressed, the polyclonal antibodies were produced and the dynamics of the B2 
protein and genomes were measured in vivo and in vitro after NNV infection. 
Then, the effects of the overexpressed B2 protein on virus proliferation were 
investigated. The results showed that the polyclonal antibodies can recognize 
the B2 protein in both SSN-1 cells and the brain/eye of the grouper. The RNA3 
expression significantly increased at 12 h and kept rising till the end of the 
experiment; it was 106.9 copies/μL at 120 h. The B2 protein could be first 
detected at 3 h post-infection, which was earlier than the capsid protein was 
first detected (12 h post-infection). The B2 protein can be detected in the 
brain, eye and heart on day 3 and the copy number of genomes reached a maximum 
at 6 d post-infection. There was a low expression of NNV genomes in the liver, 
spleen and kidney, and no virus was detected in the gill, stomach and intestine. 
In the meantime, the B2 protein was successfully expressed in GF-1 cells and 
significantly enhanced virus proliferation, which produced an earlier cytopathic 
effect and higher cell death rates after 3 d post-infection than the control. In 
conclusion, the B2 protein acts as an early expressed protein during virus 
replication and proliferation and is involved in the early infection of NNV. The 
results may provide insight into the early stage of virus infection and 
prevention of the disease."
1719,"Bacterial viruses known as bacteriophages have been demonstrated to be effective 
in killing foodborne pathogens such as Shigella flexneri. Adsorption is the 
first step in the phage-host interaction. In the present work, 10 Shigella 
phages were used to characterize the adsorption process on Shigella flexneri 
ATCC12022 in several physicochemical conditions related to food and in a food 
matrix. One-step growth curves were drawn for all the Shigella-phages evaluated. 
Furthermore, the adsorption rate for each of the 10 phages was determined. In 
addition, the influence of temperature, Na+, Mg2+, pH, sucrose and glycerol on 
phage adsorption was investigated. Two phages (Shi22 and Shi30) showed higher 
burst sizes values (67 and 64 PFU cell-1, respectively) and burst times of 25 
min to 30 min, while the other eight phages exhibited burst sizes ranging from 
14 to 17 PFU cell-1 with slower burst times. Furthermore, most phages achieved a 
high adsorption rate, and the adsorption constants (k) ranged from ~10-9 to 
10-10 mL min-1. Regarding the influence of temperature, cations and pH, a high 
or moderate percentage of adsorption was observed for most of the phages 
evaluated. The adsorption decreased at increasing concentrations of Na+, sucrose 
and glycerol, although at different levels, since adsorption was more affected 
by sucrose than by glycerol and Na+ for most phages. The adsorption obtained in 
Triptein soy broth (TSB) for most of the phages/strain systems evaluated was 
moderate or high, as well as those observed in a food matrix. Thus, our phages 
could potentially be used to improve food safety under a wide range of 
environmental conditions against foodborne pathogens."
1720,"As for all non-segmented negative RNA viruses, rabies virus has its genome 
packaged in a linear assembly of nucleoprotein (N), named nucleocapsid. The 
formation of new nucleocapsids during virus replication in cells requires the 
production of soluble N protein in complex with its phosphoprotein (P) 
chaperone. In this study, we reconstituted a soluble heterodimeric complex 
between an armless N protein of rabies virus (RABV), lacking its N-terminal 
subdomain (NNT-ARM), and a peptide encompassing the N0 chaperon module of the P 
protein. We showed that the chaperone module undergoes a disordered-order 
transition when it assembles with N0 and measured an affinity in the low 
nanomolar range using a competition assay. We solved the crystal structure of 
the complex at a resolution of 2.3 Å, unveiling the details of the conserved 
interfaces. MD simulations showed that both the chaperon module of P and 
RNA-mediated polymerization reduced the ability of the RNA binding cavity to 
open and close. Finally, by reconstituting a complex with full-length P protein, 
we demonstrated that each P dimer could independently chaperon two N0 molecules."
1721,"Norovirus (NoV) is an enteric non-enveloped virus which is the leading cause of 
gastroenteritis across all age groups. It is responsible for around 200,000 
deaths annually and outbreaks are common in small communities such as 
educational and care facilities. 40% of all NoV outbreaks occur in long-term and 
acute-care facilities, forming the majority of outbreaks. Nosocomial settings 
set ideal environments for ease of transmission, especially due to the presence 
of immunocompromised groups. It is estimated to cost global economies around £48 
billion a year, making it a global issue. NoV is transmitted via the faecal-oral 
route and infection with it results in asymptomatic cases or gastrointestinal 
disease. It has high mutational rates and this allows for new variants to emerge 
and be more resistant. The classification system available divides NoV into 10 
genogroups and 49 genotypes based on whole amino acid sequencing of VP1 capsid 
protein and partial sequencing of RdRp, respectively. The most predominant 
genotypes which cause gastroenteritis in humans include GI.1 and GII.4, where 
GII.4 is responsible for more extreme clinical implications such as 
hospitalisation. In addition, GII.4 has been responsible for 6 pandemic strains, 
the last of which is the GII.4 Sydney (2012) variant. In recent years, the 
successful cultivation of HuNoV was reported in stem cell-derived human 
intestinal enteroids (HIEs), which promises to assist in giving a deeper 
understanding of its underlying mechanisms of infection and the development of 
more personalized control measures. There are no specific control measures 
against NoV, therefore common practices are used against it such as hand 
washing. No vaccine is available, but the HIL-214 candidate passed clinical 
phase 2b and shows promise."
1722,"Senecavirus A (SVA) is a causative agent for vesicular disease in swine, which 
is clinically indistinguishable from other vesicular diseases of swine including 
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Recently, it was reported that buffalo in 
Guangdong, China were experiencing clinical symptoms similar to FMD including 
mouth ulcers and lameness tested positive for SVA. The objective of this study 
was to determine the susceptibility of cattle (Bos taurus) to SVA infection. 
Initial in vitro work using the PrimeFlow assay demonstrated that bovine cell 
lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from cattle were susceptible to SVA 
infection. Subsequently, six colostrum-deprived Holstein calves were challenged 
with SVA intranasally. No vesicular lesions were observed after challenge. 
Serum, oral, nasal, and rectal swabs tested for SVA nucleic acid did not support 
significant viral replication and there was no evidence of seroconversion. 
Therefore, demonstrating cattle from this study were not susceptible to 
experimental SVA infection."
1723,"The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has adopted the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. 
Several factors related to the non-suppression of HIV, including interruptions 
of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and opportunistic infections could affect and 
delay this projected epidemic goal. Human T-Cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) 
appears to be consistently associated with a high risk of opportunistic 
infections, an early onset of HTLV-1 and its associated pathologies, as well as 
a fast progression to the AIDS phase in co-infected individuals, when compared 
to HIV-1 or HTLV-1 mono-infected individuals. In Gabon, the prevalence of these 
two retroviruses is very high and little is known about HTLV-1 and the 
associated pathologies, leaving most of them underdiagnosed. Hence, HTLV-1/HIV-1 
co-infections could simultaneously imply a non-diagnosis of HIV-1 positive 
individuals having developed pathologies associated with HTLV-1, but also a high 
mortality rate among the co-infected individuals. All of these constitute 
potential obstacles to pursue targeted objectives. A systematic review was 
conducted to assess the negative impacts of HTLV-1/HIV-1 co-infections and 
related factors on the elimination of HIV/AIDS by 2030 in Gabon."
1724,"Influenza virus infection in pregnant women may put the fetus at higher risk; 
however, to date, there has been no detailed research about the expression of 
influenza virus receptors in the human placenta. We employed the lectin staining 
technique, which is a classic influenza virus receptor research method for 
studying the distribution of viral receptors in the human placenta. In addition, 
we examined the susceptibility of the human placenta to H1N1/09, by detecting 
viral proteins and RNA at different time points post-infection. We found that 
the human placenta expressed both avian and human influenza A virus receptors 
(α-2, 3-linked sialic acid and α-2, 6-linked sialic acid). In addition, H1N1/09 
did not only infect the human placenta, but also replicated and was released 
into the culture media. We concluded that the human placenta is susceptible to 
the 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1/09) infection, and that particular attention 
should be paid to shielding pregnant women from infection during influenza 
season."
1725,"Goose astrovirus (GAstV) is an important pathogen causing visceral gout and high 
mortality in goslings, which has broken out and spread across China. In 2021, a 
disease characterized by urate deposition on the visceral surface and 30% 
mortality occurred in commercial adult Landaise geese in Zhejiang Province, 
China. A systematic study identified an infecting astrovirus, designated ZJCX, 
that was efficiently isolated from a diseased goose with a chicken 
hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (LMH). In contrast to other GAstVs 
originating from goslings, ZJCX caused cytopathogenic effects in LMH cells, and 
the crystalline arrangement of viral particles was observed through transmission 
electron microscopy. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide homology 
comparison revealed that ZJCX isolate belongs to the genotype II cluster of 
GAstVs and displays 97.8-98.4% identity with other GAstV II strains. However, 
several specific mutations occurred in the polyprotein and capsid protein 
regions. Moreover, a pathogenicity assessment of ZJCX with a gosling model was 
conducted, and typical visceral gout was reproduced and led to 18% mortality. 
The viral loads of ZJCX in the blood, kidney, and liver were detected with 
specific primers after inoculation, which demonstrated that the kidney and liver 
presented viral loads peaking at seven days post-inoculation (dpi). Biochemical 
parameter examination showed that AST, ALT, γ-GT, UA, and BUN levels were 
significantly increased by GAstV, whereas body weight was reduced. Overall, this 
study indicated that the GAstV isolate could infect adult geese, and the results 
regarding the viral loads and biochemical parameters induced by ZJCX provide 
insight into GAstV pathogenicity."
1726,"Viruses are strict intracellular parasites that rely on the proteins encoded in 
their genomes for the effective manipulation of the infected cell that 
ultimately enables a successful infection. Viral proteins have to be produced 
during the cell invasion and takeover in sufficient amounts and in a timely 
manner. Silencing suppressor proteins evolved by plant viruses can boost the 
production of viral proteins; although, additional mechanisms for the regulation 
of viral protein production likely exist. The strongest silencing suppressor 
encoded by the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is V2: V2 
suppresses both post-transcriptional and transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS 
and TGS), activities that are associated with its localization in punctate 
cytoplasmic structures and in the nucleus, respectively. However, V2 has been 
previously described to largely localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 
although the biological relevance of this distribution remains mysterious. Here, 
we confirm the association of V2 to the ER in Nicotiana benthamiana and assess 
the silencing suppression activity-independent impact of V2 on protein 
accumulation. Our results indicate that V2 has no obvious influence on the 
localization of ER-synthesized receptor-like kinases (RLKs) or ER quality 
control (ERQC)/ER-associated degradation (ERAD), but dramatically enhances the 
accumulation of the viral C4 protein, which is co-translationally myristoylated, 
possibly in proximity to the ER. By using the previously described V2C84S/86S 
mutant, in which the silencing suppression activity is abolished, we uncouple 
RNA silencing from the observed effect. Therefore, this work uncovers a novel 
function of V2, independent of its capacity to suppress silencing, in the 
promotion of the accumulation of another crucial viral protein."
1727,"The analysis of the HIV-1 proviral dynamics after superinfection in the context 
of both natural and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-mediated suppression could 
yield unique insights into understanding the persistence of viral variants that 
seeded the infected cells at different times. In this study, we performed a 
longitudinal analysis of the env diversity of PBMC-associated HIV DNA 
quasispecies in two HIV controllers (EEC09 and VC32) that were superinfected 
with subtype F1 viruses several years after primoinfection with subtype B 
viruses. Patient EEC09 started ART soon after superinfection, while patient VC32 
maintained a natural control of virus replication for at least six years 
following the superinfection. Our analysis revealed no significant temporal 
changes in the overall proportion of primo-infecting and superinfecting proviral 
variants over 2-3 years after superinfection in both HIV controllers. Upon the 
introduction of ART, individual EEC09 displayed no evidence of HIV-infected cell 
turnover or viral evolution, while subject VC32 displayed some level of 
HIV-infected cell reseeding and detectable evolution (divergence) of both viral 
variants. These results confirm that proviral variants that seeded the reservoir 
at different times throughout infection could persist for long periods under 
fully suppressive ART or natural viremic control, but the HIV-1 proviral 
dynamics could be different in both settings."
1728,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major causative agent of bovine mastitis, a disease 
considered one of the most economically devastating in the dairy sector. 
Considering the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains, novel 
therapeutic approaches efficiently targeting extra- and intracellular bacteria 
and featuring high activity in the presence of raw milk components are needed. 
Here, we have screened a library of eighty peptidoglycan hydrolases (PGHs) for 
high activity against S. aureus in raw bovine milk, twelve of which were 
selected for further characterization and comparison in time-kill assays. The 
bacteriocins lysostaphin and ALE-1, and the chimeric PGH M23LST(L)_SH3b2638 
reduced bacterial numbers in raw milk to the detection limit within 10 min. 
Three CHAP-based PGHs (CHAPGH15_SH3bAle1, CHAPK_SH3bLST_H, CHAPH5_LST_H) showed 
gradually improving activity with increasing dilution of the raw milk. 
Furthermore, we demonstrated synergistic activity of CHAPGH15_SH3bAle1 and LST 
when used in combination. Finally, modification of four PGHs (LST, 
M23LST(L)_SH3b2638, CHAPK_SH3bLST, CHAPGH15_SH3bAle1) with the cell-penetrating 
peptide TAT significantly enhanced the eradication of intracellular S. aureus in 
bovine mammary alveolar cells compared to the unmodified parentals in a 
concentration-dependent manner."
1729,"The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a multicellular microenvironment that plays an 
important role in regulating bidirectional transport to and from the central 
nervous system (CNS). Infections by many acutely infectious viruses such as 
alphaviruses and flaviviruses are known to impact the integrity of the 
endothelial lining of the BBB. Infection by Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus 
(VEEV) through the aerosol route causes significant damage to the integrity of 
the BBB, which contributes to long-term neurological sequelae. An effective 
therapeutic intervention strategy should ideally not only control viral load in 
the host, but also prevent and/or reverse deleterious events at the BBB. Two 
dimensional monocultures, including trans-well models that use endothelial 
cells, do not recapitulate the intricate multicellular environment of the BBB. 
Complex in vitro organ-on-a-chip models (OOC) provide a great opportunity to 
introduce human-like experimental models to understand the mechanistic 
underpinnings of the disease state and evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic 
candidates in a highly relevant manner. Here we demonstrate the utility of a 
neurovascular unit (NVU) in analyzing the dynamics of infection and 
proinflammatory response following VEEV infection and therapeutic effectiveness 
of omaveloxolone to preserve BBB integrity and decrease viral and inflammatory 
load."
1730,"In the current global scenario, many COVID-19 survivors present a severe 
deterioration in physical strength, respiratory function, and quality of life 
due to persistent symptoms and post-acute consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
These alterations are known as post-COVID-19 syndrome for which there is no 
specific and effective treatment for their management. Currently, therapeutic 
exercise strategies (ThEx) are effective in many diseases by reducing the 
appearance of complications and side effects linked to treatment, and are 
consequently of great relevance. In this study, we review the effect of ThEX in 
reversing decreased strength, impaired respiratory function, decreased physical 
fitness, and decreased quality of life (QoL) caused by post-COVID-19 syndrome. A 
literature search was conducted through the electronic databases, Medline 
(PubMed), SciELO and Cochrane Library Plus for this structured narrative review 
for studies published from database retrieval up till 12 December 2022. A total 
of 433 patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome condition (60% women) were included 
in the nine studies which met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Overall, 
post-COVID-19 syndrome patients who followed a ThEx intervention showed 
improvements in strength, respiratory function, physical fitness and QoL, with 
no exercise-derived side effects. Thus, ThEx based on strength, aerobic and 
respiratory training could be an adjuvant non-pharmacological tool in the 
modulation of post-COVID-19 syndrome."
1731,"BACKGROUND: Combination therapy has been widely explored for oncolytic virus 
(OV), as it can be met with tumor resistance. The HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) 
panobinostat is a potent pan-deacetylase inhibitor which blocks multiple 
cancer-related pathways and reverses epigenetic events in cancer progression.
METHODS: In this study, oncolytic activity in vitro and antitumor therapeutic 
efficacy in vivo when combined with oHSV and panobinostat were investigated.
RESULTS: (1) Treatment with panobinostat enhanced oHSV propagation and 
cytotoxicity in human glioma A172 and squamous cell carcinoma SCC9 cells. (2) 
Combined treatment with oHSV and panobinostat enhanced virus replication 
mediated by the transcriptional downregulation of IFN-β- and IFN-responsive 
antiviral genes in human glioma A172 and squamous cell carcinoma SCC9 cells. (3) 
Panobinostat treatment induced upregulation of PD-L1 expression in both glioma 
and squamous cell carcinoma cells. (4) A significantly enhanced therapeutic 
efficacy was shown in vivo for the murine glioma CT-2A and squamous cell 
carcinoma SCC7 models when treated with a combination of oHSV, including 
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and HDAC inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, these data provide some new clues for the clinical 
development of combination therapy with OVs, epigenetic modifiers, and 
checkpoint blockades for glioma and squamous cell carcinoma."
1732,"Insect cell-baculovirus expression vector system is one of the most established 
platforms to produce biological products, and it plays a fundamental role in the 
context of COVID-19 emergency, providing recombinant proteins for treatment, 
diagnosis, and prevention. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the interaction 
of the spike glycoprotein trimer via its receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the 
host's cellular receptor. As RBD is required for many applications, in the 
context of pandemic it is important to meet the challenge of producing a high 
amount of recombinant RBD (rRBD). For this reason, in the present study, we 
developed a process based on Sf9 insect cells to improve rRBD yield. rRBD was 
recovered from the supernatant of infected cells and easily purified by metal 
ion affinity chromatography, with a yield of 82% and purity higher than 95%. 
Expressed under a novel chimeric promoter (polh-pSeL), the yield of rRBD after 
purification was 21.1 ± 3.7 mg/L, which is the highest performance described in 
Sf9 cell lines. Finally, rRBD was successfully used in an assay to detect 
specific antibodies in COVID-19 serum samples. The efficient strategy herein 
described has the potential to produce high-quality rRBD in Sf9 cell line for 
diagnostic purpose."
1733,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-associated neurodegenerative disorder 
(HAND) is frequently reported in HIV-infected individuals. The gp120 envelope 
viral protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HAND in HIV-1-infected 
patients; however, its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we 
first overexpressed gp120 proteins in pc12 cells and used PI staining, a CCK8 
assay, a TUNEL assay, and caspase-9/caspase-3-induced apoptosis to ascertain the 
mediated cell death. Subsequently, the gp120-overexpressed cells were subjected 
to RNA transcriptomics and mass spectrometry. The obtained results were 
integrated and validated using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
and the postmortem brain samples with HIV-associated dementia were analyzed 
against the normal control (using the GSE35864 data set on gene ontology omnibus 
repository). Upon the integration of the RNA transcriptomic and proteomic 
results, 78 upregulated genes were revealed. Fut8, Unc13c, Cdk1, Loc100359539, 
and Hspa2 were the top five upregulated genes. Upon the analysis of the GSE35864 
data set, the results indicate that Cdk1 was upregulated in HIV-associated 
dementia in comparison to the normal control. Moreover, the protein expression 
of Cdk1 was significantly higher in the gp120 transfected group compared to the 
normal control and decreased significantly upon inhibition using Roscovitine (a 
known Cdk1 inhibitor). Taken together, our results provide a possible molecular 
signature of the neurological impairment secondary to HIV glycoprotein 120."
1734,"Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is one of the most studied mechanisms of plant 
resistance to viruses. During ETI, viral proteins are recognized by specific 
plant R proteins, which most often trigger a hypersensitive response (HR) 
involving programmed cell death (PCD) and a restriction of infection in the 
initially infected sites. However, in some plant-virus interactions, ETI leads 
to a response in which PCD and virus multiplication are not restricted to the 
entry sites and spread throughout the plant, leading to systemic necrosis. The 
host and virus genetic determinants, and the consequences of this response in 
plant-virus coevolution, are still poorly understood. Here, we identified an 
allelic version of RCY1-an R protein-as the host genetic determinant of 
broad-spectrum systemic necrosis induced by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 
infection in the Arabidopsis thaliana Co-1 ecotype. Systemic necrosis reduced 
virus fitness by shortening the infectious period and limiting virus 
multiplication; thus, this phenotype could be adaptive for the plant population 
as a defense against CMV. However, the low frequency (less than 1%) of this 
phenotype in A. thaliana wild populations argues against this hypothesis. These 
results expand current knowledge on the resistance mechanisms to virus 
infections associated with ETI in plants."
1735,"Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), 
the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, leads to profound remodeling of 
cellular membranes, promoting viral replication and virion assembly. A full 
understanding of this drastic remodeling and the process of virion morphogenesis 
remains lacking. In this study, we applied room temperature transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) 
tomography to visualize the SARS-CoV-2 replication factory in Vero cells, and 
present our results in comparison with published cryo-EM studies. We obtained 
cryo-EM-like clarity of the ultrastructure by employing high-pressure freezing, 
freeze substitution (HPF-FS) and embedding, allowing room temperature 
visualization of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) in a near-native state. In 
addition, our data illustrate the consecutive stages of virion morphogenesis and 
reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleoprotein assembly and membrane curvature occur 
simultaneously. Finally, we show the tethering of virions to the plasma membrane 
in 3D, and that accumulations of virus particles lacking spike protein in large 
vesicles are most likely not a result of defective virion assembly at their 
membrane. In conclusion, this study puts forward a room-temperature EM technique 
providing near-native ultrastructural information about SARS-CoV-2 replication, 
adding to our understanding of the interaction of this pandemic virus with its 
host cell."
1736,"Baculoviruses have been widely used as expression vectors. However, numerous 
genes in the baculoviral genome are non-essential for cellular infection and 
protein expression, making the optimisation of baculovirus expression vectors 
possible. We used a synthetic biological method to reduce the number of genes in 
a partial region of the autograph californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 
(AcMNPV), the most widely used baculovirus expression vector. The C1 region of 
the AcMNPV is 46.4 kb and is subdivided into B1, B2, and B3 fragments. We first 
designed modified B1, B2, and B3 fragments by deleting the non-essential genes, 
and then synthesised complete viral genomes containing either individual 
modified B fragments or joint modified B fragments through 
transformation-related recombination in yeast. The synthetic genomes were then 
transfected into Sf9 cells to rescue the progeny viruses and test their 
infectivity. The design-build-test cycle was repeated until the ultimately 
rescued virus could produce progeny viruses efficiently. Finally, 
AcMNPV-Syn-mC1-1.1 by deleting approximately 17.2 kb, including 20 ORFs, in the 
C1 region, was obtained. This is essential to the synthesis of a minimal AcMNPV 
genome that can generate infectious progeny viruses and can be further used to 
optimise the foundation of baculovirus expression vectors."
1737,"Emergence of 5' terminally deleted coxsackievirus-B RNA forms (CVB-TD) have been 
associated with the development of human diseases. These CVB-TD RNA forms have 
been detected in mouse pancreas during acute or persistent experimental 
infections. To date, the impact of the replication activities of CVB-TD RNA 
forms on insulin metabolism remains unexplored. Using an immunocompetent mouse 
model of CVB3/28 infection, acute and persistent infections of major CVB-TD 
populations were evidenced in the pancreas. The inoculation of mice with 
homogenized pancreases containing major CVB-TD populations induced acute and 
chronic pancreatic infections with pancreatitis. In the mouse pancreas, viral 
capsid protein 1 (VP1) expression colocalized with a decrease in beta cells 
insulin content. Moreover, in infected mouse pancreases, we showed a decrease in 
pro-hormone convertase 2 (PCSK2) mRNA, associated with a decrease in insulin 
plasmatic concentration. Finally, transfection of synthetic CVB-TD50 RNA forms 
into cultured rodent pancreatic beta cells demonstrated that viral replication 
with protein synthesis activities decreased the PCSK2 mRNA expression levels, 
impairing insulin secretion. In conclusion, our results show that the emergence 
and maintenance of major CVB-TD RNA replicative forms in pancreatic beta cells 
can play a direct, key role in the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the 
development of type 1 diabetes."
1738,"African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease of suids that induces 
high mortality in domestic pigs and wild boars. Given the current spread of ASF, 
the development of a vaccine is a priority. During an attempt to inactivate the 
Georgia 2007/1 strain via heat treatment, we fortuitously generated an 
attenuated strain called ASFV-989. Compared to Georgia, the ASFV-989 strain 
genome has a deletion of 7458 nucleotides located in the 5'-end encoding region 
of MGF 505/360, which allowed for developing a DIVA PCR system. In vitro, in 
porcine alveolar macrophages, the replication kinetics of the ASFV-989 and 
Georgia strains were identical. In vivo, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs 
inoculated with the ASFV-989 strain, either intramuscularly or oronasally, 
exhibited transient hyperthermia and slightly decreased growth performance. 
Animals immunized with the ASFV-989 strain showed viremia 100 to 1000 times 
lower than those inoculated with the Georgia strain and developed a rapid 
antibody and cell-mediated response. In ASFV-989-immunized pigs challenged 2 or 
4 weeks later with the Georgia strain, no symptoms were recorded and no viremia 
for the challenge strain was detected. These results show that the ASFV-989 
strain is a promising non-GMO vaccine candidate that is usable either 
intramuscularly or oronasally."
1739,"During the 2015-2016 outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, a previously 
unknown severe complication of ZIKV infection during pregnancy resulting in 
birth defects was reported. Since the ZIKV outbreak occurred in regions that 
were highly endemic for the related dengue virus (DENV), it was speculated that 
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of a ZIKV infection, caused by the presence 
of cross-reactive DENV antibodies, could contribute to ZIKV disease severity. 
Emerging evidence indicates that, while in vitro models can show ADE of ZIKV 
infection, ADE does not seem to contribute to congenital ZIKV disease severity 
in humans. However, the role of ADE of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and in 
vertical ZIKV transmission is not well studied. In this study, we hypothesized 
that pregnancy may affect the ability of myeloid cells to become infected with 
ZIKV, potentially through ADE. We first systematically assessed which cell lines 
and primary cells can be used to study ZIKV ADE in vitro, and we compared the 
difference in outcomes of (ADE) infection experiments between these cells. 
Subsequently, we tested the hypothesis that pregnancy may affect the ability of 
myeloid cells to become infected through ADE, by performing ZIKV ADE assays with 
primary cells isolated from blood of pregnant women from different trimesters 
and from age-matched non-pregnant women. We found that ADE of ZIKV infection can 
be induced in myeloid cell lines U937, THP-1, and K562 as well as in 
monocyte-derived macrophages from healthy donors. There was no difference in 
permissiveness for ZIKV infection or ADE potential of ZIKV infection in primary 
cells of pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. In conclusion, no 
increased permissiveness for ZIKV infection and ADE of ZIKV infection was found 
using in vitro models of primary myeloid cells from pregnant women compared to 
age-matched non-pregnant women."
1740,"Epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), defined by co-infection with Human Herpes Virus 
8 (HHV-8) and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), is a major cause of 
mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly 
reduces the risk of developing KS, and for those with KS, tumors frequently 
resolve with ART alone. However, for unknown reasons, a significant number of KS 
cases do not resolve and can progress to death. To explore how HIV responds to 
ART in the KS tumor microenvironment, we sequenced HIV env-nef found in DNA and 
RNA isolated from plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and tumor 
biopsies, before and after ART, in four Ugandan study participants who had 
unresponsive or progressive KS after 180-250 days of ART. We performed 
immunohistochemistry experiments to detect viral proteins in matched 
formalin-fixed tumor biopsies. Our sequencing results showed that HIV diversity 
and RNA expression in KS tumors are maintained after ART, despite undetectable 
plasma viral loads. The presence of spliced HIV transcripts in KS tumors after 
ART was consistent with a transcriptionally active viral reservoir. 
Immunohistochemistry staining found colocalization of HIV Nef protein and 
tissue-resident macrophages in the KS tumors. Overall, our results demonstrated 
that even after ART reduced plasma HIV viral load to undetectable levels and 
restored immune function, HIV in KS tumors continues to be transcriptionally and 
translationally active, which could influence tumor maintenance and progression."
1741,"Over 240 million people worldwide are chronically infected with Hepatitis B 
Virus (HBV), a hepatotropic DNA virus with an evolutionary root of over 400 
million years. Persistent HBV infection exhibits distinct and diverse phases of 
disease, from minimal liver pathology to fulminant Hepatitis, that vary in 
duration and severity among individuals. Although huge progress has been made in 
HBV research which has yielded an effective prophylactic vaccine and potent 
antiviral therapy, our understanding of its virology and immunobiology is still 
far from complete. For example, the recent re-discovery of serum HBV RNA in 
chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) patients has led to the proposal of noncanonical viral 
particles such as RNA virion and capsid-derived immune complex 
(Capsid-Antibody-Complexes, CACs) that contradict long-established basic theory. 
Furthermore, the existence of capsid-derived immune complex may hint at novel 
mechanism of HBV-induced liver disease. Here, we summarize the past and recent 
literature on HBV-induced immune complex. We propose that the release of 
capsid-derived particles by HBV has its deep evolutionary origin, and the 
associated complement activation serves as an indispensable trigger for 
intrahepatic damage and a catalyst for further cell-mediated immunopathology."
1742,"Older adults experience declining influenza vaccine-induced immunity and are at 
higher risk of influenza and its complications. For this reason, high dose 
(e.g., Fluzone) and adjuvanted (e.g., Fluad) vaccines are preferentially 
recommended for people age 65 years and older. However, T cell transcriptional 
activity shaping the humoral immune responses to Fluzone and Fluad vaccines in 
older adults is still poorly understood. We designed a study of 234 older adults 
(≥65 years old) who were randomly allocated to receive Fluzone or Fluad vaccine 
and provided blood samples at baseline and at Day 28 after immunization. We 
measured the humoral immune responses (hemagglutination inhibition/HAI antibody 
titer) to influenza A/H3N2 and performed mRNA-Seq transcriptional profiling in 
purified CD4+ T cells, in order to identify T cell signatures that might explain 
differences in humoral immune response by vaccine type. Given the large 
differences in formulation (higher antigen dose vs adjuvant), our hypothesis was 
that each vaccine elicited a distinct transcriptomic response after vaccination. 
Thus, the main focus of our study was to identify the differential gene 
expression influencing the antibody titer in the two vaccine groups. Our 
analyses identified three differentially expressed, functionally linked 
genes/proteins in CD4+ T cells: the calcium/calmodulin dependent 
serine/threonine kinase IV (CaMKIV); its regulator the TMEM38B/transmembrane 
protein 38B, involved in maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ release; and the 
transcriptional coactivator CBP/CREB binding protein, as regulators of 
transcriptional activity/function in CD4+ T cells that impact differences in 
immune response by vaccine type. Significantly enriched T cell-specific 
pathways/biological processes were also identified that point to the importance 
of genes/proteins involved in Th1/Th2 cell differentiation, IL-17 signaling, 
calcium signaling, Notch signaling, MAPK signaling, and regulation of TRP cation 
Ca2+ channels in humoral immunity after influenza vaccination. In summary, we 
identified the genes/proteins and pathways essential for cell activation and 
function in CD4+ T cells that are associated with differences in influenza 
vaccine-induced humoral immunity by vaccine type. These findings provide an 
additional mechanistic perspective for achieving protective immunity in older 
adults."
1743,"The inadequate therapeutic opportunities associated with carbapenem-resistant 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) clinical isolates impose a search for innovative 
strategies. Therefore, our study aimed to characterize and evaluate two locally 
isolated phages formulated in a hydrogel, both in vitro and in vivo, against 
CRPA clinical isolates. The two phages were characterized by genomic, 
microscopic, phenotypic characterization, genomic analysis, in vitro and in vivo 
analysis in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected skin thermal injury rat model. The 
two siphoviruses belong to class Caudovirectes and were named vB_Pae_SMP1 and 
vB_Pae_SMP5. Each phage had an icosahedral head of 60 ± 5 nm and a flexible, 
non-contractile tail of 170 ± 5 nm long, while vB_Pae_SMP5 had an additional 
base plate containing a 35 nm fiber observed at the end of the tail. The 
hydrogel was prepared by mixing 5% w/v carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) into the 
CRPA propagated phage lysate containing phage titer 108 PFU/mL, pH of 7.7, and a 
spreadability coefficient of 25. The groups were treated with either Phage 
vB_Pae_SMP1, vB_Pae_SMP5, or a two-phage cocktail hydrogel cellular subepidermal 
granulation tissues with abundant records of fibroblastic activity and mixed 
inflammatory cell infiltrates and showed 17.2%, 25.8%, and 22.2% records of 
dermal mature collagen fibers, respectively. In conclusion, phage vB_Pae_SMP1 or 
vB_Pae_SMP5, or the two-phage cocktails formulated as hydrogels, were able to 
manage the infection of CRPA in burn wounds, and promoted healing at the injury 
site, as evidenced by the histopathological examination, as well as a decrease 
in animal mortality rate. Therefore, these phage formulae can be considered 
promising for clinical investigation in humans for the management of 
CRPA-associated skin infections."
1744,"Culex spp. mosquitoes transmit several pathogens concerning public health, 
including West Nile virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus. Understanding the 
antiviral immune system of Culex spp. mosquitoes is important for reducing the 
transmission of these viruses. Mosquitoes rely on RNA interference (RNAi) to 
control viral replication. While the siRNA pathway in mosquitoes is heavily 
studied, less is known about the piRNA pathway. The piRNA pathway in mosquitoes 
has recently been connected to mosquito antiviral immunity. In Aedes aegypti, 
Piwi4 has been implicated in antiviral responses. The antiviral role of the 
piRNA pathway in Culex spp. mosquitoes is understudied compared to Ae. aegypti. 
Here, we aimed to identify the role of PIWI genes and piRNAs in Culex 
quinquefasciatus and Culex tarsalis cells during virus infection. We examined 
the effect of PIWI gene silencing on virus replication of two arboviruses and 
three insect-specific viruses in Cx. quinquefasciatus derived cells (Hsu) and 
Cx. tarsalis derived (CT) cells. We show that Piwi4 is antiviral against the La 
Crosse orthobunyavirus (LACV) in Hsu and CT cells, and the insect-specific 
rhabdovirus Merida virus (MERDV) in Hsu cells. None of the silenced PIWI genes 
impacted replication of the two flaviviruses Usutu virus (USUV) and Calbertado 
virus, or the phasivirus Phasi-Charoen-like virus. We further used small RNA 
sequencing to determine that LACV-derived piRNAs, but not USUV-derived piRNAs 
were generated in Hsu cells and that PIWI gene silencing resulted in a small 
reduction in vpiRNAs. Finally, we determined that LACV-derived DNA was produced 
in Hsu cells during infection, but whether this viral DNA is required for vpiRNA 
production remains unclear. Overall, we expanded our knowledge on the piRNA 
pathway and how it relates to the antiviral response in Culex spp mosquitoes."
1745,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genera alphacoronavirus, 
causes acute watery diarrhea and dehydration in suckling piglets and results in 
enormous economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. Identification and 
characterization of different cell lines are not only invaluable for PEDV entry 
and replication studies but also important for the development of various types 
of biological pharmaceuticals against PEDV. In this study, we present an 
approach to identify suitable permissive cell lines for PEDV research. Human 
cell lines were screened for a high correlation coefficient with the established 
PEDV infection model Huh7 based on RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line 
Encyclopedia (CCLE). Experimentally testing permissiveness towards PEDV 
infection, three highly permissive human cell lines, HepG2, Hep3B217, and SNU387 
were identified. The replication kinetics of PEDV in HepG2, Hep3B217, and SNU387 
cells were similar to that in Vero and Huh7 cells. Additionally, the 
transcriptomes analysis showed robust induction of transcripts associated with 
the innate immune in response to PEDV infection in all three cell lines, 
including hundreds of inflammatory cytokine and interferon genes. Moreover, the 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and interferons were confirmed by qPCR 
assay. Our findings indicate that HepG2, Hep3B217, and SNU387 are suitable cell 
lines for PEDV replication and innate immune response studies."
1746,"Because of the interface between coagulation and the immune response, it is 
expected that COVID-19-associated coagulopathy occurs via activated protein C 
signaling. The objective was to explore putative changes in the expression of 
the protein C signaling network in the liver, peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells, and nasal epithelium of patients with COVID-19. Single-cell 
RNA-sequencing data from patients with COVID-19 and healthy subjects were 
obtained from the COVID-19 Cell Atlas database. A functional protein-protein 
interaction network was constructed for the protein C gene. Patients with 
COVID-19 showed downregulation of protein C and components of the downstream 
protein C signaling cascade. The percentage of hepatocytes expressing protein C 
was lower. Part of the liver cell clusters expressing protein C presented 
increased expression of ACE2. In PBMC, there was increased ACE2, inflammatory, 
and pro-coagulation transcripts. In the nasal epithelium, PROC, ACE2, and PROS1 
were expressed by the ciliated cell cluster, revealing co-expression of ACE-2 
with transcripts encoding proteins belonging to the coagulation and immune 
system interface. Finally, there was upregulation of coagulation factor 3 
transcript in the liver and PBMC. Protein C could play a mechanistic role in the 
hypercoagulability syndrome affecting patients with severe COVID-19."
1747,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes outbreaks of rash, arthritis, and fever 
associated with neurologic complications, where astrocytes are preferentially 
infected. A determinant of virulence is the macrodomain (MD) of nonstructural 
protein 3 (nsP3), which binds and removes ADP-ribose (ADPr) from ADP-ribosylated 
substrates and regulates stress-granule disruption. We compared the replication 
of CHIKV 181/25 (WT) and MD mutants with decreased ADPr binding and hydrolase 
(G32S) or increased ADPr binding and decreased hydrolase (Y114A) activities in 
C8-D1A astrocytic cells and NSC-34 neuronal cells. WT CHIKV replication was 
initiated more rapidly with earlier nsP synthesis in C8-D1A than in NSC-34 
cells. G32S established infection, amplified replication complexes, and induced 
host-protein synthesis shut-off less efficiently than WT and produced less 
infectious virus, while Y114A replication was close to WT. However, G32S 
mutation effects on structural protein synthesis were cell-type-dependent. In 
NSC-34 cells, E2 synthesis was decreased compared to WT, while in C8-D1A cells 
synthesis was increased. Excess E2 produced by G32S-infected C8-D1A cells was 
assembled into virus particles that were less infectious than those from WT or 
Y114A-infected cells. Because nsP3 recruits ADP-ribosylated RNA-binding proteins 
in stress granules away from translation-initiation factors into nsP3 granules 
where the MD hydrolase can remove ADPr, we postulate that suboptimal 
translation-factor release decreased structural protein synthesis in NSC-34 
cells while failure to de-ADP-ribosylate regulatory RNA-binding proteins 
increased synthesis in C8-D1A cells."
1748,"Movement proteins (MPs) of plant viruses enable the translocation of viral 
genomes from infected to healthy cells through plasmodesmata (PD). The MPs 
functions involve the increase of the PD permeability and routing of viral 
genome both to the PD entrance and through the modified PD. Hibiscus green spot 
virus encodes two MPs, termed BMB1 and BMB2, which act in concert to accomplish 
virus cell-to-cell transport. BMB1, representing an NTPase/helicase 
domain-containing RNA-binding protein, localizes to the cytoplasm and the 
nucleoplasm. BMB2 is a small hydrophobic protein that interacts with the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and induces local constrictions of the ER 
tubules. In plant cells, BMB2 localizes to PD-associated membrane bodies (PAMBs) 
consisting of modified ER tubules and directs BMB1 to PAMBs. Here, we 
demonstrate that BMB1 and BMB2 interact in vitro and in vivo, and that their 
specific interaction is essential for BMB2-directed targeting of BMB1 to PAMBs. 
Using mutagenesis, we show that the interaction involves the C-terminal BMB1 
region and the N-terminal region of BMB2."
1749,"The H9N2 subtype of avian influenza virus (AIV) has been reported to infect not 
only birds, but also humans. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein is the main surface 
antigen of AIV and plays an important role in the viral infection. For treatment 
strategies and vaccine development, HA protein has been an important target for 
the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza A virus. To 
investigate the vital target determinant cluster in HA protein in this work, HA 
gene was cloned and expressed in the prokaryotic expression vector pET28a. The 
spleen lymphocytes from BALC/c mice immunized with the purified recombinant HA 
protein were fused with SP2/0 cells. After Hypoxanthine-Aminopterin-Thymidine 
(HAT) medium screening and indirect ELISA detection, six hybridoma cell lines 
producing anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were screened. The gradually truncated 
HA gene expression and western blotting were used to identify their major 
locations in epitopes specific to these monoclonal antibodies. It was found that 
the epitopes were located in three areas: 112NVENLEEL119, 117EELRSLFS124, and 
170PIQDAQ175. Epitope 112NVENLEEL119 has a partial amino acid crossover with 
117EELRSLFS124, which is located in the vestigial esterase domain ""110-helix"" of 
HA, and the monoclonal antibody recognizing these epitopes showed the 
neutralizing activity, suggesting that the region 112NVENLEELRSLFS124 might be a 
novel neutralizing epitope. The results of the homology analysis showed that 
these three epitopes were generally conserved in H9N2 subtype AIV, and will 
provide valuable insights into H9N2 vaccine design and improvement, as well as 
antibody-based therapies for treatment of H9N2 AIV infection."
1750,"Influenza virus infections and the continuing spread of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are global public health concerns. As there 
are limited therapeutic options available in clinical practice, the rapid 
development of safe, effective and globally available antiviral drugs is 
crucial. Drug repurposing is a therapeutic strategy used in treatments for newly 
emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. It has recently been shown that 
the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 is critical for influenza A virus 
entry, providing a potential target for antiviral strategies. Nisoldipine, a 
selective Ca2+ channel inhibitor, is commonly used in the treatment of 
hypertension. Here, we assessed the antiviral potential of nisoldipine against 
the influenza A virus and explored the mechanism of action of this compound. We 
found that nisoldipine treatment could potently inhibit infection with multiple 
influenza A virus strains. Mechanistic studies further revealed that nisoldipine 
impaired the internalization of the influenza virus into host cells. Overall, 
our findings demonstrate that nisoldipine exerts antiviral effects against 
influenza A virus infection and could serve as a lead compound in the design and 
development of new antivirals."
1751,"COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS 
CoV-2), is estimated to have caused over 6.5 million deaths worldwide. The 
emergence of fast-evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern alongside increased 
transmissibility and/or virulence, as well as immune and vaccine escape 
capabilities, highlight the urgent need for more effective antivirals to combat 
the disease in the long run along with regularly updated vaccine boosters. One 
of the early risk factors identified during the COVID-19 pandemic was that men 
are more likely to become infected by the virus, more likely to develop severe 
disease and exhibit a higher likelihood of hospitalisation and mortality rates 
compared to women. An association exists between SARS-CoV-2 infectiveness and 
disease severity with sex steroid hormones and, in particular, androgens. 
Several studies underlined the importance of the androgen-mediated regulation of 
the host protease TMPRSS2 and the cell entry protein ACE2, as well as the key 
role of these factors in the entry of the virus into target cells. In this 
context, modulating androgen signalling is a promising strategy to block viral 
infection, and antiandrogens could be used as a preventative measure at the pre- 
or early hospitalisation stage of COVID-19 disease. Different antiandrogens, 
including commercial drugs used to treat metastatic castration-sensitive 
prostate cancer and other conditions, have been tested as antivirals with 
varying success. In this review, we summarise the most recent updates concerning 
the use of antiandrogens as prophylactic and therapeutic options for COVID-19."
1752,"Anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV-1) is a pathogen that causes hemorrhagic disease 
in various farmed and wild freshwater eel species, resulting in significant 
economic losses. Although AngHV-1 has been detected in the American eel 
(Anguilla rostrata), its pathogenicity has not been well characterized. In this 
study, an AngHV-1 isolate, tentatively named AngHV-1-FC, was isolated from 
diseased American eels with similar symptoms as those observed in 
AngHV-1-infected European eels and Japanese eels. AngHV-1-FC induced severe 
cytopathic effects in the European eel spleen cell line (EES), and numerous 
concentric circular virions were observed in the infected EES cells by 
transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, AngHV-1-FC caused the same symptoms 
as the naturally diseased European eels and Japanese eels through experimental 
infection, resulting in a 100% morbidity rate and 13.3% mortality rate. The 
whole genome sequence analyses showed that the average nucleotide identity value 
between AngHV-1-FC and other AngHV-1 isolates ranged from 99.28% to 99.55%. 
However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that there was a genetic divergence 
between AngHV-1-FC and other AngHV-1 isolates, suggesting that AngHV-1-FC was a 
new isolate of AngHV-1. Thus, our results indicated that AngHV-1-FC can infect 
farmed American eels, with a high pathogenicity, providing new knowledge in 
regard to the prevalence and prevention of AngHV-1."
