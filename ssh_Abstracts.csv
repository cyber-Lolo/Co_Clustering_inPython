0,"This research attempts to put forward an argument against the claim that the current legal/political system of Iran is undergoing a re-secularization process. It is argued, by focusing on concepts of the secular and the sacred/religious, that the system was never de-secularized by the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The reason derives from the facts that the main allegedly religious content of the new system is per se a secular entity, and that the existing constitutional structure is overwhelmingly secular. The content overwhelmingly originates in fiqh which is argued to be a secular entity, i.e., an amoral one, as it accommodates immorality. It is then claimed that what occurred by the Revolution was indeed the triumph of a traditional secularism over an exogenous modern secular establishment. Therefore, since the early months of the new regime a process of re-modernization, an endogenous one, has gradually taken form."
1,"This research paper examines how Bangladeshi youth perceive the role of Islam in their everyday lives and how this, in turn, informs broader political participation and radicalism. The emphasis is on unpacking the politics of meaning-making of Islam at the informal and individual levels eschewing a high politics approach that constitutes formal institutions and structures. Drawing on field-data collected in 2017 and 2018, this paper offers insights on the politics of faith in the everyday lives of ordinary Bangladeshi youths whose individual socio-political actions are inspired by their perception of what Islam is but not devoid from the influence of structures of high politics that constantly shapes and reshapes these individualsperception of Islam. The findings indicate that divisions exist among young Bangladeshis about what Islam constitutes and means. Specifically, it was observed that an emerging trend is to advance the idea of Islam as a majoritarian religion through signs, symbols, and the politics of space. Within this context, narratives of good Muslim and bad Muslim manifest and contribute into justifications for radicalisation and even terror activities.

2,"Research shows the experience of awe is associated with a variety of benefits ranging from increased well-being and prosocial behavior to enhanced cognition. The adaptive purpose of awe, however, is elusive. In this article, we aim to show that the current framework used to conceptualize awe points towards higher-order cognition as the key adaptive function. This goes against past evolutionary positions that posit social benefits or unidimensional behavioral adaptations. In the second half of the article, we highlight a distinct cognitive advantage of awe. The literature connecting awe and cognition is surveyed and used to develop a view that situates awe as a critical component in the cognitive success of the human species.

3,"Disgust seems to play an important role in moral judgment. However, it is unclear whether the role of disgust in moral judgment is limited to certain kinds of moral domains (versus many) and/or certain types of disgust (versus many). To clarify these questions, we conducted a multilevel meta-analysis (k = 512; N = 72,443) on relations between trait disgust sensitivity and moral judgment (disgust-immorality association). Main analyses revealed a significant overall mean disgust-immorality association (r = .23). Additionally, moderator analyses revealed significant specificity in disgust type and moral domain (grounded in Moral Foundations Theory): effects were stronger for (a) sexual disgust compared to pathogen disgust, (b) sanctity moral judgments compared to other domains of moral judgments, and (c) sexual-sanctity associations compared to other disgust type-moral domain pairings.

4,"The enjoyment and pleasure derived from sad music has sparked fascination among researchers due to its seemingly paradoxical nature in producing positive affect. Research is yet to develop a comprehensive understanding of this paradox. Contradictory findings have resulted in a great variability within the literature, meaning results and interpretations can be difficult to derive. Consequently, this review collated the current literature, seeking to utilize the variability in the findings to propose a model of differential sad states, providing a means for past and future findings to be interpreted. The proposed model is based on theoretical understanding, as such it requires full empirical support. Comparisons to alternative models, theoretical, clinical, and cognitive implications, as well as future directions are discussed.

5,"Sympathy (empathic concern) is mainly understood as a feeling for another and is often contrasted with empathya feeling with another. However, it is not clear what feeling for another means and what emotions sympathy involves. Since empirical data suggests that sympathy plays an important role in our social lives and is more closely connected to helping behavior than empathy, we need a more detailed account. In this paper, I argue that sympathy is not a particular emotion but a type of emotional experience: those that have another person as focus. I explain what this means and show that this sheds light on why sympathy, rather than empathy, directly motivates altruistic actions.

6,"Plato's Republic lurks in cybernetics, a word popularly attributed to US American mathematician Norbert Wiener (18941964). In his accounts of how he came up with it, however, Wiener never mentions Plato, though he does note it was formed from the ancient Greek word kubern?t?s (navigator). Among the earliest popular books about the cybernetics craze are three published in France, and their authors show a special interest in the origin of cybernetics. In something like learned rebukes to Wiener, all three books credit Plato with significant use of kubern?-based terms. This article presents evidence, one, that Wiener knows well he has chosen a word with a Platonic history and, two, that Wiener deems the technical and social climate of ancient Athens (and of the Republic) instructive only as an anti-model for the mid-20th-century United States and so does not feel compelled to associate cybernetics with Plato. Instead, Wiener focuses on the challenges cybernetics and automation pose for his own engineering-oriented, capitalist, multiracial, democratic republic. Wiener's decisions not to use Plato as an authorizing force and not to put ancient Athens on a pedestal merit recognition, since subsequent writers link ancient Athens with cybernation via a presumption that cybernation will enable and fully democratize the sort of leisure activities, including thinking and participation in public life, deemed by some to be emblematic of ancient Athens.

7,"This article traces the career arc of Dutch psychoanalyst Joost A. M. Meerloo by examining his biography and his psychology of interrogation and confession. His life story, particularly his experiences during the German occupation of the Netherlands and his escape to England during World War II, shaped his views on these issues, as well as his rise to prominence as an expert on these topics in the United States. His psychoanalytic perspectives on interrogation and confession, including false confession, reflected the zeitgeist of the First Wave of Cold War interrogation tactics and related scholarship. His career as a scholar of interrogation faded with the study of distinct interrogation tactics used by communists during the Korean War, the emergence of experimental social psychology, and a growing cohort of scholars who rejected his psychoanalytic views in favor of more contemporary approaches. For these reasons, his work remains undervalued, increasing the risks that todays scholars will fail to recognize his larger contributions and his warnings about vulnerability and psychologistsroles in military interrogations. The article reviews the rise and fall of the career of Joost A. M. Meerloo as a scholar of Cold War interrogation, including his contributions and his unheeded warnings about vulnerability and psychologistsroles in military interrogations.

8,"Wants and desires are central to ordinary experience and to aesthetic, philosophical, and theological thought. Yet despite a burgeoning interest in the history of emotions research, their history as objects of scientific study has received little attention. This historiographical neglect mirrors a real one, with the retreat of introspection in the positivist human sciences of the early 20th century culminating in the relative marginalization of questions of psychic interiority. This article therefore seeks to explain an apparent paradox: the attempt to develop a comprehensive theory of why  we want what we wantin the 1940s by esteemed American neo-behavioristpsychologist Edward Tolman  a proponent of a methodology famous for its prohibition on appeals to unobservable mental phenomena. Though chiefly known today for his theory of cognitive maps, Tolman also sought to map the contours of desire as such, integrating Freudian and behaviorist models of the drivesto develop a complex iconography of the universal structures of motivation. Close attention to Tolman's striking maps offers a compelling limit case for what could and could not be captured within an anti-mentalist framework, and illuminates an important precursor to theories of motivational affectin the postwar cognitive and neurosciences. His work upsets a standard chronology that centers on the cognitive revolutionof the 1960s, and points to the significance of psychoanalysis to an earlier turn to cognitivism. Tolman concluded his theory pointed in the direction of more socialism a reminder of the politically labile anti-essentialism of behaviorism's commitment to mental plasticity.

9,"Could there be any academics on earth who have not yet noticed that the field of Positive Psychology has been growing in prominence over the last two decades? If so, it can only be because they are oblivious to happenings in the world around them. The leading US-based newspapers have run stories announcing that even the Ivy Leagueschools are setting new records for student attendance, with Harvard Universitys Positive Psychology class being designated as the most popular course in the history of the school. Likewise, Psychology and the Good Life stands as the most acclaimed class in Yale Universitys 316-year existence. And Martin Seligman, so often referred to as the father of modern Positive Psychology, concludes that principles of well-being should be taught in schools from elementary levels through higher education. The leaders in this school of thought herald it as an antidote to depression, a method for increasing life satisfaction and an aid to more creative thinking.

10,"Management research has attracted a plethora of research intending to optimize performance within and outside firms. We have seen plenty of progress in various dimensions; however, we also notice domains where the struggle still exists. This work tries to develop a theory of a hypothetical firm that goes beyond the current theories and takes inspiration from the texts of the Bhagavad Gita. We look at the theory of a hypothetical firm through the lens of the Bhagavad Gita. Precisely, this work theorizes about the three aspects of a firm: leadership, governance and motivation. Governance provides a structure to business management; leaderships play a pivotal role in converting inputs to desired outputs; and motivation acts as a catalyst in any process that builds and runs the firm. Moreover, this work integrates the understanding of certain shlokas of the Bhagavad Gita for theorizing.

11,"The union of human and divine wills is a concept that features abundantly in Christian spiritual literature. Yet, it gets very little hearing in most systematic works on theosis despite the fact that it offers a way of talking about the process of divinisation. I propose that the union of human and divine wills is the pinnacle of the virtue of obedience, and that the union in turn constitutes a pathway to divinization. I map this trajectory in St John of the Cross and plot his works as a vademecum on the way to deification. Finally, I consider Johns understanding of the impact of this supernatural union on the human body as well as the role of the latter in deification. Despite uncovering unexpected resources for embodied theosis in Johns writings, I also list major omissions with regards to his (reconstructed) spiritual theology concerning the body transformed by union.

12,"Truth is an ethical relation. Facts, whether descriptions of the physical world or of historical events, are necessarily mediated by our frames of reference. This contingency opens a space for disagreement that cannot be adjudicated by an absolute standard of truth. For those seeking power or profit, the temptation to exploit this state of undecidability is strong. When many question the institutions that broker meaning  science, the professions, the media  rumors, misinformation, deliberate distortions and falsehoods all proliferate. In the digital age, the madeis swiftly supplanted by the made-up. The remedy for this predicament is not technological or factual, but ethical and social. The normative resources for this project lie in our everyday ethic of communication and in the ideal of democracy as shared authority. Whether we can address this predicament effectively is uncertain. But the nature of the problem is clear: It is not that we live in a post-truthage, but rather that we are facing a crisis of democratic society as such. It is not so much that we lost sight of truth, as that we have lost sight of one another.
"
13,"Despite Jean-Paul Sartre and Cornelius Castoriadis placing the imagination centre stage in their respective conceptual theories, little work has been done to bring them into conversation on this issue or, indeed, any other. This is perhaps not surprising given Sartres early work on this topic has tended to be downplayed in favour of his affirmation of freedom, while Castoriadis not only denigrates Sartres thinking generally and his account of the imagination specifically but also posits their relationship as one of opposition. In contrast, this article brings them into conversation on the question of the imagination to call into question Castoriadis assessment of their relation. To do so, I outline Sartres position in The Imaginary, showing that Castoriadis assessment of Sartres notion is based on a problematic, if common, misunderstanding of Sartres notion of nothingness and its relationship to creativity. Having overcome the opposition that Castoriadis affirms between their respective positions, I argue that, while there certainly are differences between their positions, there are also important points of agreement and overlap between them, especially regarding the constitutive role that the imagination plays for consciousness, and the relationships between the imagination and freedom and the imagination and creativity, that point to a shared and original approach.
"
14,"What role do normative ideals play in politics? Since Rawls, many political philosophers have advocated what they take to be a Kantian answer to this question. Normative ideals organize and guide political decision-making and action, and a major task of political philosophy is to generate them. Recently, this position has come under renewed scrutiny among political thinkers identifying as realists and nonideal theorists. These critics argue that ideal theory is too remote from empirical politics. This article turns to Kant for an alternative conception of ideals that is both distinct from the Rawlsian account and better withstands the critiques of realists and nonideal theorists. It argues that, for Kant, ideals are aids to freedom; their aim is to guide us towards forms of autonomy we have yet to fully realize. This leaves us with a much stronger view of ideals than does ideal theory.
"
15,"This article argues that late Heideggers analyses of the Fourfold can be used as a methodological starting point for discourse analyses. It argues that the Fourfold points out elements or foundations of discursive structures that orient us to differing, and to some extent opposing, directions that are at the same time mutually interdependent. A discursive analysis of how the Fourfold is at play in prevailing discursive exchanges and structures will thus be a matter of situating ourselves in a conceptual space beyond existing practices and structures, from which we get a picture of their inadequacies. As such, the article contributes to a critical understanding of discourse analysis. It will be argued that through understanding the Fourfold, we can better understand the problems with various aspects of measuring, which are founded upon the (concealed) instability of elements of the Fourfold  which shapes practical discursive engagements. By foregrounding this structural instability we can approach it critically. I demonstrate how this approach might be used in an analysis of a debate between Greta Thunberg and BjÃ¸rn Lomborg.

16,"What is cultural appropriation? What is cultural appreciation? Whatever the complex answer to this question, cultural appropriation is commonly defined as the taking of something produced by members of one culture by members of another(Young 2005: 136), whilst appreciation is typically understood as mere exploration: Appreciation explores whatever is there. (Gracyk 2007: 112). These provisional definitions suggest that there is an in-principle distinction between the two concepts that presupposes the following: what is appreciated is already available; what is appropriated was, prior to its being taken, not already there or available. Moreover, perhaps appreciation, when contrasted to appropriation, is unproblematic precisely due to this basic difference.
In this paper, we argue that the exclusive disjunction  appropriation or appreciation  rests on a false distinction between the two. We also show that this distinction presupposes a false normative principle that to the extent that x is appreciation rather than appropriation, then x is not  relevant to this issue  a wrong. Against these presuppositions, we defend the view that appropriation is already built into appreciation. This does not mean that we cannot ask questions of appreciation, but that questions of appreciation do not preclude the problematics of appropriation."
17,"The expropriation of the expropriatorsis a delicious turn of phrase, one that Marx even compares to Hegels infamous negation of the negation. But what does it mean, and is it still relevant today? Before I analyse the content of Marxs expression, I briefly consider contemporary legal understandings of expropriation, as well as some examples of it. In the remainder of the essay, I spell out different kinds of expropriation in Marx and focus on an ambiguity at the core of the notion of expropriating the expropriators, namely, whether it describes an immanent and objective tendency within the development of the capitalist mode of production or else actively prescribes a form of revolutionary political praxis for the working class. My answer is that it does both, though not without tension. Finally, I develop some implications of these reflections by showing how the concept of expropriation can be put to use today, in struggles around housing, climate and work.

19,"Popper and Agassi diverged on nationalism. Popper was a trenchant critic whereas Agassi formed a theory of liberal nationalism. At the root of their disagreement was Poppers refusal of Jewish identity and rejection of Zionism, in contrast with Agassis affirmation of progressive Jewishness and liberal Zionism. Both Agassi and Popper, however, rejected ethnonationalism. To hedge against it, they ignored the claims of ethnocultural communities. This essay will highlight Agassis liberal theory of the nation state but urge that we overcome Critical Rationalistsinstinctive aversion to ethnicity, and accommodate ethnocultural communities. We should also explore again both Poppers democratic imperialism and cosmopolitan diasporas, to think a future beyond nationalism.
"
20,"This paper presents Agassis views of morality and ethics. Agassi proposes a non-reductive psychological theory of moral judgments, complemented by duties, and a psychological hypothesis regarding the psychological and social conditions that invite openness to criticism. His opposition to moralism, his objection to justification, his emphasis on red lines and grey areas, and his rejection of abstract moral debates in favor of public moralism result in a distinct approach to moral philosophy that is in conflict with most of the mainstream work in this field. Following Socrates, he takes education for autonomy as the critical rationalist life-style.
"
21,"Joseph Agassi, together with Yehuda Fried, presented the paradoxes of paranoia and proposed to explain and solve them by introducing innovative diagnostic criteria for psychosis as reflecting a specific kind of rationality. Their ethical-clinical framework however, discouraged discussion of placing impositions on the mentally ill, even when in danger. According to these very criteria, Agassis institutional individualism framework renders paranoiacs defective in autonomy. Introducing the idea of degrees of autonomy as a guiding principle for research and practice will promote responsible commitment to the mentally ill and to all other persons in society.

22,"Public funders of health research have been widely criticized on the grounds that their allocations of funding for disease-specific research do not reflect the relative burdens imposed by different diseases. For example, the US National Institutes of Health spends a much greater fraction of its budget on HIV/AIDS research and a much smaller fraction on migraine research than their relative contribution to the US burden of disease would suggest. Implicit in this criticism is a normative claim: Insofar as the scientific opportunities are equal, each patient merits research into their condition proportional to the burden of disease for which that condition is responsible. This claimthe proportional viewis widely accepted but has never been fully specified or defended. In this paper, I explain what is required to specify the view, attempt to do so in the most charitable way, and then critically evaluate its normative underpinnings. I conclude that a severity-weighted proportional view is defensible. I close by drawing out five key lessons of my analysis for health research priority-setting.

23,"Polarization often happens asymmetrically. One political actor radicalizes, and the results reverberate through the political system. This is how the deep divisions in contemporary American politics arose: the Republican Party radicalized. Republican officeholders began to use extreme legislative tactics. Republican voters became animated by contempt for their political rivals and by the defense of their own social superiority. The party as a whole launched a wide-ranging campaign of voter suppression and its members endorsed violence in the face of electoral defeat. This paper is about how such asymmetric polarization affects everyone elses obligations. My core claim is that two kinds of relationship  civic friendship and non-subordination  underpin critical democratic norms. Republican misbehavior has severed cross-partisan civic friendships. Their authoritarianism forfeits their claim to non-subordination. The former means that non-Republicans need not justify policy on public grounds. The latter undercuts Republicansclaim to enjoy minority vetoes when out of power and it gives their rivals reason to disobey the laws that Republicans make when they are in power. More generally, when one political actor contravenes the proper norms of democratic politics, their opposition is not bound by those norms.
"
24,"Concern for corporate influence on democratic decisions has mostly focused on campaign funding and access to legislators. While these are certainly worrisome, corporations have another tool to influence decisions, which they are increasingly using. They can threaten to move their operations or cancel expansion plans in a municipality unless its public officials pass (or kill) certain policies. In one sense, this is business as usual. Companies have the right to decide where to operate, and it is important for officials to consider how policy will impact local businesses that provide jobs and tax revenue. On the other hand, companies can use these threats to get their way on any policy, whether or not it impacts them. How do we tell when this kind of corporate action is illegitimate? We argue that such actions are illegitimate when they violate democratic norms of reason-giving, which occurs when companies offer the public created rather than natural reasons for their proposed policy.

25,"The pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders since March 2020 have come at a high cost to lives and livelihoods around the globe including ways in which faith communities meet. This paper forms part of a wider study Exploring hope, grace, and resilience in parish communities in COVID-19 times. It investigates how members of Christian faith communities in Melbourne (Australia) made meaning of their understanding of hope during the pandemic. The authors draw on survey data gathered between November 2021 and mid-March 2022 and using thematic analysis they discuss two overarching themes (Light despite the darkness and Connection to God). While generalisations to other faith communities cannot be made, the findings indicate churches fostered hope and offered a sense of belonging. The paper discusses implications for ways in which churches can continue to build faith with church members and the wider community in the changing landscape of the pandemic.

26,"This essay represents the first formal attempt to identify themes of theosis within the Ethiopian Orthodox Taw???do Church (EOTC). The first half explores four historical phases in the development of the doctrine of theosis: Ancient Pagan, Biblical, Patristic, and Medieval and Modern. It is argued that theosis finds strong support in the biblical corpus but that it is best to clarify which historical type one has in view due to its complex development. The second half of the paper considers themes of theosis within three genres of Ethiopic literature: Hagiography, Liturgy, and National Epic. New discoveries and insights are leveraged in order to demonstrate that although theosis lacks a precise equivalent in Classical Ethiopic, the literature of the EOTC demonstrates a strong familiarity with the basic contours of the doctrine of deification.

27,"Putting feelings into words, or affect labeling, can attenuate our emotional experiences. However, unlike explicit emotion regulation techniques, affect labeling may not even feel like a regulatory process as it occurs. Nevertheless, research investigating affect labeling has found it produces a pattern of effects like those seen during explicit emotion regulation, suggesting affect labeling is a form of implicit emotion regulation. In this review, we will outline research on affect labeling, comparing it to reappraisal, a form of explicit emotion regulation, along four major domains of effectsexperiential, autonomic, neural, and behavioralthat establish it as a form of implicit emotion regulation. This review will then speculate on possible mechanisms driving affect labeling effects and other remaining unanswered questions.

28,"The nature of envy has recently been the subject of a heated debate. Some researchers see envy as a complex, yet unitary construct that despite being hostile in nature can lead to both hostile and nonhostile reactions. Others offer a dual approach to envy, in which envys outcomes reflect two types of envy: benign envy, involving upward motivation, and malicious envy, involving hostility against superior others. We compare these competing conceptualizations of envy in an adversarial (yet collaborative) review. Our goal is to aid the consumers of envy research in navigating the intricacies of this debate. We identify agreements and disagreements and describe implications for theory, methodology, and measurement, as well as challenges and opportunities for future work.

29,"Researchers have proposed that blocking facial feedback via glabellar-region botulinum toxin injections (GBTX) can reduce depression. Random-effects meta-analyses of studies that administered GBTX to individuals with depression indicate that, 6 weeks postintervention, GBTX groups were significantly less depressed compared to placebo groups (d = 0.83) and pretreatment levels (d = 1.57). However, we noted the following concerns: (a) effect sizes were extraordinarily large, (b) authors failed to provide information to compute 51% of relevant effect sizes, (c) 96% of effect sizes came from studies conducted by investigators with conflicts of interest, (d) there is some evidence of publication bias, and (e) studies used ineffective blinding procedures. These considerations suggest that confidence in GBTX as a treatment for depression is premature.

30,"This article examines whether the Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Act 2009 (Cth) provides adequate protections for artists working with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Focussing on Indigenous Australian artists and the context within which they work, the article assesses whether smart contracts embedded in NFTs provide more secure access to royalties for visual artists, as compared with the Act. The article then considers how the Act can be reformed to provide more comprehensive protections that meet the needs of Indigenous Australian artists working with NFTs.

31,"This article explores how the economic impacts of violence can continue long after a relationship has ended and how the family law system is a generally unhelpful tool for financial recovery from abuse. Hurdles in the legal system such as the unavailability of legal aid and the absence of affordable legal representation, lack of legislative reforms in relation to property division in cases of violence, and difficulties in enforcing orders, compound experiences of violence and entrench poverty. Reforms to improve the family law property system for victims of violence are suggested.

32,"This article discusses the recent repeal of the death penalty in Papua New Guinea and examines some potential implications for considerations to decriminalise same-sex sexual activity and sex work in the country. It considers that, while the repeal of the death penalty was a significant milestone for human rights domestically and internationally, the dominance of Christian morals evident in propelling the repeal deepens the challenge for law reform on issues of moral bearing, most notably the decriminalisation of same-sex sexual activity and sex work. The article further analyses the political conditions to conclude that for those considering law reform, there may be better prospects through the Supreme Court by way of a constitutional validity challenge than through the Parliament.

33,"For more than half a century, Australian states and territories have criminalised the distinct offence of inciting another person to commit suicide. The maximum penalties for these offences vary and require the accused to have intended that the victim would commit suicide. In contrast, the offence of involuntary manslaughter does not require such an intention. Instead, a charge of manslaughter requires that the accused acted in a conscious and voluntary way that caused the victims death, and that their conduct was either criminally negligent or unlawful and dangerous. Drawing on cases from the United States and United Kingdom, this article suggests that in appropriate circumstances in Australia, especially in the context of family violence, offenders should be held criminally liable for manslaughter if they cause another person to commit suicide.

35,"The presumption of doli incapax is a legal safeguard for children who contravene the criminal law. Four distinct thresholds emerge from the application of doli incapax across the Australian jurisdictions: actual knowledge that the offending conduct was seriously wrong; actual knowledge that the offending conduct was wrong; capacity to know that the offending conduct should not occur; and capacity to know that the offending conduct was seriously wrong. This article explores differences in the four doli incapax thresholds and suggests a uniform approach to the presumption is required to correct the jurisdictional inconsistency.

36,"The decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in Benjamin v Kalio has been praised. However, the route taken by the Court to do justice and its implication have never been considered. This article examines the route through which the Supreme Court of Nigeria arrived at justice in this case. The article finds that the Supreme Court of Nigeria overruled its previous judgments by holding that unregistered land instruments could be tendered in evidence because section 20 of the Land Instruments (Preparation and Registration) Law of Rivers State is unconstitutional for not being within the legislative competence of States. The article argues that this is a simplistic route to justice having not taken cognisance of the Nigerian federalism and the concepts of existing and deemed laws with the probable consequence of rendering such laws on presumptions as section 30 of the Criminal Code and section 50 of the Penal Code null and void. The article concludes that this tends to constitute a pitfall.

37,"In considering the protection of fundamental rights in Hong Kong, the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap 383) (BORO) tend to be the dual focus. However, common law principles protective of fundamental rights continue to apply. These include principles of statutory interpretation such as the principle of legality (the presumption that general or ambiguous words in legislation are insufficient to interfere with certain common law rights) and the presumption that legislation is to be interpreted consistently with international treaties. This article considers the role of these common law interpretive principles in Hong Kong, and, in particular, the scope for their application in light of the Basic Law and the BORO. It concludes that the protection of fundamental rights in Hong Kong will continue to focus on the Basic Law and the BORO for so long as the current constitutional arrangements persist. However, the courts ought to take care to pay due regard to the relevant common law interpretive principles, including the stringency of the test of necessary implication where a statutory interference with rights is not express, and the potential for the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to be relevant to statutory interpretation.

38,"The common law on vicarious liability is unsatisfactory because the doctrine is couched at such a high level of generality that it cannot yield predictable results when applied to a given fact situation. This paper is an attempt to inject some precision into the doctrine. It examines and rejects three justifications for the doctrine: effective compensation/risk spreading, deterrence and certain theories related to quid pro quo. It then proposes the most suitable justification for the doctrine: vicarious liability is imposed because and when the defendant, by placing the tortfeasor in the position in its organisation that it did with that position's accompanying privileges and demands, had created or significantly enhanced the risk of the claimants injury. Three implications follow from this justification: (1) there is no vicarious liability for the wrongful acts of independent contractors; (2) agency reasoning should be rejected; and (3) we should stop using the phrase enterprise-risk approach.
"
39,"This paper considers how three jurisdictions, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, have sought to reconcile freedom of religion with equality rights, particularly in the commercial context, and particularly in relation to sexual orientation. The recent decisions of the United Kingdom Supreme Court and United States Supreme Court form the backdrop for that discussion. It is argued that the former made piecemeal, and misleading, use of American case law, and a fuller consideration of that jurisdictions position was warranted, and would have led to a different view of the recent American decision. It argues that the United Kingdom Supreme Court was in error in viewing a message on a cake ordered from a baker as an example of the baker's expression, leading it to an incorrect conclusion at odds with statutory mandates in the commercial sphere around refusals of service. Both high court decisions risk undermining progress on the equality front.

40,"It is commonly understood that contract law and property law are different areas of law which address different issues. This article departs from this conventional position in a rather radical way by arguing that the conclusion, amendment, and termination of contracts are in fact property law transactions and that the strict divide between contract law and property law is therefore not justifiable. It demonstrates theoretical and practical implications as contract law must be redefined and aligned with the general property law framework to avoid inconsistencies and thus the violation of the notion of formal rationality.

41,"The difficulties in balancing judicial independence and accountability, the importance of formal processes around the investigation of judicial conduct, and the need for clarity on the respective roles of the branches of government under the separation of powers were all issues that were highlighted by the recent controversy surrounding the conduct of a Supreme Court Judge in Ireland. This article considers the detail of the controversy, in the context of the Irish system governing judicial discipline and removal, analyses certain problems underlined by the episode, and finally reflects on lessons that may be helpful for any jurisdiction grappling with the complex issues involving judicial discipline and removal.

42,"While it is true that the expanded use of health information and electronic health records (eHRs) can help deliver better healthcare, there remains the need to reconcile citizens legitimate concerns for privacy protection and confidentiality in the use of their personal health data, and the potential for violation of their privacy. Under the Hong Kongs Electronic Health Record Sharing System (eHRSS), the eHR of the individual patient can be accessed and shared between healthcare providers for healthcare-related purposes. Although the Electronic Health Record Sharing System Ordinance (Cap 625) (the eHRSSO) and the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap 486) (the PD(P)O) provide protection for personal data and patients privacy, the eHRSS has come under greater scrutiny given the rise in data breaches experienced globally and in Hong Kong. The articles objective is twofold. It first examines the eHRSS specifically with regard to some of the more pertinent provisions of the eHRSSO and the PD(P)O, to critically evaluate the extent to which these provisions ensure and protect patient privacy. Thence it offers suggestions and recommendations as to how protection for patient privacy can be enhanced and, indeed, altogether better ensured.

43,"Media is often termed as the fourth pillar of India; it is an indispensable part in keeping democracy alive and reaching out to the masses. The media plays an instrumental role in educating and delivering the truth to people. However, in recent times, the media has exceeded its role by bringing its lens into the courtrooms and setting up its own trials, parallelly. The transition from responsible reporting to investigating various high-profile cases or cases of infamous crimes has made the media trial a common practice. From aiming to grab the highest television rating points to trying to stay relevant in the changing times, the media has overstepped its own boundary. The unconscious transition in its role has not only interfered with the fair administration of justice but also pressurised the judiciary to act in a certain way. It has, also, hampered the fundamental and constitutional rights of both the accused and the victim of a crime. The courts have always, unfailingly, guarded the freedom of press, and they continue to do so. However, the judiciary sensed trouble in certain cases when the media began to deliver its own verdict before the evidence was verified or the guilt proved. It is here that the need to demarcate a line arose in order to ensure the media remains well within its job of fair reporting. In an attempt to contain this adverse effect of the media, the legislature and the judiciary have attempted to frame rules and guidelines to that effect. This article attempts to discuss the various facets of media trials and the laws pertaining to them.

44,"The meteoric rise of the digital platforms and their increasing dominance can be easily considered the highlight of the latter half of the previous decade. Even though antitrust laws do apply to such online markets, the determination of the competitive strength of in these digital markets was often determined by the quantum of data accumulated by the entities. The article is an attempt by the authors to evaluate the feasibility of applicability of the existing competition law framework to the growing platform economies and the resultant implications of personal data being collected by such entities. For this research, the authors have outlined three specific questions. First, what is the inter-relation between the growing platform economy and merger control regime of a country? Second, what are the possible avenues of concerns that may arise due to collection of personal data? Finally, what are the possible enforcement challenges that would hamper the applicability of existing competition regimes to the digital platforms? The research is doctrinal research, and the authors have adopted a comparative-analytical research methodology for evaluating the above-mentioned research questions. The authors have considered the jurisdictions of the EU and India as the geographical scope for the research. The authors consider the following upon the conclusion of the study. First, the use and access of this data after the merger with companies with low turnover confer the acquiring enterprise a market power by which it can have an edge over its competitors in the market which will ultimately harm the competition in the market. Second, the digital market is data-driven; hence, collection of copious amounts of data places the big-tech players in a position of control, allowing them to indulge in exclusionary and exploitative conduct. Third, the assessment basis of combinations, more specifically in cases of data-based entities within the competition law, needs a serious re-assessment to include data within the scope of assessment as it is the primary asset in such cases.

45,"This case note reports on the judgment of the Court of Justice in case C-673/20 EP. The decision clarified that British nationals lost their EU citizenship status following the UK's withdrawal from the Union. After giving an overview of the facts of the case and summarizing the opinion of AG Collins and the Court's reasoning, this contribution critically engages with the judgment and reflects on its place in the Court's jurisprudence on Union citizenship.

46,"The principle that in all actions relating to children () the child's best interests must be a primary consideration (Article 24(2) EU Charter of Fundamental Rights) is widely applied by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). This article considers preliminary rulings in which the CJEU had recourse to the best interests of the child as the criterion for settling the dispute in the main proceeding. For analytical purposes, these cases may be grouped in two clusters: cases resembling child custody disputes, and other cases. It is argued that, in the light of the varied factual circumstances of the judicial disputes, the application of the criterion of best interests of the child as primary consideration warrants further scrutiny. To this end, this article identifies and assesses a practical and a conceptual challenge to the widespread application of the criterion. The former posits that the criterion is indeterminate, and this article considers whether drawing from Article 3 of the Convention on the Right of the Child may help in solving the uncertainty; the latter maintains that the test is unjust and self-defying, a critique that this article finds only partially founded, for cases resembling child custody disputes.
"
47,"Temporariness of refugee protection has started to emerge as a new standard in the policies of European countries. Given this development, the article focuses on one specific issue related to this temporariness: how refugee status intertwines with the conditions for the granting, revocation and prolongation of national residence permits. What are the interconnections between refugee status, including its cessation and revocation, on the one hand, and national residence permits and their revocation and prolongation, on the other? How are these interconnections regulated by international law, EU law and national law (with Sweden as an example)? Inaddition to the detailed analysis of the relevant legal norms, the article situates the questions within a more general discussion about residence in the national community. In this way, it is shown how temporariness creates tensions at national level where the refugee qua resident in the national community, benefits from safeguards in favour of individual certainty. This explains why residence permits, as opposed to refugee status, have central organizing role at national level.

48,"Based on the guidelines issued by the European Securities and Market Authority and by the European Banking Authority, the article deals with the legal qualification of blockchain-based crypto-assets under EU law. Focusing on crypto-assets that function as a) investment instruments (that is, investment tokens) and as b) electronic money (that is, payment tokens), the work outlines shortages and drawbacks in the applicability and enforcement of existing EU legal frameworks regulating investment activities and payment services. With such analysis, the article seeks to inform the ongoing debate within European institutions on the need of regulatory intervention in this area, and it points out pressing questions to be tackled by further research.

49,"This article examines, within Chinas complex healthcare sector, the extent to which Chinas legal frameworks can adapt to a data-driven context that requires the reconciliation of public and private interests for the use of health data. Current data-processing mechanisms operate through individual consent, and administrative authorisation in mobile health settings are insufficient and ineffective to meet societal needs while simultaneously protecting individuals interests. In light of this shift of regulation from individual control to collective governance, this article argues that the principle of the right to health may complement this collective governance model. The right to health principle emphasises solidarity, justice, confidentiality, and collective responsibility, which may balance power asymmetries in the use of health data among different stakeholders. The article proposes a solution that incorporates the states obligation with private actors responsibilities, while stressing the importance of data sharing and the fair use of health data.

50,"In 2018, Australian paramedics entered the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for Health Practitioners. The scheme represented a significant change in the way paramedics were regulated and able to self-identify. Equally, it brought substantial changes to the individual accountability and responsibilities of practitioners. Response to these reforms was largely positive; however, diverse views existed on the intent and impacts of the scheme. Paramedics were surveyed immediately before registration commencement to examine their views concerning the new regulatory framework. Supportive views included acknowledgement of regulations public safety function and potential advancement of the profession. Dissenting views predicted increased practitioner risk and degradation of working conditions. Importantly, this study explores how members of the same profession can have diverse views of the same regulatory scheme. This study supports the notion that paramedicine consists of diverse subcultures with differing worldviews. This presents challenges in ensuring cohesive professional engagement with regulation and the evolution of the profession.

51,"This article assesses the regulatory framework relating to over-the-counter (OTC) sales of antibiotics for human use in India. The OTC sale of antibiotics is recognised as a pathway for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR); a serious public health challenge in need of urgent regulatory responses. Analytically, this article identifies opportunities within existing laws in India and highlights gaps that need to be filled by modifying existing laws or developing new ones. Conceptually, it suggests a need to reflect on the limits of traditional, top-down, command-and control regulation and to think about alternative approaches. The article therefore advocates for an approach to regulation that incorporates two elements. First, it argues for a broader concept of regulation that encompasses binding as well as non-binding regulatory instruments and initiatives aimed at influencing stakeholder behaviour (including soft regulation, economic incentives, information campaigns and uses of technology). Second, it makes the case for enhanced stakeholder participation in regulatory design. The article will be relevant for health policy and drug regulators in India and other low- and middle-income countries, as well as legal scholars, social scientists and others interested in the regulation of OTC sales of antibiotics for AMR containment.

52,"COVID-19 has significantly impacted all aspects of maternity services in the United Kingdom, exacerbating the fact that choice is insufficiently centred within the maternity regime. In this article, we focus on the restrictions placed on homebirthing services by some National Health Service Trusts in response to the virus. In March 2020, around a third of Trusts implemented blanket policies suspending their entire homebirth service. We argue that the failure to protect choice about place of birth during the pandemic may not only be harmful to birthing peoples physical and mental health, but also that it is legally problematic as it may, in some instances, breach human rights obligations. We also voice concerns about the possibility that in the absence of available homebirthing services people might choose to freebirth. While freebirthing (birthing absent any medical or midwifery support) is not innately problematic, it is concerning that people may feel forced to opt for this.

53,"The modern, global food system is unsustainable for both human and planetary health. The widespread consumption of highly processed foods and use of production systems that negatively affect the environment have led to a rise in nutrition-related diseases and exacerbated the effects of climate change. A comprehensive reform of global food systems and diets is needed to effectively respond to this problem, but the interference of food industry actors in health negotiations is diluting health policies at both domestic and international levels. This article establishes the concrete value of international legal responses grounded in human rights for tackling the global syndemic of climate change and malnutrition. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) exemplifies how normative conflicts between the trade and health regimes can be overcome. Forming an effective and egalitarian response to malnutrition and climate change will require a rights-based, regime interaction approach that prioritizes human and planetary health over private interests.

54,"Noting that 2022 marked the 45th anniversary of the Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions  the first treaties that explicitly noted the relationship between international human rights law and international humanitarian law - this column reflects on how the relationship between these two bodies of law has developed since 1977. It demonstrates that while much progress has been made internationally towards understanding the relationship between two bodies of law, there are still obstacles to be overcome if the goal is to apply the two bodies of law in a complementary fashion and achieve the maximum protection of the human person.

55,"Black Lives Matter is having a profound impact on how individuals and communities view their repressive histories and their present environments. The movement has greatly influenced the questioning of everyday landscapes and the role of official memory in the erection, maintenance, or removal of monuments and memorials. In this column, I shed light on these phenomena, and highlight the tensions that exist between the acknowledgement and removal of racist or problematic memorials and statues and the protection of historical monuments and cultural heritage more generally. A human rights approach to memorialization would be a step in the right direction, while recognizing that the imperatives of the present shape memorialization efforts. It calls on those in the human rights field to continue pressing for critical reflection and debate around racism and memory landscapes, and to call out and expose racism in all of its forms in order to bring about social change.

56,"On 14 June 2018, Russias national football team will play against Saudi Arabia for the opening match of this years football World Cup held in Russia. In the subsequent month, more than 3 billion people are expected to follow this mega-sporting event (MSE) on television.1 What the people behind their screens will see are state-of-the-art stadiums with the newest technology, each costing hundreds of millions of dollars.2 What most of the viewers are not aware of, however, is that during the building of these stadiums tens of thousands of workers were exposed to severe human rights violations.3 Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other human rights groups documented the structural exploitation of workers, including non-payment or severe delays in payment of wages, working in unsafe conditions leading to injuries, and the death of 17 workers, as well as forced illegal work due to lack of employment contracts and other documentation.4 Lack of proof of any employment relation made it extremely difficult for workers to complain about these exploitative practices. If workers managed to file a complaint, they were threatened by their employers with retaliation and non-payment of wages.5 Journalists and human rights advocates who tried to investigate and report on these conditions have been working under constant suspicion and intimidation. Journalists have been arrested during their investigations, held in detention and faced with criminal charges.6

57,"Lenin said, We do not regard Marxs theory as something completed and inviolable; on the contrary, we are convinced that it has only laid the foundation stone of the science which socialists must develop in all directions if they wish to keep pace with life. Marx himself believed in the principle of ruthless criticism of everything existing. Critiquing and revising certain ideas to strengthen an approach to society is a constructive act. But the legitimate act of revision becomes revision-ism, when the fundamental tenets of Marxism are revised in order to attack  negate  its very explanatory or scientific foundation and to justify political reformism. Indeed, since Lenins time, scientific socialism has been under attack from not only the ruling class and its ideologues, but also those who associate themselves with Marxism itself, including in academia. The latter are revisionist Marxists. For them, Marxism has some usefulness. But they deny the superiority of Marxism as a way of critically and scientifically interpreting the world and transforming that world in the interest of the exploited and oppressed masses in a revolutionary socialist manner. This denial of Marxisms superiority takes the form of the denial of Marxisms central concepts: class and capitalism. The article discusses, and critiques, various forms of revisionist Marxism (e.g. Analytical Marxism, Polanyian Marxism, Post-Modernist Marxism, and Geographical Marxism). Revisionism does respond to some recent developments in the world (e.g. the defeat of class-based movements; the complexity of class structure), but it seeks to explain these not on the basis of Marxist foundations but on the basis of scientifically inadequate ideas and in a manner that is politically reformist.
"
58,"There are at least five obstacles to the viability of ideology critique as a method of analysis in current conditions: (1) there is no ideology-free, Gods-eye view through which the critical theorist can analyze other ideologies; (2) few people really believe in explicit ideological justifications for exploitation and domination today, a widespread skepticism that could annul the warrant for ideology critique; (3) conspiracy theories and identity politics have superseded more universalistic and structural forms of critique, which, due to their real and superficial similarities with ideology critique, represent troublesome competitors; (4) ecological degradation is undermining the possibility of the free future that ideology critique implicitly anticipates; and (5) due to the decline of radical labor movements and near-absolute control of consciousness by the culture industry, the audience for ideology critique is so small and distracted that thoughtful, written analyses of ideology may be pointless. Despite these obstacles, I defend ideology critique as a viable and beneficial method. Barrier (5) is the only obstacle that I think has the potential to deliver a death blow to ideology critique in the foreseeable future.
"
59,"Racialisation is a Marxist concept that has been utilised to understand racism patterns and reproduction in Western societies for more than three decades. In Marxist parlance, racialisation is the ideological process through which the state racialised a section of the population (ethnic minorities) for political purposes. The centrality of the state in racialisation discourse has inhibited the class basis that underpins racialisation. This article articulates the class analysis of racialisation, positing that racialisation stems from racism ideology that the Western ruling class utilised to divide the people along the ethnic line as a means of preserving and maintaining ruling class influence and prestige in society and protecting the capitalist system from being challenged by the unity of the people along the class line. Racialisation is utilised to reproduce racism, using media, laws, regulations and institutional practices to entrench division and disunity in society and preserve their control system under capitalism. In discussing the future of racism, this article critiques the current anti-racism campaign/movement founded and rooted in race discourse and race consciousness and argues that a shift from race consciousness to racialised consciousness is pivotal towards deconstruction and eradicating all vestiges of racism in the global society. The article concludes that racialised consciousness would act as a political unifier in anti-racism campaigns and connects the struggles of Black working and middle class with that of the White working and middle class in terms of collaboration and solidarity, to collectively challenge the capitalist system that is responsible for oppression, inequality and racism on class lines.
"
60,"While tensions over historical issues between Japan and South Korea have long served to impede US strategic goals in East Asia, mainstream International Relations theory has largely been unable to explain the stubborn persistence of such issues. Instead, I interpret East Asias post-war history through the lens of Gramscis concept of passive revolution, thereby situating the history problem in the context of the dialectical relations between state (re)formation, geopolitical contestation and transnational capital accumulation in the post-war era. I argue that US intervention in 1945 was a process in which a set of statesociety relations was established whereby democratising tendencies from below were repressed through the establishment of US-aligned capitalist regimes. This implied the partial restoration of certain aspects of the pre-1945 regimes in a manner that served to forestall any genuine coming to terms with past colonial history. Gramscis concept of passive revolution thus provides a framework for rethinking how bilateral relations between countries can be explained with reference to the broader dynamics of geopolitical contestation, transnational capital accumulation and the dynamics of statesociety contestation within national social formations. While existing empirical applications of passive revolution have typically focused on particular national instances of state formation and transformation, I argue that the concept can be utilised to analyse the region-wide processes whereby the US empire was established in the aftermath of the Second World War, and by extension, how supranational processes of passive revolution subsequently generated their own tensions and contradictions as manifested in contested bilateral relations between states.
"
61,"This article brings in the concept of the neoliberal model of development as a corrective to the prevailing emphasis in the literature that usefully describes neoliberalism as a nationally diverging phenomenon but does not adequately examine the mid-range trans-national/global regulatory connection or the logics of national convergence. By extending the concept of regulation and specifying the national trans-national connection, this article revises the original Parisian French Regulation School conception of a model of development and makes it applicable to the contemporary neoliberal era. It then applies this revised conception to help explain contemporary patterns of national convergence and divergence. In particular, with reference to Marxs theory of the relative surplus population, this article explores capitalisms uneven development as a form of national variation intensified by the neoliberal model of development. This revisionist analysis of model of development also demonstrates how its praxis dimension is significant for explaining past and present mid-range variations of capitalism, and more importantly for making a mid-range counter-hegemonic future.

62,"Drawing on a Gramscian Regulation Approach and Harveys accumulation by dispossession thesis, this article discusses the structural and hegemonic mechanisms of the neoliberal transformation of Swedens welfare sectors. Providing new longitudinal data on welfare retrenchment, corporate governance, wealth shares, and private economic power, the article further analyzes how the transformation of the Swedish post-war universal welfare model is related to class struggle and accumulation regime change in the Swedish economy. Following a decade-long countermobilization of Swedish capital and a severe economic crisis in the early 1990s, neoliberal economic common sense was cemented among social democratic policy elites that manifested itself in an institutionalized austerity polity, leading to a slow but steady dismantling of the Swedish welfare project. Roughly a fifth of employees in the three largest welfare sectors work in private welfare companies that generate tax-financed profits on politically created welfare markets. Welfare profits are in turn defended by a welfareindustrial complex and undergirded by a hegemonic bloc consisting of capital elites and sympathetic policymakers. In the virtual absence of vocal antihegemonic forces, many social democratic leaders have limited criticism against welfare profits throughout the last decades. On the contrary, austerity measures practiced by Swedish social democrats have thereto led to deteriorating social cohesion and spawned distrust among core social democratic voters.

63,"Inequality has been increasing for decades in both rich and developing countries and the academic literature addressing it struggles to provide explanations, let alone solutions. This article is concerned with a relatively underexplored area, the relationship between macro-level inequality and organizational inequality. The core focus of the article is the recognition that the two phenomena are closely bound up one with the other. This is made possible by adopting Rousseaus notion of inequality as hierarchy and willingness to accept subordination to authority and disparity of treatment. In doing so, we highlight similarities and dissimilarities between Rousseau and Marx. Inequality remains an issue of hierarchy at both the macro and organizational levels. As it was for Rousseau, so it is today but it is much more layered than in Rousseaus day: inequality in society is the accepted degree of hierarchy among its members, inequality in the economy and at work is the extent to which, accepted or not, there is an imbalance of power, financial resources, remuneration of work and access to opportunities and services. The increase in inequality is due to a radical change in the socio-economic model of advanced economies. This change involves a shift towards financialization, a pressure on labour through flexibility, the decline of trade unions power and the retrenchment of public social spending.
"
64,"Social supply plays a key role in bottom level cannabis markets. In outlining how social supply of cannabis differs from commercial market exchange, existing studies have argued that social supply is typically driven by two cultural logics: reciprocal gift-giving and sharing. Importantly, researchers have depicted sharing as a sub-version of a more generalized pattern of reciprocation and/or described sharing as a type of transfer that is motivated by altruism on the part of the giver. However, in this article, we argue that if we are to develop a more nuanced understanding of the sharing aspects of social supply, we need a more refined understanding of sharing. Based on interviews with 38 young cannabis users from Denmark, this article draws on recent anthropological theories of sharing and the concept of demand sharing in demonstrating how social cannabis supply is driven both by reciprocal logics, but also by hitherto overlooked sharing logics that cannot easily be captured by the categories reciprocity or altruism. More specifically, we analyze the important role played by receivers in facilitating sharing processes. We outline how diverse receiver demands are often the precondition for creating the social pressure that leads those who have, to allow others to take. In this way, this article contributes to a more detailed understanding of the complex transfer processes fueling social supply of illicit drugs.

65,"Traditional news media can both reflect and shape public perceptions, including expectations relating to alcohol and parenting. This paper examines representations of parents in Australian news media reporting on youth drinking to understand how parental standards related to alcohol are constructed and articulated. 150 news articles were sampled from a larger study of youth drinking, in which we identified four representations of parentsparents as to blame, good parents, parents as lost and parents as victims. These four representations of parents reflect dominant neoliberal ways of governing, which promote parental education, best practice standards and responsibility as solutions to concerns around youth drinking. We examine the way politicians, research findings and legal directives (most commonly secondary supply laws) were deployed to attribute parental responsibility and standards of care. While parents as to blame or as irresponsible was concretely established in the articles, good parents were far more elusive and strategically individualized in ways that abdicated responsibility from the state, industry and structural burdens. As such, while media representations were able to define and moralize bad parents and parenting practices when it came to youth drinking, what it meant to be a good parent was often an ambiguous ideal. We suggest these media representations contribute to intensive parenting standards by providing another platform in which parental behaviors can be publicly scrutinized and moralized.

66,"Historically, overpolicing of some racialized and Indigenous groups in Canada has resulted in unequal application of drug laws contributing to disproportionate rates of charges and convictions in these populations. Criminal records severely and negatively impact an individuals life and can perpetuate cycles of poverty and socioeconomic disadvantage. On October 17, 2018, Canada legalized cannabis production, distribution, sale, and possession for non-medical purposes. Advocates of criminal justice reform have raised concerns that Indigenous and racialized people may not equitably benefit from legalization due to unequal police surveillance and drug enforcement. These groups are among priority populations for research on cannabis and mental health, but their views on cannabis regulation have been largely absent from research and policy-making. To address this gap, we asked self-identified members of these communities about their lived experiences and perspectives on cannabis legalization in Canada. Between September 2018 and July 2019, we conducted semistructured interviews and focus groups with 37 individuals in QuÃ©bec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. During this phase of early cannabis legalization, participants responded to questions about anticipated public health risks and benefits of legalization, how their jurisdiction is responding to legalization, and what community resources would be needed to address legalization impacts. We conducted a thematic analysis and identified five major themes in the data related to race and early cannabis legalization: overpolicing of racialized communities, severity of penalties in new cannabis legislation, increased police powers, and underrepresentation of racialized groups in the legal cannabis market and in cannabis research. Participants discussed opportunities to support cannabis justice, including establishing priority licenses, issuing pardons or expunging criminal records, and reinvesting cannabis revenue into impacted communities. This work begins to address the paucity of Indigenous and racialized voices in cannabis research and identifies potential solutions to injustices of cannabis prohibition.

67,"Despite its strengths, drug policy scholarship in the United States has deficiencies and systemic biases that contribute to misinformation about drugs and people who use drugs. Factors ranging from funders biases to an overemphasis on abstinence-only outcomes limit the scope and focus of drug policy research. These deficiencies and the highly politicized nature of drug policy reform have led U.S. decision-makers to largely reproduce the uninformed thinking that epitomizes failed drug policies. In an effort to address some of these limitations, we designed Unbounded Knowledge: Envisioning a New Future for Drug Policy Research, a project to engage researchers in thinking about how U.S. drug policy research should be transformed. The project involved a diverse group of multidisciplinary drug researchers and clinicians in a focused collaboration to identify what drug research should bebut is notstudying in the U.S. It consisted of: (1) a preliminary series of interviews with researchers, (2) identification of common research constraints and factors that would transform the direction of drug policy research in the U.S., and (3) a daylong workshop to craft an aspirational research agenda. Participants were broadly in consensus that significant changes are needed to create different ways to conduct drug policy research and new opportunities within the research environment. They also generated specific ideas for research that could better shape U.S. drug policies in ways that move beyond the dominant focus on criminalization and medicalization. This article offers recommendations generated by the project for improving drug policy research in the U.S.

68,"The article aims to make understandable a significant change that has taken place in the adolescent drinking habits: throughout the world, the teens are drinking much less than previous generations. Previous research has approached this phenomenon through survey research methodology, trying to identify the variables that correlate with individuals alcohol consumption level, thereby explaining the phenomenon. The impact of social media use on drinking habits has been identified as one possible explanation, but the results have been contradictory. The article hypothesizes that the rise of social media created an institutional change in young peoples conditions for and patterns of socializing. Using qualitative interviews with Finnish teenagers as empirical data, the article concludes that since socializing with peers and initiating romantic relationships takes place primarily in virtual contexts, there are less occasions in which alcohol would serve as a social lubricant. Consequently, compared with previous generations, alcoholic beverages play a smaller role in young peoples lives. The current living conditions molded by the social media concern everyone, which is why individual-level correlations between social media use and alcohol consumption level do not capture the aggregate effect that the changed living conditions have brought about.
"
69,"Some personal experience of illicit drug use undoubtedly exists within the population of academic drug researchers. But it is rarely acknowledged, and even more rarely reflected upon, in their published work. This is understandable: criminal, professional and social sanctions may follow public admission of illicit activities. However, to not come out seems contrary to some core academic principles, such as transparency in data collection and reflexivity in the research process. Coming out may present researchers with an opportunity for improving knowledge of, and policies toward, drug use. In this article, we identify reasons for and against the public disclosure of drug use and the impact of such disclosure across a range of spheres, including research, teaching, policy influence and private lives. Reasons against coming out include the risks of undermining professional reputations and hence the ability to contribute to academic and policy debates, the threat of criminal justice sanctions, and impacts on loved ones. However, coming out can have academic benefit (i.e., improving our understanding of drugs, of people who use drugs, and of drug research) and contribute to activist goals (e.g., de-stigmatization of drug use and demarginalization of people who use drugs). Both the risks and benefits of public drug use disclosure have implications for how research and researchers may influence drug policy. Two key themes, stigma and reflexivity, underpin the discussion. We do not conclude with clear recommendations for drug-using drug researchers; to come out or to not come out is a personal decision. However, we argue that there is clear merit to further open discussion on the role of disclosure and reflection on personal drug use experience among those working in drug research and drug policywhere such reflection is relevant and where such researchers feel able to do so.

70,"Safe injection sites are spaces where people who inject drugs can do so under the supervision of staff at the sites who attempt to revive them if they overdose. Public officials in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have proposed the sites as a means to reduce opioid overdose deaths in the city, a policy proposal that has been politically and legally contested. This article uses the Narrative Politics model to elucidate the concerns, values, and aspirations of the competing narratives in the public discourse over safe injection sites in Philadelphia. Despite the aspirations expressed within the Harm Reduction narrative to open such a site, opposition from the Nimby (not in my backyard) narrative has, at the time of this research, successfully precluded such a step. Other narratives in the discourse include the Abstinence narrative opposing safe injection sites and the Social Justice narrative opposed to incarceration but also hesitant to wholeheartedly endorse the Harm Reduction narrative for its delayed advocacy of compassionate treatment of people who use drugs now that the face of the person who uses opioids is a white one. In addition to juxtaposing competing narratives against one another and considering their alignments, disagreements, and interactions, the authors consider absences and shared presuppositions. The social construction of the purported drug addict varies in some ways between and among the prevailing narratives; in other ways, all the narratives problematize addiction as an affliction that justifies techniques of discipline aimed at caring for and controlling the population.

72,"We study the implications of mixing economics and personal finance standards in a high school course. Using administrative, survey, and testing data on college students, we find that learning personal finance can help the learning of economics for some students but hurt it for others. We estimate that students who received more instruction in economics score almost 5 percentage points higher on our economics test. Furthermore, we estimate the effect of being assigned a certification test in personal finance as a part of this course. Taking the personal finance certification test increases economics test scores by 2.5 percentage points for the average student, but this effect is not uniform across students. The certification test significantly increases the economics scores of students with low SAT scores, while decreasing the economics scores of those with high SAT scores. Our results emphasize the potentially idiosyncratic effects of mixing economics with personal finance.

73,"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), the idea that business stewards have a broader range of societal obligations than maximizing shareholder value, is a mainstream theme in contemporary management research, education, and practice. Carroll points to one of its controversial aspects when he describes a clash between management scholars (who are generally pro-CSR) and their neoclassical economic contrarians. This has become an increasingly one-sided conflict with the pro-CSR side prevailing in both business and academia. CSR proponents have generally viewed Milton Friedman as an opponent of CSR. However, we argue that Friedmans purported opposition to CSR is something of a caricature. We reveal that Friedman was concerned that his advocacy for free market operation would promote pro-social outcomes. Indeed, through his emphasis on creating value for consumers, being good stewards of scarce resources, and avoiding rent-seekings inefficiencies, Friedman has more in common with CSR proponents than is sometimes acknowledged.

74,"Economic education has emerged as an important subfield in economics over the last several decades. This paper explores the author gender breakdown found in economic education journals compared to top-tier, general-interest economics journals and some field journals. We find that from 2009 to 2019, the percentage of articles published by women in general interest and selected field journals has remained relatively constant, while female publications in economic education journals have grown to match the percentage of women in the discipline.

76,"This study examines the structure and formula for revenue allocation in Nigeria which has been fraught with challenges, proffers solution, and highlights its implications for sustainable national development. The work uses the methodology of Group Unit Root Test, auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) Bounds Testing and Cointegrating Long Run tests for robust policy recommendations. Using the Gross Domestic Product as the dependent variable and revenue allocation to the three levels of government, and oil revenue as the independent variables, the results from the study show that revenue allocations and the other variables have significant relationship with economic growth in Nigeria. Based on our findings, the study recommends among others that the current revenue allocation formula should be reviewed to embrace autonomy in its entirety to achieve national goals and objectives. Various levels of government should be adequately funded to enable it carry out its expenditure responsibilities to accelerate grass root development.

77,"Past fears that robots and computers would cause large increases in secular unemployment have proven unfounded. Some well-respected economists and other technology and labor analysts are worried again. Advances in algorithms have proven impressive, but experts on the mind and neuroscience remain skeptical about the extent to which robots and computers will be able to duplicate or surpass humans in areas of insight, judgment, and creativity. Certainly, for the foreseeable future, robots and computers will be more complements to human labor, than they will be substitutes for human labor, enhancing us more than replacing us. If we use the precautionary principle to justify heavy regulation of robots and computers, the benefits of enhancement will be fewer and will be delayed.

78,"This study examined how weekly, externally set deadlines affected the completion of adaptive learning assignments and student outcomes in an introductory macroeconomics course. We imposed different deadline schemes for the same adaptive learning assignments in two sections of the course. One section was given flexible deadlines and the other section was given rigid weekly deadlines. We found that weekly deadlines did not affect assignment completions or total points earned on unit exams. We investigated how the adaptive learning assignments affected student retention of material. A measure of staying on pace in the course provided a positive effect on the comprehensive final exam for students with weekly deadlines. The weekly deadlines may not have influenced assignment completions but consistent engagement with the flow of topics through the course increased student knowledge retention. Regardless of deadline type, completions of adaptive learning assignments positively affected outcomes on the unit exams and final exam.

79,"Keynes argued that the central bank can influence the long-term interest rate on government bonds and the shape of the yield curve mainly through the short-term interest rate. Several recent empirical studies that examine the dynamics of government bond yields not only substantiate Keyness view that the long-term interest rate responds markedly to the short-term interest rate but also have relevance for macroeconomic theory and policy. This article relates Keyness discussions of money, the state theory of money, financial markets, investors expectations, uncertainty, and liquidity preference to the dynamics of government bond yields for countries with monetary sovereignty. Investors psychology, herding behavior in financial markets, and uncertainty about the future reinforce the effects of the short-term interest rate and the central banks monetary policy actions on the long-term interest rate.

81,"Funds-based mechanisms for urban adaptation finance are still underexplored. Addressing this gap, as well as the need for greater learning about how urban adaptation finance operates, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for such analysis that considers complexity, uncertainty, transformation and vulnerability. We analyse 39 urban projects financed by Climate Adaptation Funds (CAFs) using a qualitative approach. The findings indicate the ongoing dominance of national governments at all stages of the funding cycle, and of a focus on hard adaptation measures, but also a diverse set of stakeholder relationships involved in CAF finance which offers potential for greater multi-stakeholder and multisectoral management of complexity. Few projects, however, address the management of uncertainty. While upscaling from projects is a common preoccupation, catalysing effects across sectors are limited, and transformative mechanisms for addressing vulnerability are limited to consultation with vulnerable groups. Innovations are highlighted which merit further exploration through case study analysis.

82,"Despite varying conceptions of what co-production entails, there is a growing consensus in research, practice and public policy discourse that co-production is a preferred strategy for leveraging resources to deliver basic infrastructure services in low-income settlements. Using largely qualitative data, this paper explores the adaption of co-production in the low-income settlement of Hanna Nassif in Dar es Salaam, implemented 20 years ago by state actors, international agencies and grassroots actors, with attention to basic infrastructure and local employment. The findings reveal that co-production engendered partnerships and platforms and transformed sociocultural norms and values that made inroads toward urban equality in the settlement, although it failed to address inequalities among the partners, or to be replicated subsequently. The paper argues that meaningful co-production of basic infrastructure services in low-income settlements of the global South requires a focus on the context-specific pro-poor concerns and priorities.

83,"This paper reflects on the ethics of research and knowledge co-production aimed at addressing urban inequality. It draws on work within the Knowledge in Action for Urban Equality (KNOW) programme, which aimed to co-produce knowledge to activate transformation. We employ a lens of feminist care ethics to examine ethical challenges in research partnerships, which derive from interrelated layers of power asymmetry and inequality. We focus on ethical dilemmas that emerged during the planning stage of research work led by the NGO Centre for Community Initiatives (CCI), Tanzania, in collaboration with University College Londons Institute of Global Prosperity (IGP). We argue that contextualizing the value of knowledge co-production in generating transformation in the long term reveals a necessity for simultaneously addressing the immediate needs of intersectionally marginalized research participants. We suggest that ethical awareness of both long- and short-term modes of caring for could better support initiatives for addressing urban inequalities in context.

84,"Hygiene plays a key role in tipping the balance towards reduction of diarrhoeal and other infectious diseases. Yet it has often been overlooked, positioned as a supporting rider of water supply and sanitation services, or narrowly understood as handwashing. By focusing on handwashing infrastructure as proposed for the monitoring of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, development actors might miss the opportunity of capturing hygiene practices that are socially embedded and can act as a catalyst for change and risk reduction. We develop this argument by presenting an in-depth examination of hygiene practices in a low-income neighbourhood of Lilongwe, Malawi. Despite the high poverty levels and the constant water shortages in the area, a number of water-intensive hygiene practices are consistently carried out, proving that hygiene is central to residents everyday lives. Development projects should start by identifying these practices and by reflecting on the extent that these already work or can be made to work for reducing health-related risks.

85,"As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases nears 27 million, there is a rush to answer (what next) and a rush to act (to solve the immediate problems of COVID-19). This paper discusses, with a specific focus on urban areas in the global South, what is missing to date from this response. That includes an identification of things that there are too much of, things that are not being done at all, and things that are unbalanced. There has been an enormous upsurge of academic research papers and opinions on COVID-19. Technological and scientific solutions tend to overshadow other approaches, even if people know that social is important. Based on our analysis to date, our primary concern is that there is too little understanding about the importance of building dialogue, exploring collaboration and co-producing solutions. There is too little understanding as to why social and cultural responses are important, and how the recognition that they are important can be actioned.

86,"How do ordinary citizens, activists and urban practitioners learn to become agents of change for a socially just habitat? The paper explores this question through the experiences of eight grassroots schools of popular urbanism working under the umbrella of the Habitat International Coalition (HIC) in Latin America. Building on a process of self-documentation and collective pedagogic reflection driven by the protagonists of these schools, the analysis explores the core pedagogic practices identified across the schools to enact popular urbanism as a collective and intentional praxis: to weave, sentipensar, mobilize, reverberate and emancipate. We argue that, put in motion, these pedagogic practices transgress the rules and boundaries of the formal classroom, taking participants to and through other sites and modes of learning that host significant potential to stimulate collectivizing and alternative ways of seeking change towards urban equality.
