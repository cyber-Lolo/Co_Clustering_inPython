0,"BACKGROUND: Normalizing health-related quality of life (QoL) and fatigue are 
important long-term treatment targets in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We 
examined their evolution in relation to changes in disease activity during 
vedolizumab therapy.
METHODS: Cohort study of biologically refractory IBD patients treated with 
vedolizumab. Patients were prospectively evaluated at all infusions by Short 
Health Scale (SHS) (QoL questionnaire covering four health dimensions) (n=79), 
visual analogous scale for fatigue (VAS-F) (n=30), and clinical disease 
activity. Objective disease assessment was done after one year or at treatment 
failure.
RESULTS: Patients in steroid-free clinical remission at end of induction 
improved significantly in all SHS items already from week 2 with full 
implementation by week 14 ('Symptoms' 59% improvement, p<0.001; Function' 63%, 
p<0.001; Worries' 59%, p<0.001; 'Well-being' 40%, p<0.01). Then, SHS remained 
stable at background levels (<20) for one year (improvements 67%; 65%; 62%; 57%; 
p<0.001). Combined clinical-objective remission at one year was associated with 
highest SHS improvements (64-72%; p<0.001). Of note, early SHS improvements 
preceded manifestation of clinical remission in most patients (22 of 33; 67%). 
Clinical response materialized into late (week 6 or later) and minor SHS 
improvements (31-46%, p<0.001). Fatigue improved steadily over 6 months to 
background levels (VAS-F <4) among patients in clinical remission (45% decrease) 
or clinical-objective remission (41%). SHS and VAS-F impairment remained 
elevated in patients without effect of therapy.
CONCLUSION: QoL rapidly improves and predicts later significant 
clinical-objective efficacies of vedolizumab at end of induction and one year. 
Fatigue improves slowly after remission is attained."
1,"Microbial diversity positively influences community resilience of the host 
microbiome. However, extinction risk factors such as habitat specialization, 
narrow environmental tolerances, and exposure to anthropogenic disturbance may 
homogenize host-associated microbial communities critical for stress responses 
including disease defense. In a dataset containing 43 threatened and 90 
non-threatened amphibian species across two biodiversity hotspots (Brazil's 
Atlantic Forest and Madagascar), we found that threatened host species carried 
lower skin bacterial diversity, after accounting for key environmental and host 
factors. The consistency of our findings across continents suggests the broad 
scale at which low bacteriome diversity may compromise pathogen defenses in 
species already burdened with the threat of extinction."
2,"BACKGROUND: Splenic lymphangiomas (SL) are very rare benign cystic lesions found 
in pediatric population. Their occurrence in adults is exceptional. Splenectomy 
is the common management of splenic lesions for diagnostic and/or therapeutic 
purpose. Our aim is to report additional cases of SL diagnosed on splenectomy 
specimens at our Pathology laboratory with literature review.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study including all cases of splenectomy 
recorded at our Pathology laboratory (June 2020-August 2022). We performed a 
comparison of clinicopathological features between patients with SL and those 
with other benign splenic diseases.
RESULTS: Sixteen cases of splenectomy were included. The mean age was 
30.25 years (range of 6-70 years). The final histopathological diagnoses were 
congestive spleens in all cases of sickle cell disease (SCD) (5/16 patients, 
31.25%), splenic cystic lymphangiomas (4/16 patients, 25%), capsular splenic 
infiltration by gastric and colic cancers (3/16 cases, 18.75%), splenic abscess 
(2/16 cases, 12.5%) and splenic rupture with subcapsular hematoma (1/16 
patients, 6.25%). 12/16 patients (75%) had benign splenic conditions (4/12 with 
SL, 5/12 with SCD, 2/12 with abscess and 1/12 with splenic trauma). Patients 
with SL were older than those with other benign splenic conditions (mean age of 
28.27 years versus 20.87 years). Also patients with SL presented with massive 
splenomegaly (mean splenic weight of 1675 g versus 418.75 g, mean splenic size 
of 19.62 cm versus 14.63 cm). Open surgery was performed in 15/16 patients 
(93.75%).
CONCLUSION: Unlike previous studies, our series shows that SL are a common 
indication for splenectomy and occur in older patients with massive cystic 
splenomegaly. Open splenectomy is still an usual surgical practice in our 
country."
3,"BACKGROUND: Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous 
disease with different subtypes, multidisciplinary teams-led management, and a 
poor prognosis. Currently, the clinical benefits of stage III NSCLC in the 
neoadjuvant setting are still unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of published 
data on neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in stage III NSCLC to systematically 
evaluate its efficacy and safety.
METHODS: We searched the databases to identify eligible studies of neoadjuvant 
chemoimmunotherapy for stage III NSCLC. The primary outcomes mainly included 
pathological and radiological response outcomes, the feasibility of surgery, and 
the safety of the regimen. The pathological and radiological response included 
the rate of major pathologic response (MPR), complete pathologic response (pCR), 
radiological response outcomes, and R0 resection; The feasibility included the 
rate of surgical resection, conversion to thoracotomy, surgical complications, 
pathological downstaging of clinical disease stage. The safety included the 
incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and severe adverse events 
(SAEs). R 4.1.3 software was conducted for data analysis, and p < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Nine trials containing a total of 382 populations were eligible for the 
meta-analysis, with the pooled surgical resection rate of 90%. Owing to the 
large heterogeneity of the single-rate meta-analysis, the random effect model 
was adopted. The estimated pooled prevalence of MPR was 56% (95%CI 0.39-0.72) 
and of pCR was 39% (95%CI 0.28-0.51). The pooled rate of TRAEs was 65% (95%CI 
0.17-0.99) and SAEs was 24% (95%CI 0.05-0.49).
CONCLUSION: Compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy, neoadjuvant 
chemoimmunotherapy achieved more pathological and radiological relief, and has a 
high surgical resection rate and low risk of conversion to thoracotomy and 
surgical complications, with poor tolerance of toxicity but rarely developing 
life-threatening adverse events. In conclusion, neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy 
is suggested to be beneficial for stage III NSCLC."
4,"Reducing drug development timelines is an industry-wide goal to bring medicines 
to patients in need more quickly. This was exemplified in the COVID-19 pandemic 
where reducing development timelines had a direct impact on the number of lives 
lost to the disease. The use of drug substance produced using cell pools, as 
opposed to clones, has the potential to shorten development timelines. Toward 
this goal, we have developed a novel technology, GPEx® Lightning, that allows 
for rapid, reproducible, targeted recombination of transgenes into more than 200 
Dock sites in the CHO genome. This allows for rapid production of high 
expressing stable cell pools and clones that reach titers of 4 to 12 g/L in 
generic fed-batch production. These pools and clones are highly stable in both 
titer and glycosylation, showing strong similarity in glycosylation profiles.

5,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report and discuss clinical 
analysis, including the diagnosis and treatment of 4 cases of neuromyelitis 
optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) with area postrema syndrome (APS) as the first 
symptom.
METHODS: Four patients with intractable nausea, vomiting, and confirmed NMOSD 
were included in the final analysis. All of these patients were initially 
misdiagnosed and mismanaged.
RESULTS: Among the 4 patients, 3 were admitted to the department of 
gastroenterology at the onset of the disease, and 2 were not correctly diagnosed 
and treated promptly due to misdiagnosis. Therefore, their symptoms worsened, 
and they were transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for life support. No 
obvious early medulla lesions were found in one patient. One patient was treated 
with intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and plasma exchange, but 
there was no significant clinical improvement, after which the disease relapsed 
during the treatment with low-dose rituximab.
CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations of NMOSD are complex and diverse, and 
the initial symptoms, onset age of the patient, and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) findings can influence the final diagnosis. Early identification of the 
APS and timely therapy can prevent visual and physical disabilities, even 
respiratory failure, coma, and cardiac arrest. Therefore, it is necessary to 
identify specific and sensitive serum and imaging markers for predicting the 
prognosis and recurrence of the disease."
6,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) in the postoperative 
treatment of patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair compared with sham and 
no treatment group.
METHODS: This study is a protocol for a three-armed, single-blinded, 
placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial. Ninety participants scheduled 
for inguinal hernia repair will be randomly assigned to the TEAS group (n = 30), 
sham group (n = 30), and control group (n = 30). The TEAS group will receive 
treatment using four portable coin-sized electro-stimulators at both local and 
distal acupuncture points. The sham group will receive sham treatment with mock 
electrostimulation. The treatment groups will receive mixed frequency 
stimulation (alternating at 2 and 100 Hz every 3 s) in continuous mode for 
30 min at intervals of 2 h for 24 h postoperatively. The control group will 
receive postoperative pain control using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) 
device. The primary outcome is the total morphine dose received in the 
postoperative period (mg) using PCA 24 h after surgery. The number of PCA 
demands (i.e., times the button will be pressed) and delivered bolus doses, 
score on the Visual Analogue Scale, opioid-related side effects, the requirement 
for supplemental medications, score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS), and blood levels of stress hormones cortisol and prolactin.
DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will determine whether TEAS with 
intensified stimulation protocol is a safe and effective option for reducing 
analgesic consumption and postoperative pain.

7,"BACKGROUND: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is the recommended mode of ventilation 
used in acute respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Recent data has shown that high-flow 
nasal cannula (HFNC) treatment can be an alternative for patients with 
hypercapnic respiratory failure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate HFNC 
with sequential NIV versus NIV alone as the initial ventilatory strategy in 
AECOPD.
METHODS: This investigator-initiated, unblinded, single center, randomized 
controlled trial will be conducted in the emergency department, emergency 
intensive care unit, or respiratory intensive care unit of a tertiary-care urban 
teaching hospital. A total of 66 patients will be enrolled and randomized into 
the intervention group (HFNC with sequential NIV) or the control group (NIV 
group). The primary endpoint will be the mean difference in PaCO2 from baseline 
to 24 h after randomization. Secondary endpoints include the mean difference in 
PaCO2 from baseline to 6, 12, and 18 h, as well as the dyspnea score, overall 
discomfort score, rate of treatment failure, respiratory rate, rate of 
endotracheal intubation, length of hospital stay, and mortality.
DISCUSSION: Taking the advantages of both HFNC and NIV on AECOPD patients into 
account, we designed this clinical trial to investigate the combination of these 
ventilatory strategies. This trial will help us understand how HFNC with 
sequential NIV compares to NIV alone in treating AECOPD patients.

8,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a gynaecological endocrine disease. The 
objective of the present study was to investigate the role of GTPase 
immunity-associated protein (GIMAP) 7 in PCOS. A PCOS rat model was established 
using dehydroepiandrosterone injection. The data showed that GIMAP7 was mainly 
located in granulosa cells and was abundantly expressed in the ovarian granulosa 
cells of PCOS rats. GIMAP7 silencing decreased blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR 
scores, and number of cystic follicles. In addition, GIMAP7 silencing corrected 
erratic oestrous cycles, inhibited apoptosis and reduced c-caspase-3 protein 
expression in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. GIMAP7 silencing reduced 
malondialdehyde (MDA) but increased glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase 
(SOD) levels in the serum and ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. The effects of 
GIMAP7 were further investigated in human ovarian granulosa KGN cells. GIMAP7 
silencing increased the viability, promoted proliferation, and increased the 
percentage of S-phase KGN cells. The apoptosis rate was significantly decreased 
by GIMAP7 silencing. GIMAP7 also inhibited oxidative stress in KGN cells, 
resulting in decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MDA and 
increased levels of GSH and SOD. Notably, GIMAP7 inhibited the sonic hedgehog 
(SHH) signalling pathway, and GIMAP7 silencing increased the expression of the 
SHH signalling pathway downstream genes SHH, SMO, and Gli1. Inhibition of the 
SHH signalling pathway using cyclopamine reduced the effect of GIMAP7 silencing 
on KGN cells. This study proved that GIMAP7 promotes oxidative stress and 
apoptosis in ovarian granulosa cells in PCOS by inhibiting the SHH signalling 
pathway."
9,"BACKGROUND: After many years of neglect in the field of alternative splicing, 
the importance of intron retention (IR) in cancer has come into focus following 
landmark discoveries of aberrant IR patterns in cancer. Many solid and liquid 
tumours are associated with drastic increases in IR, and such patterns have been 
pursued as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Paradoxically, breast cancer 
(BrCa) is the only tumour type in which IR is reduced compared to adjacent 
normal breast tissue.
METHODS: In this study, we have conducted a pan-cancer analysis of IR with 
emphasis on BrCa and its subtypes. We explored mechanisms that could cause 
aberrant and pathological IR and clarified why normal breast tissue has 
unusually high IR.
RESULTS: Strikingly, we found that aberrantly decreasing IR in BrCa can be 
largely attributed to normal breast tissue having the highest occurrence of IR 
events compared to other healthy tissues. Our analyses suggest that low numbers 
of IR events in breast tumours are associated with poor prognosis, particularly 
in the luminal B subtype. Interestingly, we found that IR frequencies negatively 
correlate with cell proliferation in BrCa cells, i.e. rapidly dividing tumour 
cells have the lowest number of IR events. Aberrant RNA-binding protein 
expression and changes in tissue composition are among the causes of aberrantly 
decreasing IR in BrCa.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IR should be considered for therapeutic 
manipulation in BrCa patients with aberrantly low IR levels and that further 
work is needed to understand the cause and impact of high IR in other tumour 
types."
10,"BACKGROUND: The identification and mapping of at-risk populations at a lower 
administrative level than the district are prerequisites for the planning, 
resource allocation and design of impactful control intervention measures. Thus, 
the objective of the current study was to conduct sub-district precision mapping 
of soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and schistosomiasis in 29 districts of 
north-western Tanzania using the current recommended World Health Organization 
criteria.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 145 schools between March and 
May 2021. A urine filtration technique was used for the quantification of 
Schistosoma haematobium eggs, whereas quantification of Schistosoma mansoni and 
STH eggs was done using the Kato-Katz technique. Microhaematuria was examined 
using a urine dipstick.
RESULTS: The overall prevalences of any STH and schistosome infections were 9.3% 
[95% confidence interval (95%CI) 8.6-9.9] and 14.6% (95%CI 13.9-15.4), 
respectively. The overall prevalence of S. mansoni was 8.7% (95%CI 8.1-9.3), and 
36.4%, 41.6%, and 21.9% of the children had low, moderate, and heavy infections, 
respectively. The overall prevalence of S. haematobium was 6.1% (95%CI 5.5-6.5), 
and 71.7% and 28.3% of the infected children had light and heavy intensity 
infections, respectively. The prevalence of microhaematuria was 7.3% (95%CI 
6.7-7.8), with males having the highest prevalence (8.4%, P < 0.001). The 
prevalences of Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm were, 
respectively, 1.3% (95%CI 0.1-1.5), 2.9% (95%CI 2.5-3.3) and 6.2% (95%CI 
5.7-6.7). Most of the children infected with STH had light to moderate 
intensities of infection. The overall prevalence of co-infection with STH and 
schistosomiasis was 19.1%. The prevalence of schistosomiasis (P < 00.1) and STH 
(P < 0.001) varied significantly between schools and sub-districts. Schistosoma 
mansoni and S. haematobium were observed in 60 and 71 schools, respectively, 
whereas any STH was observed in 49 schools. In schools where schistosomiasis was 
observed, prevalence was < 10% in 90.8% of them, and ranged from ≥ 10% to < 50% 
in the other 9.2%. In schools where any STH was observed, the prevalence 
was < 10% in 87.7% of them.
CONCLUSIONS: The data reported here show that schistosomiasis and STH are widely 
distributed around Lake Victoria. In most of the schools where schistosomiasis 
and STH occurred the transmission thresholds were low. These data are important 
and need to be taken into consideration when decisions are made on the 
implementation of the next round of mass chemotherapies for schistosomiasis and 
STH in Tanzania."

12,"BACKGROUND: The identification of biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is critical to the development of therapies and interventions 
targeted at symptom management and tracking the pathophysiology of disease. The 
endorsement of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has emerged as a potential 
indicator of early change in cognitive status that may be predictive of future 
impairment at a time when measurable declines in neuropsychological performance 
cannot be detected. While there are numerous findings revealing sex differences 
in the prevalence of AD, there is a paucity of research examining sex 
differences in SCD. Therefore, the goal of this project was to determine if the 
relationship between the endorsement of SCD and future cognitive changes differ 
as a function of biological sex.
METHODS: A sample of 3019 male and female healthy older adults (2188 without 
SCD, 831 with SCD), with a mean follow-up time of 5.7 years, were included from 
the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center Research Sharing Hub. Linear regressions 
were performed to determine group differences in baseline cognitive scores, 
while linear mixed-effects models were completed to determine group differences 
in the rate of cognitive change over time.
RESULTS: Individuals endorsing SCD had significantly lower baseline cognitive 
scores and increased rates of decline in all cognitive domains compared to those 
without SCD. Males exhibited significantly lower scores in baseline performance 
in global cognition, episodic memory, and perceptual speed regardless of SCD 
classification. Females with SCD were found to decline at significantly faster 
rates than both males with SCD and males and females without SCD in all 
cognitive domains over a maximum 15-year follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: SCD is related to lower baseline cognitive performance and faster 
cognitive decline compared to those who do not endorse SCD. Females with SCD 
have the fastest rate of decline suggesting that SCD may be more predictive of 
future decline in females than in males. Targeted assessments of SCD may allow 
for the identification of individuals for inclusion in intervention trials, and 
other research studies, aiming to attenuate casual disease processes, which may 
ultimately aid in the mitigation of sex disparities in AD."
13,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence and influencing factors of thyroid 
dysfunction (TD) in patients with primary liver cancer (PLC) induced by PD-1 
monoclonal antibodies.
METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 195 PLC patients treated with PD-1. 
They were divided into TD group and normal thyroid function (NTF) group, and 
further divided into TD subgroups, the differences between groups and subgroups 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 113 of 195 (57.9%) PLC patients developed TD. The positive 
rate of thyroid antibody (20.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.041) and the median value of TSH 
(6.20 vs. 2.16 mU/L, P = 0.000) in TD group were higher than those in NTF group. 
Ten patients (8.8%) had the CTCAE grade of TD above grade 3, of which 2 patients 
died of liver failure. There were 20 patients (17.7%) in hyperthyroidism group 
and 93 patients (82.3%) in hypothyroidism group. The decompensated cirrhosis in 
hyperthyroidism group was lower than that in hypothyroidism group (33.3% vs. 
65.6%, P = 0.010), and the proportion of patients who had previously received 
surgical treatment was higher than that in hypothyroidism group (35.0% vs. 9.7%, 
P = 0.003); The proportion of clinical hyperthyroidism was higher than that of 
clinical hypothyroidism (70.0% vs. 31.2%, P = 0.001), the proportion of 
decompensated liver cirrhosis in clinical hyperthyroidism group was lower than 
that in clinical hypothyroidism group (23.1% vs. 68.0%, P = 0.022), and the 
proportion of previous or combined surgical resection was much higher than that 
in clinical hypothyroidism group (42.9% vs. 7.1%, P = 0.018); The proportion of 
decompensated cirrhosis in primary TD group was lower than that in secondary TD 
group (36.5% vs. 83.3%, P = 0.002), and the proportion of patients using 
antitumor targeted drugs was higher than that in secondary TD group (73.1% vs. 
45.0%, P = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Patients with PLC had high incidence of TD after receiving PD-1 
treatment, primary or subclinical hypothyroidism was the main manifestation 
type, which was related to the degree of disease and treatment."
14,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) show 
network dysfunctions linked with cognitive deficits. Within this framework, 
network abnormalities between AD and FTD show both convergent and divergent 
patterns. However, these functional patterns are far from being established and 
their relevance to cognitive processes remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: We investigated the relationship between cognition and functional 
connectivity of major cognitive networks in these diseases. Twenty-three bvFTD 
(age: 71±10), 22 AD (age: 72±6), and 20 controls (age: 72±6) underwent cognitive 
evaluation and resting-state functional MRI. Principal component analysis was 
used to describe cognitive variance across participants. Brain network 
connectivity was estimated with connectome analysis. Connectivity matrices were 
created assessing correlations between parcels within each functional network. 
The following cognitive networks were considered: default mode (DMN), dorsal 
attention (DAN), ventral attention (VAN), and frontoparietal (FPN) networks. The 
relationship between cognition and connectivity was assessed using a 
bootstrapping correlation and interaction analyses.
RESULTS: Three principal cognitive components explained more than 80% of the 
cognitive variance: the first component (cogPC1) loaded on memory, the second 
component (cogPC2) loaded on emotion and language, and the third component 
(cogPC3) loaded on the visuo-spatial and attentional domains. Compared to HC, AD 
and bvFTD showed impairment in all cogPCs (p<0.002), and bvFTD scored worse than 
AD in cogPC2 (p=0.031). At the network level, the DMN showed a significant 
association in the whole group with cogPC1 and cogPC2 and the VAN with cogPC2. 
By contrast, DAN and FPN showed a divergent pattern between diagnosis and 
connectivity for cogPC2. We confirmed these results by means of a multivariate 
analysis (canonical correlation).
CONCLUSIONS: A low-dimensional representation can account for a large variance 
in cognitive scores in the continuum from normal to pathological aging. 
Moreover, cognitive components showed both convergent and divergent patterns 
with connectivity across AD and bvFTD. The convergent pattern was observed 
across the networks primarily involved in these diseases (i.e., the DMN and 
VAN), while a divergent FC-cognitive pattern was mainly observed between 
attention/executive networks and the language/emotion cognitive component, 
suggesting the co-existence of compensatory and detrimental mechanisms 
underlying these components."
15,"BACKGROUND: High-quality evidence is lacking to support one treatment strategy 
over another in patients with foot drop due to peroneal nerve entrapment. This 
leads to strong variation in daily practice.
METHODS/DESIGN: The FOOTDROP (Follow-up and Outcome of Operative Treatment with 
Decompressive Release Of The Peroneal nerve) trial is a randomized, multi-centre 
study in which patients with peroneal nerve entrapment and persistent foot drop, 
despite initial conservative treatment, will be randomized 10 (± 4) weeks after 
onset between non-invasive treatment and surgical decompression. The primary 
endpoint is the difference in distance covered during the 6-min walk test 
between randomization and 9 months later. Time to recovery is the key secondary 
endpoint. Other secondary outcome measures encompass ankle dorsiflexion strength 
(MRC score and isometric dynamometry), gait assessment (10-m walk test, 
functional ambulation categories, Stanmore questionnaire), patient-reported 
outcome measures (EQ5D-5L), surgical complications, neurological deficits 
(sensory changes, motor scores for ankle eversion and hallux extension), health 
economic assessment (WPAI) and electrodiagnostic assessment.
DISCUSSION: The results of this randomized trial may elucidate the role of 
surgical decompression of the peroneal nerve and aid in clinical 
decision-making.

16,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the financial burden of out-of-pocket 
(OOP) payments to purchase antidiabetic medicines for type 2 patients in Iran.
METHOD: The ""budget share"" and ""capacity to pay"" approaches were employed to 
assess the catastrophic pharmaceutical expenditures of antidiabetic medication 
therapies. The catastrophic thresholds were adjusted for pharmaceutical sectors. 
The data was 2019 monthly household expenditures in rural and urban areas, 
insurance coverages of antidiabetic medicines and patients' out-of-pocket (OOP) 
payments in 30-day treatment schedules.
RESULTS: The results show that expenditure on diabetes medication therapies in 
the form of mono-dual therapy and some cases triple oral therapies were not 
catastrophic even for rural households. Insulin puts patients at risk of 
catastrophic pharmaceutical expenditures when added to the treatment schedules, 
and lack of financial protection intensifies it. In general, the poorer 
households and those resistant to first-line treatments were at increased risk 
of catastrophic pharmaceutical expenditures. The number of treatments that put 
patients at risk of catastrophic pharmaceutical expenditure in ""budget share"" 
was higher than the ""capacity to pay"" approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessing medication treatment affordability instead of a single 
medicine assessment is needed. Assessment could be done by utilizing a 
macro-level data approach and applying adjusted pharmaceutical sector threshold 
values. Considering the variation between treatment schedules that put patients 
at risk of catastrophic pharmaceutical expenditures, targeted pharmaceutical 
policies and reimbursement decisions are recommended to promote Universal Health 
Coverage (UHC) and to protect vulnerable populations from hardship."
17,"BACKGROUND: Patient reported outcome measures (PROM) can improve patient care 
and be crucial for symptom tracking especially during disease outbreaks. FLU-PRO 
Plus is a validated PROM used to track viral respiratory symptoms. Our study 
aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using FLU-PRO© Plus, to track symptoms 
across three healthcare systems.
METHODS: The prospective, longitudinal study recruited adults between 
February-May 2021 from HealthPartners Institute (HP), Kaiser Permanente Georgia 
(KPGA), and Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States (KPMAS). Adult members were 
eligible if they had a positive lab or diagnosis for either COVID-19 or 
influenza-like illness (ILI) or exhibited 2 + viral respiratory symptoms. 
Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe the patient characteristics 
for participants that were eligible for FLU-PRO Plus, successfully contacted, 
attempted to log in to the FLU-PRO Plus website, and participants who completed 
FLU-PRO Plus Day 1. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression using PROC 
GLIMMIXX investigated the patient characteristics associated with (1) successful 
contact and (2) FLU-PRO Plus Day 1 completion.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 15,650 eligible participants during the 
enrollment period: 9,582 from HP, 1,740 from KPGA, and 4,328 from KPMAS. Among 
the total of 409 eligible adults who attempted to participate in FLU-PRO Plus, 
317 completed FLU-PRO Plus Day 1. Among the 317 individuals that completed 
FLU-PRO Plus Day 1, 205 (67.5%) were diagnosed with COVID-19; 112 adults 
diagnosed with COVID-19 completed FLU-PRO Plus Day 14. Among adults successfully 
contacted, adults aged 35-64 (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.05, 1.87), females (OR = 1.77, 
95% CI 1.38, 2.27), and adults diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.27, 
2.17) had higher odds of completing FLU-PRO Plus Day 1; Asian adults (OR = 0.38, 
95% CI 0.19, 0.76) and Black and African American adults (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 
0.19, 0.76) had lower odds compared to White adults.
CONCLUSION: Our study reports on the feasibility of patients across three 
integrated healthcare systems utilizing FLU-PRO Plus to monitor their 
respiratory symptoms. Patient reported outcome measures (PROM) can improve 
patient care, quality of life, and reduce the strain of limited resources on 
healthcare systems. Future FLU-PRO Plus studies should develop an implementation 
strategy to fully integrate FLU-PRO Plus within clinical care and patient 
management."
18,"BACKGROUND: Osteopathia Striata with Cranial Sclerosis (OS-CS), also known as 
Horan-Beighton Syndrome, is a rare genetic disease; about 90 cases have been 
reported to date. It is associated with mutations (heterozygous for female 
subjects and hemizygous for males) of the AMER1 gene, located at Xq11.2, and 
shows an X-linked pattern of transmission. Typical clinical manifestations 
include macrocephaly, characteristic facial features (frontal bossing, 
epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge, orofacial cleft, 
prominent jaw), hearing loss and developmental delay. Males usually present a 
more severe phenotype than females and rarely survive. Diagnostic suspicion is 
based on clinical signs, radiographic findings of cranial and long bones 
sclerosis and metaphyseal striations, subsequent genetic testing may confirm it.
CASE PRESENTATION: Hereby, we report on a female newborn with frontal and 
parietal bossing, narrow bitemporal diameter, dysplastic, 
low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, microretrognathia, cleft palate, and 
rhizomelic shortening of lower limbs. Postnatally, she manifested feeding 
intolerance with biliary vomiting and abdominal distension. Therefore, in the 
suspicion of bowel obstruction, she underwent surgery, which evidenced and 
corrected an intestinal malrotation. Limbs X-ray and skull computed tomography 
investigations did not show cranial sclerosis and/or metaphyseal striations. 
Array-CGH analysis revealed normal findings. Then, a target next generation 
sequencing (NGS) analysis, including the genes involved in skeletal dysplasias, 
was performed and revealed a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation of the AMER1 
gene. The patient was discharged at 2 months of age and included in a 
multidisciplinary follow-up. Aged 9 months, she now shows developmental and 
growth (except for relative macrocephaly) delay. The surgical correction of 
cleft palate has been planned.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report shows the uncommon association of intestinal malrotation 
in a female newborn with OS-CS. It highlights that neonatologists have to 
consider such a diagnosis, even in absence of cranial sclerosis and long bones 
striations, as these usually appear over time. Other syndromes with cranial 
malformations and skeletal dysplasia must be included in the differential 
diagnosis. The phenotypic spectrum is wide and variable in both genders. Due to 
variable X-inactivation, females may also show a severe and early-onset clinical 
picture. Multidisciplinary management and careful, early and long-term follow-up 
should be offered to these patients, in order to promptly identify any 
associated morbidities and prevent possible complications or adverse outcomes."
19,"BACKGROUND: The paucity of SARS-CoV-2-specific virulence factors has greatly 
hampered the therapeutic management of patients with COVID-19 disease. Although 
available vaccines and approved therapies have shown tremendous benefits, the 
continuous emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and side effects of existing 
treatments continue to challenge therapy, necessitating the development of a 
novel effective therapy. We have previously shown that our developed novel 
single-stranded DNA aptamers not only target the trimer S protein of SARS-CoV-2, 
but also block the interaction between ACE2 receptors and trimer S protein of 
Wuhan origin, Delta, Delta plus, Alpha, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron variants of 
SARS-CoV-2. We herein performed in vivo experiments that administer the aptamer 
to the lungs by intubation as well as in vitro studies utilizing PBMCs to prove 
the efficacy and safety of our most effective aptamer, AYA2012004_L.
METHODS: In vivo studies were conducted in transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 
(K18hACE2), C57BL/6J, and Balb/cJ. Flow cytometry was used to check S-protein 
expressing pseudo-virus-like particles (VLP) uptake by the lung cells and test 
the immuogenicity of AYA2012004_L. Ames test was used to assess mutagenicity of 
AYA2012004_L. RT-PCR and histopathology were used to determine the 
biodistribution and toxicity of AYA2012004_L in vital organs of mice.
RESULTS: We measured the in vivo uptake of VLPs by lung cells by detecting GFP 
signal using flow cytometry. AYA2012004_L specifically neutralized VLP uptake 
and also showed no inflammatory response in mice lungs. In addition, 
AYA2012004_L did not induce inflammatory response in the lungs of Th1 and Th2 
mouse models as well as human PBMCs. AYA2012004_L was detectable in mice lungs 
and noticeable in insignificant amounts in other vital organs. Accumulation of 
AYA2012004_L in organs decreased over time. AYA2012004_L did not induce 
degenerative signs in tissues as seen by histopathology and did not cause 
changes in the body weight of mice. Ames test also certified that AYA2012004_L 
is non-mutagenic and proved it to be safe for in vivo studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our aptamer is safe, effective, and can neutralize the uptake of 
VLPs by lung cells when administered locally suggesting that it can be used as a 
potential therapeutic agent for COVID-19 management."
20,"Over the last decades, canines have experienced a marked increase in their 
lifespan, mirroring human populations. Several authors have pointed out the 
domestic dog as a suitable animal model for geropathology translational 
research. The aim of this study is to assess age-related morbidities and 
mortality in a population of 269 elderly canines (130 males and 139 females) 
submitted to necropsy. The organic systems exhibiting the higher number of 
age-related morbidities were the reproductive, cardiovascular and urinary 
systems and, in females, also the mammary gland. The prevalence of 
cardiovascular and urinary disease was significantly higher in males and mammary 
lesions were exclusively found in females. Urinary disease was more frequent in 
small breeds dogs, while peritoneum and male genital morbidities were 
significantly higher in larger breeds. Hyperplastic and degenerative lesions 
were common morbidities found in this elderly dog population. The main cause of 
death was neoplasia, which accounted for almost half of the deaths. 
Cardiovascular and urinary pathology also emerged as a frequent cause of 
mortality. These findings partially parallel data obtained for human species, 
displaying cancer and cardiovascular pathology as major causes of disease and 
death in elderlies. Our data reinforce the potential of the domestic dog for 
further translational investigations on gerontology, meeting the concept of One 
Health."
21,"PURPOSE: To analyze the diagnostic value of placenta three-dimensional (3D) 
energy blood flow parameters combined with maternal serum AFP, β-hCG, sFlt-1 and 
CK levels for PA.
METHODS: 30 pregnant women with PA and 30 pregnant women with normal placenta 
were randomly selected in the Affiliated Maternal and Child Health Hospital of 
Nantong University from January 2021 to December 2021. Thereafter, the 3D energy 
ultrasound was applied to detect the placenta VI, FI and VFI. Moreover, the 
diagnostic value of different parameters combined with serum AFP, β-hCG, sFlt-1 
and CK levels for PA was analyzed.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis results indicated that, gravidity > 2 and 
with/without placenta previa were the independent risk factors for PA 
(P < 0.05). In PA group, the AFP, β-hCG, CK, placenta VI, FI and VFI values were 
higher than those in non-PA group, while sFlt-1 was apparently lower than that 
in non-PA group. With the increase in PA degree, the serum AFP, β-hCG and CK 
levels increased. Meanwhile, serum sFlt-1 level was negatively correlated with 
PA degree. Serum AFP, β-hCG, sFlt-1, CK and placenta VFI showed prediction 
potency for PA, and their combined detection attained the optimal diagnostic 
value for predicting PA. ROC curve analysis suggested that, serum AFP, β-hCG, 
sFlt-1, CK and 3D ultrasound VFI value had the greatest AUC values in predicting 
PA, which might provide reference for the clinical diagnosis and disease 
evaluation of PA. Conclusion Serum AFP, β-hCG, sFlt-1, CK and placental VFI can 
increase the consistency in the diagnosis of PA. Serum markers combined with 3D 
ultrasound blood flow imaging can improve the sensitivity and specificity of 
prenatal diagnosis of PA, which provides an important reference for clinical 
diagnosis and treatment."
22,"BACKGROUND: This trial aimed to analyse the safety, effectiveness and 
transcriptomic characteristics of neoadjuvant toripalimab plus chemotherapy in 
II-III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Patient eligibility mainly involved treatment-naive, clinical stage 
II-III and wild-type EGFR/ALK NSCLC. The patients received 2-4 cycles of 
toripalimab (240 mg q3w) plus carboplatin-based chemotherapy. After the second 
treatment cycle, all patients were re-evaluated by a multidisciplinary team. 
Candidates eligible for surgery underwent surgery; otherwise, patients received 
the remaining treatment cycles. The primary endpoints were safety and major 
pathological response (MPR). Secondary endpoints were R0 resection rate, 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RNA sequencing of 
baseline and post-treatment samples was conducted to explore the transcriptomic 
characteristics of the therapeutic response.
RESULTS: In total, 50 eligible patients were enrolled, including 12 (24.0%) with 
resectable disease (RD) and 38 (76.0%) with potentially resectable disease 
(PRD). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were recorded in 48 cases 
(96.0%). Severe TRAEs occurred in 3 (6.0%) cases, including myelosuppression, 
drug-induced liver injury and death related to haemoptysis. The objective 
response rate (ORR) was 76.0%, with 8 (16.0%) patients having a complete 
response (CR), 30 (60.0%) partial response (PR), 10 (20.0%) stable disease (SD) 
and 2 (4.0%) progressive disease (PD). Surgery could be achieved in 12 (100%) 
patients with RD and 25 (65.8%) with PRD; 1 (2.0%) with PRD refused surgery. 
Therefore, R0 resection was performed for all 36 (100%) patients who underwent 
surgery; 20 (55.6%) achieved MPR, including 10 (27.8%) with a complete 
pathological response (pCR). The CHI3L1 (chitinase-3-like protein 1) 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of baseline tumour samples could predict 
the therapeutic response (AUC=0.732), OS (P=0.017) and PFS (P=0.001). Increased 
PD-1 expression, T cell abundance and immune-related pathway enrichment were 
observed in post-treatment samples compared to baseline in the response group 
(CR+PR) but not in the non-response group (SD+PD).
CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant toripalimab plus chemotherapy was safe and effective, 
with a high MPR and manageable TRAEs for II-III NSCLC, even converting initially 
PRD to RD. Disparate transcriptomic characteristics of therapeutic efficiency 
were observed, and CHI3L1 expression predicted therapeutic response and 
survival.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR1900024014, June 22, 2019."
23,"BACKGROUND: Significant comorbidities, advanced age, and a poor performance 
status prevent surgery and systemic treatment for many patients with localized 
(non-metastatic) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These patients are 
currently treated with 'best supportive care'. Therefore, it is desirable to 
find a treatment option which could improve both disease control and quality of 
life in these patients. A brief course of high-dose high-precision radiotherapy 
i.e. stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) may be feasible.
METHODS: A nationwide multicenter trial performed within a previously 
established large prospective cohort (the Dutch Pancreatic cancer project; 
PACAP) according to the 'Trial within cohorts' (TwiCs) design. Patients enrolled 
in the PACAP cohort routinely provide informed consent to answer quality of life 
questionnaires and to be randomized according to the TwiCs design when eligible 
for a study. Patients with localized PDAC who are unfit for chemotherapy and 
surgery or those who refrain from these treatments are eligible. Patients will 
be randomized between SABR (5 fractions of 8 Gy) with 'best supportive care' and 
'best supportive care' only. The primary endpoint is overall survival from 
randomization. Secondary endpoints include preservation of quality of life 
(EORTC-QLQ-C30 and -PAN26), NRS pain score response and WHO performance scores 
at baseline, and, 3, 6 and 12 months. Acute and late toxicity will be scored 
using CTCAE criteria version 5.0: assessed at baseline, day of last fraction, at 
3 and 6 weeks, and 3, 6 and 12 months following SABR.
DISCUSSION: The PANCOSAR trial studies the added value of SBRT as compared to 
'best supportive care' in patients with localized PDAC who are medically unfit 
to receive chemotherapy and surgery, or refrain from these treatments. This 
study will assess whether SABR, in comparison to best supportive care, can 
relieve or delay tumor-related symptoms, enhance quality of life, and extend 
survival in these patients.

24,"BACKGROUND: Bone erosions may appear early or later during rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), causing joint damage and functional impairment. However, in some patients 
erosions do not occur, even after several years of disease. This study evaluates 
the prevalence, clinical relevance and possible predictors of erosion-free RA.
METHODS: Six hundred and eight patients from an early RA cohort (BARFOT) having 
radiographs of hands and feet at inclusion and after 1, 2, 5 and 8 years were 
studied. Clinical and functional assessments were performed on all these 
time-points.
RESULTS: In all, 144 patients (24%) did not develop erosions up to 8 years 
follow-up (Never erosive group), while 464 patients (76%) had erosions on one or 
more assessments (Ever erosive group). At diagnosis, the patients in the Never 
erosive group were significantly younger, satisfied fewer ACR criteria, and were 
less frequently RF- and/or anti-CCP- positive compared with those in the Ever 
erosive group. The Never erosive patients had consistently more tender joints, 
lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and, from two years and onwards, 
fewer swollen joints. Absence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-CCP were 
strong independent predictors for erosion-free disease. The erosion-free 
patients were less frequently treated with DMARDs and/or prednisolone.
CONCLUSIONS: One-quarter of the patients was erosion-free during eight years in 
this early RA cohort. Erosion-free patients had a less severe disease course as 
to disease activity and were more often seronegative compared with those with 
erosive disease. The results suggest that non-erosive RA represents a milder 
form of RA."
25,"BACKGROUND: Co-management of HIV-TB coinfection remains a challenge globally. 
Addressing TB among people living with HIV (PLHIV) is a key priority for the 
Government of India (GoI). In 2016, GoI implemented single-window services to 
prevent and manage TB in PLHIV. To strengthen HIV-TB service delivery, 
case-based e-learning was introduced to health care providers at Antiretroviral 
Therapy centres (ARTc).
METHODS: We implemented a hub and spoke model to deliver biweekly, virtual, 
case-based e-learning at select ARTc (n = 115), from four states of India-Delhi, 
Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. We evaluated feasibility and 
acceptability of case-based e-learning and its impact on professional 
satisfaction, self-efficacy, knowledge retention using baseline and completion 
surveys, session feedback, pre-and post-session assessments. We reviewed routine 
programmatic data and patient outcomes to assess practices among participating 
ARTc.
RESULTS: Between May 2018 and September 2020, 59 sessions were conducted with 
mean participation of 55 spokes and 152 participants. For 95% and 88% of 
sessions ≥ 80% of respondents agreed that topics were clear and relevant to 
practice, and duration of session was appropriate, respectively. Session 
participants significantly improved in perceived knowledge, skills and 
competencies (+ 8.6%; p = 0.025), and technical knowledge (+ 18.3%; p = 0.04) 
from baseline. Participating ARTc increased TB screening (+ 4.2%, p < 0.0001), 
TB diagnosis (+ 2.7%, p < 0.0001), ART initiation (+ 4.3%, p < 0.0001) and TB 
preventive treatment completion (+ 5.2%, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Case-based e-learning is an acceptable and effective modus of 
capacity building and developing communities of practice to strengthen 
integrated care. E-learning could address demand for accessible and sustainable 
continuing professional education to manage complex diseases, and thereby 
enhance health equity. We recommend expansion of this initiative across the 
country for management of co-morbidities as well as other communicable and 
non-communicable diseases to augment the existing capacity building 
interventions by provide continued learning and routine mentorship through 
communities of practice."
26,"BACKGROUND: Clusterin is a multifunctional protein, which is associated with the 
pathogenesis and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared with 
normal controls, inconsistent results have yielded in previous studies for 
concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clusterin in AD patients. We explored 
CSF clusterin levels in different pathological processes of AD.
METHODS: Following the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association 
(NIA-AA) criteria, we employed on the levels of CSF Aβ42(A), phosphorylated-Tau 
(T), and total-tau (N). Based on previously published cutoffs and the close 
correlation between CSF p-tau and t-tau, 276 participants from the publicly 
available ADNI database with CSF biomarkers were divided into four groups: 
A-(TN)- (normal Aβ42 and normal p-tau and t-tau; n = 50), A+(TN)- (abnormal Aβ42 
and normal p-tau and t-tau; n = 39), A+(TN) + (abnormal Aβ42 and abnormal p-tau 
or t-tau; n = 147), A-(TN) + (normal Aβ42 and abnormal p-tau or t-tau; n = 40). 
To assess CSF clusterin levels in AD continuum, intergroup differences in four 
groups were compared. Pairwise comparisons were conducted as appropriate 
followed by Bonferroni post hoc analyses. To further study the relationships 
between CSF clusterin levels and AD core pathological biomarkers, we employed 
multiple linear regression method in subgroups.
RESULTS: Compared with the A-(TN)- group, CSF clusterin levels were decreased in 
A+ (TN)- group (P = 0.002 after Bonferroni correction), but increased in the 
A+(TN) + group and the A-(TN) + group (both P <  0.001 after Bonferroni 
correction). Moreover, we found CSF clusterin levels are positively associated 
with CSF Aβ42 (β = 0.040, P <  0. 001), CSF p-tau (β = 0.325, P <  0.001) and 
CSF t-tau (β = 0.346, P <  0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that there are differences levels of CSF 
clusterin in different stages of AD pathology. The CSF clusterin level decreased 
at the early stage are related to abnormal Aβ pathology; and the increased 
levels are associated with tau pathology and neurodegeneration."
27,"BACKGROUND: Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is one of the most common 
heart valve diseases that is a sequel of left ventricular remodelling. Although 
mitral valve annuloplasty is a standard treatment of FMR, the recurrence of FMR 
is a major drawback and occurs in 10-50% of patients. The REFORM-MR registry 
aims to investigate the effectiveness of standardized papillary muscle 
relocation and ring annuloplasty and to identify the risk factors associated 
with recurrent FMR.
METHODS: REFORM-MR is a prospective, multicenter registry that enrols 
consecutive FMR patients across five sites in Germany. All patients with FMR and 
restricted movement of leaflets during systole (i.e., type IIIb mitral 
regurgitation) undergoing standardized subannular repair in combination with 
mitral valve annuloplasty are included in the study. The primary objective is to 
examine the effect of combined papillary muscle relocation and ring annuloplasty 
on the recurrence of FMR at 2 years postoperatively. The secondary objectives 
are MACCE rate, reinterventions on the mitral valve and cardiac-related 
mortality in the study cohort. Echocardiography core-lab and MRI core-lab will 
provide anonymized analysis of the imaging data in the REFORM-MR registry. 
Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and the 
Chi-Square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables are used for group 
comparisons. Kaplan-Meier analyses is performed for survival and safety 
outcomes.
RESULTS: As of May 2021, a total of 97 patients were enrolled across five sites 
in Germany.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will help define the outcomes of combined 
papillary muscle relocation and ring annuloplasty in the FMR treatment in a 
multicentre setting and to improve the understanding of the limitations of 
subannular repair procedures while treating patients with type III FMR. Trial

28,"BACKGROUND: Congenital syphilis (CS) depends on the placental transmission of 
Treponema pallidum (TP) spirochetes from an infected mother to fetus during 
pregnancy. It shows a wide clinical variability with cutaneous and visceral 
manifestations, including stillbirths, neonatal death, and asymptomatic cases. 
Preterm infants with CS may have more severe features of disease than the term 
ones, due to the combined pathogenic effect of both CS and prematurity.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a female preterm (32+6 weeks of gestation) 
newborn showing most of the typical CS manifestations, in addition to 
gastrointestinal disorders including feeding difficulties, colon stenosis and 
malabsorption leading to postnatal growth restriction. The mother resulted 
positive at the syphilis screening test of the first trimester of pregnancy, but 
she did not undergo any treatment. At birth, our newborn was VDRL positive 
(antibody titer four times higher compared to the mother), and she was treated 
with intravenous benzathine benzylpenicillin G for 10 days (50,000 IU/Kg three 
times per day). Poor tolerance to enteral nutrition (abdominal distension, 
increased biliary type gastric secretions) was observed. A barium enema X-Ray 
identified a colon stenosis within the descending tract. However, the poor 
general conditions due to a concurrent fungal sepsis did not allow to perform 
any surgical procedure, and a conservative approach with total parenteral 
nutrition was started. The following evolution was marked by difficulties in 
enteral feeding including refusal of food and vomiting, to which also 
contributed the neurological abnormalities related to a perinatal asphyxia, and 
the affective deprivation for the physical absence of the mother during 
hospitalization. At 5 months of age, after the introduction of an amino 
acid-based formula (Neocate LCP Nutricia ®), an improvement of enteral feeding 
was observed, with no further and significantly decreased episodes of abdominal 
distension and vomiting respectively, and regular stool emission. A 
psychological support offered to the family allowed a more stable bond between 
the mother and her baby, thus providing a significant additional benefit to food 
tolerance and growth. She was discharged at 5 months of age, and included in a 
multidisciplinary follow-up. She at present shows global growth delay, and 
normal development apart from mildly increased tone of lower limbs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights less common clinical CS manifestations like 
gastrointestinal disorders including feeding difficulties, colon stenosis and 
malabsorption leading to postnatal growth delay. Moreover, it underlines how 
prematurity may worsen the clinical evolution of such congenital infection, due 
to the additional pathogenic effect of possible associated diseases and/or 
conditions like sepsis, hypoxic/ischemic injury, or use of drugs. CS may be 
observed also in high-income countries, with high rates of antenatal screening 
and availability of prenatal treatment. A multidisciplinary network must be 
guaranteed to the affected subjects, to ensure adequate care and improve the 
quality of life for patients and their families."
29,"BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is well known to 
influence the progression of depression. However, the molecular mechanisms 
triggering NAc neuroinflammation in depression have not been fully elucidated. 
Progranulin (PGRN) is a multifunctional growth factor that is linked to the 
innate immune response and inflammation, and PGRN plays a key role in 
neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, the 
purpose of this study was to validate whether PGRN was involved in the NAc 
neuroinflammation-promoted depressive-like phenotype.
METHODS: A NAc neuroinflammation-relevant depression-like model was established 
using wild-type (WT) and PGRN-knockout (KO) mice after NAc injection with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and various behavioral tests related to cognition, 
social recognition, depression and anxiety were performed with WT and PGRNKO 
mice with or without NAc immune challenge. RT‒PCR, ELISA, western blotting and 
immunofluorescence staining were used to determine the expression and function 
of PGRN in the neuroinflammatory reaction in the NAc after LPS challenge. The 
morphology of neurons in the NAc from WT and PGRNKO mice under conditions of NAc 
neuroinflammation was analyzed using Golgi-Cox staining, followed by Sholl 
analyses. The potential signaling pathways involved in NAc neuroinflammation in 
PGRNKO mice were investigated by western blotting.
RESULTS: Under normal conditions, PGRN deficiency induced FTD-like behaviors in 
mice and astrocyte activation in the NAc, promoted the release of the 
inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 and increased dendritic 
complexity and synaptic protein BDNF levels in the NAc. However, NAc 
neuroinflammation enhanced PGRN expression, which was located in astrocytes and 
microglia within the NAc, and PGRN deficiency in mice alleviated NAc 
neuroinflammation-elicited depression-like behaviors, seemingly inhibiting 
astrocyte- and microglia-related inflammatory reactions and neuroplasticity 
complexity in the NAc via the p38 and nuclear factor of kappa (NF-κB) signaling 
pathways present in the NAc after neuroinflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PGRN exerts distinct function on different 
behaviors, showing protective roles in the FTD-like behavior and detrimental 
effects on the neuroinflammation-related depression-like behavior, resulting 
from mediating astrocyte and microglial functions from the NAc in different 
status."
30,"BACKGROUND: The medical care of patients with myositis is a great challenge in 
clinical practice. This is due to the rarity of these disease, the complexity of 
diagnosis and management as well as the lack of systematic analyses.
OBJECTIVES: Therefore, the aim of this project was to obtain an overview of the 
current care of myositis patients in Germany and to evaluate epidemiological 
trends in recent years.
METHODS: In collaboration with BARMER Insurance, retrospective analysis of 
outpatient and inpatient data from an average of approximately 8.7 million 
insured patients between January 2005 and December 2019 was performed using 
ICD-10 codes for myositis for identification of relevant data. In addition, a 
comparative analysis was performed between myositis patients and an age-matched 
comparison group from other populations insured by BARMER.
RESULTS: 45,800 BARMER-insured individuals received a diagnosis of myositis 
during the observation period, with a relatively stable prevalence throughout. 
With regard to comorbidities, a significantly higher rate of cardiovascular 
disease as well as neoplasm was observed compared to the control group within 
the BARMER-insured population. In addition, myositis patients suffer more 
frequently from psychiatric disorders, such as depression and somatoform 
disorders. However, the ICD-10 catalogue only includes the specific coding of 
""dermatomyositis"" and ""polymyositis"" and thus does not allow for a sufficient 
analysis of all idiopathic inflammatory myopathies subtypes.
CONCLUSION: The current data provide a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of 
myositis in Germany, highlighting the multimorbidity of myositis patients. This 
underlines the need for multidisciplinary management. However, the ICD-10 codes 
currently still in use do not allow for specific analysis of the subtypes of 
myositis. The upcoming ICD-11 coding may improve future analyses in this regard."
31,"BACKGROUND: Hyaluronic acid (HA) promotes cancer metastasis; however, the 
currently approved treatments do not target HA. Metastatic renal carcinoma 
(mRCC) is an incurable disease. Sorafenib (SF) is a modestly effective 
antiangiogenic drug for mRCC. Although only endothelial cells express known SF 
targets, SF is cytotoxic to RCC cells at concentrations higher than the 
pharmacological-dose (5-µM). Using patient cohorts, mRCC models, and SF 
combination with 4-methylumbelliferone (MU), we discovered an SF target in RCC 
cells and targeted it for treatment.
METHODS: We analyzed HA-synthase (HAS1, HAS2, HAS3) expression in RCC cells and 
clinical (n = 129), TCGA-KIRC (n = 542), and TCGA-KIRP (n = 291) cohorts. We 
evaluated the efficacy of SF and SF plus MU combination in RCC cells, 
HAS3-transfectants, endothelial-RCC co-cultures, and xenografts.
RESULTS: RCC cells showed increased HAS3 expression. In the clinical and 
TCGA-KIRC/TCGA-KIRP cohorts, higher HAS3 levels predicted metastasis and shorter 
survival. At > 10-µM dose, SF inhibited HAS3/HA-synthesis and RCC cell growth. 
However, at ≤ 5-µM dose SF in combination with MU inhibited HAS3/HA synthesis, 
growth of RCC cells and endothelial-RCC co-cultures, and induced apoptosis. The 
combination inhibited motility/invasion and an HA-signaling-related 
invasive-signature. We previously showed that MU inhibits SF inactivation in RCC 
cells. While HAS3-knockdown transfectants were sensitive to SF, 
ectopic-HAS3-expression induced resistance to the combination. In RCC models, 
the combination inhibited tumor growth and metastasis with little toxicity; 
however, ectopic-HAS3-expressing tumors were resistant.
CONCLUSION: HAS3 is the first known target of SF in RCC cells. In combination 
with MU (human equivalent-dose, 0.6-1.1-g/day), SF targets HAS3 and effectively 
abrogates mRCC."
32,"BACKGROUND: The Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Questionnaire (PVDQ) measures 
beliefs associated with personal susceptibility to infectious diseases and 
behaviors or perceptions in the presence of potential risk of pathogen 
transmission. Given the onset of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus 2 global pandemic, otherwise known as the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
construct being measured may function differently based on affective, 
behavioral, and cognitive changes along with the need to change norms and 
lifestyles in a global context. The present study aims to test the psychometric 
properties and the gender invariance of the Italian adaptation of the PVDQ to 
confirm that the scale can be used with Italian-speaking people, and that it 
functions effectively during a pandemic.
METHODS: A total of 509 participants filled out an online questionnaire 
including the Italian version of the I-PVDQ (I-PVDQ) and several measures of 
psychological constructs. Reliability and factor analyses (single and 
multigroup) were conducted. Bayesian correlation tests and Bayesian independent 
sample t-tests were used to assess the validity of I-PVDQ.
RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis supported the two-factor structure of the 
I-PVDQ, and factor loadings loaded appropriately onto perceived infectability 
(PI) and germ aversion (GA). In terms of invariance, the scale showed 
configural, metric, scalar, and strict invariance across genders. Decisive 
evidence in favor of correlation with the measure of COVID-19 related fears for 
both PI and GA was found. There was strong evidence for observed correlations 
with COVID-19 related constructs such as intolerance to uncertainty, 
psychological inflexibility, resilience, stress, and anxiety. Women showed 
higher GA than men, while there were no gender differences in PI.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that the I-PVDQ confirms the 
psychometric properties of the original version and that can be used to detect 
PVD when it is affected by environmental circumstances since its functioning is 
preserved during a pandemic."
33,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 60% of patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) 
exhibit secondary acute symptomatic seizures and showed highly sensitive to 
immunotherapy. However, it is difficult for many patients to receive early 
immunotherapy since the early identification of the cause in AE is more complex. 
This study aimed to investigate the early predictors of initial immune-related 
seizures and to guide the evaluation of treatment and prognosis.
METHODS: One hundred and fifty-four patients with new-onset ""unknown etiology"" 
seizures with a course of disease less than 6 months were included. Serum and/or 
cerebrospinal fluid neuron-specific autoantibodies (NSAbs), including 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- Methyl-4-isoxazole 
propionic acid receptor 1 (AMPAR1), AMPAR2, anti-leucine rich glioma inactivated 
1 antibody (LGI1), anti-gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR), 
anti-contact protein-related protein-2 (CASPR2) were used to screen for immune 
etiology of the seizures. In addition, patients with epilepsy and encephalopathy 
were also examined via brain MRI, long-term video EEG, antibody prevalence in 
epilepsy and encephalopathy (APE2) score, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). A 
logistic regression model was used to analyze the early predictors of immune 
etiology.
RESULTS: Thirty-four cases (22.1%) were positive for NSAbs. Among all 154 
patients, 23 cases of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) (21 cases of NSAbs positive), 
1 case of ganglionic glioma (NSAbs positive), 130 cases of epilepsy or seizures 
(12 cases of NSAbs positive) were recorded. Also, there were 17 patients (11.0%) 
with APE2 ≥ 4 points, and all of them met the clinical diagnosis of AE. The 
sensitivity and specificity of APE2 ≥ 4 points for predicting AE were 73.9% and 
100%. The results of multivariate analysis showed that the NSAbs and APE2 scores 
independently influenced the early prediction of initial immune-related seizures 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: NSAbs and APE2 scores could act as early predictors of initial 
immune-related seizures."
34,"BACKGROUND: Standard precautions are minimum infection control practices used to 
prevent the transmission of diseases and applied to all patient care. Nursing 
students are at high risk of exposure to occupational biologic hazards because 
they are obligated to provide care to patients admitted with unknown infection 
statuses. Compliance with standard precautions is an effective and efficient 
means of infection prevention. However, their compliance with standard 
precautions among nursing students is not known in Ethiopia. Therefore, this 
study aimed to assess compliance with standard precautions and associated 
factors among undergraduate BSc nursing students at governmental universities 
located in the Amhara Region, northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 
undergraduate BSc nursing students at the governmental universities located in 
Amhara Region, northwest Ethiopia, from April 15 to May 15, 2021. A simple 
random sampling technique was used to select 423 samples. Descriptive statistics 
were presented in text, tables, and charts. Multicollinearity and model fitness 
were checked. All variables were entered into multivariable logistic regression 
and a P-value of < 0.05 was considered to identify statistically significant 
factors.
RESULT: Around 221 (53.4%) of the study participants were males. Good compliance 
of nursing students towards standard precautions was 56.3% (95% CI = 51.4-60.9), 
which is significantly associated with good knowledge (AOR = 2.52, 95% 
CI = 1.61-3.94), a perceived safe workplace climate (AOR = 2.15, 95% 
CI = 1.24-3.71), and training or seminars related to standard precautions in the 
last six months (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.01-2.29).
CONCLUSION: The overall compliance of nursing students with standard precautions 
was low, with nearly half of the nursing students failing to comply with 
standard precautions. The major factors associated with good compliance were 
good knowledge, a perceived safe workplace, and having seminars or training in 
the last six months. Training, enhancing knowledge, and creating a safe hospital 
environment are recommended to improve nursing students' compliance with 
standard precautions."
35,"BACKGROUND: Efavirenz is an anti-HIV drug, and cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) is 
a CNS-specific enzyme that metabolizes cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol 
(24HC). We have previously shown that allosteric CYP46A1 activation by low-dose 
efavirenz in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) enhanced both 
cholesterol elimination and turnover in the brain and improved animal 
performance in memory tests. Here, we sought to determine whether CYP46A1 could 
be similarly activated by a low-dose efavirenz in human subjects.  METHODS: This 
pilot study enrolled 5 subjects with early AD. Participants were randomized to 
placebo (n = 1) or two daily efavirenz doses (50 mg and 200 mg, n = 2 for each) 
for 20 weeks and evaluated for safety and CYP46A1 target engagement (plasma 24HC 
levels). A longitudinal mixed model was used to ascertain the statistical 
significance of target engagement. We also measured 24HC in CSF and conducted a 
unique stable isotope labeling kinetics (SILK) study with deuterated water to 
directly measure CYP46A1 activity changes in the brain.
RESULTS: In subjects receiving efavirenz, there was a statistically significant 
within-group increase (P ≤ 0.001) in the levels of plasma 24HC from baseline. 
The levels of 24HC in the CSF of subjects on the 200-mg dose of efavirenz were 
also increased. Target engagement was further supported by the labeling kinetics 
of 24HC by deuterated water in the SILK study. There were no serious adverse 
effects in any subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest efavirenz target engagement in human subjects 
with early AD. This supports the pursuit of a larger trial for further 
determination and confirmation of the efavirenz dose that exerts maximal enzyme 
activation, as well as evaluation of this drug's effects on AD biomarkers and 
clinical symptomatology.

36,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is the leading cause of mortality in China. DNA methylation 
has essential roles in multiple diseases, but its association with stroke was 
barely studied. We hereby explored the association between blood-based HTRA 
serine protease 1 (HTRA1) methylation and the risk of stroke.
RESULTS: The association was discovered in a hospital-based case-control study 
(cases/controls = 190:190) and further validated in a prospective nested 
case-control study including 139 cases who developed stroke within 2 years after 
recruitment and 144 matched stroke-free controls. We observed stroke-related 
altered HTRA1 methylation and expression in both case-control study and 
prospective study. This blood-based HTRA1 methylation was associated with stroke 
independently from the known risk factors and mostly affected the older 
population. The prospective results further showed that the altered HTRA1 
methylation was detectable 2 years before the clinical determination of stroke 
and became more robust with increased discriminatory power for stroke along with 
time when combined with other known stroke-related variables [onset 
time ≤ 1 year: area under the curve (AUC) = 0.76].
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, altered HTRA1 methylation was associated with stroke 
at clinical and preclinical stages and thus may provide a potential biomarker in 
the blood for the risk evaluation and preclinical detection of stroke."
37,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative carbohydrates (CHO) supplement has been widely 
investigated in nondiabetic patients undergoing a variety of surgeries. It has 
been proved that preoperative CHO could alleviate postoperative insulin 
resistance (IR) and improve patients' well-being in nondiabetic patients. 
However, it remains controversial whether preoperative CHO could yield similar 
effects in diabetic patients. Till now, seldom has the administration of 
preoperative CHO been investigated in diabetic patients and there are limited 
studies reporting IR and postoperative recovery of diabetic patients undergoing 
cardiac surgery.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We present a prospective, single-center, single-blind, 
randomized, no-treatment controlled trial of preoperative CHO on diabetic 
patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). A total of 
62 patients will be enrolled and randomized to either Group CHO or Group control 
(CTRL). Patients in Group CHO will consume CHO fluid containing 50 g 
carbohydrates orally the evening before surgery (20:00-24:00) while their 
counterparts in Group CTRL will be fasted after 20:00 the evening before 
surgery. The primary endpoint is postoperative IR assessed via homeostasis model 
assessment (HOMA). The secondary endpoints are postoperative levels of potential 
mediators relating to IR including inflammatory factors and stress reaction 
characterized by serum cortisol. Exploratory endpoints are in-hospital clinical 
endpoints. Continuous variables will be compared by Student's t-test or 
Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables will be compared with χ2 test or 
Fisher's exact test. All tests in the present study are two-tailed and P<0.05 is 
considered statistically significant. All analyses will be performed with R 
4.0.4.
DISCUSSION: This is the first prospective randomized controlled trial of 
preoperative CHO in diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery, with the 
hypothesis that preoperative CHO could improve postoperative IR and promote 
postoperative recovery. The research may assist in improving the clinical 
outcomes of diabetic patients undergoing OPCAB.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been prospectively registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov ( https://register.

38,"BACKGROUND: Cytokines secreted in the tumor microenvironment function in cancer 
cachexia (CC), a common clinicopathological syndrome associated with adipocyte 
wasting and skeletal muscle atrophy. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by 
cancer cells actively engage in inter-tissue communication; EVs and enclosed 
cytokines are largely undefined in CC adipocytes wasting.
METHODS: EVs derived from Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and colorectal cancer C26 
cells were extracted and characterized. Conditioned medium and EVs from cancer 
cells were applied to 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Recombinant IL-8, IL-8 neutralizing 
antibody, CXCR2 and NF-κB inhibitor were examined in functional assays. 
Lipolysis of adipocytes was monitored by Western blots, Oil red O staining and 
glycerol assays. Furthermore, LLC and C26 cell lines were established as 
cachexia model to explore the relevance of IL-8 and NF-κB signaling in CC 
adipose wasting. Adipose tissues were collected for histology analyses.
RESULTS: LLC and C26 cell-derived EVs induced lipolysis of 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. 
Specially, Dil-labeled EVs were effectively taken up by 3 T3-L1 adipocytes, 
which were motivated by the delivered IL-8 to elicit the NF-κB pathway. In 
comparison, special IL-8 neutralizing antibody relieved that lipolysis of 
3 T3-L1 adipocytes induced by EVs together with conditioned medium of LLC and 
C26 cells, respectively. Consistently, both CXCR2 and NF-κB inhibitors would 
lessen the phenotype of lipolysis in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. In the in vivo 
settings, both LLC and C26-tumor bearing mice had higher serum IL-8 levels as 
compared to the control groups. Two typical lipolysis markers, PGC1α and UCP1, 
were also up-regulated in the adipose tissues of LLC and C26-tumor mice groups, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: EVs secreted by LLC and C26 tumor cells would induce adipocyte 
wasting via extracellular IL-8-mediated NF-κB signaling. Our study pointed out 
the physiological and therapeutic values of exosomal IL-8 in CC lipolysis."
39,"BACKGROUND: It remains unclear how human and animal displacement impacts 
zoonotic disease risk with little contextualized primary data available. This 
study investigates zoonotic disease dynamics in populations regularly displaced 
due to slow onset disasters and annual monsoons in the Indus Delta in Sindh 
province in southeast Pakistan.
METHODS: Using a case study methodology, semi-structured key informant 
interviews and focus group discussions with 35 participants, as well as 
observational studies were conducted in seven communities in Thatta district.
RESULTS: Key factors affecting zoonotic disease dynamics in environmental 
displacement in Thatta identified in the study include disasters and loss of 
forage, a lack of veterinary and healthcare access, and socio-economic status. 
Animal and human health are an important consideration in displacement 
disrupting communities and livelihoods, affecting safety, health, and food 
security. Displacement results in a poverty spiral whereby the displaced find 
themselves at continuous peril from poverty and disaster, with zoonotic disease 
dynamics shifting based on environmental changes, and an expectation of future 
movement and loss.
CONCLUSION: The precarious conditions generated through the disruption of 
communities and livelihoods makes environmentally displaced populations 
vulnerable to zoonotic disease. To prevent further displacement and disease, 
broader political economy issues need to be addressed, and comprehensive 
assistance provided to support sustainable livelihoods."
40,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants has raised questions 
regarding resistance to immunity by natural infection or immunization. We 
examined the sensitivity of Delta and Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, 
BA.2.12.1, BA.4/5, and BA.3) to neutralizing antibodies from 
BBIBP-CorV-vaccinated and BBIBP-CorV- or ZF2001-boosted individuals, as well as 
individuals with Delta and BA.1 breakthrough infections, and determined their 
fusogenicity and infectivity.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, serum samples from two doses of 
BBIBP-CorV-vaccinated individuals 1 (n = 36), 3 (n = 36), and 7 (n = 37) months 
after the second dose; BBIBP-CorV- (n = 25) or ZF2001-boosted (n = 30) 
individuals; and fully vaccinated individuals with Delta (n = 30) or BA.1 (n = 
26) infection were collected. The serum-neutralizing reactivity and potency of 
bebtelovimab were assessed against D614G, Delta, and Omicron subvariants (BA.1, 
BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4/5, and BA.3) through a pseudovirus neutralization 
assay. The fusogenicity and infectivity of D614G, Delta, and Omicron subvariants 
were determined by cell-cell fusion assay and pseudovirus infection assay, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Omicron subvariants markedly escaped vaccine-elicited neutralizing 
antibodies after two doses of BBIBP-CorV with comparable efficiency. A third 
dose vaccination of BBIBP-CorV or ZF2001 increased neutralizing antibody titers 
and breadth against Delta and three Omicron subvariants. Delta and BA.1 
breakthrough infections induced comparable neutralizing antibody titers against 
D614G and Delta variants, whereas BA.1 breakthrough infections elicited a 
stronger and broader antibody response against three Omicron subvariants than 
Delta breakthrough infections. BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 are more resistant to 
immunity induced by breakthrough infections. Bebtelovimab had no significant 
loss of potency against the Delta and Omicron subvariants. Cell culture 
experiments showed Omicron subvariants to be less fusogenic and have higher 
infectivity than D614G and Delta with comparable efficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings have important public health implications and 
highlight the importance of repeated exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens to broaden 
the neutralizing antibody response against Omicron subvariants."
41,"BACKGROUND: Clinical diagnosis based on machine learning usually uses case 
samples as training samples, and uses machine learning to construct disease 
prediction models characterized by descriptive texts of clinical manifestations. 
However, the problem of sample imbalance often exists in the medical field, 
which leads to a decrease in classification performance of the machine learning.
METHODS: To solve the problem of sample imbalance in medical dataset, we propose 
a hybrid sampling algorithm combining synthetic minority over-sampling technique 
(SMOTE) and edited nearest neighbor (ENN). Firstly, the SMOTE is used to 
over-sampling missed abortion and diabetes datasets, so that the number of 
samples of the two classes is balanced. Then, ENN is used to under-sampling the 
over-sampled dataset to delete the ""noisy sample"" in the majority. Finally, 
Random forest is used to model and predict the sampled missed abortion and 
diabetes datasets to achieve an accurate clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: Experimental results show that Random forest has the best 
classification performance on missed abortion and diabetes datasets after 
SMOTE-ENN sampled, and the MCC index is 95.6% and 90.0%, respectively. In 
addition, the results of pairwise comparison and multiple comparisons show that 
the SMOTE-ENN is significantly better than other sampling algorithms.
CONCLUSION: Random forest has significantly improved all indexes on the missed 
abortion dataset after SMOTE-ENN sampled."
42,"BACKGROUND: CD20-negative diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a very rare and 
heterogeneous invasive cancer characterized by chemical resistance and poor 
prognosis. Primary CD20-negative diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central 
nervous system is even rarer, presenting great challenges in pathological 
diagnosis and clinical treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of primary CD20-negative diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma of the CNS in a 54-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with 
a headache lasting more than 10 days. CT and MRI scans showed right temporal 
lobe lymphoma. Microscopically, large infiltrating lymphoid cells that induced 
brain tissue damage were observed. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor 
cells were CD79a+, PAX-5+, MUM1+, and CD20-. The patient was diagnosed with 
lymphoma and transferred to an oncology hospital for chemotherapy. However, 
because the disease progressed rapidly, the patient died only after two rounds 
of chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first reported 
cases of unclassifiable CD20-negative diffuse large B-cell lymphoma located in 
the CNS. This case report aims to deepen the understanding of 
clinicopathological features of this type of lymphoma and expand the scope of 
this disease."
43,"BACKGROUND: The early life gut microbiome is crucial in maintaining host 
metabolic and immune homeostasis. Though neonates with critical congenital heart 
disease (CCHD) are at substantial risks of malnutrition and immune imbalance, 
the microbial links to CCHD pathophysiology remain poorly understood. In this 
study, we aimed to investigate the gut microbiome in neonates with CCHD in 
association with metabolomic traits. Moreover, we explored the clinical 
implications of the host-microbe interactions in CCHD.
METHODS: Deep metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic profiling of paired fecal 
samples from 45 neonates with CCHD and 50 healthy controls were performed. The 
characteristics of gut microbiome were investigated in three dimensions 
(microbial abundance, functionality, and genetic variation). An in-depth 
analysis of gut virome was conducted to elucidate the ecological interaction 
between gut viral and bacterial communities. Correlations between multilevel 
microbial features and fecal metabolites were determined using integrated 
association analysis. Finally, we conducted a subgroup analysis to examine 
whether the interactions between gut microbiota and metabolites could mediate 
inflammatory responses and poor surgical prognosis.
RESULTS: Gut microbiota dysbiosis was observed in neonates with CCHD, 
characterized by the depletion of Bifidobacterium and overgrowth of 
Enterococcus, which was highly correlated with metabolomic perturbations. 
Genetic variations of Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus orchestrate the 
metabolomic perturbations in CCHD. A temperate core virome represented by 
Siphoviridae was identified to be implicated in shaping the gut bacterial 
composition by modifying microbial adaptation. The overgrowth of Enterococcus 
was correlated with systemic inflammation and poor surgical prognosis in 
subgroup analysis. Mediation analysis indicated that the overgrowth of 
Enterococcus could mediate gut barrier impairment and inflammatory responses in 
CCHD.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that an aberrant gut microbiome 
associated with metabolomic perturbations is implicated in immune imbalance and 
adverse clinical outcomes in neonates with CCHD. Our data support the importance 
of reconstituting optimal gut microbiome in maintaining host metabolic and 
immunological homeostasis in CCHD. Video Abstract."
44,"BACKGROUND: Delusional infestation (DI) is a rare psychotic disorder 
characterized by a patient's false belief that the body is infested with living 
or non-living organisms in the absence of clinical evidence of disease. Based on 
the underlying etiology, DI can be classified into primary and secondary forms 
based on the presence or absence of an underlying condition or previously 
diagnosed psychiatric disorder. This paper discusses a condition that is not 
commonly reported in the literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe four patients diagnosed with DI of the oral 
cavity. In each case, the patients' intraoral examinations revealed either 
traumatic lesions or no signs of mucosal disease. Management involved symptom 
management, medical therapy, and/or a referral to the primary care provider.
CONCLUSION: Because oral health care providers may encounter patients with DI, 
they should familiarize themselves with this unusual condition in order to 
recognize the condition and initiate prompt referral to a psychiatrist."
45,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) combined with hypertension has a higher risk 
of developing cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate the 
relationships between the surrogate indicators of insulin resistance (TyG, 
TG/HDL, and Mets-IR) with the risk of T2D combined with hypertension.
METHODS: This study is based on a functional community cohort from Beijing and 
the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, comprising 4234 and 4658 
participants respectively. Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic 
spline regression were performed to assess the link between TyG, TG/HDL, and 
Mets-IR with T2D combined with hypertension. The cross-lagged panel analysis and 
the mediation analysis were used to examine the temporal relationship between 
insulin resistance and obesity and their temporal relationship with follow-up 
T2D combined with hypertension.
RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted models, higher TyG was associated with a 
higher risk of developing T2D combined with hypertension, the hazard ratios (95% 
confidence interval) were 3.46 (2.43-4.93) and 2.02 (1.67-2.44), in two cohorts 
respectively. A similar positive association was shown for Mets-IR, the hazard 
ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.04 (1.03-1.06) and 1.05 (1.03-1.07), in 
two cohorts respectively. However, the association between TG/HDL with T2D 
combined with hypertension was different in two cohorts. The restricted cubic 
spline regression showed a linear association between TyG and T2D combined with 
hypertension (P-nonlinear > 0.05). The cross-lagged path coefficient from 
baseline BMI to follow-up TyG index was significantly greater than the path 
coefficient from baseline TyG to follow-up BMI. TyG partially mediated the 
effect of BMI on the risk of T2D combined with hypertension and the percentage 
of mediated association was estimated at 41.58% and 48.41% in two cohorts, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicated positive associations between TyG and 
Mets-IR with the risk of T2D combined with hypertension in two cohorts. In 
addition, BMI change may precede TyG index change, and the TyG index plays a 
mediating role in BMI induced T2D combined with hypertension."
46,"BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression (PND) is prevalent and negatively impacts HIV 
care among women living with HIV (WLHIV), yet PND remains under-identified in 
Malawian WLHIV. Accordingly, this formative study explored perceptions of the 
feasibility and acceptability of an integrated, task-shifted approach to PND 
screening and treatment in maternity clinics.
METHODS: We completed consecutive PND screenings of HIV+ women attending pre- or 
post-natal appointments at 5 clinics in Lilongwe district, Malawi. We conducted 
in-depth interviews with the first 4-5 women presenting with PND per site 
(n = 24 total) from July to August 2018. PND classification was based on a 
score ≥ 10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). We conducted 10 
additional in-depth interviews with HIV and mental health providers at the 5 
clinics.
RESULTS: Most participants endorsed the feasibility of integrated PND screening, 
as they believed that PND had potential for significant morbidity. Among 
providers, identified barriers to screening were negative staff attitudes toward 
additional work, inadequate staffing numbers and time constraints. Suggested 
solutions to barriers were health worker training, supervision, and a brief 
screening tool. Patient-centered counselling strategies were favored over 
medication by WLHIV as the acceptable treatment of choice, with providers 
supporting the role of medication to be restricted to severe depression. 
Providers identified nurses as the most suitable health workers to deliver 
task-shifted interventions and emphasized further training as a requirement to 
ensure successful task shifting.
CONCLUSION: Improving PND in a simple, task-shifted intervention is essential 
for supporting mental health among women with PND and HIV. Our results suggest 
that an effective PND intervention for this population should include a brief, 
streamlined PND screening questionnaire and individualized counselling for those 
who have PND, with supplemental support groups and depression medication readily 
available. These study results support the development of a PND intervention to 
address the gap in treatment of PND and HIV among WLHIV in Malawi."
47,"BACKGROUND: Community-based exercise is a continuation and complement to 
inpatient rehabilitation for Parkinson's disease and does not require a 
professional physical therapist or equipment. The effects, parameters, and forms 
of each exercise are diverse, and the effect is affected by many factors. A 
meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect and the best parameters for 
improving motor symptoms and to explore the possible factors affecting the 
effect of community-based exercise.  METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive 
search of six databases: PEDro, PubMed/Medline, CENTRAL, Scopus, Embase, and 
WOS. Studies that compared community-based exercise with usual care were 
included. The intervention mainly included dance, Chinese martial arts, Nordic 
walking, and home-based exercise. The primary outcome measure was the Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) score. The mean difference 
(95% CI) was used to calculate the treatment outcomes of continuous outcome 
variables, and the I2 statistic was used to estimate the heterogeneity of the 
statistical analysis. We conducted subgroup analysis and meta-regression 
analysis to determine the optimal parameters and the most important influencing 
factors of the exercise effect.  RESULTS: Twenty-two studies that enrolled a 
total of 809 subjects were included in the analysis. Exercise had a positive 
effect on the UPDRS-III (MD = -5.83; 95% CI, -8.29 to -3.37), Timed Up and Go 
test (MD = -2.22; 95% CI -3.02 to -1.42), UPDRS ((MD = -7.80; 95% CI -10.98 to 
-6.42), 6-Minute Walk Test (MD = 68.81; 95% CI, 32.14 to 105.48), and Berg 
Balance Scale (MD = 4.52; 95% CI, 2.72 to 5.78) scores. However, the 
heterogeneity of each included study was obvious. Weekly frequency, age, and 
duration of treatment were all factors that potentially influenced the effect.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that community-based exercise may 
benefit motor function in patients with PD. The most commonly used modalities of 
exercise were tango and tai chi, and the most common prescription was 60 min 
twice a week. Future studies should consider the influence of age, duration of 
treatment, and weekly frequency on the effect of exercise.

48,"For the burgeoning global population, sustainable agriculture practices are 
crucial for accomplishing the zero-hunger goal. The agriculture sector is very

microbial bio-stimulants, which have fewer negative effects and are more 
efficient than synthetic agro-chemicals. In this context, one of the most 
important approaches in sustainable agriculture is the use of biocontrol 
microbes that can suppress phytopathogens and insects. Simultaneously, it is

49,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is associated with 
remodeling of gut microbiota. Many studies have found H. pylori infection and 
eradication therapy can alter the gut microbiota. However, few studies explored 
the impact of eradication therapy containing minocycline and metronidazole on 
gut microbiota.
AIM: The objective of the present study was to explore the changes of gut 
microbiota after H. pylori infection. Besides, learn more about the dynamic 
changes of gut microbiota during different stages of eradication treatment 
containing minocycline, metronidazole, bismuth agents and proton pump 
inhibitors.
METHODS: Sixty stool samples from the patients with H. pylori infection before 
eradication, 14 and 42 days after eradication, and ten stool samples from 
non-infected individuals were collected. Subsequently, we performed 16S rRNA 
gene amplicon sequencing to analyze these samples, and the results were 
evaluated by using alpha diversity, beta diversity and microbial composition 
analyses. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of 
Unobserved States was also used to predict the metabolic pathways according to 
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database.
RESULTS: The alpha and beta diversity of the microbiota changed significantly in 
H. pylori infected individuals, but returned to baseline 42 days after 
eradication therapy. At the genus level, the abundances of Bacteroidetes, 
[Ruminococcus]_gnavus_group, Ruminococcaceae_Incertae_Sedis, Tuzzrealla, 
Butyricicoccus were significantly lower in the H. pylori infected group. 
Bacterial abundance was also dynamically changing during eradication treatment. 
In addition, PICRUST analysis found the levels of uronic acid metabolism, 
uncharacterized transport system, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids 
were higher in H. pylori infected individuals than in the non-infected group.
CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal microbiota diversity, composition, functional 
predictions altered significantly after H. pylori infection, and gradually 
returned to healthy control levels after the application of eradication therapy 
containing minocycline and metronidazole in one month and a half."
50,"BACKGROUND: Brain cancer is one of the most aggressive cancer types owing to 
poor treatment effects. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that allergies 
may increase the disease risk. Therefore, this study evaluated the association 
between eczema and the risk of various brain cancers.
METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Embase databases from their 
inception until June 23, 2022. Two reviewers independently reviewed and screened 
the articles, extracted data, assessed the study quality, and pooled the 
results. Stata software was used to generate pooled odds ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: We included 20 studies comprising 5,117,222 patients that investigated 
the relationship between eczema and brain cancer. Eczema was significantly 
inversely associated with the risk of brain cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95% 
CI, 0.77-0.87), glioma (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.14-2.02), meningioma (OR, 0.74; 95% 
CI, 0.66-0.84), and acoustic neuroma (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41-0.88). Interesting, 
The strong correlation between eczema and the reduced risk of brain cancer was 
observed in people over 16 years old (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71-0.88), but not in 
those under 16 years old (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79-1.11). In addition, subgroup 
analyses found that eczema significantly decreased the glioma risk in Europeans 
(OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65-0.82) but not Australians (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.14-2.02) 
or Americans (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.69-1.46).
CONCLUSION: Eczema may be considered as a potential protective factor of brain 
cancer in population aged over 16 years. However, this relationship requires 
verification using large-scale clinical data."
51,"BACKGROUND: Fungal periprosthetic joint infections are rare. Acremonium 
osteoarticular infections are scarcely reported. Variable susceptibility to 
antifungal agents have been reported and optimal pharmacotherapy has yet to be 
established. Here we illustrate an Acremonium osteoarticular infection involving 
a prosthetic joint and present an antifungal regimen that had led to treatment 
success.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 had 
left total knee arthroplasty done in 2012 with a cementless implant for knee 
osteoarthritis. In 2019, the patient had asymptomatic, progressive osteolysis 
with fracture and migration of the femoral component warranting replacement. 
Eleven months later, the patient developed significant pain, redness, and 
swelling in the left leg and knee concerning for periprosthetic joint infection 
that failed outpatient antibiotic treatment. Further investigation revealed 
infection by Acremonium species. A revision of the joint was successfully 
completed, and the patient was placed on voriconazole for one year. Subsequent 
cultures did not yield any fungal growth.
CONCLUSION: While an optimal antifungal regimen for periprosthetic joint 
infections has not been well established, voriconazole is a relatively safe and 
effective agent that can be used as a long-term therapy. With variable 
susceptibility testing in reported isolates, individualized antifungal 
susceptibility should be used to guide therapy for Acremonium infections."
52,"BACKGROUND: Identifying the risk factors leading to hypertension can help 
explain why some populations are at a greater risk for developing hypertension 
than others. The present study seeks to identify the association between the 
risk factors of hypertension in 35- to 65-year-old participants in western Iran.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 9705 adults from baseline 
data of Ravansar Non-Communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort study, in the west 
region of Iran. Each of the latent variables were confirmed by confirmatory 
factor analysis. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we assessed the 
direct and indirect effects of factors associated with blood pressure.
RESULTS: Socioeconomic status (SES), physical activity, mean of serum lipids, 
obesity, diabetes and family history of hypertension had a diverse impact on the 
blood pressure, directly and (or) indirectly. The standardized total effect of 
SES, physical activity, mean of serum lipids, and obesity were -0.09 vs. -0.14, 
-0.04 vs. -0.04, 0.13 vs. 0.13 and 0.24 vs. 0.15 in men and women, respectively. 
Diabetes had a direct relationship with the blood pressure in women (0.03).
CONCLUSION: With regard to control of high blood pressure, public health 
interventions must target obesity, lifestyle and other risk related to 
nutritional status such as hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in Iranian 
population and among those with higher SES."
53,"BACKGROUND: Public health dashboards have been used in the past to communicate 
and guide local responses to outbreaks, epidemics, and a host of various health 
conditions. During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, dashboards 
proliferated but the availability and quality differed across the world. This 
study aimed to evaluate the quality, access, and end-user experience of one such 
dashboard in the Western Cape province, South Africa.
METHODS: We analysed retrospective aggregate data on viewership over time for 
the first year since launch of the dashboard (30 April 2020 - 29 April 2021) and 
conducted a cross-sectional survey targeting adult users of the dashboard at one 
year post the initial launch. The self-administered, anonymous questionnaire 
with a total of 13 questions was made available via an online digital survey 
tool for a 2-week period (6 May 2021 - 21 May 2021).
RESULTS: After significant communication by senior provincial political leaders, 
adequate media coverage and two waves of COVID-19 the Western Cape public 
COVID-19 dashboard attracted a total of 2,248,456 views during its first year. 
The majority of these views came from Africa/South Africa with higher median 
daily views during COVID-19 wave periods. A total of 794 participants responded 
to the survey questionnaire. Reported devices used to access the dashboard 
differed statistically between occupational status groups with students tending 
toward using mobile devices whilst employed and retired participants tending 
toward using desktop computers/laptops. Frequency of use increases with 
increasing age with 65.1% of those > 70 years old viewing it daily. Overall, 
76.4% of respondents reported that the dashboard influenced their personal 
planning and behaviour. High Likert score ratings were given for clarity, ease 
of use and overall end-user experience, with no differences seen across the 
various age groups surveyed.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that both the availability of data and an 
understanding of end-user need is critical when developing and delivering public 
health tools that may ultimately garner public trust and influence individual 
behaviour."
54,"OBJECTIVE: This study mainly analysed the imaging data for seven cases of adult 
pancreatoblastoma (PB) and summarized additional imaging features of this 
disease based on a literature review, aiming to improve the understanding and 
diagnosis rate of this disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The imaging data for seven adult patients pathologically 
diagnosed with adult PB were retrospectively analysed. Among the seven patients, 
six underwent computed tomography (CT) scans, two patients underwent abdominal 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and five patients underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT.
RESULTS: The tumours were located in the head of the pancreas in three cases, in 
the tail of the pancreas in two cases, and in the gastric antrum and neck of the 
pancreas in one case. Six tumours showed blurred edges, and an incomplete 
envelope was observed in only two cases when enhanced, which showed extruded 
growth and cyst-solid masses; one tumour was a solid mass with ossification. 
Showing mild or significant enhancement in the arterial phase (AP) for six 
cases. In the MRI sequence, isointensity was found on suppressed T1-weighted 
imaging, and hyperintensity was noted on suppressed T2-weighted imaging in two 
cases, with significant enhancement. Pancreatic duct dilatation was found in 
four cases. Tumour 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging exhibited high uptake in five cases.
CONCLUSION: Adult PB involves a single tumour and commonly manifests as 
cystic-solid masses with blurred edges. Capsules are rare, ossification is an 
important feature, tumours can also present in ectopic pancreatic tissues, with 
mild or strengthening in the AP, and 18F-FDG uptake is high. These features are 
relatively specific characteristics in adult PB."
55,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) is an important pathogen causing 
respiratory diseases and arthritis in chickens and turkeys, thus, resulting in 
serious economic losses to the poultry industry. Membrane-associated proteins 
are thought to play important roles in cytoadherence and pathogenesis. NADH 
oxidase (NOX) is an oxidoreductase involved in glycolysis, which is thought to 
be a multifunctional protein and potential virulence factor in some pathogens. 
However, little is known regarding the NOX of MS (MSNOX). We previously 
demonstrated that MSNOX was a metabolic enzyme distributed in not only the 
cytoplasm but also the MS membrane. This study was aimed at exploring NOX's 
potential as a diagnostic antigen and its role in MS cytoadherence.
RESULTS: Western blots and ELISAs indicated that recombinant MSNOX (rMSNOX) 
protein reacted with sera positive for various MS isolates, but not MG isolates 
or other avian pathogens, thus, suggesting that rMSNOX is a potential diagnostic 
antigen. In addition, rabbit anti-rMSNOX serum showed substantial 
complement-dependent mycoplasmacidal activity toward various MS isolates and MG 
Rlow. MSNOX protein was found not only in the cytoplasm but also on the membrane 
of MS through suspension immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy 
assays. Indirect immunofluorescence assays indicated that rMSNOX adhered to DF-1 
cells, and this adherence was inhibited by rabbit anti-rMSNOX, but not anti-MG 
serum. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence and colony counting assays 
confirmed that the rabbit anti-rMSNOX serum inhibited the adherence of various 
MS isolates but not MG Rlow to DF-1 cells. Moreover, plasminogen (Plg)- and 
fibronectin (Fn)-binding assays demonstrated that rMSNOX bound Plg and Fn in a 
dose-dependent manner, thereby further confirming that MSNOX may be a putative 
adhesin.
CONCLUSION: MSNOX was identified to be a surface immunogenic protein that has 
good immunoreactivity and specificity in Western blot and ELISA, and therefore, 
may be used as a potential diagnostic antigen in the future. In addition, rMSNOX 
adhered to DF-1 cells, an effect inhibited by rabbit anti-rMSNOX, but not 
anti-MG serum, and anti-rMSNOX serum inhibited the adherence of various MS 
isolates, but not MG Rlow, to DF-1 cells, thus indicating that the inhibition of 
adherence by anti-MSNOX serum was MS specific. Moreover, rMSNOX adhered to 
extracellular matrix proteins including Plg and Fn, thus suggesting that NOX may 
play important roles in MS cytoadherence and pathogenesis. Besides, rabbit 
anti-rMSNOX serum presented complement-dependent mycoplasmacidal activity toward 
both MS and MG, indicating the MSNOX may be further studied as a potential 
protective vaccine candidate."
56,"BACKGROUND: In general, animal diseases have a significant impact on public 
health; accordingly, an effective animal disease surveillance system is an 
important control system that requires efficient and engaging participants in 
the long run. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of monetary and 
social motivation on animal disease surveillance. We hypothesized that there are 
two sorts of motivation based on Fiske's relational theory (1992): monetary 
incentives (monetary markets) and nonmonetary incentives (social markets).
METHODS: In Chiang Mai Province, Northern Thailand, we analyzed data from a 
pilot project that began in 2014 and used a mobile application to report on 
signs that identify animal health problems. A total of 67 participants from 17 
different areas in the central part of the province participated in this study. 
Participants in this study were divided into two groups: those who received 
monetary incentives and those who received social incentives.
RESULTS: According to the findings, the monetary market group's effort was 
significantly higher than that of the social market group during the time when 
the volunteers in the monetary market group were paid. However, in the long run, 
the monetary market group reported significantly less than the social market 
group. Social incentive, on the other hand, was more efficient once the payment 
period ended.
CONCLUSIONS: Social incentive outperformed monetary motivation in terms of 
efficiency and sustainability in the long run. Not only did the volunteers who 
were offered monetary incentive put in less effort than those who were offered 
the social incentive, but they were also not remotivated by the social incentive 
after the payment period had ended."
57,"BACKGROUND: In children, chronic wet cough may be a sign of underlying lung 
disease, including protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and bronchiectasis. 
Chronic (> 4 weeks in duration) wet cough (without indicators pointing to 
alternative causes) that responds to antibiotic treatment is diagnostic of PBB. 
Timely recognition and management of PBB can prevent disease progression to 
irreversible bronchiectasis with lifelong consequences. However, detection and 
management require timely health-seeking by carers and effective management by 
clinicians. We aim to improve (a) carer health-seeking for chronic wet cough in 
their child and (b) management of chronic wet cough in children by clinicians. 
We hypothesise that implementing a culturally integrated program, which is 
informed by barriers and facilitators identified by carers and health 
practitioners, will result in improved lung health of First Nations children, 
and in the future, a reduced the burden of bronchiectasis through the prevention 
of the progression of protracted bacterial bronchitis to bronchiectasis.
METHODS: This study is a multi-centre, pseudorandomised, stepped wedge design. 
The intervention is the implementation of a program. The program has two 
components: a knowledge dissemination component and an implementation component. 
The implementation is adapted to each study site using a combined Aboriginal 
Participatory Action Research and an Implementation Science approach, guided by 
the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research. There are three 
categories of outcome measures related to (i) health (ii) cost, and (iii) 
implementation. We will measure health-seeking as the proportion of parents 
seeking help for their child in a 6-month period before the intervention and the 
same 6-month period (i.e., the same six calendar months) thereafter. The 
parent-proxy, Cough-specific Quality of Life (PC-QoL) will be the primary 
health-related outcome measure.
DISCUSSION: We hypothesise that a tailored intervention at each site will result 
in improved health-seeking for carers of children with a chronic wet cough and 
improved clinician management of chronic wet cough. In addition, we expect this 
will result in improved lung health outcomes for children with a chronic wet 
cough.

58,"BACKGROUND: Nocardia cyriacigeorgica is one of the most common Nocardia species 
found in human infections, recently reclassified. Even though Nocardia may 
affect all organs by hematogenous dissemination, bacteremia are uncommon. Among 
all possible dissemination sites, the involvement of the adrenal glands is 
particularly rare.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a rare case of Nocardia disseminated infection 
with notably bacteremia and adrenal gland abscess, in a 77-years-old 
immunocompetent man. Adrenal gland abscess diagnosis was made by imaging 
(computerized tomography, magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography 
scan). A complete regression of all lesions including the left adrenal gland was 
obtained after 6 months of antibiotics. A review of literature was also 
performed.
CONCLUSION: Nocardia bacteremia is a rare event but blood cultures may help to 
improve detection of Nocardia spp. in a non-invasive way. Adrenal abscess due to 
Nocardia spp. is very rare with only fourteen cases reported in the literature, 
but it is a true cause of adrenal masses. Our report suggests that clinician 
should be aware of this rare location and prioritize a non-invasive diagnosis 
strategy."
59,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease with the 
potential for significant morbidity in case of suboptimal treatment (e.g. low 
treatment adherence). In spite of immense research in IBD, literature on 
association of IBD with race/ethnicity is fragmented. In this study, we aimed to 
evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and treatment adherence and 
persistence among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) 
initiated with biologic therapies.
METHODS: This observational, retrospective study utilized the Optum 
Clinformatics (Optum) Extended Data Mart Socioeconomic Status (SES) database. 
Adult patients with ≥ 2 medical claims for CD or UC diagnosis, ≥ 1 medical or 
pharmacy claim for corresponding FDA-approved biologic therapy, and a ≥ 12-month 
pre-index (index date: date of the first biologic medical/pharmacy claim) 
continuous health plan enrollment were included. Treatment adherence was 
measured as the proportion of days covered of ≥ 80% and treatment persistence by 
the number of days from the index date to the biologics discontinuation date. 
Switching among biologics was allowed for both treatment adherence and treatment 
persistence. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to evaluate the 
association between race/ethnicity and treatment adherence/persistence.
RESULTS: Among patients with CD (N = 1430) and UC (N = 1059) included, majority 
were White (CD: 80.3%, UC: 78.3%), followed by African Americans (AA; CD: 10.5%, 
UC: 9.7%). Among patients with CD, AA were significantly less likely to adhere 
to biologics (adjusted OR [95%CI]: 0.61 [0.38; 0.99]) and more likely to 
discontinue biologics earlier (adjusted HR [95%CI]: 1.52 [1.16; 2.0]) during the 
follow-up period compared to Whites, after adjusting for other patient 
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Among patients with UC, no 
significant differences in the treatment adherence/persistence were observed 
between different races/ethnicities.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD were found to display racial differences in the 
treatment adherence and persistence of biologics, with significantly lower 
adherence and earlier discontinuation in AA compared to Whites. Such differences 
were not observed in patients with UC. Future studies are warranted to 
understand the possible reasons for racial differences, particularly in patients 
with CD."
60,"BACKGROUNDS: Remarkable interindividual variability in clopidogrel response is 
observed, genetic polymorphisms in P2RY12 and its signal pathway is supposed to 
affect clopidogrel response in CHD patients.
METHODS: 539 CHD patients treated with clopidogrel were recruited. The platelet 
reaction index (PRI) indicated by VASP-P level were detected in 12-24 h after 
clopidogrel loading dose or within 5-7 days after initiation of maintain dose 
clopidogrel. A total of 13 SNPs in relevant genes were genotyped in sample A 
(239 CHD patients). The SNPs which have significant differences in PRI will be 
validated in another sample (sample B, 300 CHD patients).
RESULTS: CYP2C19*2 increased the risk of clopidogrel resistance significantly. 
When CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 were considered, CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) 
alleles were associated with more obviously increased the risk of clopidogrel 
resistance; P2RY12 rs6809699C > A polymorphism was also associated with 
increased risk of clopidogrel resistance (AA vs CC: P = 0.0398). This difference 
still existed after stratification by CYP2C19 genotypes. It was also validated 
in sample B. The association was also still significant even in the case of 
stratification by CYP2C19 genotypes in all patients (sample A + B).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that P2RY12 rs6809699 is associated with 
clopidogrel resistance in CHD patients. Meanwhile, the rs6809699 AA genotype can 
increase on-treatment platelet activity independent of CYP2C19 LOF 
polymorphisms."
61,"BACKGROUND: Urogenital schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease most 
prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. In the Senegal river basin, the construction of 
the Diama dam led to an increase and endemicity of schistosomiasis. Since 2009, 
praziquantel has frequently been used as preventive chemotherapy in the form of 
mass administration to Senegalese school-aged children without monitoring of the 
treatment efficacy and the prevalence after re-infection. This study aims to 
determine the current prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis (caused by 
Schistosoma haematobium), the efficacy of praziquantel, and the re-infection 
rates in children from five villages with different water access.
METHODS: The baseline prevalence of S. haematobium was determined in August 2020 
in 777 children between 5 and 11 years old and a single dose of praziquantel 
(40 mg/kg) was administered to those positive. The efficacy of praziquantel and 
the re-infection rates were monitored 4 weeks and 7 months after treatment, 
respectively, in 226 children with a high intensity of infection at baseline.
RESULTS: At the baseline, prevalence was low among children from the village of 
Mbane who live close to the Lac de Guiers (38%), moderate among those from the 
villages of Dioundou and Khodit, which neighbor the Doue river (46%), and very 
high at Khodit (90.6%) and Guia (91.2%) which mainly use an irrigation canal. 
After treatment, the observed cure rates confirmed the efficacy of praziquantel. 
The lowest cure rate (88.5%) was obtained in the village using the irrigation 
canal, while high cure rates were obtained in those using the lake (96.5%) and 
the river (98%). However, high egg reduction rates (between 96.7 and 99.7%) were 
obtained in all the villages. The re-infection was significantly higher in the 
village using the canal (42.5%) than in the villages accessing the Lac de Guiers 
(18.3%) and the Doue river (14.8%).
CONCLUSION: Praziquantel has an impact on reducing the prevalence and intensity 
of urogenital schistosomiasis. However, in the Senegal river basin, S. 
haematobium remains a real health problem for children living in the villages 
near the irrigation canals, despite regular treatment, while prevalence is 
declining from those frequenting the river and the Lac de Guiers. Trial

62,"Orthodontic tooth movement relies on bone remodeling and periodontal tissue 
regeneration in response to the complicated mechanical cues on the compressive 
and tensive side. In general, mechanical stimulus regulates the expression of 
mechano-sensitive coding and non-coding genes, which in turn affects how cells 
are involved in bone remodeling. Growing numbers of non-coding RNAs, 
particularly mechano-sensitive non-coding RNA, have been verified to be 
essential for the regulation of osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis and have 
revealed how they interact with signaling molecules to do so. This review 
summarizes recent findings of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and long 
non-coding RNAs, as crucial regulators of gene expression responding to 
mechanical stimulation, and outlines their roles in bone deposition and 
resorption. We focused on multiple mechano-sensitive miRNAs such as miR-21, 
- 29, -34, -103, -494-3p, -1246, -138-5p, -503-5p, and -3198 that play a 
critical role in osteogenesis function and bone resorption. The emerging roles 
of force-dependent regulation of lncRNAs in bone remodeling are also discussed 
extensively. We summarized mechano-sensitive lncRNA XIST, H19, and MALAT1 along 
with other lncRNAs involved in osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Ultimately, 
we look forward to the prospects of the novel application of non-coding RNAs as 
potential therapeutics for tooth movement and periodontal tissue regeneration."
63,"BACKGROUND: Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, interfere with daily 
function and are one of the major causes of disability, institutionalization, 
and death. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, 
the effect of significant and sustained weight loss following bariatric surgery 
on dementia is not known. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term 
risk of dementia following bariatric surgery.
METHODS: A surgical cohort was identified from the Utah Bariatric Surgery 
Registry and was linked to the Utah Population Database that includes electronic 
medical records, death records, and State Facility data. Adult subjects 
(≥ 18 years old) at time of surgery (1996-2016) were matched with non-surgical 
subjects. The final sample included 51,078 subjects (1:2 matching); surgery 
group n = 17,026; non-surgery subjects n = 34,052). Dementia were identified by 
ICD-9/10 diagnosis codes following surgery year or matched baseline year. Cox 
proportional hazard model was used to calculate the hazard ratio in the outcome 
between the groups.
RESULTS: Average (SD) age of the subjects was 42 (12) years old at surgery or 
matched baseline year, 78% were female and mean follow-up time was 10.5 years. 
1.4% of the surgery group and 0.5% of the control group had an incidence of 
dementia. Controlling the covariates in the Cox regression, the surgery group 
had a higher risk for dementia incidence than the matched non-surgery subjects 
(HR = 1.33, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed an increased hazard for dementia in individuals 
who underwent bariatric surgery compared to matched non-surgical subjects. 
Additional long-term data is needed to verify this association."
64,"The uterine luminal epithelium, glandular epithelium, and stromal cells are 
vital for the establishment of pregnancy. Previously studies have shown various 
methods to isolate mouse uterine epithelium and stromal cells, including laser 
capture microdissection (LCM), enzyme digestion, and immunomagnetic beads. 
Despite the importance of the endometrial epithelium as the site of implantation 
and nutritional support for the conceptus, there is no isolated method to 
separate the luminal epithelium and glandular epithelium. Here, we establish a 
novel enzyme-based way to separate two types of epithelium and keep their 
viability. In this article, we analyzed their purity by mRNA level, 
immunostaining, and transcriptome analysis. Our isolation method revealed 
several unstudied luminal and glandular epithelial markers in transcriptome 
analysis. We further demonstrated the viability of the isolated epithelium by 2D 
and 3D cultures. The results showed that we successfully separated the 
endometrial luminal epithelium and glandular epithelium. We also provided an 
experimental model for the following study of the physiological function of the 
different parts of the uterus and related diseases."
65,"BACKGROUND: Tinea capitis (TC) is a dermatophytosis of the scalp and hair, which 
occurs less common in children younger than two years of age, and the data of TC 
in this age group are still unknown.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to reveal the epidemiological, clinical and mycological 
characteristics of TC in children under two years old.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all reported cases of TC in children in 
their first two years of life from 1991 to 2022, by searching PubMed, Embase, 
Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang and Weipu databases.
RESULTS: A total of 47 articles involving 126 cases of pediatric TC were 
enrolled in this study. The sex ratio (M/F) was 1.28:1. The age of the children 
ranged from ten days old to two years old with a median age of three months. The 
main clinical manifestations were alopecic patches (40 cases, 31.7%) and scaling 
(39 cases, 31.0%) on the scalp, and 29 infants (23.0%) appeared kerion. The most 
common sources of contagion were animals (35 cases, 27.78%) and humans (31 
cases, 24.60%). The leading pathogens were Microsporidium canis (64 cases, 
50.79%), followed by Trichophyton violaceum (13 cases, 10.32%), T. 
mentagrophytes complex (12 cases, 9.52%) and T. tonsurans (10 cases, 7.94%). 
Ninety-five children (75.40%) were treated with systemic antifungal drugs and 22 
patients (17.46%) were only treated with topical therapy. Except for 10 patients 
with unknown final prognosis, all the other cases were cured after treatment. 
There was one child (0.79%) relapsed after treatment with griseofulvin and one 
case (0.79%) presented with gastrointestinal symptoms from griseofulvin.
CONCLUSION: The principal clinical symptoms of TC in children less than two 
years old were alopecic patches and scaling. The top four pathogens were M. 
canis, T. violaceum, T. mentagrophytes complex and T. tonsurans. Oral treatment 
for pediatric TC had achieved good therapeutic effects, and topical therapy can 
be an alternative choice."
66,"PURPOSE: To compare the perioperative and oncologic outcomes between minimally 
invasive pelvic organ-preserving radical cystectomy (MIPOPRC) and open pelvic 
organ-preserving radical cystectomy (open POPRC) among female patients with 
bladder cancer (BCa).
METHODS: We identified female patients who underwent POPRC for BCa at three 
centers between January 2006 and April 2018. Female patients who underwent open 
POPRC were matched with those who underwent MIPOPRC using 1:1 propensity score 
(PS) matching. The patient demographics and perioperative and oncologic outcomes 
were evaluated for the comparison between MIPOPRC and open POPRC.
RESULTS: Among the 158 patients enrolled, 83 patients underwent MIPOPRC, and 75 
underwent open POPRC. A total of 60 MIPOPRC and 60 open POPRC patients were 
matched successfully. The cancer-specific survival (CSS) and recurrence-free 
survival (RFS) did not differ significantly in the propensity score-weighted 
cohort (p = 0.297 and p = 0.600, respectively). Subgroup analysis by age and 
pathologic stage in the matched cohort revealed that CSS and RFS were with no 
differences among all subgroups. Moreover, multivariable Cox regression analyses 
showed that the surgical approach (MIPOPRC vs open POPRC) was not a predictor of 
CSS (p = 0.250).
CONCLUSION: MIPOPRC was non-inferior to open POPRC in terms of oncologic 
outcomes among female patients. MIPOPRC could be technically feasible in 
selected female patients with BCa."
67,"Infection with Thelazia nematodes results in eye disease in wild and domestic 
animals. The aim of the present study was to describe the occurrence of Thelazia 
nematodes in European bison, and to subject the isolated parasites to molecular 
identification and phylogenetical analysis. The eyeballs of 18 European bison 
from the Bieszczady Mountains, culled due to dysfunctional vision, were 
collected for study. The conjunctival sacs, tear ducts, corneal surface and 
nictitating membrane were rinsed with a saline solution. Any obtained nematodes 
were isolated under a stereoscopic microscope, and then identified as T. gulosa 
or T. skrjabini by molecular analysis of partial cox1 sequences. The prevalence 
of infection with Thelazia spp. was found to be 61%, with a 95% confidence 
interval (CI 95%) of 39-80%. Thelazia skrjabini was isolated from 56% (CI 95% 
34-75%) of examined animals; T. gulosa was significantly less common (p = 0.038) 
with the prevalence of infection reaching 22% (CI 95% 9-45%). Three European 
bison were cross-infected with both T. gulosa and T. skrjabini. Phylogenetic 
analysis found the obtained sequences to be similar to those of Thelazia species 
from domestic ungulates in Europe. Infection intensity ranged from 1 to 16 
nematodes per individual (median of three nematodes), and was significantly 
higher in females (6 nematodes) than in males (1 nematode; p = 0.019). A 
tendency for seasonal occurrence of nematodes in European bison was also 
observed. Our study provides further information regarding the patterns of 
Thelazia transmission in European bison in Poland."
68,"Adaptive immunity controls Trypanosoma cruzi infection, but the protozoan 
parasite persists and causes Chagas disease. T cells undergo apoptosis, and the 
efferocytosis of apoptotic cells might suppress macrophages and exacerbate 
parasite infection. Nonetheless, the receptors involved in the efferocytosis of 
apoptotic lymphocytes during infection remain unknow. Macrophages phagocytose 
apoptotic cells by using the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family of receptors. To 
address how the efferocytosis of apoptotic cells affects macrophage-mediated 
immunity, we employ here Axl receptor- and Mer receptor-deficient mouse strains. 
In bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), both Axl and Mer receptors play a 
role in the efferocytosis of proapoptotic T cells from T. cruzi-infected mice. 
Moreover, treatment with a TAM receptor inhibitor blocks efferocytosis and 
upregulates M1 hallmarks induced by immune T cells from infected mice. 
Remarkably, the use of Axl-/- but not Mer-/- macrophages increases 
T-cell-induced M1 responses, such as nitric oxide production and control of 
parasite infection. Furthermore, infected Axl-/- mice show reduced peak 
parasitemia, defective efferocytosis, improved M1 responses, and ameliorated 
cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, Axl induces efferocytosis, 
disrupts M1 responses, and promotes parasite infection and pathology in 
experimental Chagas disease. Axl stands as a potential host-direct target for 
switching macrophage phenotypes in infectious diseases."
69,"Associations of total testosterone (T) and calculated free T with cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) remain poorly understood. Particularly how these associations vary 
according to race and ethnicity in a nationally representative sample of men. 
Data included 7058 men (≥20 years) from NHANES. CVD was defined as any reported 
diagnosis of heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial 
infarction (MI), and stroke. Total T (ng/mL) was obtained among males who 
participated in the morning examination. Weighted multivariable-adjusted 
logistic regression models were conducted. We found associations of low T 
(OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.17-2.11), low calculated free T (OR = 1.53, 95% 
CI = 1.10-2.17), total T (Q1 vs Q5), and calculated free T (Q1 vs Q5) with CVD 
after adjusting for estradiol and SHBG. In disease specific analysis, low T 
increased prevalence of MI (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.08-2.75) and HF (OR = 1.74, 
95% CI = 1.08-2.82), but a continuous increment of total T reduced the 
prevalence of CAD. Similar inverse associations were identified among White and 
Mexican Americans, but not Blacks (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.49-1.76). Low levels of 
T and calculated free T were associated with an increased prevalence of overall 
CVD and among White and Mexican Americans. Associations remained in the same 
direction with specific CVD outcomes in the overall population."
70,"Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), as a rapid and nondestructive 
biological detection method, promises greatly for clinical on spot and early

71,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit a propensity for transformation to 
secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), for which the underlying mechanisms 
remain poorly understood, resulting in limited treatment options and dismal 
clinical outcomes. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on serial MPN 
and sAML patient stem and progenitor cells, identifying aberrantly increased 
expression of DUSP6 underlying disease transformation. Pharmacologic 
dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP)6 targeting led to inhibition of S6 and Janus 
kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling 
while also reducing inflammatory cytokine production. DUSP6 perturbation further 
inhibited ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)1, which we identified as a second 
indispensable candidate associated with poor clinical outcome. Ectopic 
expression of DUSP6 mediated JAK2-inhibitor resistance and exacerbated disease 
severity in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Contrastingly, DUSP6 
inhibition potently suppressed disease development across Jak2V617F and MPLW515L 
MPN mouse models and sAML PDXs without inducing toxicity in healthy controls. 
These findings underscore DUSP6 in driving disease transformation and highlight 
the DUSP6-RSK1 axis as a vulnerable, druggable pathway in myeloid malignancies."
72,"Patients with cancer are at high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), with high morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, impaired humoral 
response renders severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
vaccines less effective and treatment options are scarce. Randomized trials 
using convalescent plasma are missing for high-risk patients. Here, we performed 
a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial ( 
https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-001632-10/DE ) in 
hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 134) within four risk groups 
((1) cancer (n = 56); (2) immunosuppression (n = 16); (3) laboratory-based risk 
factors (n = 36); and (4) advanced age (n = 26)) randomized to standard of care 
(control arm) or standard of care plus convalescent/vaccinated anti-SARS-CoV-2 
plasma (plasma arm). No serious adverse events were observed related to the 
plasma treatment. Clinical improvement as the primary outcome was assessed using 
a seven-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes were time to discharge and 
overall survival. For the four groups combined, those receiving plasma did not 
improve clinically compared with those in the control arm (hazard ratio 
(HR) = 1.29; P = 0.205). However, patients with cancer experienced a shortened 
median time to improvement (HR = 2.50; P = 0.003) and superior survival with 
plasma treatment versus the control arm (HR = 0.28; P = 0.042). Neutralizing 
antibody activity increased in the plasma cohort but not in the control cohort 
of patients with cancer (P = 0.001). Taken together, convalescent/vaccinated 
plasma may improve COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer who are unable to 
intrinsically generate an adequate immune response."
73,"The past eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC)/International Union against Cancer (UICC) pathologic 
tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) staging system for esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (ESCC) patients, which also is the gold standard of postoperative 
treatment decision-making, needs to be continuously improved. To improve the 
efficiency of the staging system, the proteomic data from Chinese ESCC patients 
was combined with preoperative radiomic data and pTNM data to establish the 
multiomic RadpTNM and ProtRadpTNM models and compare them with the traditional 
pTNM staging system. The results suggest that both the RadpTNM and ProtRadpTNM 
models are significantly better than the traditional pTNM staging system. Future 
prospective multicentered cohort studies in Asian and Caucasian patients with 
ESCC are warranted to evaluate the efficiency of the multiomic models."
74,"BACKGROUND: Surveillance imaging of patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma 
(RP-LPS) after surgical resection is based on a projected risk of locoregional 
and distant recurrence. The duration of surveillance is not well defined because 
the natural history of RP-LPS after treatment is poorly understood. This study 
evaluated the long-term risk of recurrence and disease-specific survival (DSS) 
for a cohort of patients with at least 10 years of progression-free survival 
(10yr-PFS) from their primary resection.
METHODS: The prospective University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Sarcoma 
Database identified RP-LPS patients with 10yr-PFS after initial resection. The 
patients in the 10yr-PFS cohort were subsequently evaluated for recurrence and 
DSS. The time intervals start at date of initial surgical resection. Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to determine factors associated with 
recurrence and DSS.
RESULTS: From 1972 to 2010, 76 patients with RP-LPS had at least 10 years of 
follow-up evaluation. Of these 76 patients, 39 (51%) demonstrated 10yr-PFS. The 
median follow-up period was 15 years (range 10-33 years). Among the 10yr-PFS 
patients, 49% (19/39) experienced a recurrence at least 10 years after surgery. 
Of those who experienced recurrence, 42% (8/19) died of disease. Neither 
long-term recurrence nor DSS were significantly associated with age, sex, tumor 
size, LPS subtype, surgical margin, or perioperative treatment with radiation or 
chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Patients who have primary RP-LPS treated with surgical resection ± 
multimodality therapy face a long-term risk of recurrence and disease-specific 
death unacknowledged by current surveillance imaging guidelines. Among the 
patients with 10yr-PFS, 49% experienced a recurrence, and 42% of those died of 
disease. These findings suggest a need for lifelong surveillance imaging for 
patients with RP-LPS."
75,"BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) of low-risk T1a papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC) is generally accepted as an alternative to immediate surgery. The cut-off 
in the size criterion for AS has recently been extended in select individuals, 
especially older patients. We evaluated the clinicopathological differences of 
T1b PTC according to age to investigate the possibility of AS in older patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a cohort study of 1269 patients undergoing lobectomy 
for PTC, 1223 PTC patients with T1 stage disease (tumor ≤ 2 cm) were enrolled. 
The clinicopathological characteristics between T1a and T1b patients according 
to age were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the 1223 T1 cases, 918 (75.1%) were T1a (≤ 1 cm) and 305 (34.9%) 
T1b (> 1 and ≤ 2 cm). T1b PTC was associated with male sex, minimal 
extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, occult central lymph node 
(LN) metastasis, and a higher number of metastatic LNs than T1a. However, in 
patients over 55 years of age, the clinicopathological features of the patients 
with T1a and T1b PTC were not significantly different except for minimal 
extrathyroidal extension, although many clinicopathological differences were 
observed in patients under 55 years of age.
CONCLUSION: The clinicopathological features of patients with T1b PTC over 55 
years of age are similar to those with T1a PTC and less aggressive than those 
with T1b PTC under 55 years of age. These findings suggest that AS may be 
possible in patients with T1b PTC over 55 years of age without high-risk 
features on preoperative examinations."
76,"Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to poor sexual health outcomes such as 
sexually transmitted diseases, sexually transmitted infections, human 
immunodeficiency virus, and unintended pregnancy. While school-based sexual 
health education (SBSHE) can address adolescents' needs, they are often 
insufficient. Hence, their perception of SBSHE should be explored to improve 
current education. This review aims to consolidate the available evidence on 
perceptions, experiences, and needs of adolescents about SBSHE. Six electronic 
databases were searched from their inception date till June 2022. The included 
studies were assessed using the method of the Critical Appraisal Skills Program 
tool, and findings were meta-synthesized using Sandelowski and Barroso (2007). 
This review was registered via the International Prospective Register of 
Systematic Reviews. Overall, 51 studies were included, and three themes were 
identified: (1) teachings of SBSHE and its impact, (2) adolescents' preferred 
approach to SBSHE, and (3) importance of engaging and safe SBSHE. In conclusion, 
adolescents had mixed reactions toward SBSHE. They expressed the need for 
inclusivity (gender identity and racial, ethnic, and cultural groups). Having a 
""safe space,"" well-trained educators, and interactive approaches were important 
and hence should also be considered. More qualitative studies from different 
geographical regions are needed. Diverse topics (e.g., mutual consent, sexual 
abuse, and violence) should also be discussed. The use of multiple educators 
(e.g., schoolteachers, specialist teachers, and peers) should also be 
deliberated in future SBSHE research. Findings from this review should be 
triangulated by evaluating the perceptions of various stakeholders (e.g., 
educators, adolescents, and SBSHE administrators)."
77,"Vietnam has high rates of antibiotic use and resistance. Measuring resistance in 
commensal bacteria could provide an objective indicator for evaluating the 
impact of interventions to reduce antibiotic use and resistance. This study 
aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and bacterial recovery for 
different sampling strategies. We conducted a cross-sectional mixed methods 
study in a rural community in Ha Nam Province, northern Vietnam, and collected 
structured interviews, samples, and in-depth interviews from households. Out of 
389 households invited, 324 participated (83%), representing 1502 individuals. 
Samples were collected from these individuals (1498 stool, 1002 
self-administered nasal swabs, and 496 HW-administered nasopharyngeal swabs). 
Pneumococci were recovered from 11.1% (128/1149) of the total population and 
26.2% (48/183) of those under 5-years. Recovery was higher for health-worker 
(HW)-administered swabs (13.7%, 48/350) than self-administered swabs (10.0%, 
80/799) (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.07-3.96). Cost per swab was cheaper for 
self-administered ($7.26) than HW-administered ($8.63) swabs, but the 
overall cost for 100 positive samples was higher ($7260 and $6300 
respectively).﻿ Qualitative interviews revealed that HW-administered 
nasopharyngeal swabs took longer to collect, caused more discomfort, and were 
more difficult to take from children. Factors affecting participation included 
sense of contribution, perceived trade-offs between benefits and effort, and 
peer influence. Reluctance was related to stool sampling and negative 
perceptions of research. This study provides important evidence for planning 
community-based carriage studies, including cost, logistics, and acceptability. 
Self-administered swabs had lower recovery, and though cheaper and quicker, this 
would translate to higher costs for large population-based studies. Recovery 
might be improved by swab-type, transport medium, and better cold-chain to lab."
78,"BACKGROUND: The purpose was to determine the predictability of tooth movements 
through clear aligner among premolar extraction patients and to explore the 
effects of various factors on tooth movements.
METHODS: A total of 31 extraction patients (10 males and 20 females; age 14-44) 
receiving clear aligner treatment (Invisalign) were enrolled in this study. The 
actual post-treatment models and pre-treatment models were superimposed using 
the palatal area as a reference and registered with virtual post-treatment 
models. A paired t test was used to compare the differences between actual and 
designed tooth movements of maxillary first molars, canines, and central 
incisors. A multivariate linear mixed model was performed to examine the 
influence of variables on actual tooth movements.
RESULTS: Compared to the designed tooth movements, the following undesirable 
tooth movements occurred: mesial movement (2.2 mm), mesial tipping (5.4°), and 
intrusion (0.45 mm) of first molars; distal tipping (11.0°), lingual tipping 
(4.4°), and distal rotation of canines (4.9°); lingual tipping (10.6°) and 
extrusion (1.5 mm) of incisors. Age, crowding, mini-implant, overbite, and 
attachments have differential effects on actual tooth movements. Moreover, 
vertical rectangular attachments on canines are beneficial in achieving more 
predictable canine and incisor tooth movements over optimized attachments. 
Lingual tipping and extrusion of incisors were significantly influenced by the 
interaction effects between incisor power ridge and different canine attachments 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Incisors, canines, and first molars are subject to unwanted 
tooth movements with clear aligners among premolar extraction patients. Age, 
crowding, mini-implant, overbite, and attachments influence actual tooth 
movements. Moreover, vertical rectangular attachments on canines are beneficial 
in achieving more predictable incisor tooth movements over optimized canine 
attachments."
79,"Issues around turning can impair daily tasks and trigger episodes of freezing of 
gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Slow speeds associated with 
aging produce a more en-bloc movement strategy which have been linked with falls 
while turning. However, the influence of speed of turning on the complex 
whole-body coordination considering eye movements, turning kinematics, and 
stepping characteristics during turning has not been examined. The aim of this 
study was to investigate if individuals with PD have a different response to 
changes in turning speed compared to healthy older adults during 180° standing 
turns. 20 individuals with PD and 20 healthy age matched adults participated in 
this study. Data were collected during clockwise and counter-clockwise turns 
at three self-selected speeds in a randomised order: (a) normal; (b) faster than 
normal; and (c) slower than normal. Eye movement and turning kinematics were 
investigated using electrooculography and Inertial Measurement Units. Mixed 
Model Analysis of Variance (MM ANOVA) tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons 
were performed to assess the differences between groups and turning speed. In 
addition, further post hoc Repeated Measures ANOVA (RM ANOVA) tests were 
performed if any significant interactions were seen between groups and turning 
speed. Significant interaction effects were found in eye movement and turning 
kinematics, and the RM ANOVA showed significant main effects for turning speeds 
within the PD and the control groups. Turning slowly resulted in similar 
alterations in eye movement, turning kinematics and stepping characteristics in 
the PD group and the healthy controls. However, individuals with PD showed a 
different response to the healthy controls, with a greater delay in eye movement 
and onset latency of segments in turning kinematics and step variables between 
the different speeds. These findings help our understanding regarding the 
turning strategies in individuals with PD. The incorporation of guidance with 
regard to faster turning speeds may be useful in the management of individuals 
with PD. Clinical training using different turn directions and speeds may 
improve coordination, increase confidence and reduce the risk of falling."
80,"Decellularized extracellular matrix in the form of patches and locally injected 
hydrogels has long been used as therapies in animal models of disease. Here we 
report the safety and feasibility of an intravascularly infused extracellular 
matrix as a biomaterial for the repair of tissue in animal models of acute 
myocardial infarction, traumatic brain injury and pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. The biomaterial consists of decellularized, enzymatically digested 
and fractionated ventricular myocardium, localizes to injured tissues by binding 
to leaky microvasculature, and is largely degraded in about 3 d. In rats and 
pigs with induced acute myocardial infarction followed by intracoronary infusion 
of the biomaterial, we observed substantially reduced left ventricular volumes 
and improved wall-motion scores, as well as differential expression of genes 
associated with tissue repair and inflammation. Delivering pro-healing 
extracellular matrix by intravascular infusion post injury may provide 
translational advantages for the healing of inflamed tissues 'from the inside 
out'."
81,"The RON receptor tyrosine kinase is an exceptionally interesting target in 
oncology and immunology. It is not only overexpressed in a wide variety of 
tumors but also has been shown to be expressed on myeloid cells associated with 
tumor infiltration, where it serves to dampen tumour immune responses and reduce 
the efficacy of anti-CTLA4 therapy. Potent and selective inhibitory antibodies 
to RON might therefore both inhibit tumor cell growth and stimulate immune 
rejection of tumors. We derived cloned and sequenced a new panel of 
exceptionally avid anti-RON antibodies with picomolar binding affinities that 
inhibit MSP-induced RON signaling and show remarkable potency in antibody 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Antibody specificity was validated by cloning 
the antibody genes and creating recombinant antibodies and by the use of RON 
knock out cell lines. When radiolabeled with 89-Zirconium, the new antibodies 
3F8 and 10G1 allow effective immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) 
imaging of RON-expressing tumors and recognize universally exposed RON epitopes 
at the cell surface. The 10G1 was further developed into a novel bispecific T 
cell engager with a 15 pM EC50 in cytotoxic T cell killing assays."
82,"BACKGROUND: Save for the contribution of Charles McBurney, who described his 
eponymous point and the appendicectomy incision, the history of appendicectomy 
is largely unknown among the medical profession. This review traces the history 
from the first anatomical depiction of the appendix to the development of open 
appendicectomy and the recent minimally invasive and non-operative methods.
METHODS: Historical articles, monographs and books containing anatomical 
descriptions of the vermiform appendix and reports of appendicitis and its 
surgical treatment were retrieved after searching the PubMed, Google Scholar and 
Embase databases from their inception to 31 March 2022.
RESULTS: The first inadvertent appendicectomy was performed during an operation 
for a groin hernia by Cookesley in 1731, and Mestivier was the first to drain a 
right iliac fossa abscess, due to appendicitis, in 1757. Krönlein performed the 
first appendicectomy for acute appendicitis in 1884 but his patient died. The 
first successful appendicectomy for acute appendicitis leading to patient 
survival was by Morton in 1887. In 1976, Wirschafter and Kaufman performed an 
inadvertent colonoscopic appendicectomy and, in 1980, Semm carried out the first 
laparoscopic appendicectomy. The first appendicectomy via a natural orifice 
(transgastric) appendicectomy was by Rao and Reddy in 2004.
CONCLUSION: This historical review charts the development of surgical knowledge 
concerning the management of appendicitis, from the first anatomical drawings of 
the appendix and descriptions of appendicitis to the development of surgical and 
conservative treatments up to the present day. It also corrects some 
inaccuracies of attribution in previous historical reviews."
83,"Prion diseases are characterized by the cellular prion protein, PrPC, misfolding 
and aggregating into the infectious prion protein, PrPSc, which leads to 
neurodegeneration and death. An early sign of disease is inflammation in the 
brain and the shift of resting glial cells to reactive astrocytes and activated 
microglia. Few therapeutics target this stage of disease. Mesenchymal stromal 
cells produce anti-inflammatory molecules when exposed to inflammatory signals 
and damaged tissue. Here, we show that adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells 
(AdMSCs) migrate toward prion-infected brain homogenate and produce the 
anti-inflammatory molecules transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and tumor 
necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6). In an in vitro model of prion 
exposure of both primary mixed glia and BV2 microglial cell line, co-culturing 
with AdMSCs led to a significant decrease in inflammatory cytokine mRNA and 
markers of reactive astrocytes and activated microglia. This protection against 
in vitro prion-associated inflammatory responses is independent of PrPSc 
replication. These data support a role for AdMSCs as a beneficial therapeutic 
for decreasing the early onset of glial inflammation and reprogramming glial 
cells to a protective phenotype."
84,"The pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully elucidated. 
COVID-19 is due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
which causes severe illness and death in some people by causing immune 
dysregulation and blood T cell depletion. Increased numbers of myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a diverse role in the pathogenesis of many 
infections and cancers but their function in COVID-19 remains unclear. To 
evaluate the function of MDSCs in relation with the severity of COVID-19. 26 
PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients including 12 moderate and 14 severe patients 
along with 11 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. 10 ml whole 
blood was harvested for cell isolation, immunophenotyping and stimulation. The 
immunophenotype of MDSCs by flow cytometry and T cells proliferation in the 
presence of MDSCs was evaluated. Serum TGF-β was assessed by ELISA. High 
percentages of M-MDSCs in males and of P-MDSCs in female patients were found in 
severe and moderate affected patients. Isolated MDSCs of COVID-19 patients 
suppressed the proliferation and intracellular levels of IFN-γ in T cells 
despite significant suppression of T regulatory cells but up-regulation of 
precursor regulatory T cells. Serum analysis shows increased levels of TGF-β in 
severe patients compared to moderate and control subjects (HC) (P = 0.003, 
P < 0.0001, respectively). The frequency of MDSCs in blood shows higher 
frequency among both moderate and severe patients and may be considered as a 
predictive factor for disease severity. MDSCs may suppress T cell proliferation 
by releasing TGF-β."
85,"Fibrosis is an important pathological mechanism in heart failure (HF) and is 
associated with poor prognosis. We analyzed fibrosis in HF patients using 
transcriptomic data. Genes differentially expressed between normal control and 
congestive HF (CHF) dogs included P3H1, P3H2, P3H4, P4HA2, PLOD1 and PLOD3, 
which belong to the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2OGD) superfamily 
that stabilizes collagen during fibrosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
analysis demonstrated 2OGD gene expression was increased in CHF samples compared 
with normal left ventricle (LV) samples. 2OGD gene expression was repressed in 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-treated samples. These genes, activated 
the hydroxylation of proline or lysin residues of procollagen mediated by 
2-oxoglutaric acid and O2, produce succinic acid and CO2. Metabolic analysis 
demonstrated the concentration of succinic acid was significantly increased in 
CHF samples compared with normal LV samples. Fibrosis was induced in human 
cardiac fibroblasts by TGF-ß1 treatment. After treatment, the gene and protein 
expressions of 2OGD, the concentration of succinic acid, and the oxygen 
consumption rate were increased compared with no treatment. This is the first 
study to show that collagen-related 2OGD genes contribute to HF during the 
induction of fibrosis and might be potential therapeutic targets for fibrosis 
and HF."
86,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a major cause of severe lower 
respiratory tract disease in infants and the elderly, yet no safe, effective 
vaccine is commercially available. Closely related bovine RSV (BRSV) causes 
respiratory disease in young calves, with many similar features to those seen in 
HRSV. We previously showed that a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-vectored vaccine 
expressing the F glycoprotein of HRSV reduced viral loads in lungs of mice and 
cotton rats and protected from HRSV. However, clinical signs and pathogenesis of 
disease in laboratory animals following HRSV infection differs from that 
observed in human infants. Thus, we examined whether a similar vaccine would 
protect neonatal calves from BRSV infection. Codon-optimized rNDV vaccine 
(rNDV-BRSV Fopt) was constructed and administered to colostrum-deprived calves. 
The rNDV-BRSV Fopt vaccine was well-tolerated and there was no evidence of 
vaccine-enhanced disease in the upper airways or lungs of these calves compared 
to the non-vaccinated calves. We found two intranasal doses reduces severity of 
gross and microscopic lesions and decreases viral load in the lungs. 
Furthermore, serum neutralizing antibodies were generated in vaccinated calves. 
Finally, reduced lung CXC chemokine levels were observed in vaccinated calves 
after BRSV challenge. In summary, we have shown that rNDV-BRSV Fopt vaccine is 
safe in colostrum-deprived calves, and is effective in reducing lung lesions, 
and decreasing viral load in upper respiratory tract and lungs after challenge."
87,"Early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) is very important in clinical 
diagnosis for preventing disease development. In this study, we present 
efficient discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based methods for detecting PD from 
health control (HC) in two cases, namely, off-and on-medication. First, the EEG 
signals are preprocessed to remove major artifacts before being decomposed into 
several EEG sub-bands (approximate and details) using DWT. The features are then 
extracted from the wavelet packet-derived reconstructed signals using different 
entropy measures, namely, log energy entropy, Shannon entropy, threshold 
entropy, sure entropy, and norm entropy. Several machine learning techniques are 
investigated to classify the resulting PD/HC features. The effects of DWT 
coefficients and brain regions on classification accuracy are being investigated 
as well. Two public datasets are used to verify the proposed methods: the 
SanDiego dataset (31 subjects, 93 min) and the UNM dataset (54 subjects, 
54 min). The results are promising and show that four entropy measures: log 
energy entropy, threshold entropy, sure entropy, and modified-Shannon entropy 
(TShEn) lead to high classification accuracy, indicating they are good 
biomarkers for PD detection. With the SanDiego dataset, the classification 
results of off-medication PD versus HC are 99.89, 99.87, and 99.91 for accuracy, 
sensitivity, and specificity, respectively, using the combination of DWT + TShEn 
and KNN classifier. Using the same combination, the results of on-medication PD 
versus HC are 94.21, 93.33, and 95%. With the UNM dataset, the obtained 
classification accuracy is around 99.5% in both cases of off-and on-medication 
PD using DWT + TShEn + SVM and DWT + ThEn + KNN, respectively. The results also 
demonstrate the importance of all DWT coefficients and that selecting a suitable 
small number of EEG channels from several brain regions could improve the 
classification accuracy."
88,"We have measured the changes in the production of volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) by the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, when treated in vitro with 
the antibiotic amoxicillin. We have also measured the VOC production of P. 
gingivalis grown in the presence and absence of supplemental hemin. Planktonic 
bacterial cultures were treated with different amounts of amoxicillin in the lag 
phase of the bacterial growth. Planktonic bacteria were also cultured with and 
without supplemental hemin in the culture medium. Concentrations of VOCs were 
measured with proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(PTR-ToF-MS) and further molecular identification was done with gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using solid phase microextraction 
(SPME) for sampling. The cell growth of P. gingivalis in the cultures was 
estimated with optical density measurements at the wavelength of 600 nm (OD600). 
We found that the production of methanethiol, hydrogen sulfide and several 
short- to medium-chain fatty acids was decreased with antibiotic treatment using 
amoxicillin. Compounds found to increase with the antibiotic treatment were 
butyric acid and indole. In cultures without supplemental hemin, indole and 
short- to medium-chain fatty acid production was significantly reduced. Acetic 
acid production was found to increase when supplemental hemin was not available. 
Our results suggest that the metabolic effects of both antibiotic treatment and 
supplemental hemin availability are reflected in the VOCs produced by P. 
gingivalis and could be used as markers for bacterial cell growth and response 
to threat. Analysis of these volatiles from human samples, such as the exhaled 
breath, could be used in the future to rapidly monitor response to antibacterial 
treatment."
89,"MR1-restricted T (MR1T) cells recognize microbial small molecule metabolites 
presented on the MHC Class I-like molecule MR1 and have been implicated in early 
effector responses to microbial infection. As a result, there is considerable 
interest in identifying chemical properties of metabolite ligands that permit 
recognition by MR1T cells, for consideration in therapeutic or vaccine 
applications. Here, we made chemical modifications to known MR1 ligands to 
evaluate the effect on MR1T cell activation. Specifically, we modified 
6,7-dimethyl-8-D-ribityllumazine (DMRL) to generate 
6,7-dimethyl-8-D-ribityldeazalumazine (DZ), and then further derivatized DZ to 
determine the requirements for retaining MR1 surface stabilization and agonistic 
properties. Interestingly, the IFN-γ response toward DZ varied widely across a 
panel of T cell receptor (TCR)-diverse MR1T cell clones; while one clone was 
agnostic toward the modification, most displayed either an enhancement or 
depletion of IFN-γ production when compared with its response to DMRL. To gain 
insight into a putative mechanism behind this phenomenon, we used in silico 
molecular docking techniques for DMRL and its derivatives and performed 
molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes. In assessing the dynamics of 
each ligand in the MR1 pocket, we found that DMRL and DZ exhibit differential 
dynamics of both the ribityl moiety and the aromatic backbone, which may 
contribute to ligand recognition. Together, our results support an emerging 
hypothesis for flexibility in MR1:ligand-MR1T TCR interactions and enable 
further exploration of the relationship between MR1:ligand structures and MR1T 
cell recognition for downstream applications targeting MR1T cells."
90,"Ferroptosis is a new iron-dependent form of programmed cell death characterized 
by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. In recent years, ferroptosis has 
garnered enormous interest in disease treatment research communities in pursuit 
to reveal the mechanism and key targets of ferroptosis because ferroptosis is 
closely related to the pathophysiological processes of many diseases. Recent 
studies have shown some key targets, such as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and 
System Xc-, and several inducers and inhibitors have been developed to regulate 
these key targets. With the emergence of new ferroptosis targets, studies on 
inducers and inhibitors have made new developments. The selection and use of 
inducers and inhibitors are very important for related work. This paper briefly 
introduces important regulatory targets in the ferroptosis metabolic pathway, 
lists and categorizes commonly used and recently developed inducers and 
inhibitors, and discusses their medical application. The paper ends of with 
potential future research direction for ferroptosis."
91,"Pneumoconiosis is the most common and serious disease among coal miners. In 
earlier work on this subject, we documented that coal dust (CD) nanoparticles 
(CD-NPs) induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF) more profoundly than did CD micron 
particles (CD-MPs), but the mechanism has not been thoroughly studied. Based on 
the GEO database, jveen, STRING, and Cytoscape tools were used to screen hub 
genes regulating PF. Particle size distribution of CD were analyzed with Malvern 
nanoparticle size potentiometer. Combining 8 computational methods, we found 
that IGF1, POSTN, MMP7, ASPN, and CXCL14 may act as hub genes regulating PF. 
Based on the high score of IGF1 and its important regulatory role in various 
tissue fibrosis, we selected it as the target gene in this study. Activation of 
the IGF1/IGF1R axis promoted CD-NPs-induced PF, and inhibition of the axis 
activation had the opposite effect in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, activation 
of the IGF1/IGF1R axis induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to 
promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar epithelial cells 
(AECs) to accelerate PF. High-throughput gene sequencing based on lung tissue 
suggested that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and the NF-kB signaling 
pathway play a key role in PF. Also, ROS induced inflammation and EMT by the 
activation of the NF-kB/NLRP3 axis to accelerate PF. ROS can induce the 
activation of AKT/GSK3β signaling, and inhibition of it can inhibit ROS-induced 
inflammation and EMT by the NF-kB/NLRP3 axis, thereby inhibiting PF. CD-NPs 
induced PF by promoting inflammation and EMT via the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway driven 
by IGF1/ROS-mediated AKT/GSK3β signals. This study provides a valuable 
experimental basis for the prevention and treatment of coal workers' 
pneumoconiosis. Illustration of the overall research idea of this study: IGF1 
stimulates coal dust nanoparticles induced pulmonary fibrosis by promoting 
inflammation and EMT via the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway driven by ROS-mediated 
AKT/GSK3β signals."
92,"Latin America is the world's most urbanized region and its heterogeneous urban 
development may impact chronic diseases. Here, we evaluated the association of 
built environment characteristics at the sub-city -intersection density, 
greenness, and population density- and city-level -fragmentation and isolation- 
with body mass index (BMI), obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Data from 93,280 
(BMI and obesity) and 122,211 individuals (T2D) was analysed across 10 
countries. Living in areas with higher intersection density was positively 
associated with BMI and obesity, whereas living in more fragmented and greener 
areas were negatively associated. T2D was positively associated with 
intersection density, but negatively associated with greenness and population 
density. The rapid urban expansion experienced by Latin America provides unique 
insights and vastly expand opportunities for population-wide urban interventions 
aimed at reducing obesity and T2D burden."
93,"Pretomanid is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial active against drug-resistant 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and approved in combination with bedaquiline and 
linezolid (BPaL) to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). 
However, the penetration of these antibiotics into the central nervous system 
(CNS), and the efficacy of the BPaL regimen for TB meningitis, are not well 
established. Importantly, there is a lack of efficacious treatments for TB 
meningitis due to MDR strains, resulting in high mortality. We have developed 
new methods to synthesize 18F-pretomanid (chemically identical to the 
antibiotic) and performed cross-species positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging to noninvasively measure pretomanid concentration-time profiles. Dynamic 
PET in mouse and rabbit models of TB meningitis demonstrates excellent CNS 
penetration of pretomanid but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels does not 
correlate with those in the brain parenchyma. The bactericidal activity of the 
BPaL regimen in the mouse model of TB meningitis is substantially inferior to 
the standard TB regimen, likely due to restricted penetration of bedaquiline and 
linezolid into the brain parenchyma. Finally, first-in-human dynamic 
18F-pretomanid PET in six healthy volunteers demonstrates excellent CNS 
penetration of pretomanid, with significantly higher levels in the brain 
parenchyma than in CSF. These data have important implications for developing 
new antibiotic treatments for TB meningitis."
94,"Diabetic macular edema (DME), a complication of diabetes mellitus, is a leading 
cause of adult-onset blindness worldwide. Recently, intravitreal anti-VEGF 
injection has been used as a first-line treatment. This study analyzed the 
association between the genetic profile of patients with DME and their response 
to treatment. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections were administered monthly for 
three months to Korean patients diagnosed with DME, who were classified into two 
groups depending on whether they responded to anti-VEGF therapy or showed 
recurrence within six months. Peripheral blood samples were used for genetic 
analyses. Genome-wide association analysis results sowed that the genes DIRC3 on 
chromosome 2 (rs16857280, p = 1.2 × 10-6), SLCO3A1 on chromosome 15 (rs12899055, 
p = 2.5 × 10-6), and RAB2A on chromosome 8 (rs2272620, p = 4.6 × 10-6) were 
associated with treatment response to intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. SLC35F1, 
TMEM132D, KIAA0368, HPCAL1, IGF2BP3, SPN2S, COL23A1, and CREB5 were also related 
to treatment response (p < 5.0 × 10-5). Using the KEGG pathway analysis, RAB2A 
and CREB5 were found to be associated with AMPK signaling related to VEGF 
(p = 0.018). The identified genetic biomarkers can elucidate the factors 
affecting patient response to intravitreal anti-VEGF injection and help select 
appropriate therapeutic strategy."
95,"Lysosomes are single-membraned organelles that mediate the intracellular 
degradation of macromolecules. Various stress can induce lysosomal membrane 
permeabilization (LMP), translocating intralysosomal components, such as 
cathepsins, to the cytoplasm, which induces lysosomal-dependent cell death 
(LDCD). This study reports that p53 regulates LMP in response to DNA-damaging 
drugs. Treating wild-type TP53 A549 cells with DNA-damaging drugs (namely, 
doxorubicin, carboplatin, and etoposide) induced LMP and accelerated cell death 
more rapidly than treating TP53-knockout (KO) A549 cells. This suggested 
p53-dependent LMP and LDCD induction in response to DNA damage. LMP was induced 
by p53-dependent BID upregulation and activation, followed by translocation of 
truncated BID to lysosomes. Simultaneously, autophagy for damaged lysosome 
elimination (lysophagy) was activated via the p53-mTOR-TEFB/TFE3 pathways in 
response to DNA damage. These data suggested the dichotomous nature of p53 for 
LMP regulation; LMP induction and repression via the p53-BID axis and 
p53-mTOR-TFEB/TFE3 pathway, respectively. Blocking autophagy with 
hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin as well as ATG5 KO enhanced LMP and LDCD 
induction after exposure to DNA-damaging drugs. Furthermore, lysosomal membrane 
stabilization using U18666A, a cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick disease C1 
(NPC1) inhibitor, suppressed LMP as well as LDCD in wild-type TP53, but not in 
TP53-KO, A549 cells. Thus, LMP is finely regulated by TP53 after exposure to 
DNA-damaging drugs."
96,"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged showing higher transmissibility and 
possibly higher resistance to current COVID-19 vaccines than other variants 
dominating the global pandemic. In March 2020 we performed a study in clinical 
samples, where we found that a portion of genomes in the SARS-CoV-2 viral 
population accumulated deletions immediately before the S1/S2 cleavage site 
(furin-like cleavage site, PRRAR/S) of the spike gene, generating a frameshift 
and appearance of a premature stop codon. The main aim of this study was to 
determine the frequency of defective deletions in prevalent variants from the 
first to sixth pandemic waves in our setting and discuss whether the differences 
observed might support epidemiological proposals. The complete SARS-CoV-2 spike 
gene was deeply studied by next-generation sequencing using the MiSeq platform. 
More than 90 million reads were obtained from respiratory swab specimens of 78 
COVID-19 patients with mild infection caused by the predominant variants 
circulating in the Barcelona city area during the six pandemic waves: B.1.5, 
B.1.1, B.1.177, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. The frequency of defective 
genomes found in variants dominating the first and second waves was similar to 
that seen in Omicron, but differed from the frequencies seen in the Alpha, Beta 
and Delta variants. The changing pattern of mutations seen in the various 
SARS-CoV-2 variants driving the pandemic waves over time can affect viral 
transmission and immune escape. Here we discuss the putative biological effects 
of defective deletions naturally occurring before the S1/S2 cleavage site during 
adaption of the virus to human infection."
97,"Freezing of gait (FOG) greatly impacts the daily life of patients with 
Parkinson's disease (PD). However, predictors of FOG in early PD are limited. 
Moreover, recent neuroimaging evidence of cerebral morphological alterations in 
PD is heterogeneous. We aimed to develop a model that could predict the 
occurrence of FOG using machine learning, collaborating with clinical, 
laboratory, and cerebral structural imaging information of early drug-naïve PD 
and investigate alterations in cerebral morphology in early PD. Data from 73 
healthy controls (HCs) and 158 early drug-naïve PD patients at baseline were 
obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. The CIVET 
pipeline was used to generate structural morphological features with T1-weighted 
imaging (T1WI). Five machine learning algorithms were calculated to assess the 
predictive performance of future FOG in early PD during a 5-year follow-up 
period. We found that models trained with structural morphological features 
showed fair to good performance (accuracy range, 0.67-0.73). Performance 
improved when clinical and laboratory data was added (accuracy range, 
0.71-0.78). For machine learning algorithms, elastic net-support vector machine 
models (accuracy range, 0.69-0.78) performed the best. The main features used to 
predict FOG based on elastic net-support vector machine models were the 
structural morphological features that were mainly distributed in the left 
cerebrum. Moreover, the bilateral olfactory cortex (OLF) showed a significantly 
higher surface area in PD patients than in HCs. Overall, we found that T1WI 
morphometric markers helped predict future FOG occurrence in patients with early 
drug-naïve PD at the individual level. The OLF exhibits predominantly cortical 
expansion in early PD."
98,"Sirtuins (SIRTs) are nicotine adenine dinucleotide(+)-dependent histone 
deacetylases regulating critical signaling pathways in prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes, and are involved in numerous biological processes. Currently, seven 
mammalian homologs of yeast Sir2 named SIRT1 to SIRT7 have been identified. 
Increasing evidence has suggested the vital roles of seven members of the SIRT 
family in health and disease conditions. Notably, this protein family plays a 
variety of important roles in cellular biology such as inflammation, metabolism, 
oxidative stress, and apoptosis, etc., thus, it is considered a potential 
therapeutic target for different kinds of pathologies including cancer, 
cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other conditions. Moreover, 
identification of SIRT modulators and exploring the functions of these different 
modulators have prompted increased efforts to discover new small molecules, 
which can modify SIRT activity. Furthermore, several randomized controlled 
trials have indicated that different interventions might affect the expression 
of SIRT protein in human samples, and supplementation of SIRT modulators might 
have diverse impact on physiological function in different participants. In this 
review, we introduce the history and structure of the SIRT protein family, 
discuss the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of seven members of 
the SIRT protein family, elaborate on the regulatory roles of SIRTs in human 
disease, summarize SIRT inhibitors and activators, and review related clinical 
studies."
99,"Elevated body mass index (BMI) is heritable and associated with many health 
conditions that impact morbidity and mortality. The study of the genetic 
association of BMI across a broad range of common disease conditions offers the 
opportunity to extend current knowledge regarding the breadth and depth of 
adiposity-related diseases. We identify 906 (364 novel) and 41 (6 novel) 
genome-wide significant loci for BMI among participants of European (N~1.1 
million) and African (N~100,000) ancestry, respectively. Using a BMI genetic 
risk score including 2446 variants, 316 diagnoses are associated in the Million 
Veteran Program, with 96.5% showing increased risk. A co-morbidity network 
analysis reveals seven disease communities containing multiple interconnected 
diseases associated with BMI as well as extensive connections across 
communities. Mendelian randomization analysis confirms numerous phenotypes 
across a breadth of organ systems, including conditions of the circulatory 
(heart failure, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation), genitourinary 
(chronic renal failure), respiratory (respiratory failure, asthma), 
musculoskeletal and dermatologic systems that are deeply interconnected within 
and across the disease communities. This work shows that the complex genetic 
architecture of BMI associates with a broad range of major health conditions, 
supporting the need for comprehensive approaches to prevent and treat obesity."
100,"Verticillium species are known as plant pathogens responsible for wilt diseases 
in a large variety of dicotyledon plants and crops in many parts of the world. 
Here we present the draft genome sequence of Verticillium dahliae Kleb. (strain 
VdGL16) isolated in Italy from the invasive alien species Ailanthus altissima 
(Mill.; commonly known as tree-of-heaven) showing Verticillium wilt symptoms. 
The comparison between the newly sequenced genome with those publicly available 
revealed candidate genes putatively involved in pathogenicity. The genome 
represents a new useful source for future research on Verticillium genetics and 
biology as well as research on novel approaches in the control of A. altissima."
101,"Regulation of neuronal metabolism during early brain development is crucial for 
directing synaptic plasticity and proper circuit formation. Alterations in 
neuronal glycolysis or mitochondrial function are associated with several 
neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Recently, loss-of-function 
mutations in SETD1A, a histone methyltransferase, have been linked to increased 
schizophrenia risk and global developmental delay. Here, we show that 
heterozygous disruption of SETD1A in human induced pluripotent stem cell 
(hiPSC)-derived neurons results in reduced neurite outgrowth and spontaneous 
activity, two phenotypes commonly associated with schizophrenia, as well as 
alterations in metabolic capacity. Furthermore, supplementing culture media with 
metabolic intermediates ameliorated changes in neurite outgrowth and spontaneous 
activity, suggesting that metabolic dysfunction contributes to neuronal 
phenotypes caused by SETD1A haploinsufficiency. These findings highlight a 
previously unknown connection between SETD1A function, metabolic regulation, and 
neuron development, and identifies alternative avenues for therapeutic 
development."
102,"Quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides have been widely used to manage 
diseases of soybean including target spot caused by Corynespora cassiicola. 
However, resistance to QoI fungicides has recently been reported within the C. 
cassiicola population from Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee as a 
result of isolates in the population containing the G143A amino acid 
substitution. Therefore, the relative fitness and stability of isolates 
containing the G143A substitution compared to wild-type C. cassiicola isolates 
from Mississippi soybean were investigated by analyzing several fitness 
parameters in vitro. In addition, in vivo virulence assays were conducted in the 
greenhouse on a target spot-susceptible cultivar. The evaluations of fitness 
considered the difference between isolates from the wild-type and 
G143A-containing genotypes by evaluating colony growth parameters following the 
first and the tenth subcultures on microbiological media. When considered as an 
average of all G143A-containing isolates, the G143A-containing isolates 
following the tenth subculture produced 6.2% greater colony diameter growth but 
produced 2.3% less conidia. Conversely, over the same period, wild-type isolates 
produced 6.7% less colony growth but produced 10.9% more conidia. Based on our 
results, the C. cassiicola isolates that contained the G143A substitution appear 
stable since successive subculturing did not significantly affect the measured 
fitness parameters. The lack of fitness cost accompanying the genotypic shift to 
the G143A amino acid substitution which confers fungicide resistance in C. 
cassiicola indicates that these isolates may have fitness advantages and may 
remain stable in the population as well as displace wild-type isolates with 
repeated fungicide applications of QoI-containing products."
103,"Dracaena trifasciata (Prain) Mabb. is a popular houseplant in the United States. 
In September 2021, two diseased samples from two Ohio homeowners were received 
by the Ornamental Pathology Laboratory at The Ohio State University. Each sample 
included one or two detached leaves displaying circular gray water-soaked 
lesions scattered throughout the lamina and blighted areas with concentric rings 
bearing brown to black acervuli. Lesions covered between 25 and 50% of the leaf 
surface. Isolations were made by excising small portions of leaf tissue from the 
margin of the lesions, surface-disinfesting in 10% bleach for 45 s, rinsing in 
sterile water, and plating on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Plates were incubated 
at 23°C for one week. Two representative isolates, one per sample (FPH2021-5 and 
-6), were obtained by transferring hyphal tips to fresh PDA plates. Mycelia of 
both isolates were aerial, cottony, grayish-white, producing spores in a 
gelatinous orange matrix, and appeared gray to olivaceous-gray on the plate 
underside. Conidia produced by both isolates were cylindrical, single-celled, 
hyaline, measuring 12.02 to 18.11 (15.51) × 5.03 to 7.29 (6.14) μm (FPH2021-5; 
n=50) and 15.58 to 20.90 (18.39) × 5.63 to 8.27 (7.05) μm (FPH2021-6; n=50). 
Appressoria were globose to subglobose, single-celled, dark brown to sepia, 
measuring 6.62 to 13.98 (8.97) × 5.05 to 6.58 (6.58) μm (FPH2021-5; n=50), and 
6.54 to 11.32 (8.63) × 4.54 to 8.94 (7.09) μm (FPH2021-6; n=50). Genomic DNA 
(gDNA) samples were extracted from both isolates and the internal transcribed 
spacer (ITS) region was amplified using primers ITS1F/ITS4 (Gardes and Bruns, 
1993; White et al. 1990). GenBank BLAST sequence analysis resulted in 99.83% 
(FPH2021-5; GenBank Acc. No. OP410918.1) and 100% (FPH2021-6; OP410917.1) 
identity with 100% query coverage to the type strain of Colletotrichum 
sansevieriae Miho Nakam. & Ohzono MAFF239721 or Sa-1-2 (NR_152313.1; Nakamura et 
al. 2006). Whole genome sequencing was conducted for FPH2021-6 and the assembly 
was deposited in GenBank (JAOQIF000000000.1). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and β-tubulin (β-tub) regions were either extracted from 
the genome of FPH2021-6 (OP414603.1 and OP414601.1, respectively) or amplified 
from FPH2021-5 gDNA using primers GDF/GDR (OP414604.1) and Bt-2b/T1 
(OP414602.1), respectively (Templeton et al. 1992; Glass and Donaldson 1995; 
O'Donnell and Cigelnik 1997). A multilocus partitioned analysis (Chernomor et 
al. 2016) based on concatenated sequences of ITS, GAPDH, and β-tub using 
ModelFinder (Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017) was performed to build a maximum 
likelihood tree (IQ-TREE v2.0.3; Nguyen et al. 2015), suggesting that these two 
isolates are phylogenetically closer to the type strain from Japan than to a 
previously reported isolate 1047 from Florida (Palmateer et al. 2012). To 
fulfill Koch's postulates, two parallel leaf sections from one 10-inch D. 
trifasciata 'Laurentii' plant maintained in a 1.3-liter container were selected. 
Three wounds were made in each section using a sterile syringe needle. A 10-µl 
drop of either a 1×106 conidia/ml suspension of isolate FPH2021-6 or sterile 
water was placed on each wound. The plant was covered with a plastic bag for two 
days post-inoculation (DPI) and maintained in a greenhouse at 25°C with a 12- h 
photoperiod. The experiment was conducted twice. Grayish water-soaked lesions, 
acervuli, and leaf blight were observed on the inoculated sections 3, 10, and 14 
DPI, respectively, while no symptoms appeared on the sections treated with 
sterile water. C. sansevieriae was re-isolated from the lesions and confirmed to 
be identical to the original isolate based on ITS sequencing and morphological 
examinations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of C. 
sansevieriae on D. trifasciata in Ohio and the first genome draft of an isolate 
from the United States. Availability of whole-genome sequence data is paramount 
for resolving species identification in this highly diverse fungal genus, and a 
powerful tool to conduct comparative genomic analyses in the future."
104,"As the field of interventional pain management (IPM) grows, the risk of surgical 
site infections (SSIs) is increasing. SSI is defined as an infection of the 
incision or organ/space that occurs within one month after operation or three 
months after implantation. It is also common to find patients with suspected 
infection in an outpatient clinic. The most frequent IPM procedures are 
performed in the spine. Even though primary pyogenic spondylodiscitis via 
hematogenous spread is the most common type among spinal infections, secondary 
spinal infections from direct inoculation should be monitored after IPM 
procedures. Various preventive guidelines for SSI have been published. 
Cefazolin, followed by vancomycin, is the most commonly used surgical antibiotic 
prophylaxis in IPM. Diagnosis of SSI is confirmed by purulent discharge, 
isolation of causative organisms, pain/tenderness, swelling, redness, or heat, 
or diagnosis by a surgeon or attending physician. Inflammatory markers include 
traditional (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and white blood 
cell count) and novel (procalcitonin, serum amyloid A, and presepsin) markers. 
Empirical antibiotic therapy is defined as the initial administration of 
antibiotics within at least 24 hours prior to the results of blood culture and 
antibiotic susceptibility testing. Definitive antibiotic therapy is initiated 
based on the above culture and testing. Combination antibiotic therapy for 
multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria infections appears to be superior to 
monotherapy in mortality with the risk of increasing antibiotic resistance 
rates. The never-ending war between bacterial resistance and new antibiotics is 
continuing. This article reviews prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of 
infection in pain medicine."
105,"PHD-finger domain protein 5A (PHF5A) is a member of the PHD-finger like protein 
superfamily and widely expressed in the nucleus of eukaryotes. The PHD-finger 
like domain is a protein-DNA or protein-protein interaction region. In addition 
to regulate alternative splicing of target genes as a spliceosome protein 
subunit, PHF5A is also involved in pluripotency maintenance of embryonic stem 
cells, chromatin remodeling, DNA damage repair, embryogenesis and 
histomorphological development. Recently, increasing studies have focused on 
exploring spliceosome-related and non-spliceosome-related functions of PHF5A and 
its relationship with the tumorigenesis, development and patient prognosis of 
various malignant tumors, such as breast cancer, lung cancer and colorectal 
cancer. The underlying mechanisms of PHF5A may include mediating aberrant 
alternative splicing of target genes, activating downstream signaling pathways 
as an oncogene/protein, and regulating abnormal gene transcription as a nuclear 
transcription factor or cofactor. Besides, PHF5A was also found to be involved 
in the growth regulation of cancer stem cells. In this review, we aimed to

its role in the occurrence and development of malignant tumors hitherto

106,"OBJECTIVE: To prepare the hyaluronic acid microneedle (abbreviated as 
microneedle) delivery system carrying curcumin nanodrugs (Cur-NDs) and 
photothermal trigger agent new indocyanine green (IR820), and to investigate its 
effect on proliferation of human tongue squamous carcinoma cells (Cal-27) in 
vitro.
METHODS: The microneedle delivery system carrying Cur-NDs and IR820 was 
prepared. The morphological characteristics of the microneedles were observed, 
and the mechanical strength test, skin insertion ability test and the 
photothermal test in vitro were performed. Cal-27 cells were treated with 
microneedles, Cur-NDs microneedles, IR820 microneedles, or Cur-NDs+IR820 
microneedles in vitro, respectively. The IR820 microneedle group and 
Cur-NDs+IR820 microneedle group were irradiated with 808 nm near infrared light 
at 1 W/cm 2 for 5 min. The cell viability was tested with cell counting kit-8 
method.
RESULTS: The prepared microneedles had homogeneous needle-like morphology, good 
mechanical strength and skin piercing ability, among which the microneedles 
equipped with IR820 showed better photothermal performance. The survival rates 
of Cal-27 cells were 100.00% in blank control group, 99.92% in control 
microneedles group, 94.08% in Cur-NDs microneedles group, 0.41% in IR820 
microneedles group, and 0.04% in Cur-NDs+IR820 microneedles group, respectively 
(all P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Compared with single drug treatment, Cur-NDs+IR820 microneedle shows 
better inhibitory effect on Cal-27 cell proliferation in vitro."
107,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the molecular biological mechanisms of Chinese herbal 
medicines for the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions by data mining and 
network pharmacology.
METHODS: The keywords ""gastric precancerous lesions""""gastric precancerous 
disease""""gastric mucosal intraepithelial neoplasia""""gastric mucosal 
heterogeneous hyperplasia""""gastric precancerous state""""chronic gastritis, 
atrophic""""combined Chinese and Western medicine""""Chinese medicine 
therapy""""efficacy evaluation"" ""randomized controlled trial""were searched in 
China Journal Full-text Database, Wanfang Data, VIP database, PubMed and Embase 
from 2001 to 2021. The information was extracted from the literature which met 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the database was constructed to 
identify the high-frequency herbal medicines. The top six Chinese herbal 
medicines were analyzed by the network pharmacology methods, including the 
acquisition of herbs compounds and gastric precancerous lesions targets using 
Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform and GeneCards databases, 
construction of protein-protein interaction network, and screening of core 
targets, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
enrichment analysis of core targets through Metascape platform, etc., to 
elucidate their active components, targets and pathways.
RESULTS: A total of 482 compound prescriptions with 603 herbal medicines were 
included, and the top 6 herbal medicines with higher application frequency were 
Ume plum (63.35%), Curcuma longa (58.54%), Paeonia lactiflora (54.06%), Salvia 
miltiorrhiza (49.92%), Rhizoma alba (46.43%), and Astragalus membranaceus 
(45.44%). The results of the network pharmacological analysis showed that the 
active ingredients were 4 types from Ume plum, 3 from Curcuma longa, 9 from 
Paeonia lactiflora, 13 from Salvia miltiorrhiza, 7 from Astragalus alba, and 9 
from Astragalus; 77 predicted targets were in Ume plum, 11 in Curcuma longa, 33 
in Paeonia lactiflora, 58 in Salvia miltiorrhiza, 65 in Astragalus alba and 89 
in Astragalus; and 98 crossover genes were obtained after these targets were 
compared with the disease genes, among which HSP90AA1, AKT1, TP53, STAT3, MAPK1 
and TNF had higher relevance to the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions. 
The results of the GO enrichment analysis showed that the active ingredients of 
high frequency Chinese medicine mostly acted through biological processes such 
as response to inorganic substance, response to hormone, gland development, 
positive regulation of cell migration, positive regulation of cell motility, 
etc. The targets include cellular components such as vesicle lumen, secretory 
granule lumen, cytoplasmic vesicle lumen, transcription regulator complex, and 
with molecular functions such as kinase binding, protein kinase binding and 
DNA-binding transcription factor binding. The results of the KEGG pathway 
enrichment analysis showed that Paeonia lactiflora, Ulmus lucidus, Salvia 
miltiorrhiza and Astragalus mainly act through the cancer pathway and PI3K-AKT 
pathway; Curcuma longa and Rhizoma alba mainly act through the cancer pathway 
and proteoglycans in cancer, and all six herbs were involved in the cancer 
pathway and five herbs are involved in the PI3K-AKT pathway.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we obtained the top 6 high-frequency Chinese herbal 
medicines in the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions by data mining 
method, and revealed that their mechanisms are involved in cell proliferation, 
differentiation, immunity, inflammation and other processes mainly through 
cancer pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer."
108,"Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted considerable attention in recent years 
due to their unique advantages in minimal invasiveness and spatiotemporal 
selectivity. However, the fabrication procedures of PTT agents frequently 
require complex chemical and/or physical methods that involves harsh and 
environmentally hazardous conditions. Here, a genetically engineered bacterium 
is developed to synthesize melanin nanoparticles under mild and environmentally 
friendly conditions. The biosynthetic melanin nanoparticles exhibit excellent 
biocompatibility, good stability, and negligible toxicity. In addition, the 
biosynthetic melanin nanoparticles have strong absorption at near-infrared (NIR) 
region and higher photothermal conversion efficiency (48.9%) than chemically 
synthesized melanin-like polydopamine nanoparticles under an 808 nm laser 
irradiation. Moreover, the results show that the biosynthetic melanin 
nanoparticles have excellent photoacoustic imaging (PAI) performance and can be 
used for PAI guided PTT in vivo. In conclusion, the study provides an 
alternative approach to synthesize PTT agents with broad application potential 
in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer."
109,"BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and hemiarthroplasty are common 
treatments for severe hip joint disease. To predict the probability of 
re-admission after discharge when patients are hospitalized will support 
providing appropriate health education and guidance.
METHODS: The research aims to use logistic regression (LR), decision trees (DT), 
random forests (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN) to establish 
predictive models and compare their performances on re-admissions within 30 days 
after THA or hemiarthroplasty. The data of this study includes patient 
demographics, physiological measurements, disease history, and clinical 
laboratory test results.
RESULTS: There were 508 and 309 patients in the THA and hemiarthroplasty studies 
respectively from September 2016 to December 2018. The accuracies of the four 
models LR, DT, RF, and ANN in the THA experiment are 94.3%, 93.2%, 97.3%, and 
93.9%, respectively. In the hemiarthroplasty experiment, the accuracies of the 
four models are 92.4%, 86.1%, 94.2%, and 94.8%, respectively. Among these, we 
found that the RF model has the best sensitivity and ANN model has the best area 
under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) score in both experiments.
CONCLUSIONS: The THA experiment confirmed that the performance of the RF model 
is better than the other models. The key factors affecting the prognosis after 
THA surgery are creatinine, sodium, anesthesia duration, and dialysis. In the 
hemiarthroplasty experiment, the ANN model showed more accurate results. Poor 
kidney function increases the risk of hospital re-admission. This research 
highlights that RF and ANN model perform well on the hip replacement surgery 
outcome prediction."
110,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most frequently performed bariatric 
procedure worldwide. Long-term complications such as insufficient weight loss 
(IWL) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may necessitate SG conversion 
to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The aim of this review was to determine the 
indication-specific weight loss and diabetes remission after SG conversion to 
RYGB (STOBY). Our objective was to extract all available published data on 
indication for conversion, weight loss, remission of diabetes, and short-term 
complications after STOBY. A systematic literature search was conducted to 
identify studies reporting outcomes following STOBY. A random effects model was 
used for meta-analysis. The search identified 44 relevant studies. Overall 
short-term (12-mo) excess weight loss (EWL) was 54.6% (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 46%-63%) in 23 studies (n = 712) and total weight loss (TWL) was 19.9% 
(95% CI, 14%-25%) in 21 studies (n = 740). For IWL, short-term (12-mo) pooled 
weight loss outcomes were 53.9% EWL (95% CI, 48%-59%) in 14 studies (n = 295) 
and 22.7% TWL (95% CI, 17%-28%) in 12 studies (n = 219), and medium-term (2-5 
yr) outcomes were 45.8% EWL (95% CI, 38%-53%) in 7 studies (n = 154) and 20.6% 
TWL (95% CI, 15%-26%) in 9 studies (n = 206). Overall diabetes remission was 53% 
(95% CI, 33%-72%), and the perioperative complication rate was 8.2% (95% CI, 
7.6%-8.7%). Revisional SG conversion to RYGB for IWL can achieve good weight 
loss outcomes and diabetes remission."
111,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe 
irreversible central vision loss in individuals over 65 years old. Genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) have shown that the region at chromosome 10q26, 
where the age-related maculopathy susceptibility (ARMS2/LOC387715) and HtrA 
serine peptidase 1 (HTRA1) genes are located, represents one of the strongest 
associated loci for AMD. However, the underlying biological mechanism of this 
genetic association has remained elusive. In this article, we extensively review 
the literature by us and others regarding the ARMS2/HTRA1 risk alleles and their 
functional significance. We also review the literature regarding the presumed 
function of the ARMS2 protein and the molecular processes of the HTRA1 protein 
in AMD pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo, including those of transgenic mice 
overexpressing HtrA1/HTRA1 which developed Bruch's membrane (BM) damage, 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), 
similar to human AMD patients. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of 
the ARMS2 and HTRA1 susceptibility loci has begun to untangle the complex 
biological pathways underlying AMD pathophysiology, pointing to new testable 
paradigms for treatment."
112,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Rhino‑Orbital‑Cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM) is a 
life-threatening opportunistic fungal infection, which mostly affects 
immunocompromised patients. There has been a notable rise in the incidence of 
ROCM during the COVID-19 outbreak. In this study we described imaging 
characteristics of ROCM in detail, from early sinonasal inflammation to late 
intracranial involvement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, Computed Tomography (CT) 
scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of 48 patients with proven ROCM in 
biopsy or culture were evaluated. All the patients had a history of COVID-19 
infection within the previous three months. The imaging findings were described 
and the frequency of different parameters was reported.
RESULTS: Paranasal inflammation was detected in all the patients on imaging. The 
most common involved paranasal sinuses were ethmoid sinuses (97.9%). On 
diffusionweighted images, restricted diffusion was seen in the paranasal sinuses 
of 81.1% of the patients. In addition, sinus wall bone involvement was observed 
in 87.5% of the cases. The most common anatomical sites for extrasinus 
involvement were the retroantral soft tissue (89.6%) and orbital cavity (87.5%). 
Dacryocystitis in 50%, optic nerve inflammation in 43.2%, globe involvement in 
18.9%, and trigeminal nerve involvement in 16% of the patients were detected. 
There was extension of inflammation through the cavernous sinuses and alongside 
the internal carotid arteries in 24% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Characteristic imaging findings of ROCM not only play a vital role 
in the early diagnosis of this infection, but they also contribute to the 
assessment of the extension of inflammation, which is vitally important in 
surgical planning."
113,"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a 
large genetic contribution; however, its neurodevelopmental substrates remain 
largely unknown. Modeling pathogenic processes in SCZ using human induced 
pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (iNs) has emerged as a promising strategy. 
Copy number variants confer high genetic risk for SCZ, with duplication of the 
16p11.2 locus increasing the risk 14.5-fold.
METHODS: To dissect the contribution of induced excitatory neurons (iENs) versus 
GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic) neurons (iGNs) to SCZ pathophysiology, 
we induced iNs from CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
repeats)-Cas9 isogenic and SCZ patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells 
and analyzed SCZ-related phenotypes in iEN monocultures and iEN/iGN cocultures.
RESULTS: In iEN/iGN cocultures, neuronal firing and synchrony were reduced at 
later, but not earlier, stages of in vitro development. These were fully 
recapitulated in iEN monocultures, indicating a primary role for iENs. Moreover, 
isogenic iENs showed reduced dendrite length and deficits in calcium handling. 
iENs from 16p11.2 duplication-carrying patients with SCZ displayed overlapping 
deficits in network synchrony, dendrite outgrowth, and calcium handling. 
Transcriptomic analysis of both iEN cohorts revealed molecular markers of 
disease related to the glutamatergic synapse, neuroarchitecture, and calcium 
regulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the presence of 16p11.2 duplication-dependent 
alterations in SCZ patient-derived iENs. Transcriptomics and cellular 
phenotyping reveal overlap between isogenic and patient-derived iENs, suggesting 
a central role of glutamatergic, morphological, and calcium dysregulation in 
16p11.2 duplication-mediated pathogenesis. Moreover, excitatory dysfunction 
during early neurodevelopment is implicated as the basis of SCZ pathogenesis in 
16p11.2 duplication carriers. Our results support network synchrony and calcium 
handling as outcomes directly linked to this genetic risk variant."
114,"Targeting CD96 that originates in immune cells has shown potential for cancer 
therapy. However, the role of intrinsic CD96 in solid tumor cells remains 
unknown. Here, it is found that CD96 is frequently expressed in tumor cells from 
clinical breast cancer samples and is correlated with poor long-term prognosis 
in these patients. The CD96+ cancer cell subpopulations exhibit features of both 
breast cancer stem cells and chemoresistance. In vivo inhibition of cancer 
cell-intrinsic CD96 enhances the chemotherapeutic response in a patient-derived 
tumor xenograft model. Mechanistically, CD96 enhances mitochondrial fatty acid 
β-oxidation via the CD155-CD96-Src-Stat3-Opa1 pathway, which subsequently 
promotes chemoresistance in breast cancer stem cells. A previously unknown role 
is identified for tumor cell-intrinsic CD96 and an attractive target in 
improving the chemotherapeutic response."
115,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The role of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients 
with large vessel occlusions (LVOs) administered prior to transfer from a 
primary stroke center (PCS) to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) is 
questioned.
METHODS: We included observational studies of patients with an LVO receiving IVT 
at a PCS prior to their EVT transfer compared to those receiving EVT alone. 
Efficacy outcomes included excellent or good functional outcomes [modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 0-1 or 0-2, respectively] and reduced disability 
(mRS shift analysis) at three months. Safety outcomes included symptomatic 
intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 48 hours and three-month all-cause 
mortality. Associations are reported with crude odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted 
ORs (aOR).
RESULTS: We identified 6 studies, including 1723 participants (mean age: 71 
years, 51% women; 53% treated with IVT at a PSC). The mean onset-to-groin 
puncture time did not differ between the two groups (mean difference:-20 min, 
95%CI:-115.89,76.04). Patients receiving IVT prior to transfer had higher odds 
of three-month reduced disability (common OR=1.98; 95%CI:1.17-3.35), excellent 
(OR=1.70,95%CI:1.28-2.26) and good (OR=1.62,95%CI:1.15-2.29) functional 
outcomes, with no increased sICH (OR=0.87,95%CI:0.54-1.39) or mortality 
(OR=0.55,95%CI:0.37-0.83) risks. In the adjusted analyses patients receiving IVT 
at a PSC had higher odds of excellent functional outcome 
(aOR=1.32,95%CI:1.00-1.74) and lower probability for mortality 
(aOR=0.50,95%CI:0.27-0.93).
DISCUSSION: LVO patients receiving IVT at a PSC prior to an EVT transfer have 
higher likelihood of excellent functional recovery and lower odds of mortality, 
with no increase in sICH and onset-to-groin puncture times, compared to those 
transferred for EVT without previously receiving IVT."
116,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is increasing interest in characterizing the 
earliest phases of Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, few studies have 
investigated prediagnostic trajectories of cognition and function. Our objective 
was to describe prediagnostic cognitive and functional trajectories in PD in 
older women and men.
METHODS: We studied 9,595 women and 5,795 men from two prospective cohort 
studies of community-dwelling elders followed up to 20 years. In individuals 
without prevalent PD, we estimated the associations of incident PD diagnosis 
with rates of change in cognition and function before and after diagnosis 
compared to healthy older adults using multivariate mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: Over follow-up, 297 individuals developed incident PD. Interactions 
between the terms in our model and sex were statistically significant for the 
three outcomes (p<0.001 for all), so we stratified results by sex. Compared to 
older men without PD, men who developed PD exhibited faster decline in global 
cognition (0.04 SD more annual change, p<0.001), executive function (0.05 SD 
more annual change, p<0.001), and functional status (0.06 SD more annual change, 
p<0.001) in the prediagnostic period. Women who developed PD compared to women 
without PD displayed faster decline in executive function (0.02 SD more annual 
change, p=0.006) and functional status in the prediagnostic period (0.07 SD more 
annual change, p<0.001).
DISCUSSION: Individuals with incident PD exhibit cognitive and functional 
decline during the prediagnostic phase that exceeds rates associated with normal 
aging. Better understanding heterogeneity in prodromal PD is essential to enable 
earlier diagnosis and identify impactful nonmotor symptoms in all subgroups."
117,"This study was carried out to determine the effect of fear of COVID-19 on 
health-seeking behaviors and Pap smear test rates in women. This study was 
conducted online between June and September 2021. Women aged 21-65 years were 
invited to participate in the study via social media. A total of 396 women 
comprised the sample for this study. Data were collected the Fear of COVID-19 
Scale, and the Health-seeking Behavior Scale. Data were evaluated using 
descriptive statistics, parametric tests and regression analysis. As a result of 
the study, 11.1 percent of women were found to have had a Pap smear test during 
the pandemic period. Fear of COVID-19 was determined to have a positive and 
significant effect on online health-seeking behavior (t = 7.915, p < .001), 
professional health-seeking behavior (t = 4.503, p < .001), traditional 
health-seeking behavior (t = 6.037, p < .001), and general health-seeking 
behavior(t = 8.390, p < .001) while it did not have any effect on having a Pap 
smear test (p > .05). This study showed that although the fear of COVID-19 
positively affected health-seeking behaviors in women, the rates of 
gynecological examination and Pap smear test rates were low during the pandemic."
118,"Objective: In 2019, the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases 
Society of America updated clinical practice guidelines for community-acquired 
pneumonia (CAP). In contrast to guidelines published in 2007, macrolide 
monotherapy for outpatients was made a conditional recommendation based on 
resistance levels. Local knowledge of current antimicrobial susceptibility is 
needed to guide management of CAP and other bacterial respiratory pathogens. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate antimicrobial susceptibility profiles 
and trending for Wisconsin Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.Design: 
Multi-center laboratory surveillance, with testing at a central location 
utilizing standardized susceptibility testing protocols.Methods: Data published 
by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) were augmented with data 
from the Surveillance of Wisconsin Organisms for Trends in Antimicrobial 
Resistance and Epidemiology (SWOTARE) program. Data were stratified by invasive 
or non-invasive sources, as well as DHS region and compared to data compiled 
from 2006-2010.Results: Susceptibility rates for ≥ 916 invasive S. pneumoniae 
assessed from 2016-2020 were greater than 91% for ceftriaxone, tetracycline, and 
fluoroquinolone agents and were generally higher than those from 354 
non-invasive isolates. Low susceptibility rates were observed for invasive 
isolates of penicillin (78.7%) and erythromycin (64.8%) and were even lower for 
non-invasive isolates (73.8% and 59.9%, respectively). This erythromycin 
susceptibility rate was a significant reduction from that observed in 2006-2010 
(80.4; P < 0.0002). 24.8% of isolates generated an erythromycin MIC ≥ 8 μg/mL. 
Statewide geographic variability was noted.Conclusions: Rates of S. pneumoniae 
susceptibility to parenteral penicillins and cephems, and oral tetracycline and 
fluoroquinolone agents, remain high throughout Wisconsin. However, low oral 
penicillin susceptibility rates, taken together with declining macrolide 
susceptibility rates, should cause clinicians to consider alternative treatment 
options for respiratory tract infections, especially with macrolides."
119,"Rationale: We present an overview of our prospective fibroblast activation 
protein inhibitors (FAPI) registry study across a 3-year period, with 
head-to-head comparison of tumor uptake in 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG PET, as well as 
FAP immunohistochemistry. Methods: This is an interim analysis of the ongoing 
68Ga-FAPI PET prospective observational trial at our Department. Patients who 
underwent clinical imaging with 68Ga-FAPI PET between October 2018 and October 
2021 were included. Tracer uptake for tumor lesions was quantified by SUVmax and 
for normal organs by SUVmean. PET tumor volume (40% isocontour) and 
tumor-to-background ratios (TBR) were calculated. Correlation between SUVmax and 
FAP staining in tissue samples was analyzed. Results: 324 patients with 21 
different tumor entities underwent 68Ga-FAPI imaging; 237 patients additionally 
received 18F-FDG PET. The most common tumor entities were sarcoma (131/324, 
40%), pancreatic carcinoma (67/324, 21%), and primary tumors of the brain 
(22/324, 7%). Mean primary tumor SUVmax was significantly higher for 68Ga-FAPI 
than 18F-FDG among pancreatic cancers (13.2 vs. 6.1, p<0.001) and sarcoma (14.3 
vs. 9.4, p<0.001), and the same was true for mean SUVmax in metastatic lesions 
of pancreatic cancers (9.4 vs. 5.5, p<0.001). Mean primary tumor TBRmax was 
significantly higher for 68Ga-FAPI than 18F-FDG across several tumor entities, 
most prominently pancreatic cancers (14.7 vs. 3.0, p<0.001) and sarcoma (17.3 
vs. 4.7, p<0.001). Compared to 18F-FDG, 68Ga-FAPI showed superior detection for 
locoregional disease in sarcoma (52 vs. 48 total regions detected) as well as 
for distant metastatic disease in both, sarcoma (137 vs. 131) and pancreatic 
cancer (65 vs. 57), respectively. Among 61 histopathology samples, there was a 
positive correlation between 68Ga-FAPI SUVmax and overall FAP 
immunohistochemistry score (r=0.352, P = 0.005). Conclusion: 68Ga-FAPI 
demonstrates higher absolute uptake in pancreatic cancers and sarcoma, as well 
as higher tumor-to-background uptake along with improved tumor detection for 
pancreatic cancers, sarcoma, and other tumor entities when compared to 18F-FDG. 
68Ga-FAPI is a new tool for tumor staging with theranostic potential."
120,"To assess the prognostic utility of conventional biochemical and imaging 
response criteria and 68Ga- prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) 11 PET 
adapted or specific systems regarding overall survival (OS) in men with 
metastatic hormone-sensitive (mHSPC) and castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) treated 
with taxane-based chemotherapy. Methods: A total of 103 patients (pts) (n = 57 
mHSPC, n = 46 mCRPC) underwent taxane-based chemotherapy. All patients had a 
minimum of two PSMA PET scans (at baseline and up to 3 months post-treatment). 
PSMA PET response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST 1.1), adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (aPCWG3, using 
PSMA PET instead of bone scan), adapted Positron Emission Tomography Response 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (aPERCIST) and PSMA PET Progression (PPP) criteria. 
Response by each criterion was stratified by either progressive disease (PD) 
versus non-PD. For aPERCIST, stratification by PD, stable disease (SD) and 
partial/complete remission (PR/CR) was performed. Biochemical response was 
determined by PSA decline ≥50%. Subgroup analyses were performed by 
castration-status. Univariable cox proportional hazard regression analyses 
including Harrell's concordance indices were calculated to investigate the 
association of PD by response criteria and OS. Kaplan-Meier tests including 
log-rank statistics were calculated for survival analyses. Results: 26 (25%) of 
pts had non-measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. PD by any response criterion was 
associated with an at least 2.5-fold increased risk of death and was highest for 
PD versus CR/PR by aPERCIST (HR 11.4) on univariable regression. Stratified by 
castration status, a similar pattern was observed. PD by any criterion as 
associated with significantly shortened OS across overall and subgroup analyses. 
PR/CR by aPERCIST identified pts with lower risk of death and longer OS as 
compared to patients with PD or SD. Conclusion: 68Ga-PSMA11 PET-based response 
criteria (PPP, aPERCIST, aPCWG3) have high prognostic utility in men with 
metastatic PC undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy. PPP is simple to use, 
identified most patients with PD and showed best prognostic utility regarding 
OS. PR/CR by aPERCIST identifies a subgroup of responders (PR/CR) showing better 
outcomes than patients with PD or SD. Future studies are warranted to amend the 
current paradigm relying on mere differentiation of PD versus non-PD in 
metastatic PC and to identify true treatment responders by imaging criteria."
121,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) deposited from 
disease-affected individuals could be a valuable donor cell source for 
generating disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, 
generation of iPSCs from the LCLs is still challenging, as yet no effective gene 
delivery strategy has been developed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we reveal an effective gene delivery method 
specifically for LCLs. We found that LCLs appear to be refractory toward 
retroviral and lentiviral transduction. Consequently, lentiviral and retroviral 
transduction of OCT4, SOX2, KFL4 and c-MYC into LCLs does not elicit iPSC colony 
formation. Interestingly, however we found that transfection of 
oriP/EBNA-1-based episomal vectors by electroporation is an efficient gene 
delivery system into LCLs, enabling iPSC generation from LCLs. These iPSCs 
expressed pluripotency makers (OCT4, NANOG, SSEA4, SALL4) and could form 
embryoid bodies.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that electroporation is an effective gene delivery 
method with which LCLs can be efficiently reprogrammed into iPSCs."
122,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The heart contains a pool of c-kit+ progenitor cells 
which is believed to be able to regenerate. The differentiation of these 
progenitor cells is reliant on different physiological cues. Unraveling the 
underlying signals to direct differentiation of progenitor cells will be 
beneficial in controlling progenitor cell fate. In this regard, the role of the 
mitochondria in mediating cardiac progenitor cell fate remains unclear. 
Specifically, the association between changes in mitochondrial morphology with 
the differentiation status of c-kit+ CPCs remains elusive. In this study, we 
investigated the relationship between mitochondrial morphology and the 
differentiation status of c-kit+ progenitor cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: c-kit+ CPCs were isolated from 2-month-old male wild-type 
FVB mice. To activate differentiation, CPCs were incubated in α-minimal 
essential medium containing 10 nM dexamethasone for up to 7 days. To inhibit 
Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation, either 10 μM or 50 μM mdivi-1 was 
administered once at Day 0 and again at Day 2 of differentiation. To inhibit 
calcineurin, either 1 μM or 5 μM ciclosporin-A (CsA) was administered once at 
Day 0 and again at Day 2 of differentiation. Dexamethasone-induced 
differentiation of c-kit+ progenitor cells is aligned with fragmentation of the 
mitochondria via a calcineurin-Drp1 pathway. Pharmacologically inhibiting 
mitochondrial fragmentation retains the undifferentiated state of the c-kit+ 
progenitor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study provide an alternative view of the 
role of mitochondrial fusion-fission in the differentiation of cardiac 
progenitor cells and the potential of pharmacologically manipulating the 
mitochondria to direct progenitor cell fate."
123,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Brain metastases (BMs) are the most frequent intracranial tumors 
in adults and one of the greatest challenges for modern oncology. Most are 
derived from lung, breast, renal cell, and colorectal carcinomas and melanomas. 
Up to 14% of patients are diagnosed with BMs of unknown primary, which are 
commonly characterized by an early and aggressive metastatic spread. It is 
important to discover novel biomarkers for early identification of BM origin, 
allowing better management of patients with this disease. Our study focused on 
microRNAs (miRNAs), which are very stable in frozen native and FFPE tissues and 
have been shown to be sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarkers of cancer. We 
aimed to identify miRNAs with significantly different expression in the five 
most frequent groups of BMs and develop a diagnostic classifier capable of 
sensitive and specific classification of BMs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total RNA enriched for miRNAs was isolated using the 
mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit from 71 fresh-frozen histopathologically confirmed 
BM tissues originating in 5 cancer types. Sequencing libraries were prepared 
using the QIAseq miRNA Library Kit and sequenced on the NextSeq 500 platform. 
MiRNA expression was further validated by RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: Differential analysis identified 373 miRNAs with significantly 
different expression between 5 BM groups (p<0.001). A classifier model was 
developed based on the expression of 6 miRNAs (hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-141-5p, 
hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-194-5p, hsa-miR-200b-3p and hsa-miR-365b-5p) with the 
ability to correctly classify 91.5% of samples. Subsequent validation confirmed 
both significantly different expression of selected miRNAs in 5 BM groups as 
well as their diagnostic potential.
CONCLUSION: To date, our study is the first to analyze miRNA expression in 
various types of BMs using small RNA sequencing to develop a diagnostic 
classifier and, thus, to help stratify BMs of unknown primary. The presented 
results confirm the importance of studying the dysregulated expression of miRNAs 
in BMs and the diagnostic potential of the validated 6-miRNA signature."
124,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in 
women worldwide and it is a major cause of cancer-related deaths in developing 
countries. Despite the marked reduction observed in the rates of the disease as 
a result of screening programs, it is necessary to develop robust biomarkers 
that can detect the neoplastic progression early in HPV-related cervical 
lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed comparative mRNA sequencing from exfoliative 
cervical cytology samples from nine Korean women using the Illumina NovaSeq6000 
platform. Each pathological tissue was matched to the corresponding cytological 
sample. The pathologic diagnosis was scrutinized with ancillary 
immunohistochemistry and was considered a confirmative (endpoint) diagnosis. The 
pathological diagnoses consisted of three cases of chronic cervicitis, 2 
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), 2 squamous cell carcinomas 
in situ (CIS), and 2 invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs), respectively. 
Using bioinformatic analyses, differentially expressed genes (DEGs; fold change 
≥1.5; p<0.05) were applied for Gene Ontology (GO), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
(GSEA), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.
RESULTS: From a total of 55,882 genes, 438 DEGs were pinpointed; 282 genes were 
up-regulated and 156 genes down-regulated. These transcriptomic profiles were 
clearly divided into neoplastic (HSIL, CIS, and SQCC; ≥HSILs) and non-neoplastic 
lesions. The up-regulated DEGs were HIF-1a, EDN1, PIK3R3, PPP1CA and AKR1C1. GO, 
GSEA, and PPI network analyses showed marked associations with metabolism, 
proteolysis, or proteoglycan process pathways in cervical carcinogenesis.
CONCLUSION: The transcriptomic analysis using exfoliative cervical cells was 
more likely representative of its corresponding histopathological diagnosis, 
thus emphasizing its potential utility in clinical practice. This study provides 
comprehensive transcriptomic network analyses for robust biomarkers that might 
present a high potential risk of progression to cancer in the exfoliative 
cervical cytology; our findings support their clinical utility for improved 
cervical cancer screening."
125,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Several cases of concurrent reduction of expression of 
polycystin 1 (PKD1) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2) that are contiguous 
in chromosome 16p13 have been previously reported. This study newly addresses 
the concurrent reduction of expression of PKD1, TSC2 and NTHL1, which is 
adjacent to TSC2 and is a tumor suppressor gene.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the mRNA expression levels of PKD1, TSC2, 
PKD2, TSC1 and NTHL1 in blood and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues in a 
proband with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC) and multiple pathologically diverse RCCs, including 
clear cell, papillary and chromophobe types. Additionally, we investigated 
germline variants in blood using whole exome sequencing (WES) in the proband and 
her four siblings.
RESULTS: mRNA expression levels of PKD1, TSC2 and NTHL1 were reduced in the 
proband's blood and RCCs, compared with control groups. WES identified one novel 
variant with amino acid changes in the PKD1 exon in the three subjects with 
ADPKD, including the proband. Moreover, two variants in the TSC2 intron specific 
to the proband were also identified.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we report a novel pathogenic variant in the PKD1 exon 
which likely led to ADPKD, and two variants in the TSC2 intron, which might have 
led to reduction in the expression of both TSC2 and NTHL1, consequently leading 
to TSC and multiple pathologically diverse RCCs."
126,"Routine childhood vaccination improves health and prevents morbidity and 
mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. There are indications that the 
COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted immunization rates globally, but 
systematic studies on this are still lacking in Canada. This study aims to add 
knowledge on the pandemic's effect on children's immunization rates with 
pneumococcal vaccine using self-reported immunization data from CANImmunize. An 
interrupted time series analysis was conducted on aggregated monthly enrollment 
of children on the platform (2016-2021) and their pneumococcal immunization 
series completion rates (2016-2020). Predicted trends before and after the onset 
of the COVID19-related restriction (March 1, 2020) were compared by means of an 
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). The highest monthly enrollment 
was 3,474 new infant records observed in January 2020, and the lowest was 100 
records in December 2021. The highest Self-reported pneumococcal immunization 
series completion rate was 78.89%, observed in February 2017, and the lowest was 
6.94% in December 2021. Enrollment decreased by 1177.52 records (95% CI: 
-1865.47, -489.57), with a continued decrease of 80.84 records each month. 
Completion rates had an immediate increase of 14.57% (95% CI 4.64, 24.51), 
followed by a decrease of 3.54% each month. The onset of the COVID-19 related 
restrictions impacted the enrollment of children in the CANImmunize digital 
immunization platform and an overall decrease in self-reported pneumococcal 
immunization series completion rates. Our findings support efforts to increase 
catch-up immunization campaigns so that children who could not get scheduled 
immunization during the pandemic are not missed."
127,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) frequently 
experience nighttime heartburn and sleep disturbance. Tegoprazan is a new 
potassium-competitive acid blocker that can rapidly block acid secretion. This 
study aims to evaluate the efficacy of tegoprazan compared with esomeprazole in 
relieving nighttime heartburn and sleep disturbances.
METHODS: Patients with erosive esophagitis, nighttime heartburn, and sleep 
disturbances were randomized to receive tegoprazan 50 mg or esomeprazole 40 mg 
for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was time to first nighttime heartburn-free 
interval. The percentage of nighttime heartburn-free days was also compared 
between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were enrolled in this study. Time to the first 
nighttime heartburn-free interval was shorter with tegoprazan than with 
esomeprazole but the difference was not statistically significant (1.5 days vs 3 
days, P = 0.151). The percentage of nighttime heartburn-free days was higher in 
the tegoprazan group but the difference was insignificant (57.8% vs 43.1%, P = 
0.107). Adverse events occurred in 2 patients. They were mild in severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Tegoprazan may induce faster relief of nighttime heartburn symptoms 
and may improve sleep disorders associated with nighttime heartburn. Further 
large-scale studies are required to validate our findings."
128,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an approach with the potential to 
complement clinical surveillance systems. Using WBE, it is possible to carry out 
an early warning of a possible outbreak, monitor spatial and temporal trends of 
infectious diseases, produce real-time results and generate representative 
epidemiological information in a territory, especially in areas of social 
vulnerability. Despite the historical uses of this approach, particularly in the 
Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and for other pathogens, it was during the 
COVID-19 pandemic that occurred an exponential increase in environmental 
surveillance programs for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, with many experiences and 
developments in the field of public health using data for decision making and 
prioritizing actions to control the pandemic. In Latin America, WBE was applied 
in heterogeneous contexts and with emphasis on populations that present many 
socio-environmental inequalities, a condition shared by all Latin American 
countries. This manuscript addresses the concepts and applications of WBE in 
public health actions, as well as different experiences in Latin American 
countries, and discusses a model to implement this surveillance system at the 
local or national level. We emphasize the need to implement this sentinel 
surveillance system in countries that want to detect the early entry and spread 
of new pathogens and monitor outbreaks or epidemics of infectious agents in 
their territories as a complement of public health surveillance systems."
129,"Microenvironmental concentrations and time-activity patterns influence personal 
exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, the variations and 
contributions of PM2.5 exposures from various microenvironments (MEs) and 
activities remain unclear. In this study, gravimetrically corrected real-time 
personal PM2.5 measurements were collected during routine activities in 
different MEs from 66 non-smoking retired adults. Exposure data were collected 
for five consecutive days over two seasons in Nanjing (NJ) and Beijing (BJ), 
China. Measured PM2.5 concentrations varied substantially both between and 
within different MEs and activities. The highest average concentrations were 
observed in restaurants (NJ: mean 192 μg/m3, SD 242 μg/m3; BJ: mean 91 μg/m3, SD 
79 μg/m3) and were associated with sources such as passive smoking and cooking 
emissions. Overall, PM2.5 concentrations in different MEs and activities were 
moderately to highly correlated with outdoor PM2.5 concentrations (Spearman's 
r = 0.51-0.97) except in restaurants and during passive smoking. The at-home ME 
contributed approximately 85 % of the total PM2.5 exposure, corresponding to the 
participants spending about 87 % of their time there. The majority of household 
exposures occurred during sleeping, cooking, and other home-based activities. 
Transportation accounted for <5 % of total exposure. Our results indicate that 
improving indoor air quality, especially residential indoors, is important to 
reduce personal exposure to PM2.5."
130,"Over the course of the Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020-2022, 
monitoring of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ribonucleic 
acid (SARS-CoV-2 RNA) in wastewater has rapidly evolved into a supplementary 
surveillance instrument for public health. Short term trends (2 weeks) are used 
as a basis for policy and decision making on measures for dealing with the 
pandemic. Normalisation is required to account for the dilution rate of the 
domestic wastewater that can strongly vary due to time- and location-dependent 
sewer inflow of runoff, industrial discharges and extraneous waters. The 
standard approach in sewage surveillance is normalisation using flow 
measurements, although flow based normalisation is not effective in case the 
wastewater volume sampled does not match the wastewater volume produced. In this 
paper, two alternative normalisation methods, using electrical conductivity and 
crAssphage have been studied and compared with the standard approach using flow 
measurements. For this, a total of 1116 24-h flow-proportional samples have been 
collected between September 2020 and August 2021 at nine monitoring locations. 
In addition, 221 stool samples have been analysed to determine the daily 
crAssphage load per person. Results show that, although crAssphage shedding 
rates per person vary greatly, on a population-level crAssphage loads per person 
per day were constant over time and similar for all catchments. Consequently, 
crAssphage can be used as a quantitative biomarker for populations above 5595 
persons. Electrical conductivity is particularly suitable to determine dilution 
rates relative to dry weather flow concentrations. The overall conclusion is 
that flow normalisation is necessary to reliably determine short-term trends in 
virus circulation, and can be enhanced using crAssphage and/or electrical 
conductivity measurement as a quality check."
131,"Environmental filtering (EF), the abiotic exclusion of species, can have first 
order, direct effects with cascading consequences for population dynamics, 
especially at range edges where abiotic conditions are suboptimal. Abiotic 
stress gradients associated with EF may also drive indirect second order 
effects, including exacerbating the effects of competitors, disease, and 
parasites on marginal populations because of suboptimal physiological 
performance. We predicted a cascade of first and second order EF-associated 
effects on marginal populations of the invasive mussel Mytilus 
galloprovincialis, plus a third order effect of EF of increased epibiont load 
due to second order shell degradation by endoliths. Mussel populations on rocky 
shores were surveyed across 850 km of the south-southeast coast of South Africa, 
from the species' warm-edge range limit to sites in the centre of their 
distribution, to quantify second order (endolithic shell degradation) and third 
order (number of barnacle epibionts) EF-associated effects as a function of 
along-shore distance from the range edge. Inshore temperature data were 
interpolated from the literature. Using in situ temperature logger data, we 
calculated the effective shore level for several sites by determining the 
duration of immersion and emersion. Summer and winter inshore water temperatures 
were linked to distance from the mussel's warm range edge (our proxy for an 
EF-associated stress gradient), suggesting that seasonality in temperature 
contributes to first order effects. The gradient in thermal stress clearly 
affected densities, but its influence on mussel size, shell degradation, and 
epibiosis was weaker. Relationships among mussel size, shell degradation, and 
epibiosis were more robust. Larger, older mussels had more degraded shells and 
more epibionts, with endolithic damage facilitating epibiosis. EF associated 
with a gradient in thermal stress directly limits the distribution, abundance, 
and size structure of mussel populations, with important indirect second and 
third order effects of parasitic disease and epibiont load, respectively."
132,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is the primary cause of premature death in adult 
patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD). This study aims to describe the 
impact of a HF diagnosis on short-term prognosis and to investigate the added 
prognostic value of a HF diagnosis to the ACHD Anatomic and Physiological 
classification (ACHD-AP).
METHODS: This study included 3995 patients followed in a tertiary care center 
(last follow-up >January 1 2010). Survival curves were plotted and predictors of 
the primary endpoint (death, heart transplantation, or ventricular assist device 
[VAD]) were identified using Cox proportional hazard models and compared using 
Harrell's C-statistic.
RESULTS: Mean age at baseline was 35.7±13.3 years. The prevalence of ACHD-HF was 
6.4%. During a median follow up of 3.1 (IQR 2.1-3.6) years, 27.3% of ACHD-HF 
patients reached the primary endpoint, compared to 1.4% of ACHD patients without 
HF. Event-free survival was 78.3%, 61.9%, and 57.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years in 
ACHD-HF patients, compared to 99.3%, 98.3%, and 98.0% in ACHD patients without 
HF (p<0.001). A HF diagnosis (HR 6.9; 95% CI 4.3-11.2) and the physiological 
classification (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.9-3.7) were independently associated with the 
primary endpoint. The addition of HF to the ACHD-AP classification yielded a 
Harrell's C index of 0.8631, providing a significant improvement over the 
ACHD-AP classification alone (p=0.0003).
CONCLUSION: The risk of mortality, and need for transplantation or VAD is 
increased in ACHD-HF patients. A HF diagnosis appears a valuable prognostic 
marker in addition to the ACHD-AP classification."
133,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence and assess the risk factors associated with 
3 adverse events (AE) of interest after Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy 
(Nd:YAG-caps): ocular hypertension (OHT), macular edema (ME) and retinal 
detachment (RD).
DESIGN: Observational cohort study using a nationwide claims database.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults who underwent Nd:YAG-caps between 2014 and 2017, with no 
ocular disease history in the year before.
METHODS: Nd:YAG-caps patients were identified using data from the French 
national 1/97th representative sample and followed-up for 12 months 
post-Nd:YAG-caps. The time to AE was assessed using Kaplan-Meier method. Factors 
associated with AE were assessed using Cox models.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nd:YAG-caps epidemiology; patients' characteristics; 
proportion of patients with AE; Hazard ratios (HRs) associated to variables 
identified as factors associated with AEs of interest, overall and by AE.
RESULTS: During the study period, 6,210 patients with Nd:YAG-caps were 
identified (7,958 procedures). The mean age (±sd) at Nd:YAG-caps was 75.0 
(±10.3) years. The 3-month and 12-month overall AE rates (≥1 AE of interest 
[OHT, ME, RD]) were 8.6% and 13.3%, respectively. Among patients with ≥1 AE of 
interest, 68.4% of AEs occurred within 3 months post-Nd:YAG-caps. Three-month 
rates were similar for OHT and ME (≈5%). RD rate remained ≤0.5% over the entire 
follow-up. Cox models showed that patients with Nd:YAG-caps performed within 
1-year post-cataract surgery were of higher risk of AE than those with later 
Nd:YAG-caps (HR 1.314 [1.034-1.669], p=0.0256). Diabetic patients were more at 
risk of OHT (HR 1.233 [1.005-1.513], p=0.0448) and ME (HR 1.810 [1.446-2.266], 
p=<.0001) than non-diabetic ones. Patients with Nd:YAG-caps within 1-year 
post-cataract surgery were more at risk of ME (HR 1.500 [1.087-2.070], 
p=0.0137). Patients with Nd:YAG-caps performed between the first- and 
second-year post-cataract were more at risk of OHT than patients with later 
Nd:YAG-caps (HR 1.429 [1.185-1.723], p=0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a national claims database, OHT and ME were the most 
frequent AE of interest post-Nd:YAG-caps, mainly observed within the first 3 
months post-procedure, highlighting the need for a close follow-up during this 
period or a delayed capsulotomy if possible. Diabetes and an early Nd:YAG-caps 
post-cataract surgery were among the main drivers for AE occurrence."
134,"Cranial 4D flow MRI post-processing typically involves manual user interaction 
which is time-consuming and associated with poor repeatability. The primary goal 
of this study is to develop a robust quantitative velocity tool (QVT) that 
utilizes threshold-based segmentation techniques to improve segmentation quality 
over prior approaches based on centerline processing schemes (CPS) that utilize 
k-means clustering segmentation. This tool also includes an interactive 3D 
display designed for simplified vessel selection and fully automated hemodynamic 
visualization and quantification. The performances of QVT and CPS were compared 
in vitro in a flow phantom and in vivo in 10 healthy participants. Vessel 
segmentations were compared with ground-truth computed tomography in vitro (29 
locations) and manual segmentation in vivo (13 locations) using linear 
regression. Additionally, QVT and CPS MRI flow rates were compared to 
perivascular ultrasound flow in vitro using linear regression. To assess 
internal consistency of flow measures in vivo, conservation of flow was assessed 
at vessel junctions using linear regression and consistency of flow along vessel 
segments was analyzed by fitting a Gaussian distribution to a histogram of 
normalized flow values. Post-processing times were compared between the QVT and 
CPS using paired t-tests. Vessel areas segmented in vitro (CPS: slope = 0.71, 
r = 0.95 and QVT: slope = 1.03, r = 0.95) and in vivo (CPS: slope = 0.61, 
r = 0.96 and QVT: slope = 0.93, r = 0.96) were strongly correlated with 
ground-truth area measurements. However, CPS (using k-means segmentation) 
consistently underestimated vessel areas. Strong correlations were observed 
between QVT and ultrasound flow (slope = 0.98, r = 0.96) as well as flow at 
junctions (slope = 1.05, r = 0.98). Mean and standard deviation of flow along 
vessel segments was 9.33e-16 ± 3.05%. Additionally, the QVT demonstrated 
excellent interobserver agreement and significantly reduced post-processing by 
nearly 10 min (p < 0.001). By completely automating post-processing and 
providing an easy-to-use 3D visualization interface for interactive vessel 
selection and hemodynamic quantification, the QVT offers an efficient, robust, 
and repeatable means to analyze cranial 4D flow MRI. This software is freely 
available at: BLINDED."
135,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to compare the clinical results of microwave 
ablation (MWA) in patients downstaged to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer(BCLC) 
stage A with transarterial chemoembolization(TACE) and those initially 
classified as BCLC stage A.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2012 to May 2017, 1087 patients were 
reviewed retrospectively using propensity score matching (1:1): 86 patients 
received MWA as a curative treatment after downstaging to BCLC stage A by TACE 
(downstaging group), and 86 patients initially classified as BCLC stage A 
received MWA (control group). The overall survival (OS) and disease-free 
survival (DFS) between the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS was 95.3%, 79.1%, and 58.1%, respectively, in 
the downstaging group; and 93.0%, 81.4%, and 61.6%, respectively, in the control 
group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50, 1.13; P = 
0.162). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS was 80.2%, 50.0%, and 24.4%, respectively, in 
the downstaging group; and 77.9%, 52.3%, and 27.9%, respectively, in the control 
group (HR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.53; P = 0.678). No significant differences 
were found in OS and DFS.
CONCLUSION: The long-term prognosis in patients with HCC who received MWA after 
downgrading to BCLC stage A using TACE and in patients with initial BCLC stage A 
was similar."
136,"PURPOSE: To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of AAV2-REP1 in 
choroideremia (CHM) patients, and to test a potential antisense oligonucleotide 
therapy for CHM.
METHODS: Design: Extended phase 1/2 clinical trial and laboratory investigation.
PARTICIPANTS: Five patients who received a single subfoveal injection of 
AAV2-REP1.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The long-term safety was evaluated by ophthalmic examination, 
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and fundus 
autofluorescence (FAF) for up to five years. Functional and structural changes 
were determined by different test modalities. Four antisense oligonucleotides 
(ASOs) were designed to treat the CHM c.1245-521A>G mutation which was present 
in two patients within this trial.
RESULTS: Subject P3 experienced a localized intraretinal immune response that 
resulted in a significant loss of preserved RPE. P4 experienced an exacerbation 
of peripheral retinoschisis. P2 had a constant ≥ 15-letter BCVA gain in the 
treated eye, while P5 had ≥ 15-letter BCVA improvement once in the untreated 
eye. The preserved FAF areas declined more rapidly in the treated eyes compared 
to the untreated eyes (P = 0.043). A customized 25-mer ASO recovered 83.2-95.0% 
of the normal RNA and 57.5% of the normal protein in fibroblasts from two trial 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-retinal inflammation triggered by AAV2-REP1 subretinal 
injection stabilized after two years but resulted in permanent damage to the 
retinal structure. Long-term progression of the disease was seen in both treated 
and untreated eyes, casting doubt as to the effectiveness of this approach in 
late-stage CHM. Alternate approaches such as ASO may have a therapeutic effect 
in a subgroup of CHM patients."
137,"BACKGROUND: The seasonal and antigenic characteristics of influenza are crucial 
to help understanding influenza activity and inform vaccine recommendations.
METHODS: We employed a generalized linear model with harmonic terms to quantify 
the seasonal pattern of influenza in China during 2005-2017, including amplitude 
(circulatory intensity), semiannual periodicity (given two peaks a year), annual 
peak time, and epidemic duration. The antigenic differences were distinguished 
as antigenic similarity between 2009 and 2020. We categorized regions above 33° 
N, between 27° N and 33° N, and below 27° N as the north, central, and south 
regions, respectively.
RESULTS: We estimated that the amplitude in the north region (median: 0.019, 95% 
CI: 0.018-0.021) was significantly higher than that in the central (median: 
0.011, 95% CI: 0.01-0.012, p < 0.001) and south region (median: 0.008, 95% CI: 
0.007-0.008, p < 0.001) for A/H3N2. The A/H3N2 in the central region had a 
semiannual periodicity (median: 0.548, 95% CI: 0.517-0.577), while no semiannual 
pattern was found in other regions or subtypes/lineages. The antigenic 
similarity was low (below 50% in the 2009-10, 2014-15, 2016-18, and 2019-20 
seasons) for A/H3N2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study depicted the seasonal pattern differences and antigenic 
differences of influenza in China, which provides information for vaccination 
strategies."
138,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with 
multiple histopathological subtypes. FTD patients share similar symptoms with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, FTD patients are commonly misdiagnosed as AD, 
despite the consensus clinical diagnostic criteria. It is therefore of great 
clinical need to identify a biomarker that can distinguish FTD from AD and 
control individuals, and potentially further differentiate between FTD 
pathological subtypes. We conducted a metabolomic analysis on post-mortem human 
brain tissue from three regions: cerebellum, frontal cortex and occipital cortex 
from control, FTLD-TDP type A, type A-C9, type C and AD. Our results indicate 
that the brain subdivisions responsible for different functions show different 
metabolic patterns. We further explored the region-specific metabolic 
characteristics of different FTD subtypes and AD patients. Different FTD 
subtypes and AD share similar metabolic phenotypes in the cerebellum, but AD 
exhibited distinct metabolic patterns in the frontal and occipital regions 
compared to FTD. The identified brain region-specific metabolite biomarkers 
could provide a tool for distinguishing different FTD subtypes and AD and 
provide the first insights into the metabolic changes of FTLD-TDP type A, type 
A-C9, type C and AD in different regions of the brain. The importance of protein 
arginine methylation in neurodegenerative disease has come to light, so we 
investigated whether the arginine methylation level contributes to disease 
pathogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between 
arginine methylation and metabolic changes in FTD subtypes and AD that could be 
further explored, to study the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis."
139,"Multisensory integration plays an important role in animal cognition. Although 
many studies have focused on visual-auditory integration, studies on 
olfactory-auditory integration are rare. Here, we investigated neural activity 
patterns and odor decoding in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) under 
uni-sensory and multisensory stimuli in awake, head-fixed mice. Using specific 
retrograde tracing, we verified that the LEC receives direct excitatory inputs 
from the primary auditory cortex (AC) and the medial geniculate body (MGB). 
Strikingly, we found that mitral/tufted cells (M/Ts) in the olfactory bulb (OB) 
and neurons in the LEC respond to both olfactory and auditory stimuli. Sound 
decreased the neural responses evoked by odors in both the OB and LEC, for both 
excitatory and inhibitory responses. Interestingly, significant changes in odor 
decoding performance and modulation of odor-evoked local field potentials (LFPs) 
were observed only in the LEC. These data indicate that the LEC is a critical 
center for olfactory-auditory multisensory integration, with direct projections 
from both olfactory and auditory centers."
140,"Six new limonoids, named hainanxylogranolides A-F (1-6), together with nineteen 
known ones (7-25) were isolated from the seeds of a Hainan mangrove Xylocarpus 
granatum. The structures of the new compounds were established by extensive NMR 
spectroscopic data combined with the DFT and TDDFT calculated electronic 
circular dichroism spectra. Hainanxylogranolide A (1) is the aromatic B-ring 
limonoid containing a central pyridine ring and a C-17 substituted 
γ(21)-hydroxybutenolide moiety. Hainanxylogranolide B (2) belongs to the small 
group of mexicanolides containing a C3-O-C8 bridge, whereas hainanxylogranolides 
C and D (3 and 4) are mexicanolides comprising a C1-O-C8 bridge. Compounds 9 and 
25 posed obvious inhibition effect on the tube formation of HUVECs. There are 
only about 25% tube-like structures were observed at the concentration of 
40.0 μM of compound 25. The antiviral activities of the isolates against herpes 
simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus 
(SFTSV) were tested in vitro. Compound 23 exhibited moderate anti-SFTSV activity 
with the IC50 value of 29.58 ± 0.73 μM. This is the first report of 
anti-angiogenic effect and anti-SFTSV activity of limonoids from the genus 
Xylocarpus."
141,"Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease that results from the imbalance 
of homeostasis within the bone. Intra-bone homeostasis is dependent on a precise 
dynamic balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by 
mesenchymal lineage osteoblasts, which comprises a series of complex and highly 
standardized steps. Programmed cell death (PCD) (e.g., apoptosis, autophagy, 
ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis) is a cell death process that involves 
a cascade of gene expression events with tight structures. These events play a 
certain role in regulating bone metabolism by determining the fate of bone 
cells. Moreover, existing research has suggested that natural products derived 
from a wide variety of dietary components and medicinal plants modulate the PCDs 
based on different mechanisms, which show great potential for the prevention and 
treatment of osteoporosis, thus revealing the emergence of more acceptable 
complementary and alternative drugs with lower costs, fewer side effects and 
more long-term application. Accordingly, this review summarizes the common types 
of PCDs in the field of osteoporosis. Moreover, from the perspective of 
targeting PCDs, this review also discussed the roles of currently reported 
natural products in the treatment of osteoporosis and the involved mechanisms. 
Based on this, this review provides more insights into new molecular mechanisms 
of osteoporosis and provides a reference for developing more natural 
anti-osteoporosis drugs in the future."
142,"Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.), also known as the ""queen of fruits"", is a 
tropical fruit of the Clusiacea family. While native to Southeast Asian 
countries, such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India, and 
the Philippines, the fruit has gained popularity in the United States due to its 
health-promoting attributes. In traditional medicine, mangosteen has been used 
to treat a variety of illnesses, ranging from dysentery to wound healing. 
Mangosteen has been shown to exhibit numerous biological and pharmacological 
activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, 
antimalarial, antidiabetic, and anticancer properties. Disease-preventative and 
therapeutic properties of mangosteen have been ascribed to secondary metabolites 
called xanthones, present in several parts of the tree, including the pericarp, 
fruit rind, peel, stem bark, root bark, and leaf. Of the 68 mangosteen xanthones 
identified so far, the most widely-studied are α-mangostin and γ-mangostin. 
Emerging studies have found that mangosteen constituents and phytochemicals 
exert encouraging antineoplastic effects against a myriad of human malignancies. 
While there are a growing number of individual research papers on the anticancer 
properties of mangosteen, a complete and critical evaluation of published 
experimental findings has not been accomplished. Accordingly, the objective of 
this work is to present an in-depth analysis of the cancer preventive and 
anticancer potential of mangosteen constituents, with a special emphasis on the 
associated cellular and molecular mechanisms. Moreover, the bioavailability, 
pharmacokinetics, and safety of mangosteen-derived agents together with current 
challenges and future research avenues are also discussed."
143,"BACKGROUND: Patients with venous hypertension have significant morbidity and 
poor quality of life. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and congenital defects that 
led to chronic outflow blockage are frequent causes of venous hypertension. It 
is known that the venovenous bypass has been the standard method used in the 
treatment of chronic iliofemoral vein occlusions. Percutaneous recanalization 
has earlier been shown to be technically possible. With venoplasty and stenting, 
we used an aggressive endovascular strategy to treat the iliofemoral venous 
thrombotic occlusion.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of 
percutaneous venous stenting performed in our hospital for cases with chronic 
thrombotic venous outflow blockage of the iliofemoral vein segment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 2019 to April 2021, the medical records were 
reviewed for sixty-three patients diagnosed with symptomatic iliofemoral 
thrombotic occlusive disease and treated with venous stenting. The procedures' 
results were analyzed at Al-Azhar University Hospitals.
RESULTS: The medical records of 63 cases (44 women with a median age of 49.52 
years) with chronic outflow block of iliofemoral vein segment who were treated 
with endovascular venous stenting were reviewed retrospectively. Optimal success 
was obtained in 56 cases (88.9%). Twelve months primary, assisted primary, and 
secondary patency rates were 76.8%, 80.4%, and 87.5%, respectively, while it was 
73.2%, 80.4%, and 87.5%, respectively, after 2 years. The procedure-related 
complication rate was 6.3%. Puncture site hematoma was observed in 2 patients 
(3.2%). Early (30-days) stent thrombosis occurred in 2 patients (3.2%). Most 
importantly, there was no procedure-related mortality.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment with balloon angioplasty and stenting of 
chronic venous thrombotic occlusions is an effective and safe procedure 
associated with a high technical rate of success and excellent patency rates. 
Accordingly, it should be considered the first line in the treatment of 
symptomatic iliofemoral vein occlusion."
144,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the shared pathogenesis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 
and vascular dementia, there is little data on cognitive impairment in PAD 
patients. We hypothesized that cognitive impairment will be common and 
previously unrecognized.
METHODS: Cognitive impairment screening was prospectively performed for Veterans 
presenting to a single Veterans Affairs outpatient vascular surgery clinic from 
2020-2021 for PAD consultation or disease surveillance. Overall, 125 Veterans 
were screened. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score of <26 on the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) survey. A multivariable logistic regression 
assessed for independent risk factors for cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: Overall, 77 (61%) had cognitive impairment, 92% was previously 
unrecognized. Cognitive impairment was associated with increased age (74.4 vs. 
71.8 years, p=0.03), Black vs. White race (94% vs. 54%, p<0.01), hypertension 
(66% vs. 31%, p=0.01), prior stroke/TIA (79% vs. 58%, p=0.03), diabetes treated 
with insulin (79% vs. 58%, p=0.05), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
(80% vs. 57%, p=0.04). On multivariable analysis, risk factors for newly 
diagnosed cognitive impairment included age ≥ 70 years, diabetes treated with 
insulin, PTSD, and Black race.
CONCLUSIONS: Many Veterans with PAD have evidence of cognitive impairment and is 
overwhelmingly underdiagnosed. This study suggests cognitive impairment is an 
unrecognized issue in a VA population with PAD, requiring more study to 
determine cognitive impairment's impact on surgical outcomes, and how it can be 
mitigated and incorporated into clinical care."
145,"PURPOSE: To determine whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
angiopoeitin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoetin-2 (Ang-2), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 
(MMP-9) can be reliably collected and analyzed from infant tears to aid in the 
diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and enhance the ability to 
objectively monitor its clinical course.
METHODS: In this nonrandomized controlled investigation, tear and saliva samples 
collected from 20 premature infants during serial ophthalmic examination were 
analyzed using enzyme-linked immunoassay with results analyzed as a function of 
disease stage and need for treatment.
RESULTS: Tear volume was directly correlated with corrected gestational age (P < 
0.001). Tear VEGF levels from samples corresponding to stage 3 ROP were 47.9% 
lower (P = 0.006) than in samples corresponding to stage 0-1 and 49.1% lower (P 
= 0.01) than in samples corresponding to stage 2 ROP. There were no 
between-group differences after normalizing tear VEGF by saliva VEGF levels. 
Tear/saliva ratio for Ang-1 was 200% greater (P = 0.042) and tear/saliva ratio 
for Ang-2 was 165% greater (P = 0.035) in samples corresponding to stage 2 
versus stage 0-1 ROP disease. Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio was lower in samples from 
infants who developed stage 2 or worse ROP than in samples from infants who 
never developed worse than stage 1 ROP (P = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study cohort, cytokines involved in the pathophysiology of 
ROP could be reliably identified in and analyzed from infant tears, and showed 
variation with ROP severity."
146,"The clinical application of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) assay is 
challenging due to its long processing time. However, in 2020 a new automated 
instrument for veterinary ESR was released and validated. This study sought: (1) 
to refine the proposed reference range (reference interval, RI) for canine ESR; 
(2) to compare the ESR values of healthy and sick dogs; and (3) to correlate ESR 
with other inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, 
albumin:globulin ratio (A/G), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR); and also 
(4) to study ESR behavior across illnesses of varying durations. A prospective 
cohort study of 396 client-owned dogs (n=120 healthy and n=276 sick dogs) was 
conducted. Animals with a full clinical evaluation, complete hematobiochemical 
profile and a final diagnosis were included. ESR was performed according to 
manufacturer's instructions using the same 1mL K3-EDTA tube used for the 
complete blood count. The RI was established at 1-8mm/h in 14min. Sick dogs had 
a significantly faster ESR (median 10mm/h) than healthy dogs (median 1mm/h; 
P<0.0001). ESR was positively correlated with NLR (r = 0.36), CRP (r = 0.18) and 
fibrinogen (r = 0.56) and negatively correlated with A/G (r = -0.37). Dogs with 
an acute-on-chronic disease had the highest ESR values (median 17mm/h) compared 
with either acute (median 11mm/h; P < 0.001) or chronic diseases (median 7mm/h; 
P = 0.001). ESR was confirmed as a reliable canine inflammatory marker, 
positively correlating with the main inflammatory markers in dogs and 
significantly different between sick and healthy dogs. The ESR assay appears 
useful especially in dogs with an acute clinical presentation, with or without 
an underlying chronic condition."
147,"PR-957 [low molecular mass polypeptide (LMP)-7 selective inhibitor] regulates T 
helper (Th) cell differentiation and inflammatory response in multiple 
neurological diseases. Hence, this study aimed to explore the effect of PR-957 
on Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, therapeutic efficacy and its potential 
mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The LMP7 expressions in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells from thirty AD patients and thirty healthy controls (HC) were 
detected. PR-957 was added for the incubation of naive cluster of 
differentiation (CD)4+ T cells from AD patients, then SC79 [phosphorylated 
protein kinase B (pAKT) agonist] was added. LMP7, Th1 cells, and Th17 cells were 
upregulated, while Th2 cells were downregulated in AD patients compared to HC. 
Also, LMP7 was positively related to Th1 cells and Th17 cells, but it did not 
correlate with Th2 cells in AD patients. PR-957 treatment downregulated Th1 
cells, Th17 cells, and their secreted cytokines as well as phosphorylated 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pPI3K)/PI3K and pAKT/AKT expressions in AD CD4+ T 
cells. SC79 addition upregulated pAKT/AKT expression, Th1 cells, and Th17 cells, 
while downregulated Th2 cells; also SC79 could alleviate the effect of PR-957 on 
regulating PI3K/AKT pathway and Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell differentiation in AD 
CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, PR-957 attenuated cognitive impairment and 
neurofibrillary tangle; also it inhibited Th17 cell differentiation and PI3K/AKT 
pathway in the brain and spleen of AD mice. In conclusion, PR-957 suppresses Th1 
and Th17 cell differentiation, attenuates neural injury and improves cognitive 
function via inactivating PI3K/AKT pathway in AD."
148,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although there have been multiple drugs tested in 
gastroparesis, their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We evaluated this 
in a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: We searched the literature to 7th September 2022. We judged drugs' 
efficacy based on global symptoms of gastroparesis, individual symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, or fullness, and safety 
according to total adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal. We 
extracted data as intention-to-treat analyses, assuming dropouts to be treatment 
failures and reporting pooled relative risks (RRs) of not improving with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs), ranking drugs according to P-score.
RESULTS: We identified 29 RCTs (3772 patients). Based on global symptoms, 
clebopride ranked first for efficacy (RR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.16-0.57, P-score 0.99) 
followed by domperidone (RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.48-0.98, P-score 0.76). No other 
drug was superior to placebo. Only two drug classes were efficacious: in rank 
order, oral dopamine antagonists (RR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.44-0.77, P-score 0.96) and 
tachykinin-1 antagonists (RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.52-0.93, P-score 0.83). For 
individual symptoms, oral metoclopramide ranked first for nausea (RR 0.46; 95% 
CI 0.21-1.00, P-score 0.95), fullness (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.35-1.28, P-score 0.86), 
and bloating (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.30-0.93, P-score 0.97), based on only one small 
trial. Only prucalopride was more likely to be associated with adverse events 
than placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: In a network meta-analysis, oral dopamine antagonists and 
tachkinin-1 antagonists were more efficacious than placebo for gastroparesis, 
but confidence in the evidence was low to moderate for most comparisons. There 
is an unmet need for efficacious therapies for gastroparesis."
149,"OBJECTIVES: The potential of rideshare services to facilitate timely radiation 
therapy (RT), especially for resource-limited patients, is understudied.
METHODS: Patients (N=63) who received 73 courses of RT (1,513 fractions) and 
utilized free hospital-provided rideshare service (537 rides) were included in 
this retrospective study. A multi-dimensional analysis was conducted including a 
comparison of demographic, disease characteristics, and treatment completion 
data; a revenue analysis to evaluate the financial impact of rideshare services; 
and a geospatial analysis to evaluate community-level characteristics of 
patients.
RESULTS: Median age was 59; the majority was female (56%), self-identified as 
Black or African American (56%), not working (91%), not partnered (83%), high 
school educated or less (78%), and insured with Medicaid (51%). Geospatial 
analysis reveals that patients lived in communities with significantly higher 
rates of resource deprivation. Median rideshare distance was 6.4 miles (IQR 
3.4-11.2) with a median cost of $13.04 per rideshare (IQR 9-19). Of the 
rideshare-facilitated treatments, 100% were completed, with an overall course 
completion rate of 97.3% compared to 85.4% for those who did not use rideshare 
(p=0.001); 2 patients discontinued RT for reasons unrelated to transportation. 
High rideshare utilization (N=32), defined as utilization ≥ 45% of the treatment 
course, was associated with significantly shorter treatment courses and lower 
radiation doses compared to low rideshare utilization (p=0.04). Total rideshare 
cost for high utilizers/whole cohort was $11,589/$16,895, facilitating an 
estimated revenue of $401,952/$1,175,119.
CONCLUSIONS: Free hospital-provided rideshare service is economically feasible 
and associated with high RT completion rates. It may help enhance quality 
radiation care for those who come from resource-limited communities."
150,"OBJECTIVE: Lipohypertrophy (LH) is a common complication of insulin therapy in 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). We examined whether an intervention consisting 
of LH assessment and retraining on insulin infusion set (IIS) use improves 
glycemic control in T1DM patients on subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).
METHODS: The intervention was conducted in 79 consecutive T1DM patients. Data on 
glucose levels, HbA1c and insulin doses were collected at baseline and after a 
median 22 weeks (20-31.75).
RESULTS: Forty-six T1DM patients [23 (50%) women] participating in the follow-up 
were characterized by a median age of 29 years (25-33.8), BMI 24.6±3.3 kg/m2, 
T1DM duration 16.5 years (8.3-20) and CSII duration of 7 years (4-10.8). 
Patients' median HbA1c fell from 7.4% (6.7-8.2) to 7.05% (6.4-7.6) (p<0.001), 
daily insulin dose/kg decreased (0.7±0.20 vs. 0.68±0.15 IU/kg, p=0.017) together 
with the total daily insulin dose [50.3 (40.5-62.7) vs. 47.6 (39.8-62.1) IU, 
p=0.019]. Furthermore, percentage of basal insulin dose increased [43.0 (36-50) 
vs. 44.0 (39.0-50.0)%, p=0.010], while the percentage of bolus dose decreased 
[57 (50-64) vs. 56 (50-61)%, p=0.010].
CONCLUSIONS: The structured intervention related to LH in T1DM patients on 
insulin pumps resulted in better glycemic control, along with a decrease in 
total daily insulin dose."
151,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is great current interest in the potential application 
of DNA methylation alterations in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) as 
biomarkers of susceptibility, progression and treatment response in inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD). However, the intra-individual stability of PBL methylation 
in IBD has not been characterised. Here, we studied the long-term stability of 
all probes located on the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip array.
METHODS: We followed a cohort of 46 adult IBD patients (36 Crohn's disease (CD), 
10 ulcerative colitis (UC), median age 44 (IQR: 27-56), 50% female) that 
received standard care follow-up at the Amsterdam UMC. Paired PBL samples were 
collected at two time points with a median 7 (range: 2-9) years in between. 
Differential methylation and intra-class correlation (ICC) analyses were used to 
identify time-associated differences and temporally stable CpGs, respectively.
RESULTS: Around 60% of all EPIC array loci presented poor intra-individual 
stability (ICC <0.50); 78.114 (≈9%) showed good (ICC 0.75 - 0.89); and 41.274 
(≈5%) excellent (ICC ≥0.90) stability, between both measured time points. 
Focusing on previously identified consistently differentially methylated 
positions indicated that 22 CD-, 11 UC-, and 24 IBD-associated loci demonstrated 
high stability (ICC ≥0.75) over time; of these, we observed a marked stability 
of CpG loci associated to the HLA genes.
CONCLUSION: Our data provide insight into the long-term stability of the PBL DNA 
methylome within an IBD context, facilitating the selection of biologically 
relevant and robust IBD-associated epigenetic biomarkers with increased 
potential for independent validation. These data also have potential 
implications in understanding disease pathogenesis."
152,"BACKGROUND &AIMS: Liver macrophage-mediated inflammation contributes to the 
pathogenesis of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH). Odd skipped-related 1 (Osr1) is a putative transcription 
factor previously reported to be involved in NASH progression; however, the 
underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The current study focused on the role of 
Osr1 in macrophage polarization and metabolism and its associated functions in 
the inflammation-induced pathogenesis of NASH.
METHODS: OSR1/Osr1 expression patterns were compared in normal and NASH patients 
and mouse livers. NASH was established and compared between hepatocyte-specific 
Osr1 knockout (Osr1ΔHep), macrophage-specific Osr1 knockout (Osr1ΔMφ), and 
wild-type (Osr1F) mice fed with three different chronic obesogenic diets and 
methionine choline-deficient diet. Using genetic and therapeutic strategies in 
vitro and in vivo, the downstream targets of Osr1 and the associated mechanisms 
in inflammation-induced NASH were established.
RESULTS: Osr1 was expressed in both hepatocytes and macrophages and exhibited 
different expression patterns in NASH. In NAFLD and NASH murine models, deleting 
Osr1 in myeloid cells (Osr1ΔMφ), but not hepatocytes, aggravated steatohepatitis 
with pronounced liver inflammation. Myeloid Osr1 deletion resulted in a 
polarization switch toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype associated with reduced 
oxidative phosphorylation activity. These inflamed Osr1ΔMφ macrophages promoted 
steatosis and inflammation in hepatocytes via cytokine secretion. We identified 
two downstream transcriptional targets of Osr1, c-Myc, and PPARγ and established 
the Osr1-PPARγ cascade in macrophage polarization and liver inflammation by 
genetic study and rosiglitazone treatment in vivo. We tested a promising 
intervention strategy targeting Osr1-PPARγ by AAV8L-delivered Osr1 expression or 
rosiglitazone that significantly repressed NAFLD/NASH progression in Osr1F and 
Osr1ΔMφ mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid Osr1 mediates liver immune homeostasis, and disrupting Osr1 
aggravates the progression of NAFLD/NASH."
153,"BACKGROUND: An unmet clinical need exists in the management of 
treatment-refractory allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Omalizumab 
has shown promising effects in case series and cohort studies; however, evidence 
to support its routine clinical use is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate 
the clinical effectiveness and safety of omalizumab in patients with ABPA.
METHODS: A systematic search across standard databases was conducted using 
specific keywords until May 13, 2021. A meta-analysis was performed to compare 
the effectiveness (exacerbations, oral corticosteroid [OCS] use, lung function, 
patient-reported asthma control) and safety of pre- and post- omalizumab 
treatment. Subgroup analyses were performed for treatment duration and 
underlying disease.
RESULTS: In total, 49 studies (n=267) were included in the qualitative synthesis 
and 14 case series (n=186) in the quantitative meta-analysis. Omalizumab 
treatment significantly reduced the annualized exacerbation rate versus 
pre-treatment (mean difference [MD]: -2.09 [-3.07; -1.11], P<0.01). There was a 
reduction in the OCS use (risk difference [RD]: 0.65 [0.46;0.84], P<0.01), an 
increase in termination of OCS use (RD: 0.53 [0.24;0.82], P<0.01), and a 
reduction in OCS dose (mg/day) (MD: -14.62 [-19.86; -9.39]; P<0.01) in ABPA 
patients receiving omalizumab. Omalizumab improved forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV1) % predicted by 11.9% (8.2; 15.6, P<0.01) and asthma control, and 
was well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: Omalizumab treatment reduced exacerbations and OCS use and improved 
lung function and asthma control in patients with ABPA and was well tolerated. 
The results highlight the potential role of omalizumab in the treatment of ABPA."
154,"The assessment and management of asthma patients is challenging because of the 
complexity of the underlying inflammatory mechanisms and heterogeneity of their 
clinical presentation. Optimizing disease management requires therapy 
individualization that should rely on reliable biomarkers to unravel the 
phenotypes and endotypes of asthma. The secretory activity and turnover of 
eosinophils, as assessed by measuring eosinophil-derived proteins, may provide 
an accurate and complementary tool that mirrors the eosinophil activation 
status. Emerging evidence suggests that eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) has 
considerable potential as a precision medicine biomarker. In this review, we 
explore EDN suitability as biomarker in asthma management, with particular 
emphasis on its clinical significance in the management of both pediatric and 
adult populations."
155,"BACKGROUND: A few studies have explored the association between short sleep 
duration and worse asthma outcomes in patients with self-reported asthma; 
however, all of them were cross-sectional.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between self-reported sleep duration 
and asthma-related clinical and inflammatory characteristics and whether sleep 
duration is associated with asthma exacerbations (AEs) in the following year.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study consecutively recruited participants with 
asthma, who were classified into short (n=58), normal (n=380), and long (n=84) 
sleep duration groups. We investigated the clinical and inflammatory 
characteristics and exacerbations within a 1-year follow-up period.
RESULTS: Patients with short sleep duration were older and had significantly 
lower total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) 
levels and higher airway inflammation, characterized by increased levels of 
interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in sputum, than patients with normal 
sleep duration. Furthermore, they had a significantly increased risk of poorly 
controlled asthma (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 2.741, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = [1.379 - 5.447], P = 0.004) and moderate-to-severe AEs (adjusted 
incidence rate ratio [IRRadj] = 1.798, 95% CI = [1.098 - 2.942], P = 0.020).
CONCLUSIONS: Short sleep duration was associated with non-type 2 inflammation 
and is an independent risk factor for future AEs. Therefore, as a potentially 
treatable trait, sleep duration may have clinical implications for asthma 
management."
156,"Monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain (LC) crystalline inclusions within 
podocytes is a rare, poorly characterized entity. To provide more insight, we 
now present the first clinicopathologic series of LC crystalline podocytopathy 
(LCCP) encompassing 25 patients (68% male, median age 56 years). Most (80%) 
patients presented with proteinuria and chronic kidney disease, with nephrotic 
syndrome in 28%. Crystalline keratopathy and Fanconi syndrome were present in 
22% and 10%, respectively. The hematologic condition was monoclonal gammopathy 
of renal significance (MGRS) in 55% and multiple myeloma in 45%. The serum 
monoclonal immunoglobulin was IgG κappa in 86%. Histologically, 60% exhibited 
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), often collapsing. Ultrastructurally, 
podocyte LC crystals were numerous with variable effacement of foot processes. 
Crystals were also present in proximal tubular cells as light chain proximal 
tubulopathy (LCPT) in 80% and in interstitial histiocytes in 36%. Significantly, 
frozen-section immunofluorescence failed to reveal the LC composition of 
crystals in 88%, requiring paraffin-immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, 
with identification of kappa LC in 87%. The LC variable gene segment, determined 
by mass spectrometry of glomeruli or bone marrow plasma cell sequencing, was 
IGKV1-33 in four and IGKV3-20 in one. Among 21 patients who received anti-plasma 
cell-directed chemotherapy, 50% achieved a kidney response, which depended on a 
deep hematologic response. After a median follow-up of 36 months, 26% progressed 
to kidney failure and 17% died. The mean kidney failure-free survival was 57.6 
months and was worse in those with FSGS. In sum, LCCP is rare, mostly associates 
with IgG κappa MGRS, and frequently has concurrent LCPT, although Fanconi 
syndrome is uncommon. Thus, paraffin-immunofluorescence and electron microscopy 
are essential to prevent misdiagnosis as primary FSGS since kidney survival 
depends on early diagnosis and subsequent clone-directed therapy."
157,"The aberrant expression of ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) is believed 
related to tumor progression. However, few studies have reported the biological 
function and clinical importance of USP11 in kidney fibrosis. Here, we 
demonstrated USP11 was highly upregulated in the kidneys from patients with 
chronic kidney disease and correlated positively with fibrotic lesion but 
negatively with kidney function. Conditional USP11 deletion or pharmacologic 
inhibition with Mitoxantrone attenuated pathological lesions and improved kidney 
function in both hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN)- and folic acid (FA)-induced 
mouse models of kidney fibrosis. Mechanistically, by RNA sequencing, USP11 was 
found to be involved in nuclear gene transcription of the epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR). USP11 co-immunoprecipitated and co-stained with 
extra-nuclear EGFR, and deubiquitinated and protected EGFR from 
proteasome-dependent degradation. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of USP11 
facilitated EGFR degradation and abated augmentation of TGF-β1 and downstream 
signaling. This consequently alleviated the partial epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition, G2/M arrest and aberrant secretome of profibrogenic and 
proinflammatory factors in uric acid-stimulated tubular epithelial cells. 
Moreover, USP11 deletion had anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory kidney effects 
in the murine HN and FA models. Thus, our study provides evidence supporting 
USP11 as a promising target for minimizing kidney fibrosis and that inhibition 
of USP11 has potential to be an effective strategy for patients with chronic 
kidney disease."
158,"BACKGROUND: Transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) allows for maintenance of 
ambulatory function in patients with significant forefoot tissue loss. Effective 
revascularization is key to optimizing limb salvage in patients with chronic 
limb threatening ischemia (CLTI). We hypothesize that CLTI patients requiring 
TMA have better healing and functional outcomes with open bypass (OPEN) compared 
with endovascular (ENDO) revascularization.
METHODS: Consecutive TMAs performed at three affiliated centers between 2008 and 
2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline characteristics including WIfI 
stage, non-invasive vascular studies, healing, and ambulatory outcomes were 
collected. Catheter-based angiographic images were evaluated using the GLASS 
system. Primary outcomes were TMA healing and community ambulation, with 
secondary outcomes of TMA healed at end of study, any ambulatory function 
postoperatively, major amputation, and mortality. Descriptive statistics, 
univariate, multivariable, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed.
RESULTS: 346 TMAs were performed in 318 patients, 209 of whom had peripheral 
artery disease (PAD). Median follow up was 2. 5 years. Patients with PAD had 
significantly lower rates of healing compared to those without (64% vs. 77%, 
p=0.007). Revascularization was performed in 185 limbs with 102 treated ENDO and 
83 OPEN. Patients who underwent ENDO were significantly less likely to heal 
their TMA at any time (55% vs. 76%, p=0.003) and less likely to remain healed at 
the end of study (49% vs 66%, p=0.02). Patients with GLASS stage 3 anatomy were 
significantly more likely to heal with OPEN (75% vs 45%, p=0.003). Long term 
ambulation data was available for 72% of revascularized patients. ENDO was 
associated with lower likelihood of community ambulation after TMA (34% vs 57%, 
p=0.002). In multivariable analysis, OPEN was significantly associated with TMA 
healing (OR 2.8, p=0.007) and ambulation (OR 2.9, p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: In patients with CLTI and significant tissue loss requiring TMA, 
initial OPEN approach to revascularization was associated with improved healing 
and higher rates of ambulation than ENDO. The metabolic requirement to heal a 
TMA in CLTI patients may be better met by open revascularization."
159,"OBJECTIVE: Recent reports suggest that the number of radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA) cycles impacts the depth of vein wall damage. This study evaluates the 
mid-term occlusion rate after delivering increased energy during RFA of 
incompetent saphenous veins.
METHODS: Between 2016 and 2019, consecutive patients who underwent RFA with 
multiple heat cycles (MHCs) were enrolled in the study. The exclusion criterion 
was previous treatment history for chronic venous disease. Duplex ultrasound 
data and medical records were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: This study enrolled 217 patients (345 veins). Follow-up examinations 
were performed for 65% of treated veins after six months, 31% after 12 months, 
and 26% after more than 24 months with a mean follow-up period of 23 ± 18.9 
months. The numbers of great saphenous and small saphenous veins were 178 and 
62, respectively. According to the method of Kaplan and Meier, the occlusion 
rate of saphenous veins was 100% at three years and 95.4% at five years. Except 
for one case (0.3%) of endovenous heat-induced thrombosis class 2, no 
significant side effects were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of RFA with MHCs for incompetent saphenous veins 
exhibits good clinical outcomes considering mid-term occlusion rate without an 
increase in side effects."
160,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the current level of chronic venous 
disease (CVD) awareness and its relevant influencing factors.
METHODS: Online and interview surveys were conducted in two distinct groups from 
May 14 to June 16, 2020. An online survey was conducted among 900 adults aged 
20-64 years from the research database, while interviews were conducted among 
124 patients who presented with CVD symptoms, which covered awareness of such 
symptoms and their impact on quality of life (QoL).
RESULTS: Most respondents reported low levels of CVD awareness by recognizing 
the disease only by an entity. In 53 respondents who visited the hospital with 
suspected venous symptoms, the actual diagnosis was made in only 30.2%. CVD 
diagnosis was associated with increased CVD awareness. Female sex, age of >29 
years, higher educational level, and higher income were associated with 
increased CVD awareness. Approximately 60% of the patients with CVD responded 
that physical symptoms had a negative impact on their QoL rather than emotion or 
appearance.
CONCLUSIONS: The public is largely unaware of CVD but not in detail. Educational 
programs to improve CVD awareness should be implemented to enable appropriate 
CVD management."

162,"The discovery of new target antigens in membranous nephropathy (MN) has revealed 
new disease phenotypes and, in some cases, has suggested mechanisms of disease 
shared by two concurrent autoimmune diseases. Subject of Review: Several recent 
reports and an accompanying editorial describe the association of 
anti-contactin-1 (CNTN1) autoantibodies of the IgG4 subclass with a novel 
subtype of MN that co-occurs with a form of chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy caused by anti-CNTN1 antibodies. CNTN1, the cellular 
source of which is still undetermined, is identified as the target antigen in 
the kidney since it is present within glomerular subepithelial deposits and 
anti-CNTN1 IgG4 antibodies can be eluted from the corresponding kidney biopsy 
tissue. Second Opinion: These new reports reinforce recent findings that many 
proteins targeted in several other types of primary and secondary MN are 
proteins whose expression is shared by podocytes and neurons. While 
complement-mediated podocyte damage represents a well-established paradigm in 
the pathogenesis of MN, interference with the normal functions of these shared 
proteins by autoantibodies should be considered as another potential mechanism 
of glomerular injury to be explored in future research."
163,"BACKGROUND: Alterations of renal hemodynamics play an essential role in renal 
homeostasis and kidney diseases. Recent data indicated that semaphorin 3C 
(SEMA3C), a secreted glycoprotein involved in vessel development, can modulate 
renal vascular permeability in acute kidney injury, but whether and how it might 
impact systemic and renal hemodynamics is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to explore the effect of SEMA3C on 
systemic and renal hemodynamics.
METHODS: SEMA3C recombinant protein was administered intravenously in 
two-month-old wild-type mice, and the variations of mean arterial pressure, 
heart rate, renal blood flow, and renal vascular resistance were measured and 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Acute administration of SEMA3C induced (i) systemic hemodynamic 
changes, including mean arterial pressure decrease and heart rate augmentation; 
(ii) renal hemodynamic changes, including reduced vascular resistance and 
elevated renal blood flow. Continuous perfusion of SEMA3C had no significant 
effect on systemic or renal hemodynamics.
CONCLUSION: SEMA3C is a potent vasodilator affecting both systemic and renal 
hemodynamics in mice."
164,"INTRODUCTION: The secretion of saliva, which is triggered by acid reflux into 
the esophagus via the esophagosalivary reflex, plays a crucial role in the 
defensive mechanisms of the esophagus. The volume of saliva secreted in patients 
with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is reduced. However, the effects of 
proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on the secretion of saliva have rarely been 
reported. Therefore, the present study investigated changes in the volume and pH 
of saliva after the cessation of PPI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of consecutive 
patients previously diagnosed with mild reflux esophagitis (RE) or non-erosive 
reflux disease (NERD) controlled with PPI (including vonoprazan) who performed 
the salivary secretion test before and after a 2-week cessation of PPI. The 
volume, pH, and pH after acid loading (buffering capacity) of saliva were 
compared before and after the cessation of PPI.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (25 NERD, 7 mild RE) were included. The second 
saliva test was performed a median interval of 14 months [12.0-15.3] after the 
first test. No significant differences were observed in the volume of saliva 
secreted before and after the cessation of PPI (before 4.0 mL [2.7-6.0] vs. 
after 4.0 mL [2.3-5.9], p = 0.894). No significant differences were noted in pH 
or changes in pH after acid loading before and after the cessation of PPI (pH: 
before 7.1 ± 0.24 vs. after 7.0 ± 0.24, p = 0.1. Delta pH after acid loading: 
before 1.0 [0.8-1.2] vs. after 1.0 [0.8-1.2], p = 0.844).
CONCLUSION: The cessation of PPI did not appear to affect the volume, pH, or 
buffering capacity of saliva in patients with PPI-responsive mild RE and NERD."
165,"Racial disparities in cancer care and outcomes have been well documented in 
various malignancies, with Black patients having the highest death rate and 
shortest survival of any racial/ethnic group in the United States (US) for most 
cancers. However, there have been limited studies on racial/ethnic disparities 
in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Our study characterized and compared 
differences in baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, socioeconomic 
factors, and overall survival (OS) between Black and White patients with MDS in 
the US. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program 
and included 37,562 patients (Black, 8.1 %; White, 91.9 %) diagnosed between 
2001 and 2013. We observed significant differences in baseline characteristics 
between cohorts. In a univariate analysis, Black race was associated with longer 
survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.83; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.86; 
p < 0.001). The association between race and survival was attenuated but 
remained significant in various models to adjust for differences in baseline 
characteristics (HR in multivariable analysis, 0.92; 95 % CI, 0.87-0.96); 
p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis by histology revealed differences in the 
association between race and OS. Refractory anemia (RA), RA with ring 
sideroblasts, and MDS-not otherwise specified, a category in SEER representing a 
poorly defined MDS subset for 52 % of cases in our study, favored Black 
patients. RA with excess blasts favored White patients. The overall finding that 
Black race is associated with better OS outcomes, when compared with White 
patients, needs to be interpreted with caution and nuanced by histology. 
Additional research to explore these associations is warranted."
166,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors are a mainstay of treatment for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients after failed responses to conventional 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Despite the clinical efficacy of 
TNFα inhibitors (TNFi), many RA patients experience TNFi treatment failure due 
to the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) that can neutralize drug 
levels and lead to RA disease relapse. Methotrexate (MTX) therapy with 
concomitant TNFα inhibitors decreases the risk of TNFi immunogenicity, but 
additional and/or alternative strategies are needed to reduce MTX-associated 
toxicities and to further increase its potency for preventing TNFα inhibitor 
immunogenicity. In this review, we highlight the limitations of MTX for 
mitigating TNFα inhibitor immunogenicity, and we discuss potential alternative 
pharmacological targets for decreasing the risk of immunogenicity during TNFα 
inhibitor therapy based on the key kinases, second messengers, and shared 
signaling mechanisms of lymphocyte receptor signaling."
167,"OBJECTIVE: Joubert syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a distinctive 
hindbrain malformation called molar tooth sign, causing motor and cognitive 
impairments. More than 40 genes have been associated with Joubert syndrome. We 
aim to describe a group of Joubert syndrome patients clinically and genetically 
emphasizing organ involvement.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical information and molecular 
diagnosis data of 22 patients with Joubert syndrome from multiple facilities. 
Clinical exome or whole-exome sequencing were performed to identify causal 
variations in genes.
RESULTS: The most common variants were in the CPLANE1, CEP290, and TMEM67 genes, 
and other causative genes were AHI1, ARMC9, CEP41, CSPP1, HYLS1, KATNIP, 
KIAA0586, KIF7, RPGRIP1L, including some previously unreported variants in these 
genes. Multi-systemic organ involvement was observed in nine (40%) patients, 
with the eye being the most common, including Leber's congenital amaurosis, 
ptosis, and optic nerve coloboma. Portal hypertension and esophageal varices as 
liver and polycystic kidney disease and nephronophthisis as kidney involvement 
was encountered in our patients. The HYLS1 gene, which commonly causes 
hydrolethalus syndrome 1, was also associated with Joubert syndrome in one of 
our patients. A mild phenotype with hypophyseal hormone deficiencies without the 
classical molar tooth sign was observed with compound heterozygous and likely 
pathogenic variants not reported before in the KATNIP gene.
CONCLUSION: Some rare variants that display prominent genetic heterogeneity with 
variable severity are first reported in our patients. In our study of 22 Joubert 
syndrome patients, CPLANE1 is the most affected gene, and Joubert syndrome as a 
ciliopathy is possible without a classical molar tooth sign, like in the KATNIP 
gene-affected patients."

169,"OBJECTIVE: Manual disease delineation in full-body imaging of patients with 
multiple metastases is often impractical due to high disease burden. However, 
this is a clinically relevant task as quantitative image techniques assessing 
individual metastases, while limited, have been shown to be predictive of 
treatment outcome. The goal of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of deep 
learning-based methods for full-body delineation of skeletal metastases and to 
compare their performance to existing methods in terms of disease delineation 
accuracy and prognostic power.
APPROACH: 1833 suspicious lesions on 37 18F-NaF PET/CT scans of patients with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were contoured and 
classified as malignant, equivocal, or benign by a nuclear medicine physician. 
Two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (DeepMedic and nnUNet) were 
trained to delineate malignant disease regions with and without three-model 
ensembling. Malignant disease contours using previously established methods were 
obtained. The performance of each method was assessed in terms of four different 
tasks: (1) detection, (2) segmentation, (3) PET SUV metric correlations with 
physician-based data, and (4) predictive power of progression-free survival.
MAIN RESULTS: The nnUnet three-model ensemble achieved superior detection 
performance with a mean (± standard deviation) sensitivity of 82.9±0.1% at the 
selected operating point. The nnUnet single and three-model ensemble achieved 
comparable segmentation performance with a mean Dice coefficient of 0.80±0.12 
and 0.79±0.12, respectively, both outperforming other methods. The nnUNet 
ensemble achieved comparable or superior SUV metric correlation performance to 
gold-standard data. Despite superior disease delineation performance, the nnUNet 
methods did not display superior predictive power over other methods.
SIGNIFICANCE: This work showed that CNN-based (nnUNet) methods are superior to 
the non-CNN methods for mCRPC disease delineation in full-body 18F-NaF PET/CT. 
The CNN-based methods, however, do not hold greater prognostic power for 
predicting clinical outcome. This merits more investigation on the optimal 
selection of delineation methods for specific clinical tasks."
170,"Type 2B von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder in which 
a subset of point mutations in the von Willebrand factor (VWF) A1 domain and 
recently identified autoinhibitory module (AIM) cause spontaneous binding to 
glycoprotein (GP)Ibα on the platelet surface. All reported type 2B VWD mutations 
share this enhanced binding; however, type 2B VWD manifests as variable bleeding 
complications and platelet levels in patients depending on the underlying 
mutation. Understanding how these mutations localizing to a similar region can 
result in such disparate patient outcomes is essential for detailing our 
understanding of VWF regulatory and activation mechanisms. In this study, we 
produced recombinant glycosylated AIM-A1 fragments bearing type 2B VWD mutations 
and examined how each mutation impacts the A1 domain's thermodynamic stability, 
conformational dynamics, and biomechanical regulation of the AIM. We found that 
the A1 domain with mutations associated with severe bleeding occupy a higher 
affinity state correlating to enhanced flexibility in the secondary GPIbα 
binding sites. Conversely, mutation P1266L, associated with normal platelet 
levels, has similar proportions of high-affinity molecules to wildtype, but 
shares regions of solvent accessibility with both wildtype and other type 2B VWD 
mutations. V1316M exhibited exceptional instability and solvent exposure 
compared to all variants. Lastly, examination of the mechanical stability of 
each variant revealed variable AIM unfolding. Together, these studies illustrate 
that the heterogeneity among type 2B VWD mutations is evident in AIM-A1 
fragments."
171,"Expansions of ATTTT and ATTTC pentanucleotide repeats in the human genome are 
recently found to be associated with at least seven neurodegenerative diseases, 
including spinocerebellar ataxia type 37 (SCA37) and familial adult myoclonic 
epilepsy (FAME) types 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. The formation of non-B DNA 
structures during some biological processes is thought as a causative factor for 
repeat expansions. Yet, the structural basis for these pyrimidine-rich ATTTT and 
ATTTC repeat expansions remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the 
solution structures of ATTTT and ATTTC repeats using nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy. Here, we reveal that ATTTT and ATTTC repeats can form a highly 
compact minidumbbell structure at the 5'-end using their first two repeats. The 
high-resolution structure of two ATTTT repeats was determined, showing a regular 
TTTTA pentaloop and a quasi TTTT/A pentaloop. Furthermore, the minidumbbell 
structure could escape from proofreading by the Klenow fragment of DNA 
polymerase I when it was located at five or more base pairs away from the 
priming site, leading to a small-scale repeat expansion. Results of this work 
improve our understanding of ATTTT and ATTTC repeat expansions in SCA37 and 
FAMEs, and provide high-resolution structural information for rational drug 
design."
172,"Immunotherapy using antibodies to target the aggregation of flexible proteins 
holds promise for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases caused 
by protein misfolding. Prions or PrPSc, the causal agents of transmissible 
spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), represent a model target for immunotherapies 
as TSE are prototypical protein misfolding diseases. The X-ray crystal structure 
of the wild-type (WT) human prion protein (HuPrP) bound to a camelid antibody 
fragment, denoted as Nanobody 484 (Nb484), has been previously solved. Nb484 was 
found to inhibit prion aggregation in vitro through a unique mechanism of 
structural stabilization of two disordered epitopes, that is, the palindromic 
motif (residues 113-120) and the β2-α2 loop region (residues 164-185). The study 
of the structural basis for antibody recognition of flexible proteins requires 
appropriate sampling techniques for the identification of conformational states 
occurring in disordered epitopes. To elucidate the Nb484-HuPrP recognition 
mechanisms, here we applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations complemented 
with available NMR and X-ray crystallography data collected on the WT HuPrP to 
describe the conformational spaces occurring on HuPrP prior to Nb484 binding. We 
observe the experimentally determined binding competent conformations within the 
ensembles of pre-existing conformational states in solution before binding. We 
also described the Nb484 recognition mechanisms in two HuPrP carrying a 
polymorphism (E219K) and a TSE-causing mutation (V210I). Our hybrid approaches 
allow the identification of dynamic conformational landscapes existing on HuPrP 
and highly characterized by molecular disorder to identify physiologically 
relevant and druggable transitions."
173,"Among diverse protein post-translational modifications, O-GlcNAcylation, a 
simple but essential monosaccharide modification, plays crucial roles in 
cellular processes and is closely related to various diseases. Despite its 
ubiquity in cells, properties of low stoichiometry and reversibility are hard 
nuts to crack in system-wide research of O-GlcNAc. Herein, we developed a novel 
method employing multi-comparative thermal proteome profiling for O-GlcNAc 
transferase (OGT) substrate discovery. Melting curves of proteins under 
different treatments were profiled and compared with high reproducibility and 
consistency. Consequently, proteins with significantly shifted stabilities

from which new O-GlcNAcylated proteins were uncovered."
174,"Sample preparation is the rate-limiting step in liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS-based clinical analysis when target analytes possess 
significantly different properties. Repeated solid-phase extraction (SPE) 
processes are typically required, resulting in low throughput and excessive 
consumption of labor, materials, and samples. In this study, we developed and 
validated a feasible and productive method to enrich target analytes with 
different properties during a single operation, while sufficiently removing 
matrix interferences to meet LC-MS/MS requirements. Gastrin determination was 
selected as the subject of this study. An automated magnetic-bead-assisted 
sequential extraction (MBASE) workflow was developed to simultaneously isolate 
nonsulfated gastrin-17 (G17ns), sulfated gastrin-17 (G17s), nonsulfated 
gastrin-34 (G34ns), and sulfated gastrin-34 (G34s) from human serum. It performs 
two different ion-exchange-based magnetic-bead extraction steps on one sample 
aliquot to produce one combined extract for LC-MS/MS analysis. When compared 
with the traditional SPE process, the MBASE workflow saves over 75% time and 
labor expenses as well as over 90% material cost, while providing even higher 
extraction efficiency. The MBASE LC-MS/MS method was validated as accurate and 
robust. Clinical sample test results demonstrated that the conventional 
chemiluminescence immunoassay method significantly under-estimated total 
gastrins in human serum, and the MBASE LC-MS/MS method could serve as an ideal 
tool to provide a comprehensive and accurate gastrin profile."
175,"Background: Active and recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are 
associated with morbidity and mortality after surgery in adults. Current 
recommendations suggest delaying elective surgery in survivors for four to 12 
weeks, depending on initial illness severity. Recently, the predominant causes 
of COVID-19 are the highly transmissible/less virulent Omicron 
variant/subvariants. Moreover, increased survivability of primary infections has 
engendered the long-COVID syndrome, with protean manifestations that may persist 
for months. Considering the more than 600,000,000 COVID-19 survivors, surgeons 
will likely be consulted by recovered patients seeking elective operations. 
Knowledge gaps of the aftermath of Omicron infections raise questions whether 
extant guidance for timing of surgery still applies to adults or should apply to 
the pediatric population. Methods: Scoping review of relevant English-language 
literature. Results: Most supporting data derive from early in the pandemic when 
the Alpha variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2) predominated. The Omicron variant/subvariants generally cause 
milder infections with less organ dysfunction; many infections are asymptomatic, 
especially in children. Data are scant with respect to adult surgical outcomes 
after Omicron infection, and especially so for pediatric surgical outcomes at 
any stage of the pandemic. Conclusions: Numerous knowledge gaps persist with 
respect to the disease, the recovered pre-operative patient, the nature of the 
proposed procedure, and supporting data. For example, should the waiting period 
for all but urgent elective surgery be extended beyond 12 weeks, e.g., after 
serious/critical illness, or for patients with long-COVID and organ dysfunction? 
Conversely, can the waiting periods for asymptomatic patients or vaccinated 
patients be shortened? How shall children be risk-stratified, considering the 
distinctiveness of pediatric COVID-19 and the paucity of data? Forthcoming 
guidelines will hopefully answer these questions but may require ongoing 
modifications based on additional new data and the epidemiology of emerging 
strains."
176,"BACKGROUND: The heavy metals cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) are known to be 
widespread environmental contaminants and high occupational exposure adversely 
affects the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, evidence from 
epidemiological studies linking low Cd and Hg exposure (or non-industrial) to 
the risk of progression to CKD are conflicting. This study aimed to explore the 
association of low Cd and Hg exposure with the risk of CKD in Chinese adults 
aged ≥80 years.
METHODS: The participants were recruited for the Healthy Aging and Biomarkers 
Cohort Study in 2017, an ongoing perspective survey conducted in longevity areas 
in China initially involving 3016 older adults. We used logistic regression 
models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals of CKD 
setting Cd and Hg as categorical variables. Logistic regression with restricted 
cubic spline was used to characterize a dose-response relationships between Cd 
or Hg concentrations and the risk of CKD in the study population.
RESULTS: The ORs for the risk of CKD comparing the fourth to the first quartile 
of blood Cd, blood Hg, urine Cd, and urine Hg were 1.77, 1.57, 2.03, and 1.50, 
respectively. Restricted cubic spline models showed that blood Cd and urine Hg 
were significantly linearly correlated with the risk of CKD, while blood Hg and 
urine Cd were non-linearly correlated with the risk of CKD with a steeper slope 
at concentrations <2.30 μg/L and 3.30 μg/g creatinine.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that even low Cd and Hg exposure (or 
non-industrial) were associated with increased risk of CKD in Chinese oldest 
old, although we did not find a significant multiplicative and additive 
interaction between Cd and Hg levels in relation to the risk of CKD."
177,"BACKGROUND: Awake craniotomy (AC) enables real-time monitoring of cortical and 
subcortical functions when lesions are in eloquent brain areas. AC patients are 
exposed to various preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative stressors, 
which might affect their mental health.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review to better understand stress, anxiety, 
and depression in AC patients.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched from January 
1, 2000, to April 20, 2022, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline.
RESULTS: Four hundred forty-seven records were identified that fit our inclusion 
and exclusion criteria for screening. Overall, 24 articles consisting of 1450 
patients from 13 countries were included. Sixteen studies (66.7%) were 
prospective, whereas 8 articles (33.3%) were retrospective. Studies evaluated 
stress, anxiety, and depression during different phases of AC. Twenty-two 
studies (91.7%) were conducted on adults, and 2 studies were on pediatrics (8.3 
%). Glioma was the most common AC treatment with 615 patients (42.4%). 
Awake-awake-awake and asleep-awake-asleep were the most common protocols, each 
used in 4 studies, respectively (16.7%). Anxiety was the most common 
psychological outcome evaluated in 19 studies (79.2%). The visual analog scale 
and self-developed questionnaire by the authors (each n = 5, 20.8%) were the 
most frequently tools used. Twenty-three studies (95.8%) concluded that AC does 
not increase stress, anxiety, and/or depression in AC patients. One study (4.2%) 
identified younger age associated with panic attack.
CONCLUSION: In experienced hands, AC does not cause an increase in stress, 
anxiety, and depression; however, the psychiatric impact of AC should not be 
underestimated."
178,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is the leading cause of death in China, and predicting the 
stroke burden could provide essential information guiding the setting of medium- 
and long-term health policies and priorities. The study aimed to project trends 
associated with stroke burden in China through 2050, not only in terms of 
incidence and mortality but also for prevalence and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs).
METHODS: Data on stroke rates in incidence, prevalence, deaths, and DALYs in 
China between 1990 and 2019 were obtained from a recent Global Burden of Disease 
study. Demographic-specific trends in rates over time were estimated using three 
models: the loglinear model, the Lee-Carter model, and a functional time series 
model. The mean absolute percentage error and the root mean squared error were 
used for model selection. Projections up to 2050 were estimated using the best 
fitting model. United Nations population data were used to project the absolute 
numbers through 2050.
RESULTS: From 2019 to 2050, the crude rates for all measures of the stroke 
burden are projected to increase continuously among both men and women. We 
project that compared with those in 2019, the incidence, prevalence, deaths, and 
DALYs because of stroke in China in 2050 will increase by 55.58%, 119.16%, 
72.15%, and 20.04%, respectively; the corresponding increases in number were 
2.19, 34.27, 1.58, and 9.21 million. The age-standardized rate is projected to 
substantially decline for incidence (8.94%), death (40.37%), and DALYs (43.47%), 
but the age-standardized prevalence rate is predicted to increase by 10.82%. By 
2050, the burden of stroke among the population aged ≥65 years will increase 
significantly: by 104.70% for incidence, by 218.48% for prevalence, by 100.00% 
for death, and by 58.93% for DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: With the aging population in China increasing over the next three 
decades, the burden of stroke will be markedly increased. Continuous efforts are 
needed to improve stroke health care and secondary prevention, especially for 
older adults."
179,"BACKGROUND: Cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8 T) cells play critical roles in 
eradicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, but little is known 
about the effects of T cells expressing CD8 at low levels (CD8low) or high 
levels (CD8high) on HIV-1 replication inhibition after HIV-1 invasion into 
individual.
METHODS: Nineteen patients who had been acutely infected with HIV-1 (AHI) and 20 
patients with chronic infection (CHI) for ≥2 years were enrolled in this study 
to investigate the dynamics of the quantity, activation, and immune responses of 
CD3+CD8low T cells and their counterpart CD3+CD8high T cells at different stages 
of HIV-1 infection.
RESULTS: Compared with healthy donors, CD3+CD8low T cells expanded in 
HIV-1-infected individuals at different stages of infection. As HIV-1 infection 
progressed, CD3+CD8low T cells gradually decreased. Simultaneously, CD3+CD8high 
T cells was significantly reduced in the first month of AHI and then increased 
gradually as HIV-1 infection progressed. The classical activation of CD3+CD8low 
T cells was highest in the first month of AHI and then reduced as HIV-1 
infection progressed and entered the chronic stage. Meanwhile, activated 
CD38-HLA-DR+CD8low T cells did not increase in the first month of AHI, and the 
number of these cells was inversely associated with viral load (r = -0.664, P = 
0.004) but positively associated with the CD4 T-cell count (r = 0.586, P = 
0.014). Increased programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) abundance on CD3+CD8low 
T cells was observed from the 1st month of AHI but did not continue to be 
enhanced, while a significant T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) domains (TIGIT) abundance 
increase was observed in the 12th month of infection. Furthermore, increased 
PD-1 and TIGIT abundance on CD3+CD8low T cells was associated with a low CD4 
T-cell count (PD-1: r = -0.456, P = 0.043; TIGIT: r = -0.488, P = 0.029) in CHI. 
Nonetheless, the nonincrease in PD-1 expression on classically activated 
CD3+CD8low T cells was inversely associated with HIV-1 viremia in the first 
month of AHI (r = -0.578, P = 0.015). Notably, in the first month of AHI, few 
CD3+CD8low T cells, but comparable amounts of CD3+CD8high T cells, responded to 
Gag peptides. Then, weaker HIV-1-specific T-cell responses were induced in 
CD3+CD8low T cells than CD3+CD8high T cells at the 3rd and 12th months of AHI 
and in CHI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CD3+CD8low T cells play an anti-HIV role 
in the first month of infection due to their abundance but induce a weak 
HIV-1-specific immune response. Subsequently, CD3+CD8low T-cell number decreased 
gradually as infection persisted, and their anti-HIV functions were inferior to 
those of CD3+CD8high T cells."
180,"SARS-CoV-2, especially the variant strains, is rapidly spreading around the 
world. Rapid detection methods for the virus are crucial for controlling the 
COVID-19 epidemic. Herein, a localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) 
biosensor based on Ω-shaped fiber optic (Ω-FO) was developed for dual assays of 
SARS-CoV-2 monitoring. Due to its strong ability to control the orientation and 
density, a new T-shaped aptamer exhibits enhanced binding affinity toward N 
proteins. After being combined on the fiber optic surface, the T-shaped aptamer 
sensitively captured N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for a direct assay. Further, 
core-shell structured gold/silver nanoparticles functionalized with a T-shaped 
aptamer (apt-Ag@AuNPs) can amplify the signal of N protein detection for a 
sandwich assay. The real-time analytical feature of the dual assays endows 
time-dependent sensitivity enhancement behavior, which provides a guideline to 
save analytical time. With those characteristics, the LSPR biosensor has been 
successfully used to rapidly identify 39 healthy volunteers and 39 COVID-19 
patients infected with the ancestral or variant SARS-CoV-2. With the help of 
simple pretreatment, we obtain a true negative rate of 100% and a true positive 
rate of 92.3% with a short analysis time of 45 min using the direct assay. 
Further, the LSPR biosensor could also broaden the detection application range 
to the surface of cold-chain foods using a sandwich assay. Thus, the LSPR 
biosensor based on Ω-FO was demonstrated to have broad application potential to 
detect SARS-CoV-2 rapidly."
181,"There is no correlation between HIV per se and other risk factors for severe 
COVID-19 disease. Pivotal studies have shown that vaccination is one of the 
effective ways to prevent severe COVID-19 illness in the general population. 
Studies on people living with HIV (PLWH) are scarce. The majority of these 
studies with mRNA (BNT126b2 and mRNA-1273) and adenovirus vector (Ad26.COV2.2 
and ChAdOx1) vaccines with a low number of patients included shows that PLWH on 
antiretroviral treatment and with CD4 count > 200/mm³ has a robust immune 
response. These vaccines are thus effective in preventing severe infection 
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in PLWH. However, PLWH 
with a CD4 count of < 200/mm³ and uncontrolled viral load (VL) seems to have a 
lower immune response. COVID-19 vaccines are safe in PLWH; adverse effects are 
mild or moderate, and their incidence is similar to non-HIV people (NHP). The 
CD4 count decreased significantly and transiently, and the VL rebounded 
insignificantly in a few patients. A complete vaccination including a third dose 
is, therefore, recommended. A booster dose with an mRNA vaccine is recommended 
in PLWH with an advanced stage of their disease."
182,"Anal cancer is a common disease in men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV 
infection and is associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, which is 
very prevalent in this population. Advanced anal cancer has an aggressive 
treatment, with a high risk of producing an impaired quality of life. In cases 
of late diagnosis, mortality remains elevated. Based on these findings, it is a 
priority to carry out a systematic screening to detect earlier and prevent the 
disease. In this review and based in our experience at the Infectious Diseases 
outclinic at Hospital de la Santa Creu and Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain, we 
propose a series of actions carried out by trained nurses. We recommend a 
coordinated set of multidisciplinary activities on HIV + MSM focused on HPV 
immunization and periodic anal cytology screening. A good implementation of the 
program will provide significant benefits, since at this time, the best care for 
anal cancer relies in HPV prevention and early diagnosis of HPV oncogenic 
lesions."
183,"Respiratory X-ray imaging enhanced by phase contrast has shown improved airway 
visualization in animal models. Limitations in current X-ray technology have 
nevertheless hindered clinical translation, leaving the potential clinical 
impact an open question. Here, we explore phase-contrast chest radiography in a 
realistic in silico framework. Specifically, we use preprocessed virtual 
patients to generate in silico chest radiographs by Fresnel-diffraction 
simulations of X-ray wave propagation. Following a reader study conducted with 
clinical radiologists, we predict that phase-contrast edge enhancement will have 
a negligible impact on improving solitary pulmonary nodule detection (6 to 20 
mm). However, edge enhancement of bronchial walls visualizes small airways (< 2 
mm), which are invisible in conventional radiography. Our results show that 
phase-contrast chest radiography could play a future role in observing 
small-airway obstruction (e.g., relevant for asthma or early-stage chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease), which cannot be directly visualized using 
current clinical methods, thereby motivating the experimental development needed 
for clinical translation. Finally, we discuss quantitative requirements on 
distances and X-ray source/detector specifications for clinical implementation 
of phase-contrast chest radiography."
184,"There is a growing interest in the considerable health benefits of Gymnema 
Sylvestre (GS) supplementation, as some studies have reported that it may 
improve cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the widespread impact of GS 
supplementation on the parameters mentioned above is not fully resolved. 
Consequently, this study aimed to examine the effects of GS supplementation on 
lipid profile, glycemic control, blood pressure, and anthropometric indices in 
adults. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT), published up to November 
2021, were identified through PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases. 
Six studies were included and analyzed using a random-effects model to calculate 
weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All studies 
were conducted in adults that used a GC supplement (>1 week) and assessed our 
selected cardiovascular risk factors. Outcomes revealed that GS supplementation 
significantly decreased triglyceride (p < .001), total cholesterol (p < .001), 
low-density lipoprotein (p < .001), fasting blood sugar (p < .001), and 
diastolic blood pressure (p = .003). Some limitations, including notable 
heterogeneity, low quality of studies, and lack of diversity among research 
participants, should be considered when interpreting our results. Our outcomes 
suggest that GS supplementation may improve cardiovascular risk factors. Future 
large-high-quality RCTs with longer duration and various populations are needed 
to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of the plant."
185,"BACKGROUND: the timing of incident injurious falls at different stages of 
dementia diagnosis is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: to identify when the occurrence of injurious falls begins to 
increase among individuals who are going to develop dementia, to explore the 
time point at which people living with dementia are at highest risk of injurious 
falls and to ascertain differences in fall-related factors pre- and 
post-dementia diagnosis.
DESIGN: this study included 2,707 participants with incident dementia and 2,707 
1:1 matched (i.e. same birth year and sex) controls without dementia.
METHODS: dementia diagnosis and date of onset were identified from the National 
Patient Registry (NPR) and the Swedish Cause of Death Register following 
international criteria. Information on injurious falls and history of chronic 
disease was obtained from the NPR. Data were analysed using conditional Poisson 
regression and generalized estimating equation models.
RESULTS: compared with controls, the incidence of injurious falls among 
participants with dementia started to increase beginning 4 years pre-diagnosis 
(incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-2.22), 
reaching a peak (IRR 3.73, 95% CI 3.16-4.41) in the year of dementia diagnosis. 
Heavy drinking, physically active and cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) were 
associated with incident falls among those with dementia.
CONCLUSION: people with dementia have a higher incidence of injurious falls 
beginning 4 years leading up to diagnosis and peaking during the year of 
diagnosis. Older age, female, heavy drinking, physically active and CMDs may 
predict injurious falls among people with dementia."
186,"BACKGROUND: Quantitative assessment of muscle mass is a critical step in 
sarcopenia disease management. Expanding upon the use of ultrasound in foetal 
growth assessment, we established and validated an ultrasound-derived muscle 
assessment system for older adults at a risk of sarcopenia.
METHODS: A total of 669 older adults were recruited in three cohorts in this 
cross-sectional study. In cohort 1(n = 103), the most valuable sites for 
skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) estimation were located among 11 ultrasound 
scanning sites. An ultrasound-derived SMI estimating algorithm based on muscle 
thickness (MT) was obtained in the modelling group composed of cohorts 1 and 2 
(n = 309). The reliability of the muscle mass estimation equation and the 
validity of the obtained cut-off values were verified in cohort 3 (n = 257), 
which was selected as the verification group.
RESULTS: In the modelling group, the cut-off values of ultrasound-derived e-SMI 
for low SMI were 7.13 kg/m2 for men and 5.81 kg/m2 for women. In the 
verification group, the intraclass correlation between e-SMI and SMI was 0.885. 
The sensitivity of the e-SMI in detecting low SMI was 93.6% for men and 89.7% 
for women, and the negative predictive value was 94.9% for men and 94.7% for 
women. Combined with the handgrip strength and gait speed, the e-SMI had an 
overall diagnostic sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 91.0% for 
sarcopenia.
CONCLUSION: The ultrasound-derived muscle assessment system can be a promising 
muscle mass estimation tool and a potential disease classification tool."
187,"PURPOSE: This cross-sectional observational pilot study investigated egocentric 
social networks for 10 paired sex- and age-matched adults with and without 
multiple sclerosis (MS). This study also investigated the relationship between 
social network measures and various disease factors associated with MS. The 
relationship between social network measures and communication participation 
restrictions was also examined.
METHOD: Participants completed a seven-item social network survey. Social 
network structure and composition were quantified. The network organization 
measures (structure analysis) included the total number of members (network 
size) and extent to which members are connected (network density). The measured 
characteristics of people around a participant (composition analysis) included 
the amount of kin relative to network size (proportion of kin), gender variation 
(gender diversity index), and age variation (standard deviation of age). 
Standard clinical neuropsychological, psychosocial, and speech metrics 
quantified processing speed, memory, depression, fatigue, and sentence 
intelligibility. Measures of communication participation and MS severity were 
also obtained.
RESULTS: Matched-pairs tests indicated that the proportion of kin significantly 
differed between paired participants, whereas all other social network measures 
were similar. For participants with MS, correlation analyses indicated weak 
associations between proportion of kin and cognitive, psychosocial, and speech 
measures. However, strong correlations were found between social network size 
and processing speed, memory, fatigue, MS severity, and communication 
participation. Gender diversity index also strongly correlated with depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this pilot study highlight the importance of 
evaluating egocentric networks in the clinical management of MS, as maintaining 
nonkin friendships may be difficult for adults with MS making them vulnerable to 
social isolation. Furthermore, those with small and less diverse networks may 
experience more severe cognitive and psychosocial problems and limited 
communication participation."
188,"Background: The aim of our study was to determine the causes of lower extremity 
kinesiophobia (whether it is biological or psychological) in individuals with 
lower limb lymphedema (LLL), and to compare the changes in fatigue and 
activities of daily living with healthy individuals. Methods: The study included 
74 unilateral LLL patients (study group) and 74 individuals (control subjects). 
Causes of fear of movement were assessed with the Causes of Fear of Movement 
questionnaire; fatigue, with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Disease 
Treatment-Fatigue Questionnaire; and quality of life (QoL) with the Lymphedema 
Quality of Life Questionnaire-Leg. Results: One hundred forty-eight participants 
were included in the study, 74 of whom were in the study group and 74 in the 
control group. 63.5% of the lymphedema patients had primary lymphedema and 36.5% 
had secondary lymphedema. Fear of movement total score and QoL scores was higher 
in LLL group than control group. Total fear of movement score and biological 
subparameter score of fear of movement, fatigue, and some subparameters of QoL 
scores were found to be higher in primary LLL patients compared with secondary 
LLL. Conclusion: Fear of movement is common and QoL is impaired in patients with 
secondary LLL, more significant in primary LLL."
189,"Circular RNA (circRNA) is involved in the occurrence and development of various 
cancers. To this day, the expression and mechanism of circRNA in osteosarcoma 
(OS) remain unclear. We previously found that circ_0001060 was highly expressed 
in OS tumor tissues. In this work, we identified that high level expression of 
circ_0001060 was significantly associated with late clinical stage, larger tumor 
volume, higher frequency of metastasis, and poor prognosis in OS patients. 
Furthermore, we confirmed that silencing circ_0001060 inhibited the 
proliferation and migration of OS cell. Using bioinformatics analysis, we built 
three circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules (circ_0001060-miR-203a-5p-TRIM21, 
circ_0001060-miR-208b-5p-MAP3K5, and circ_0001060-miR-203a-5p-PRKX), suggesting 
that these signaling axes may be involved in the inhibitory effect of 
circ_0001060 on OS. To sum up, circ_0001060 is a novel tumor biomarker for OS as 
well as a potential therapeutic target."
190,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and impaired glycaemic control are 
closely linked, however, the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning this 
bidirectional relationship remain unresolved. The high secretory capacity of the 
liver and impairments in protein secretion in NAFLD suggest that endocrine 
changes in the liver are likely to contribute to glycaemic defects. We identify 
hexosaminidase A (HEXA) as a NAFLD-induced hepatokine in both mice and humans. 
HEXA regulates sphingolipid metabolism, converting GM2 to GM3 gangliosides; 
sphingolipids that are primarily localized to cell surface lipid rafts. Using 
recombinant murine HEXA protein, an enzymatically inactive HEXA(R178H) mutant, 
or adeno-associated viral vectors to induce hepatocyte-specific overexpression 
of HEXA, we show that HEXA improves blood glucose control by increasing skeletal 
muscle glucose uptake in mouse models of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, 
with these effects being dependent on HEXA's enzymatic action. Mechanistically, 
HEXA remodels muscle lipid raft ganglioside composition, thereby increasing 
insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling and glucose transporter 4 localization 
to the cell surface. Disrupting lipid rafts reverses these HEXA-mediated 
effects. Together, this study identifies a novel pathway for inter-tissue 
communication between liver and skeletal muscle in the regulation of systemic 
glycaemic control."
191,"Neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) affects up to 80% of spinal cord injury (SCI) 
patients, triggering multiple gastrointestinal symptoms. Basic bowel management 
(BBM) programs provide predictable and effective fecal elimination, being 
recommended in this population. Implementing BBM programs can be a clinical 
challenge, especially in the presence of pre-/co-morbid conditions, such as 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinical assessment may be complex since 
neurological impairment can blur abdominal signs and symptoms. As such, it is 
crucial to assess IBD activity through laboratory biomarkers, endoscopic and/or 
cross-sectional imaging. When there is evidence of IBD remission, BBM programs 
can be started as in any other SCI patient with NBD. In the presence of active 
IBD, bowel management may be hampered by active luminal disease. In this 
setting, therapeutic optimization is warranted before starting BBM programs. 
Multidisciplinary approaches, including Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and 
Gastroenterology, are critically important. This article is protected by

192,"Increased saturated fatty acid levels in membrane phospholipids have been 
implicated in the development of metabolic disease. Here, we tested the 
hypothesis that increased saturated fatty acid (SFA) content in cell membranes 
negatively impacts adipocyte insulin signaling. Pre-adipocyte cell models with 
elevated SFA levels in phospholipids were generated by disrupting the ADIPOR2 
locus, which resulted in a striking two-fold increase in SFA-containing 
phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines, which persisted in 
differentiated adipocytes. Similar changes in phospholipid composition were 
observed in white adipose tissues isolated from the ADIPOR2 knockout mice. The 
SFA levels in phospholipids could be further increased by treating 
ADIPOR2-deficient cells with palmitic acid and resulted in reduced membrane 
fluidity and endoplasmic reticulum stress in mouse and human pre-adipocytes. 
Strikingly, increased SFA levels in differentiated adipocyte phospholipids had 
no effect on adipocyte gene expression or insulin signaling in vitro. Similarly, 
increased adipocyte phospholipid saturation did not impair white adipose tissue 
function in vivo, even in mice fed a high saturated fat diet at 
thermoneutrality. We conclude that increasing SFA levels in adipocyte 
phospholipids is well tolerated and does not affect adipocyte insulin signaling 
in vitro and in vivo."
193,"BACKGROUND: There is an incompletely understood increased risk for 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) among people living with HIV (PLWH). We 
investigated if a collection of biomarkers were associated with CVD among PLWH. 
Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to identify potentially causal 
associations.
METHODS: Data from follow-up in 4 large trials among PLWH were used to identify 
131 incident CVD cases and they were matched to 259 participants without 
incident CVD (controls). Tests of associations between 460 baseline protein 
levels and case status were conducted.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis found CLEC6A, HGF, IL6, IL10RB, and IGFBP7 as being 
associated with case status and a multivariate model identified 3 of these: 
CLEC6A (OR = 1.48, p = 0.037), HGF (OR = 1.83, p = 0.012) and IL6 (OR = 1.45, 
p = 0.016). MR methods identified 5 significantly associated proteins: AXL, 
CHI3L1, GAS6, IL6RA, and SCGB3A2.
CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate inflammatory and fibrotic processes as 
contributing to CVD. While some of these biomarkers are well established in the 
general population and in PLWH (IL6 and its receptor), some are novel to PLWH 
(HGF, AXL and GAS6) and some are novel overall (CLEC6A). Further investigation 
into; 1.) the uniqueness of these biomarkers in PLWH and 2.) the role of these 
biomarkers as targets among PLWH, is warranted."
194,"Ebolaviruses cause outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever in Central and West Africa. 
Some members of this genus such as Ebola virus (EBOV) are highly pathogenic, 
with case fatality rates of up to 90%, whereas others such as Reston virus 
(RESTV) are apathogenic for humans. Bombali virus (BOMV) is a novel ebolavirus 
for which complete genome sequences were recently found in free-tailed bats, 
although no infectious virus could be isolated. Its pathogenic potential for 
humans is unknown. To address this question, we first determined whether 
proteins encoded by the available BOMV sequence found in Chaerephon pumilus were 
functional in in vitro assays. The correction of an apparent sequencing error in 
the glycoprotein based on these data then allowed us to generate infectious BOMV 
using reverse genetics and characterize its infection of human cells. 
Furthermore, we used HLA-A2-transgenic, NOD-scid-IL-2γ receptor-knockout 
(NSG-A2) mice reconstituted with human haematopoiesis as a model to evaluate the 
pathogenicity of BOMV in vivo in a human-like immune environment. These data 
demonstrate that not only does BOMV show a slower growth rate than EBOV in 
vitro, but it also shows low pathogenicity in humanized mice, comparable to 
previous studies using RESTV. Taken together, these findings suggest a low 
pathogenic potential of BOMV for humans."
195,"Preeclampsia (PE) refers to a pregnancy-specific disease that begins with the 
placenta. Differentially expressed microRNAs (miRs) are a feature of PE. This 
study tried to elicit the functional mechanism of miR-515-5p in trophoblast cell 
behaviors in PE. First, HTR-8/SVneo cells were transfected with miR-515-5p mimic 
or miR-515-5p inhibitor. Then, relative expression levels of miR-515-5p and 
histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) in HTR-8/SVneo cells were determined by reverse 
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The potential binding site 
of miR-515-5p and HDAC2 was predicted on Targetscan and their binding 
relationship was verified via dual-luciferase assay. Proliferation, apoptosis, 
invasion, and migration of HTR-8/SVneo cells were assessed via cell counting 
kit-8, flow cytometry, Transwell, and wound healing assays, respectively. 
Protein levels of Cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax were determined via Western 
blot. Overexpressed miR-515-5p impeded proliferation and stimulated apoptosis of 
HTR-8/SVneo cells, and decreased levels of Cleaved caspase-3 and Bax and 
elevated Bcl-2, whilst opposite results were observed after miR-515-5p 
inhibition. miR-515-5p targeted HDAC2. Knockdown of HDAC2 annulled the 
promotional action of miR-515-5p inhibition on proliferative, invasive, and 
migratory abilities and its antiapoptotic action on HTR-8/SVneo cells. In brief, 
miR-515-5p affected the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration of 
HTR-8/SVneo cells by targeting HDAC2."
196,"The ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27a) is cleaved from the fusion protein 
ubiquitin-RPS27a (Ub-RPS27a). Generally, Ub and RPS27a are coexpressed as a 
fusion protein but function independently after Ub is cleaved from RPS27a by a 
deubiquitinating enzyme. As an RP, RPS27a assembles into ribosomes, but it also 
functions independently of ribosomes. RPS27a is involved in the development and 
poor prognosis of various cancers, such as colorectal cancer, liver cancer, 
chronic myeloid leukemia, and renal carcinoma, and is associated with poor 
prognosis. Notably, the murine double minute 2/P53 axis is a major pathway 
through which RPS27a regulates cancer development. Moreover, RPS27a maintains 
sperm motility, regulates winged aphid indirect flight muscle degeneration, and 
facilitates plant growth. Additionally, RPS27a is a metalloprotein and mercury 
(Hg) biomarker. In the present review, we described the origin, structure, and 
biological functions of RPS27a."
197,"Prostate cancer and breast cancer are sex-steroid-dependent diseases that are 
driven in major part by gonadal sex steroids. Testosterone is converted to 
5α-dihydrotestosterone, both of which stimulate the androgen receptor (AR) and 
prostate cancer progression. Estradiol is the major stimulus for estrogen 
receptor (ER)-α and proliferation of ERα-expressing breast cancer. However, the 
human adrenal provides an alternative source for sex steroids. A number of 
different androgens are produced by the adrenals, the most abundant of which is 
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA-sulfate. These precursor steroids are 
subject to metabolism by peripherally expressed enzymes that are responsible for 
the synthesis of potent androgens and estrogens. In the case of prostate cancer, 
the regulation of one of these enzymatic steps occurs at least in part by way of 
a germline-encoded missense in 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (3βHSD1), which 
regulates potent androgen biosynthesis and clinical outcomes in men with 
advanced prostate cancer treated with gonadal testosterone deprivation. The sex 
steroids that drive prostate cancer and breast cancer require a common set of 
enzymes for their generation. However, the pathways diverge once 3-keto, 
Δ4-androgens are generated and these steroids are either turned into potent 
androgens by steroid-5α-reductase, or into estrogens by aromatase. Alternative 
steroid receptors have also emerged as disease- and treatment-resistance 
modifiers, including a role for AR in breast cancer and glucocorticoid receptor 
(GR) in both breast and prostate cancer. In this review, we integrate the 
commonalities of adrenal steroid physiology that regulate both prostate and 
breast cancer while recognizing the clear distinctions between these diseases."
198,"PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to model the costs and 
benefits of 2 screening criteria for people with gestational diabetes. Because 
people with a history of gestational diabetes are at increased risk for type 2 
diabetes, we modeled the effects of a postdelivery intervention based on the 
Diabetes Prevention Program, which is offered to all people with a history of 
gestational diabetes defined by either set of criteria.
INTERVENTION APPROACH: We used a probabilistic decision tree model to compare 
the cost-effectiveness of the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy 
Study Group's (IADPSG's) screening criteria and the Carpenter-Coustan screening 
criteria for gestational diabetes through delivery and a follow-up period during 
which people might develop type 2 diabetes after pregnancy.
EVALUATION METHODS: The model included perinatal outcomes for the infant and 
mother and a 10-year postdelivery period to model maternal progression to type 2 
diabetes. The model assumed the health care system perspective. People with 
gestational diabetes received treatment for gestational diabetes during 
pregnancy, and we assumed that 10% would participate in a Diabetes Prevention 
Program-based postdelivery intervention to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. 
We estimated the cost-effectiveness of each screening strategy in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in 2022 dollars.
RESULTS: At 10% participation in a Diabetes Prevention Program-based 
postdelivery intervention, the Carpenter-Coustan criteria were cost-effective, 
compared with no screening ($66,085 per QALY). The IADPSG screening criteria 
were slightly less cost-effective, compared with no screening ($97,878 per QALY) 
or Carpenter-Coustan screening criteria ($122,279 per QALY). With participation 
rates of 23% or higher, the IADPSG screening criteria were highly cost-effective 
($48,588 per QALY), compared with Carpenter-Coustan screening criteria.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: Diagnosing a larger proportion of pregnant 
people using the IADPSG screening criteria, compared with using 
Carpenter-Coustan screening criteria, is not cost-effective at low levels of 
participation. However, with moderate levels of participation (23%) in a 
Diabetes Prevention Program-based postdelivery intervention, the expanded IADPSG

Carpenter-Coustan screening."
199,"BACKGROUND: The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multifactorial. The most 
important challenge of research is the identification of potential biomarkers 
associated with AD pathogenesis that may significantly contribute to early 
diagnosis of the disease. We aim to explore an eventual association of the C677T 
and A1298C genetic polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene with AD risk in an Algerian 
population.
METHODS: This case-control study involved comparing a group of 106 patients that 
had developed AD to another group of 104 non-demented individuals. The MTHFR 
genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP method. Additionally, the homocysteine 
level was evaluated.
RESULTS: Genotypes analysis did not show an association for both MTHFR677CT and 
677TT variants with AD risk (OR = 1.12; p = 0.66; OR = 1.76; p = 0.09) 
respectively. As expected, the 677CC wild type genotype showed a protective role 
against AD (OR = 0.52; p = 0.03). For 1298AC MTHFR variant, the distribution of 
different genotypes did not show a statistical significant difference between 
the two cohorts. However the silmutaneous carrier, CT/AC presented association 
with AD (OR = 5.96; p = 0.05). On the other hand, carrier-state of MTHFR T 
allele showed a relationship with AD (OR = 1.98; p = 0.02). Additionally, 
hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be a risk factor for AD (OR = 1.08; p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our exploration reveals that the silmutaneous carrier, CT/AC, 
carrier-state of MTHFR T allele, and hyperhomocysteinemia seem to be risk 
factors for AD."
200,"We bring together insights from the sociology of diagnosis and the sociology of 
ignorance to examine the early diagnostic unfolding of 'Long COVID' (LC). 
Originally described by patient activists, researchers set out to ponder its 
unwieldy clinical boundaries. Using a scoping review method in tandem with 
qualitative content analytic techniques, we analyse medicine's initial struggles 
to construct a LC diagnosis. Paying attention to the dynamics of ignorance, we 
highlight three consequential conceptual manoeuvres in the early classifications 
of LC: causal agnosticism concerning the relationship between COVID-19 and LC, 
evasion of lumping LC with similar conditions; and the predictable splitting off 
of medically explainable cases from the LC designation. These manoeuvres are not 
maleficent, inept or unreasonable. They are practical but impactful responses to 
the classificatory dilemmas present in the construction of diagnoses amidst 
ignorance. Although there are unique aspects to LC, we suggest that its early 
fate is nevertheless emblematic of medicine's diagnostic standardisation 
processes more generally. To varying degrees, diagnoses are ignorance management 
strategies; they create a pathway through the uncertainty at the core of disease 
realities. However, while diagnoses circumscribe some types of ignorance, they 
produce others through the creation of blind spots and paths not taken."
201,"OBJECTIVE: To project the prevalence and number of youths with diabetes and 
trends in racial and ethnic disparities in the U.S. through 2060.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on a mathematical model and data from the 
SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study for calendar years 2002-2017, we projected 
the future prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes among youth aged <20 years 
while considering different scenarios of future trends in incidence.
RESULTS: The number of youths with diabetes will increase from 213,000 (95% CI 
209,000; 218,000) (type 1 diabetes 185,000, type 2 diabetes 28,000) in 2017 to 
239,000 (95% CI 209,000; 282,000) (type 1 diabetes 191,000, type 2 diabetes 
48,000) in 2060 if the incidence remains constant as observed in 2017. 
Corresponding relative increases were 3% (95% CI -9%; 21%) for type 1 diabetes 
and 69% (95% CI 43%; 109%) for type 2 diabetes. Assuming that increasing trends 
in incidence observed between 2002 and 2017 continue, the projected number of 
youths with diabetes will be 526,000 (95% CI 335,000; 893,000) (type 1 diabetes 
306,000, type 2 diabetes 220,000). Corresponding relative increases would be 65% 
(95% CI 12%; 158%) for type 1 diabetes and 673% (95% CI 362%; 1,341%) for type 2 
diabetes. In both scenarios, substantial widening of racial and ethnic 
disparities in type 2 diabetes prevalence are expected, with the highest 
prevalence among non-Hispanic Black youth.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of youths with diabetes in the U.S. is likely to 
substantially increase in future decades, which emphasizes the need for 
prevention to attenuate this trend."
202,"In recent years, nanotechnology has improved life with continuous growth in 
different fields. Nanoparticles can be employed in industry, imaging, 
engineering, and various biomedical filed because of their special 
physicochemical properties like rapid, effective, highly specific solutions, 
higher stability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and cost. In this line, 
veterinary medicine has been influenced by nanotechnology in prevention, 
diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, cancer therapy, immunization, vaccine 
production, drug delivery, and health besides to related issues of animal 
production, maintenance, and welfare. The other important point is the 
interwoven linkage between animals and humans whether as a food source or as a 
companionship. Inorganic nanoparticles, polymeric, solid lipid, liposomal, 
nanocrystal, nanotubes, nanoemulsions, micelles, mesoporous silica 
nanoparticles, and dendrimers are kinds of nanoparticles that can be used 
widely. In this review, the impacts of nanotechnology on veterinary medicine 
have been summarized, criticized, and acknowledged as ""veterinary nanomedicine""

203,"Objective: Mental health and substance use disorders are commonly associated 
with disrupted sleep and circadian rest-activity rhythms. How these disorders in 
combination relate to sleep and circadian organization is not well studied. We 
provide here the first quantitative assessment of sleep and rest-activity 
rhythms in inpatients with complex concurrent disorders, taking into account 
categories of substance use (stimulant vs. stimulant and opioid use) and 
psychiatric diagnosis (psychotic disorder and mood disorder). We also explore 
how sleep and rest-activity rhythms relate to psychiatric functioning. Methods: 
A total of 44 participants (10 female) between the age of 20-60 years (median = 
29 years) wore wrist accelerometers over 5-70 days and completed standardized 
questionnaires assessing chronotype and psychiatric functioning (fatigue, 
psychiatric symptom severity, and impulsiveness). To examine potential 
influences from treatment, we computed (1) length of stay; (2) days of 
abstinence from stimulants and opioids as a measure of withdrawal; and (3) a 
sedative load based on prescribed medications. Results: Participants exhibited a 
sustained excessive sleep duration, frequent nighttime awakenings, and advanced 
rest-activity phase related to sedative load. Sleep disruptions were elevated in 
participants with a history of opioid use. Patients with a psychotic disorder 
showed the longest sleep and most fragmented and irregular rest-activity 
patterns. Non-parametric circadian rhythm analysis revealed a high rhythm 
amplitude by comparison with population norms, and this was associated with 
greater psychiatric symptom severity. Psychiatric symptom severity was also 
associated with greater fatigue and later MCTQ chronotype. Conclusions: This 
pilot study provides initial information on the prevalence and severity of sleep 
and circadian rhythm disturbances in individuals with severe concurrent 
disorders are disturbed. The results underline the need for further studies to 
start to understand the role of sleep in the disease and recovery process in 
this understudied population."
204,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiological status concerning many canine tick-borne 
diseases (TBDs) in Serbia is still insufficiently known.
OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to investigate the presence of tick-borne pathogens 
of the family Anaplasmataceae and Hepatozoon spp., as a cause of illnesses 
accompanied by clinical signs that can occur in dogs with anaplasmosis, 
ehrlichiosis and hepatozoonosis.
METHODS: Dogs are included in the study based on the presence of a minimum of 
three clinical and/or pathological findings that could be associated with 
anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis and hepatozoonosis. During the study (April-October 
2018), 11 dogs met the conditions to be included in the survey. Identification 
of the causative agent in the blood of diseased dogs was performed by 
conventional PCR followed by sequencing.
RESULTS: The presence of the pathogens was confirmed in three animals (3/11, 
27.3%). The presence of Ehrlichia canis was confirmed in 3-month-old female 
Rottweiler puppy, an 8-year old Miniature Schnauzer female was positive for 
Hepatozoon canis infection, while 4-year-old mixed breed male dog was 
co-infected with both mentioned pathogens. These are the first cases of 
autochthonous infection with E. canis and H. canis in dogs from Serbia confirmed 
by molecular methods.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate the importance of molecular 
methods to establish a reliable diagnosis of TBDs. Also, the confirmed presence 
of causative agents of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis and hepatozoonosis in 
Serbia appeals to veterinary practitioners that it is necessary to exclude the 
presence of those diseases in suspicious dogs."
205,"BACKGROUND: the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia 
(CAIDE) dementia risk score is a recognised tool for dementia risk 
stratification. However, its application is limited due to the requirements for 
multidimensional information and fasting blood draw. Consequently, an effective 
and non-invasive tool for screening individuals with high dementia risk in large 
population-based settings is urgently needed.
METHODS: a deep learning algorithm based on fundus photographs for estimating 
the CAIDE dementia risk score was developed and internally validated by a 
medical check-up dataset included 271,864 participants in 19 province-level 
administrative regions of China, and externally validated based on an 
independent dataset included 20,690 check-up participants in Beijing. The 
performance for identifying individuals with high dementia risk (CAIDE dementia 
risk score ≥ 10 points) was evaluated by area under the receiver operating curve 
(AUC) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: the algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.944 (95% CI: 0.939-0.950) in the 
internal validation group and 0.926 (95% CI: 0.913-0.939) in the external group, 
respectively. Besides, the estimated CAIDE dementia risk score derived from the 
algorithm was significantly associated with both comprehensive cognitive 
function and specific cognitive domains.
CONCLUSIONS: this algorithm trained via fundus photographs could well identify 
individuals with high dementia risk in a population setting. Therefore, it has 
the potential to be utilised as a non-invasive and more expedient method for 
dementia risk stratification. It might also be adopted in dementia clinical 
trials, incorporated as inclusion criteria to efficiently select eligible 
participants."
206,"The minimal important change and analogous terms (MIC) can provide a measure of 
change in health outcome variables that is associated with a level of importance 
for participant/patient. This review explores the availability of the MIC for 
different balance measures used with older adults in research and clinical 
settings. PubMed, ProQuest and Web of Science search engines were used and based 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 studies were deemed suitable for 
data extraction and analysis. The results demonstrated that MIC is available for 
the following balance-associated tests: Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go, 
Short Physical Performance Battery, BESTest and the Tinetti test. A range of MIC 
values were shown, reflective of different older adult health conditions, 
calculation methods and anchors used. It was also evident that the 
responsiveness of the test was not always available or appropriately determined, 
questioning the validity of the MIC value published. Greater research is needed 
to establish MIC for balance measurements for use with older adults with 
different health conditions, preferably using objective measures such as falls. 
The calculation of such statistics will improve the evaluation of intervention 
effectiveness."
207,"INTRODUCTION: The e-cigarette market has expanded considerably in recent years, 
resulting in changes in availability and use of e-cigarettes with varying 
characteristics.
AIMS AND METHODS: This study assessed trends in sales and prices of e-cigarettes 
by nicotine strength level, including by product type and flavor, during January 
2017-March 2022. US e-cigarette retail sales data were licensed from IRI 
company. Nicotine strength was categorized as: <1%; 1% to <2%; 2% to <3%; 3% to 
<4%; 4% to <5%; ≥5%. E-cigarette flavors were categorized as tobacco, menthol, 
mint, or other flavors. Product type was categorized as prefilled cartridge 
devices, disposable devices, or e-liquid bottles. Trend analyses were performed 
using Joinpoint Regression.
RESULTS: During January 2017-March 2022, the unit share of products containing 
≥5% nicotine strength increased by 1486.3%, while the dollar share increased by 
1345.5%. By March 2022, 80.9% of total unit sales were composed of products 
containing ≥5% nicotine strength. By flavor, the percentage of units sold with 
≥5% nicotine strength was 61.3% of tobacco-flavor sales, 79.3% of menthol sales, 
87.4% of mint sales, and 96.1% of other flavor sales. By product type, the 
percentage of units sold with ≥5% nicotine strength was 90.6% of disposable 
e-cigarette sales and 74.2% of prefilled cartridge sales. During January 
2017-March 2022, the price of low-nicotine strength e-cigarettes increased, 
while the price of high-nicotine products either decreased or did not change.
CONCLUSIONS: Sales of high nicotine-strength e-cigarettes have dominated the US 
e-cigarette market. Limiting the nicotine strength of e-cigarettes could be 
considered as part of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy to reduce youth 
access to and use of these products.
IMPLICATIONS: The findings from this study indicate that previously reported 
increases in e-cigarette nicotine strength during 2013-2018 have continued 
through 2022. The US e-cigarette market sales continue to be dominated by 
relatively high-nicotine products. Strategies to address factors that make these 
products, particularly appealing to youth, including flavors and product 
innovations, are critical. Such strategies are important-as part of a 
comprehensive approach alongside other evidence-based population-level 
actions-to address youth e-cigarette use. Importantly, actions to reduce 
e-cigarette use among youth are not mutually exclusive from actions to maximize 
the potential benefits of e-cigarettes for increasing smoking cessation among 
adults."
208,"The work aims to revise the current views on the effectiveness of Dega's pelvic 
osteotomy in preventing femoral head deformity in the course of Perthes' disease 
in patients with late symptoms >8 years of age and withsignificant changes in 
the radiographic image (Catterall III/IV or Herring B, B/C, C). We did a 
literature review. Four articles from six found in 'PubMed' which combine Dega 
acetabuloplasty and Perthes' disease words were fully read and analyzed. 
Kamegaya (2018), with a 9.5-year follow-up period, described differences 
comparing the group treated with femoral varus osteotomy with the group that was 
treated with a combined Dega acetabuloplasty and femoral varus osteotomy. A 
series of papers by Napiontek from 2004, with an average 8-year follow-up, also 
describes satisfactory results after Dega's osteotomy, with 27 hips in groups 
I/II according to Stulberg. Another paper in the series, which analyzed 
operatively and non-operatively treated patients, shows no differences in the 
period of time of Perthes disease treatment between the analyzed groups. The 
last paper in the series from 2001, describes 10 patients treated primarily due 
to hip dysplasia, who was diagnosed with Perthes disease. Five of them underwent 
Dega acetabuloplasty obtaining a Stulberg score of I/II in the long-term 
follow-up. We think it seems reasonable to return to the treatment planning of 
Perthes' disease using Dega acetabuloplasty as a method to improve the hip 
congruence in late-diagnosed and advanced forms of the disease."
209,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Repeated joint bleeding in haemophilia patients may 
lead to haemophilic arthropathy with marked inflammation and synovitis. This 
study investigated the potential of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT) as a novel diagnostic method 
for haemophilic arthropathy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 20 adult haemophilia patients who reported 
history of hemarthroses in the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, or ankle joints. All 
joints were assessed by power Doppler ultrasonography and radiography, and 
graded by hyperaemia score and Pettersson score, respectively. Joint pain was 
evaluated by visual analogue score (VAS). Range of motion (ROM), Haemophilia 
Joint Health Score (HJHS) and annual joint bleeding rate (AJBR) were recorded. 
Finally, all participants had whole-body 18 F-FDG PET/CT, and maximum 
standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the joints being studied was measured.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients had severe haemophilia, and seven had moderate 
haemophilia. The mean age was 36 years. PET SUVmax showed significant 
correlations with VAS, ROM, Pettersson score, hyperaemia score, HJHS score and 
AJBR in all large joints except hip. Joints with pain, hyperaemia and 
radiographic changes were found to have higher SUVmax than those without these 
features. Using Youden's index, the optimal cut-off value for early 
radiographical arthropathy was found to be between 1.9 and 2.0.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging correlated well 
with various conventional diagnostic techniques. It also demonstrated high 
sensitivity and specificity for early radiographic arthropathy. 18 F-FDG PET/CT 
imaging may quantitatively evaluate disease activity of most large joints in a 
single examination and help detect early haemophilic arthropathy."
210,"CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were recently implicated in immune-mediated 
inflammation and fibrosis progression of Graves' orbitopathy (GO). However, 
little is known about therapeutic targeting CD4+ CTLs. Herein, we studied the 
effect of rapamycin, an approved mTORC1 inhibitor, in GO mouse model, in vitro 
and in refractory GO patients. In the adenovirus-induced model, rapamycin 
significantly decreased the incidence of orbitopathy. This was accompanied by 
reduction of CD4+ CTLs, and improvement of inflammation, adipogenesis and 
fibrosis in orbits. CD4+CTLs from active GO patients showed upregulation of mTOR 
pathway, while rapamycin decreased their proportions and cytotoxic function. 
Low-dose rapamycin treatment substantially improved diplopia and clinical 
activity score in steroid-refractory GO patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing 
revealed that eye motility improvement was closely related to suppression of 
inflammation and chemotaxis in CD4+ CTLs. In conclusion, rapamycin is a 
promising treatment for CD4+ CTL-mediated inflammation and fibrosis in GO."
211,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Since the early pandemic, prone positioning has been broadly 
utilized for nonintubated patients (so-called 'awake prone positioning, APP') 
with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute hypoxemic respiratory 
failure (AHRF).
RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous clinical studies have been conducted to investigate 
the effects of APP on oxygenation, intubation, and mortality. However, several 
questions remain unclear, such as the patient populations who benefit most from 
APP, the best length of daily duration on APP, how to improve adherence to APP, 
and the mechanisms of APP efficacy.
SUMMARY: APP has been shown to improve oxygenation for patients with COVID-19 
induced AHRF and is a safe treatment. However, the benefits of reducing 
intubation rates are only seen in moderate-to-severe patients who are undergoing 
HFNC treatment. In these patients, APP should be initiated early and with a 
target of at least 8 h/day of APP. Pillows under the body and 
patients-healthcare team collaboration to find the optimal position is essential 
to enhance patients' adherence. Oxygenation improvement and changes in the lung 
ultrasound findings may help to identify those patients who are more likely to 
avoid the need for intubation."

213,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired 
thrombo-inflammatory disease associated with diverse clinical manifestations in 
the setting of persistently circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). This 
review summarizes recent developments in our understanding of the pathogenesis 
of APS and its various clinical manifestations with a focus on the activation of 
endothelial cells, complement, and neutrophils.
RECENT FINDINGS: Elucidating the pathophysiology that leads to the diverse array 
of clinical manifestations of APS is an area of active exploration. Here, we 
highlight recent studies that have explored various impacts of endothelial 
activation and injury in APS, including the promotion of circulating endothelial 
cells and extracellular vesicles; the association between complement activity 
and different APS phenotypes, including pregnancy loss; and the relationship 
between neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and high-risk aPL profiles in 
thrombotic APS. We also call attention to recent work that proposes approaches 
to mitigating these pathologic changes as potential treatment strategies for 
APS. Lastly, we highlight promising future directions in APS research, such as 
multiomics approaches to molecularly stratifying APS patients.
SUMMARY: The identification of novel aspects of pathogenesis and more nuanced 
approaches to phenotyping patients will hopefully pave the way for developing 
safer and more effective patient-specific therapeutic strategies for APS."
214,"BACKGROUND: The management of infected metaphyseal nonunion of the tibia is 
devastating, especially when associated with significant bone loss, poor soft 
tissues, draining sinuses, axial deformity, knee or ankle joint stiffness, limb 
discrepancy, and multiresisted pathogens. A systematic review, performed 
recently by the primary investigators but not yet published, yielded the lack of 
studies in the field and the huge heterogeneity of the presented results. We 
found several bias and controversies such as no clear definition of the exact 
part of the tibia where the nonunion was located, the pathogen causing the 
fracture-related infection, the number of previous interventions and time to 
presentation, and the exact type of treatment methods including the use of 
muscle flaps or bone grafting. Time to final union as a functional score is 
another important but missing data.
OBJECTIVE: The proposed study is designed to evaluate a sufficient number of 
patients with infected metaphyseal tibial nonunions using various general 
health, functional, and bone scores.
METHODS: This prospective clinical trial study, with a minimum follow-up period 
of 36 months, focuses on the effectiveness of the Ilizarov method after radical 
nonunion debridement and targeted antibiotic therapy in patients with infected 
metaphyseal tibial nonunions. The primary outcomes would be the definite healing 
of nonunion and infection-free results. Secondary outcomes would be limb 
alignment and discrepancy, alteration in the patient's quality of life, and 
functional results. A power analysis calculated a minimum of 11 patients to 
obtain statistical power, but we aim to include at least 25 patients. Limb 
discrepancy, clinical validation of infection eradication and fracture healing, 
radiographic validation, and patient-reported outcome measures will be 
highlighted and correlated. Statistical analysis of the results will offer data 
missing from the literature so far. Measurements are scheduled at specific times 
for each patient: preoperatively, 3 and 6 months postoperatively, 1 month after 
Ilizarov frame removal, and once per semester afterward until the end of the 
follow-up period (minimum 36 months). Laboratory evaluation will be assessed 
once per month. Any complication will be reported and treated when it occurs.
RESULTS: The trial has already started. It was funded in June 2020. As of May 
2022, 19 participants have been recruited and no major complications have been 
noticed yet. Data analysis will be performed after data collection ends, and 
results will be published afterward.
CONCLUSIONS: An infected metaphyseal tibial nonunion is a rare condition with 
limited treatment options and many controversies. There is no consensus in the 
literature about the best treatment strategy, and this lack of evidence should 
be fulfilled.

215,"The activity of neurons in the rodent hippocampus contributes to diverse 
behaviors, with the activity of ventral hippocampal neurons affecting behaviors 
related to anxiety and emotion regulation, and the activity of dorsal 
hippocampal neurons affecting performance in learning- and memory-related tasks. 
Hippocampal cells also express receptors for ovarian hormones, estrogen and 
progesterone, and are therefore affected by physiological fluctuations of those 
hormones that occur over the rodent estrous cycle. In this review, we discuss 
the effects of cycling ovarian hormones on hippocampal physiology. Starting with 
behavior, we explore the role of the estrous cycle in regulating 
hippocampus-dependent behaviors. We go on to detail the cellular mechanisms 
through which cycling estrogen and progesterone, through changes in the 
structural and functional properties of hippocampal neurons, may be eliciting 
these changes in behavior. Then, providing a basis for these cellular changes, 
we outline the epigenetic, chromatin regulatory mechanisms through which ovarian 
hormones, by binding to their receptors, can affect the regulation of behavior- 
and synaptic plasticity-related genes in hippocampal neurons. We also highlight 
an unconventional role that chromatin dynamics may have in regulating neuronal 
function across the estrous cycle, including in sex hormone-driven X chromosome 
plasticity and hormonally-induced epigenetic priming. Finally, we discuss 
directions for future studies and the translational value of the rodent estrous 
cycle for understanding the effects of the human menstrual cycle on hippocampal 
physiology and brain disease risk."
216,"OBJECTIVES: In this article, we aimed to evaluate the most recent information on 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of mothers and their babies.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search by utilizing online sources. 
Scientific papers that were written in English on the effects of COVID-19 on 
both mother and their newborn were assessed.
RESULTS: COVID-19 can be fatal, especially in pregnant women with accompanying 
chronic diseases. The timing and mode of delivery should be decided by the 
status of the mother and fetus instead of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in pregnant 
women. At the nursery, routine separation of SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and 
their infants is not recommended. However, it is important to take preventive 
measures to reduce the risk of transmission. The advantages of breastfeeding 
seem to outweigh the potential dangers of viral transmission. Neonatal COVID-19 
infections may cause different clinical pictures from asymptomatic infections to 
life-threatening diseases. International health authorities specifically 
recommend that pregnant and lactating women get vaccinated to diminish the risk 
of transmission of the virus to the mother and fetus, not giving preference to a 
certain vaccine. It is prudent to apply universal screening only in populations 
with a high prevalence of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals should carefully manage the perinatal 
period during the COVID-19 outbreak, using the most up-to-date information to 
protect and promote maternal and newborn health. Further scientific studies are 
needed to clarify the early and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
maternal-neonatal morbidity and mortality."
217,"IMPORTANCE: Lockdown measures and the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic are 
factors associated with increased risk of violence, yet there is limited 
information on trends in emergency department (ED) encounters for sexual 
assault.
OBJECTIVE: To compare changes in ED encounters for sexual assault during the 
COVID-19 pandemic vs prepandemic estimates.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, population-based cohort 
study used linked health administrative data from 197 EDs across Ontario, 
Canada, representing more than 15 million residents. Participants included all 
patients who presented to an ED in Ontario from January 11, 2019, to September 
10, 2021. Male and female individuals of all ages were included. Data analysis 
was performed from March to October 2022.
EXPOSURES: Sexual assault, defined through 27 International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, 
procedure and diagnoses codes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ten bimonthly time periods were used to compare 
differences in the frequency and rates of ED encounters for sexual assault 
between 2020 to 2021 (during the pandemic) compared with baseline prepandemic 
rates in 2019. Rate differences (RDs) and age adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) and 
Wald 95% CIs were calculated using Poisson regression.
RESULTS: From January 11, 2019, to September 10, 2021, there were 14 476 656 ED 
encounters, including 10 523 for sexual assault (9304 [88.4%] among female 
individuals). The median (IQR) age was 23 (17-33) years for female individuals 
and 15 (4-29) years for male individuals. Two months before the pandemic, ED 
encounters increased for sexual assault among female individuals (8.4 vs 6.9 
cases per 100 000; RD, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.96]; aRR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.09 to 
1.38]) and male individuals (1.2 vs 1.0 cases per 100 000; RD, 0.19 [95% CI, 
0.05 to 0.36]; aRR, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.64]). During the first 2 months of 
the pandemic, the rates decreased for female individuals (4.2 vs 8.3 cases per 
100 000; RD, -4.07 [95% CI, -4.48 to -3.67]; aRR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.58]) 
and male individuals (0.5 vs 1.2 cases per 100 000; RD, -0.72 [95% CI, -0.86 to 
-0.57]; aRR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.26 to 0.58]). For the remainder of the study 
period, the rates of sexual assault oscillated, returning to prepandemic levels 
during the summer months and between COVID-19 waves.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that lockdown protocols should 
evaluate the impact of limited care for sexual assault. Survivors should still 
present to EDs, especially when clinical care or legal interventions are needed."

vaccination rates and adverse COVID-19 outcomes in nursing homes.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which staff vaccination was associated with 
preventing COVID-19 cases and deaths among residents and staff in nursing homes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cohort study used data on 
COVID-19 outcomes in Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes in the US 
between May 30, 2021, and January 30, 2022. Participants included the residents 
of 15 042 US nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention and passed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services data quality checks in the National Healthcare Safety Network.
EXPOSURES: Weekly staff vaccination rates.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes are weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths 
among residents and weekly COVID-19 cases among staff. The treatment variable is 
the primary 2-dose staff vaccination rate in each facility each week.
RESULTS: In the primary analysis of 15 042 nursing homes before the Omicron 
variant wave (May 30 to December 5, 2021) using fixed effects of facility and 
week, increasing weekly staff vaccination rates by 10 percentage points was 
associated with 0.13 (95% CI, -0.20 to -0.10) fewer weekly COVID-19 cases per 
1000 residents, 0.02 (95% CI, -0.03 to -0.01) fewer weekly COVID-19 deaths per 
1000 residents, and 0.03 (95% CI, -0.04 to -0.02) fewer weekly COVID-19 staff 
cases. In the secondary analysis of the Omicron wave (December 5, 2021, to 
January 30, 2022), increasing staff vaccination rates were not associated with 
lower rates of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in nursing homes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that before 
the Omicron variant wave, increasing staff vaccination rates was associated with 
lower incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths among residents and staff in US 
nursing homes. However, as newer, more infectious and transmissible variants of 
the virus emerged, the original 2-dose regimen of the COVID-19 vaccine as 
recommended in December 2020 was no longer associated with lower rates of 
adverse COVID-19 outcomes in nursing homes. Policy makers may want to consider 
longer-term policy options to increase the uptake of booster doses among staff 
in nursing homes."
219,"Plain Language Summary: This Viewpoint discusses cost-sharing reform for chronic 
disease treatments as a strategy to improve patient outcomes, promote health 
equity, and minimize long-term health care expenditures in the US."
220,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of vitamin D (Vit D) supplementation on systemic 
biomarkers of collagen degradation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and copper 
metabolism in adolescent patients with keratoconus (KC).
METHODS: This was a prospective observational pilot study. Twenty patients (age 
range, 16-19 years) presenting KC and Vit D insufficiency (<30 ng/mL) were 
included. Vit D supplementation was prescribed by their general practitioner as 
per the standard of care. Patients were followed up for 12 months. At each 
visit, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), maximal keratometry 
(Kmax), and thinnest corneal thickness (TCT) were evaluated. The primary outcome 
of the study was the proportion of patients with Kmax progression of less than 1 
D throughout the 12-month follow-up time. Blood samples were collected at 
different time points to evaluate Vit D levels and systemic markers of collagen 
degradation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and copper metabolism by ELISA or 
RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Lower Vit D levels in the plasma were correlated with higher levels of 
systemic biomarkers of collagen degradation. Vit D supplementation increased the 
cell availability of copper. Moreover, stabilization of KC progression was found 
in 60% of patients (72% of eyes) after 12 months with Vit D supplementation. 
BSCVA, Kmax, and TCT rates remained stable during the observation period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that Vit D administration could affect ocular 
and systemic biomarkers in KC and illuminate a possible mechanism that can be 
used to develop new treatment alternatives.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Although KC therapy currently relies exclusively on 
surgical procedures, Vit D supplementation may offer a non-invasive and 
inexpensive alternative with minimal associated side effects."
221,"BACKGROUND: Truncating variants in desmoplakin (DSPtv) are an important cause of 
arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy; however the genetic architecture and 
genotype-specific risk factors are incompletely understood. We evaluated 
phenotype, risk factors for ventricular arrhythmias, and underlying genetics of 
DSPtv cardiomyopathy.
METHODS: Individuals with DSPtv and any cardiac phenotype, and their 
gene-positive family members were included from multiple international centers. 
Clinical data and family history information were collected. Event-free survival 
from ventricular arrhythmia was assessed. Variant location was compared between 
cases and controls, and literature review of reported DSPtv performed.
RESULTS: There were 98 probands and 72 family members (mean age at diagnosis 
43±8 years, 59% women) with a DSPtv, of which 146 were considered clinically 
affected. Ventricular arrhythmia (sudden cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular 
tachycardia, appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy) 
occurred in 56 (33%) individuals. DSPtv location and proband status were 
independent risk factors for ventricular arrhythmia. Further, gene region was 
important with variants in cases (cohort n=98; Clinvar n=167) more likely to 
occur in the regions, resulting in nonsense mediated decay of both major DSP 
isoforms, compared with n=124 gnomAD control variants (148 [83.6%] versus 29 
[16.4%]; P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest series of individuals with DSPtv, we demonstrate 
that variant location is a novel risk factor for ventricular arrhythmia, can 
inform variant interpretation, and provide critical insights to allow for 
precision-based clinical management."
222,"IMPORTANCE: Single-arm trials have allowed for transformative therapies to be 
made available to patients expeditiously. However, using single-arm trials to 
support drug approval presents several challenges that must be carefully 
considered.
OBSERVATIONS: Between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2021, the US Food and 
Drug Administration granted 176 new malignant hematology and oncology 
indications based on single-arm trials, including 116 accelerated approvals 
(AAs) and 60 traditional approvals. Overall, 87 approvals (49%) were for new 
molecular entities or original biologics and 89 (51%) were supplemental 
indications. Response rate (RR) was the most common end point used to support 
approval in these single-arm trials (173 of 176 [98%]). Of the 116 AAs based on 
single-arm trials, 45 (38%) fulfilled their postmarketing requirement to verify 
clinical benefit, 61 (52%) are pending verification of benefit, and 10 (9%) were 
withdrawn from the market as of December 31, 2021. Most (56 of 61 [92%]) AAs 
based on single-arm trials pending verification of benefit occurred during the 
previous 5 years and have ongoing confirmatory trials as of December 2021.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Single-arm trials have been a common development 
strategy to support regulatory approval as early-stage expansion cohorts with 
promising durable RRs have become more prevalent. In the appropriate context, 
single-arm trials using durable RRs can allow patients expedited access to novel 
therapies and will continue to serve a role in advancing drug development in 
oncology. However, single-arm trials have a smaller noncomparative safety data 
set, inability to use time-to-event end points, and other limitations that 
require careful consideration within the context of the disease and available 
therapies. The randomized clinical trial remains the preferred approach in 
clinical investigation."
223,"IMPORTANCE: Thyroid eye disease (TED) results in varying degrees of proptosis 
and diplopia negatively affecting quality of life (QoL), producing possibly 
substantial visual changes, disfigurement, and disability.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of varying TED severities with QoL in a 
non-TED population by assessing health state utility scores.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study, conducted from April 
20, 2020, to April 29, 2021, assessed health states for active, moderate-severe 
TED, and values were elicited using time trade-off methods. Six health states of 
varying severity were determined from 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials (171 
patients with TED and clinical activity score ≥4, ±diplopia/proptosis) and 
refined using interviews with US patients with TED (n = 6). Each health state 
description was validated by interviews with additional TED patient advocates 
(n = 3) and physician experts (n = 3). Health state descriptions and a QOL 
questionnaire were piloted and administered to a general population. Visual 
analog scales (VASs) were also administered to detect concurrence of the 
findings.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: TED health state utility scores and whether they 
differ from one another were assessed using Shapiro-Wilk, Kruskal-Wallis, 
pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum, and paired t tests.
RESULTS: A total of 111 participants completed time trade-off interviews. The 
mean (SD) utility value was 0.44 (0.34). The lowest (worse) mean utility value 
was observed in the most severe disease state (constant diplopia/large 
proptosis) with 0.30 (95% CI, 0.24-0.36), followed by constant diplopia/small 
proptosis (0.34; 95% CI, 0.29-0.40), intermittent or inconstant diplopia/large 
proptosis (0.43; 95% CI, 0.36-0.49), no diplopia/large proptosis (0.46; 95% CI, 
0.40-0.52), and intermittent or inconstant diplopia/small proptosis (0.52; 95% 
CI, 0.45-0.58). The highest (best) mean value, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.54-0.67), was 
observed for the least severe disease state (no diplopia/small proptosis).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that patients with active, 
moderate-severe TED may have substantial disutility, with increasing severity of 
proptosis/diplopia more likely to have detrimental associations with QoL. These 
health state scores may provide a baseline for determining QoL improvement in 
these TED health states (utility gains) treated with new therapies."
224,"PURPOSE: To measure fundus autofluorescence (FAF) lifetimes and peak emission 
wavelengths (PEW) of subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) in age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD) and their development over time.
METHODS: Fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) was performed in 30 
eyes with optical coherence tomography (OCT)-confirmed early or intermediate AMD 
and SDD. Contrasts of mean lifetimes in short- (SSC) and long-wavelength 
channels (LSC), PEW, and relative fluorescence intensity were determined as 
differences of the respective measures at individual SDD and their environment. 
Measurements were made at baseline and at follow-up intervals 1 (13-36 months) 
and 2 (37-72 months), respectively.
RESULTS: Of 423 SDD found at baseline, 259, 47, and 117 were 
hypoautofluorescent, isoautofluorescent, and hyperautofluorescent, respectively. 
FAF lifetimes of SDD were significantly longer than those of their environment 
by 14.5 ps (SSC, 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.3-15.7 ps) and 3.9 ps (LSC, 
3.1-4.7 ps). PEW was shorter by 1.53 nm (1.07-1.98 nm, all contrasts P < 0.001) 
with higher contrasts for hyperfluorescent SDD. Over follow-up, SDD tended to 
hyperautofluorescence (relative intensities increased by 3.4% [95% CI, 
2.9%-4.1%; P < 0.001] in follow-up 2). Hyperautofluorescence was associated with 
disruption of the ellipsoid zone on OCT. Disease progression to late-stage AMD 
was associated with higher lifetime contrast in SSC (15.9ps [14.2-17.6 ps] vs. 
11.7 ps [9.9-13.5 ps], P < 0.001) at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: SDD show longer FAF lifetimes and shorter PEW than their 
environments. A high lifetime contrast of SDD in SSC might predict disease 
progression to late-stage AMD."
225,"IMPORTANCE: Rectal cancer management has significantly evolved over the last 2 
decades.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate trends in the characteristics, 
treatment, and outcomes of rectal adenocarcinoma across 16 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, observational case series 
study used data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to evaluate patients 
diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma from 2004 through 2019. Data analysis was 
performed from March to May 2022.
EXPOSURES: Trends in the treatment and outcomes of rectal adenocarcinoma in the 
US between 2004 and 2019 were explored. This period was subdivided into 4 equal 
periods: 2004-2007, 2008-2011, 2012-2015, and 2016-2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient and tumor characteristics, treatments, 
short-term outcomes, and overall survival.
RESULTS: A total of 318 548 patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma were 
included in the analysis, 191 369 (60.1%) of whom were males and 127 179 
(39.9%%) were females. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 63.5 (13.4) years, 
and 46 824 patients (14.8%) were younger than 50 years. Among the patients, 10 
859 (3.4%) were of Asian race and ethnicity, 28 464 (8.9%) were Black, and 271 
236 (85.1%) were White. The percentage of patients younger than 50 years who 
were diagnosed with rectal cancer increased by 1.5%, from 13.9% in period 1 to 
15.4% in period 4. Patients in the last period (2016-2019) presented more often 
with stages III (36.2% vs 30.2% vs 25.0% vs 23.4%; P < .001) and IV (21.5% vs 
19.3% vs 18.1% vs 18.6%; P < .001) disease compared with those in the remaining 
3 periods. The use of chemotherapy (36.8% vs 48.1% vs 49.1% vs 47.0%; P < .001) 
and immunotherapy (0.4% vs 0.2% vs 3.5% vs 6.5%; P < .001) significantly 
increased across the 4 periods. Although neoadjuvant radiotherapy was used more 
often across the periods studied (28.6% in period 1 to 34.3% in period 4), the 
use of adjuvant radiotherapy was reduced by half (12.9% to 6.0%). The median 
(IQR) time from diagnosis to definitive surgery increased from 95 (15-126) days 
in period 1 to 128 (47-158) days in period 4. The rate of use of open surgery 
decreased by half (60.1% in period 2 to 30.1% in period 4), and the use of 
robotic surgery significantly increased (5.2% in period 2 to 28.4% in period 4). 
The conversion rate was significantly reduced (11.2% in period 2 to 7.3% in 
period 4) and the median (IQR) hospital stay decreased by 2 days, from 6 (3-9) 
days to 4 (2-7) days. The median (IQR) overall survival significantly increased 
across the periods (from 83.1 months [95% CI, 81.8-84.6 months] in period 1 to 
92.1 months [95% CI, 90.2-93.6 months] in period 3; P < .001).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this case series study suggest a 
treatment trend of increased use of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, 
sphincter-saving surgery, and minimally invasive surgery. In addition, the time 
between diagnosis and definitive surgery increased by a median of 33 days. This 
treatment trend was associated with a significant improvement in the overall 
survival, reduction in the conversion rate by 3.9%, and a 2-day shorter hospital 
stay. These findings have major clinical relevance to the management of rectal 
cancer. The improvements seen in short-term outcomes and survival of patients 
diagnosed with rectal cancer can probably be attributed to the treatment trends 
observed. Continued improvement in outcomes warrant further updates in 
treatments."
226,"BACKGROUND: Deciphering hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) pathogenesis is 
confounded by its genetic heterogeneity and oligogenic underpinnings.
METHODS: Whole genome sequences were analyzed by 3 independent strategies to 
identify HLHS gene candidates, ranked by variant, gene, and disease-level 
metrics.
RESULTS: First, a genome-wide association study of 174 cases and 853 controls 
revealed suggestive association with a MYO18B intron 33 variant (rs2269628-G; 
frequency=0.55 versus 0.39; OR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.54-2.52]; P=6.70×10-8). Second, 
transmission disequilibrium testing of 161 HLHS proband-parent trios revealed 
overrepresentation of a MYO18B intron 42 variant (rs73154186-A; frequency=0.05; 
OR, 24 [95% CI, 3.2-177.4]; P=4.23×10-6). Third, rare, predicted-damaging 
variants were filtered in 2 multiplex families. In 141H, two-fifth-degree 
relatives with HLHS shared a paternally-inherited MYO5A missense variant 
(p.Arg801Trp; frequency=0.00003; combined annotation-dependent depletion 
score=29), each with a maternally-inherited or de novo candidate modifier 
variant in a MYO5A-interacting conventional myosin. In 442H, a HLHS proband was 
compound heterozygous for MYO15A variants-a maternally-inherited pathogenic 
stop-gain variant co-segregating with tetralogy of Fallot and bicuspid aortic 
valve in maternal relatives (p.Tyr2819Ter; frequency=0.00003) and a 
paternally-inherited intronic variant altering a canonical transcription factor 
binding site (rs1277068603; frequency=0.00001; position weight matrix 
score=0.98).
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that common and rare alleles 
within unconventional myosin genes are associated with HLHS susceptibility. The 
identified candidate MYO18B regulates cardiac sarcomerogenesis, supporting the 
hypothesis of intrinsic myogenic perturbation in arrested left heart 
development."
227,"BACKGROUND: The 10-year Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk score is the 
standard approach to predict risk of incident cardiovascular events, and 
recently, addition of coronary artery disease (CAD) polygenic scores has been 
evaluated. Although age and sex strongly predict the risk of CAD, their 
interaction with genetic risk prediction has not been systematically examined. 
This study performed an extensive evaluation of age and sex effects in genetic 
CAD risk prediction.
METHODS: The population-based Norwegian HUNT2 (Trøndelag Health Study 2) cohort 
of 51 036 individuals was used as the primary dataset. Findings were replicated 
in the UK Biobank (372 410 individuals). Models for 10-year CAD risk were fitted 
using Cox proportional hazards, and Harrell concordance index, sensitivity, and 
specificity were compared.
RESULTS: Inclusion of age and sex interactions of CAD polygenic score to the 
prediction models increased the C-index and sensitivity by accounting for 
nonadditive effects of CAD polygenic score and likely countering the observed 
survival bias in the baseline. The sensitivity for females was lower than males 
in all models including genetic information. We identified a total of 82.6% of 
incident CAD cases by using a 2-step approach: (1) Atherosclerotic 
Cardiovascular Disease risk score (74.1%) and (2) the CAD polygenic score 
interaction model for those in low clinical risk (additional 8.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance and complexity of genetic 
risk in predicting CAD. There is a need for modeling age- and sex-interaction 
terms with polygenic scores to optimize detection of individuals at high risk, 
those who warrant preventive interventions. Sex-specific studies are needed to 
understand and estimate CAD risk with genetic information."
228,"BACKGROUND: Absence of a dicrotic notch on finger photoplethysmography is an 
easily ascertainable and inexpensive trait that has been associated with age and 
prevalent cardiovascular disease. However, the trait exists along a continuum, 
and little is known about its genetic underpinnings or prognostic value for 
incident cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: In 169 787 participants in the UK Biobank, we identified absent 
dicrotic notch on photoplethysmography and created a novel continuous trait 
reflecting notch smoothness using machine learning. Next, we determined the 
heritability, genetic basis, polygenic risk, and clinical relations for the 
binary absent notch trait and the newly derived continuous notch smoothness 
trait.
RESULTS: Heritability of the continuous notch smoothness trait was 7.5%, 
compared with 5.6% for the binary absent notch trait. A genome-wide association 
study of notch smoothness identified 15 significant loci, implicating genes 
including NT5C2 (P=1.2×10-26), IGFBP3 (P=4.8×10-18), and PHACTR1 (P=1.4×10-13), 
compared with 6 loci for the binary absent notch trait. Notch smoothness 
stratified risk of incident myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease, 
stroke, heart failure, and aortic stenosis. A polygenic risk score for notch 
smoothness was associated with incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause 
death in UK Biobank participants without available photoplethysmography data.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that a machine learning derived continuous trait 
reflecting dicrotic notch smoothness on photoplethysmography was heritable and 
associated with genes involved in vascular stiffness. Greater notch smoothness 
was associated with greater risk of incident cardiovascular disease. Raw digital 
phenotyping may identify individuals at risk for disease via specific genetic 
pathways."
229,"IMPORTANCE: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is prevalent 
globally and in the US. Management, particularly after disease recurrence, can 
be challenging, and exploring additional treatment modalities, such as 
therapeutic cancer vaccines, may offer an opportunity to improve outcomes in 
this setting.
OBSERVATIONS: This review provides an overview of the clinical efficacy of 
different treatment modalities that are currently available for the treatment of 
recurrent and metastatic HNSCC, including checkpoint inhibitors and targeted 
therapies, with a detailed summary of the numerous T-cell vaccines that have 
been studied in the setting of HNSCC, as well as a detailed summary of B-cell 
therapeutic vaccines being investigated for various malignant tumors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this review suggest that several 
therapeutic T-cell and B-cell vaccines, which have been recently developed and 
evaluated in a clinical setting, offer a promising treatment modality with the 
potential to improve outcomes for patients with recurrent and metastatic HNSCC."
230,"Therapeutic peptides have revolutionized treatment for a number of human 
diseases. In particular, the past two decades have witnessed rapid progress of 
stapled helical peptides in drug discovery. Stapled helical peptides are 
chemically modified and constrained in their bioactive α-helical conformation. 
Compared to unstabilized linear peptides, stapled helical peptides exhibit 
superior binding affinity and selectivity, enhanced membrane permeability, and 
improved metabolic stability, presenting exciting promise for targeting 
otherwise challenging protein-protein interfaces. In this Perspective, we 
summarize recent applications of high-throughput screening technologies for 
identification of potent stapled helical peptides with optimized binding 
properties. We expect to provide a broad reference to accelerate the development 
of stapled helical peptides as the next generation of therapeutic peptides for 
various human diseases."
231,"Recently, there has been increased interest in using mannan as an 
immunomodulatory bioconjugate. Despite notable immunological and functional 
differences between the reduced (R-Man) and oxidized (O-Man) forms of mannan, 
little is known about the impact of mannan oxidation state on its in vivo 
persistence or its potential controlled release from biomaterials that may 
improve immunotherapeutic or prophylactic efficacy. Here, we investigate the 
impact of oxidation state on the in vitro and in vivo release of mannan from a 
biocompatible and immunostimulatory multidomain peptide hydrogel, K2(SL)6K2 
(abbreviated as K2), that has been previously used for the controlled release of 
protein and small molecule payloads. We observed that O-Man released more slowly 
from K2 hydrogels in vitro than R-Man. In vivo, the clearance of O-Man from K2 
hydrogels was slower than O-Man alone. We attributed the slower release rate to 
the formation of dynamic imine bonds between reactive aldehyde groups on O-Man 
and the lysine residues on K2. This imine interaction was also observed to 
improve K2 + O-Man hydrogel strength and shear recovery without significantly 
influencing secondary structure or peptide nanofiber formation. There were no 
observed differences in the in vivo release rates of O-Man loaded in K2, R-Man 
loaded in K2, and R-Man alone. These data suggest that, after subcutaneous 
injection, R-Man naturally persists longer in vivo than O-Man and minimally 
interacts with the peptide hydrogel. These results highlight a potentially 
critical, but previously unreported, difference in the in vivo behavior of O-Man 
and R-Man and demonstrate that K2 can be used to normalize the release of O-Man 
to that of R-Man. Further, since K2 itself is an adjuvant, a combination of 
O-Man and K2 could be used to enhance the immunostimulatory effects of O-Man for 
applications such as infectious disease vaccines and cancer immunotherapy."
232,"Piezo ion channel is a mechanosensitive protein on the cell membrane, which 
contains Piezo1 and Piezo2. Piezo channels are activated by mechanical forces, 
including stretch, matrix stiffness, static pressure, and shear stress. Piezo 
channels transmit mechanical signals that cause different downstream responses 
in the differentiation process, including integrin signaling pathway, ERK1/2 
MAPK signaling pathway, Notch signaling, and WNT signaling pathway. In the fate 
of stem cell differentiation, scientists found differences in Piezo channel 
expression and found that Piezo channel expression is related to developmental 
diseases. Here, we briefly review the structure and function of Piezo channels 
and the relationship between Piezo and mechanical signals, discussing the 
current understanding of the role of Piezo channels in stem cell fate and 
associated molecules and developmental diseases. Ultimately, we believe this 
review will help identify the association between Piezo channels and stem cell 
fate."
233,"BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is known to result in endocrine dysfunction 
(prediabetes, diabetes). The objective of this study was to determine the 
temporal incidence of endocrine dysfunction after onset of AP and determine the 
risk factors in Indian patients.
METHODS: In this prospective study, enrolled patients diagnosed with AP between 
February 2019 and May 2019 were followed at 3, 6, and 12 months until May 2020. 
Patients with recurrent AP, chronic pancreatitis, and pre-existing endocrine 
dysfunction were excluded. Demographic and disease severity (clinical, 
laboratory, and radiological) data were recorded. Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square 
tests were used to compare groups. Temporal trend for development of endocrine 
dysfunction was evaluated using the Extended Mantel Haenszel Chi-square test for 
trend. Logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors.
RESULTS: Eighty-six patients (males 66, median [IQR] age 33.0 [26.0-44.2] years) 
who fulfilled enrolment criteria were finally analyzed. The most common etiology 
was alcohol (n=31 [36%]) followed by gallstones (n=17 [19.8%]). The proportion 
of patients with moderately severe acute pancreatitis and severe AP were 59.3% 
and 15.1%, respectively. Overall, the frequency of prediabetes and diabetes 
increased temporally across the follow-up period. These were 2 (2.33%) and 1 
(1.16%) at 3 months, 11 (12.8%) and 5 (5.81%) at 6 months, and 20 (23.2%) and 9 
(10.5%) at 1 year, respectively. On multivariable logistic regression, 
intervention for walled-off necrosis (WON) emerged as the single independent 
risk factor for endocrine dysfunction (odds ratio 9.01 [2.3-35.5]; p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Endocrine dysfunction is frequent after an episode of AP. 
Intervention for WON is an independent risk factor for endocrine dysfunction."

collateral status."
235,"L-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA) is an inherited neurometabolic disorder 
caused by deficient activity of L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. 
L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid (L-2-HG) accumulation in the brain and biological 
fluids is the biochemical hallmark of this disease. Patients present exclusively 
neurological symptoms and brain abnormalities, particularly in the cerebral 
cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Since the pathogenesis of this disorder 
is still poorly established, we investigated the short-lived effects of an 
intracerebroventricular injection of L-2-HG to neonatal rats on redox 
homeostasis in the cerebellum, which is mostly affected in this disorder. We 
also determined immunohistochemical landmarks of neuronal viability (NeuN), 
astrogliosis (S100B and GFAP), microglia activation (Iba1), and myelination (MBP 
and CNPase) in the cerebral cortex and striatum following L-2-HG administration. 
Finally, the neuromotor development and cognitive abilities were examined. 
L-2-HG elicited oxidative stress in the cerebellum 6 h after its injection, 
which was verified by increased reactive oxygen species production, lipid 
oxidative damage, and altered antioxidant defenses (decreased concentrations of 
reduced glutathione and increased glutathione peroxidase and superoxide 
dismutase activities). L-2-HG also decreased the content of NeuN, MBP, and 
CNPase, and increased S100B, GFAP, and Iba1 in the cerebral cortex and striatum 
at postnatal days 15 and 75, implying long-standing neuronal loss, 
demyelination, astrocyte reactivity, and increased inflammatory response, 
respectively. Finally, L-2-HG administration caused a delay in neuromotor 
development and a deficit of cognition in adult animals. Importantly, the 
antioxidant melatonin prevented L-2-HG-induced deleterious neurochemical, 
immunohistochemical, and behavioral effects, indicating that oxidative stress 
may be central to the pathogenesis of brain damage in L-2-HGA."
236,"We aim to explore the link between maternal weekly temperature exposure and CHD 
in offspring and identify the relative contributions from heat and cold and from 
moderate and extreme atmospheric temperature. From January 2019 to December 
2020, newborns who were diagnosed with CHD by echocardiography in the Network 
Platform for Congenital Heart Disease (NPCHD) from 11 cities in eastern China 
were enrolled in the present study. We appraised the exposure lag response 
relationship between temperature and CHDs in the distributed lag nonlinear model 
and further probed the pooled estimates by multivariate meta-analysis. We 
further performed the exposure-response curves in extreme temperature (5th 
percentile for cold and 95th for hot events). We also delve into the cumulative 
risk ratios (CRRs) of temperature on CHDs in general and subgroups. In this 
study, 5904 of 983, 523 infants were diagnosed with CHDs. The temperature-CHD 
combination performed positive significance in two exposure windows, gestational 
weeks 10-16 and 26-31, and reached the maximum effect in the 28th week. Compared 
with extreme cold (5th, 6.14℃), these effects were higher in extreme heat (95th, 
29.26℃). The cumulative exposure-response curve showed a steep nonlinear rise in 
the hot tail but showed non-significance at low temperatures. In this range, the 
CRRs of temperature showed an increment to a ceiling of 3.781 (95% CI: 
1.460-10.723). The temperature- CHD curves for both sex groups showed a general 
growth trend. No statistical significance was observed between these two groups 
(P = 0.106). The cumulative effect of the temperature related CHD was 
significant in regions with lower education levels (maximum CRR was 9.282 
(3.019-28.535)). A degree centigrade increase in temperature exposure was 
associated with the increment of CHD risk in the first and second trimesters, 
especially in extreme heat. Neonates born in lower education regions were more 
vulnerable to temperature-related CHDs."
237,"The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a significant 
health emergency to adverse impact on environment, and human society. The 
COVID-19 post-pandemic not only affects human beings but also creates pollution 
crisis in environment. The post-pandemic situation has shown a drastic change in 
nature due to biomedical waste load and other components. The inadequate 
segregation of untreated healthcare wastes, chemical disinfectants, and 
single-use plastics leads to contamination of the water, air, and agricultural 
fields. These materials allow the growth of disease-causing agents and 
transmission. Particularly, the COVID-19 outbreak has posed a severe 
environmental and health concern in many developing countries for infectious 
waste. In 2030, plastic enhances a transboundary menace to natural ecological 
communities and public health. This review provides a complete overview of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on environmental pollution and its anthropogenic impacts to 
public health and natural ecosystem considering short- and long-term scenarios. 
The review thoroughly assesses the impacts on ecosystem in the terrestrial, 
marine, and atmospheric realms. The information from this evaluation can be 
utilized to assess the short-term and long-term solutions for minimizing any 
unfavorable effects. Especially, this topic focuses on the excessive use of 
plastics and their products, subsequently with the involvement of the scientific 
community, and policymakers will develop the proper management plan for the 
upcoming generation. This article also provides crucial research gap knowledge 
to boost national disaster preparedness in future perspectives."
238,"Recent investments in built environment infrastructure to create healthy 
communities have highlighted the need for equity and environmental justice. 
Although the benefits of healthy community design (e.g., connecting 
transportation systems and land use changes) are well established, some reports 
suggest that these changes may increase property values. These increases can 
raise the risk of displacement for people with low incomes and/or who are from 
racial and ethnic minority groups, who would then miss out on benefits from 
changes in community design. This review scanned the literature for displacement 
mitigation and prevention measures, with the goal of providing a compilation of 
available strategies for a wide range of audiences including public health 
practitioners. A CDC librarian searched the Medline, EbscoHost, Scopus, and 
ProQuest Central databases, and we identified grey literature using Google and 
Google Scholar searches. The indexed literature search identified 6 articles, 
and the grey literature scan added 18 articles. From these 24 total articles, we 
identified 141 mitigation and prevention strategies for displacement and 
thematically characterized each by domain using an adapted existing typology. 
This work provides a well-categorized inventory for practitioners and sets the 
stage for future evaluation research on the implementation of strategies and 
practices to reduce displacement."
239,"National trends in gonorrhea rates may obscure informative local variations in 
morbidity. We used group-based trajectory models to identify groups of counties 
with similar gonorrhea rate trajectories among non-Hispanic White (NHW) and 
non-Hispanic Black (NHB) females using county-level data on gonorrhea cases in 
US females from 2003 to 2018. We assessed models with 1-15 groups and selected 
final models based on fit statistics and identification of divergent trajectory 
groups with distinct intercepts and/or slopes. We mapped counties by assigned 
trajectory group and examined the association of county characteristics with 
group membership. We identified 7 distinct gonorrhea trajectory groups for NHW 
females and 9 distinct trajectory groups for NHB females. All identified groups 
for NHW female morbidity experienced increasing gonorrhea rates with a limited 
range (11.6-183.3/100,000 NHW females in 2018); trajectories of NHB female 
morbidity varied widely in rates (146.6-966.0/1000 NHB females in 2018) and 
included 3 groups of counties that experienced a net decline in gonorrhea rates. 
Counties with higher NHW female morbidity had lower adult sex ratios, lower 
health insurance coverage, and lower marital rates among NHW adults. Counties 
with higher NHB female morbidity were more urban, experienced higher rates of 
poverty, and had lower rates of marriage among NHB adults. Morbidity patterns 
did not always follow geographic proximity, which could be explained by 
variation in social determinants of health. Our results demonstrated a highly 
heterogenous gonorrhea epidemic among NHW and NHB US females, which should 
prompt further analysis into the differential drivers of gonorrhea morbidity."
240,"The structure of N-glycans on specific proteins can regulate innate and adaptive 
immunity via sensing environmental signals. Meanwhile, the structural diversity 
of N-glycans poses analytical challenges that limit the exploration of specific 
glycosylation functions. In this work, we used THP-1-derived macrophages as 
examples to show the vast potential of a N-glycan structural interpretation tool 
StrucGP in N-glycoproteomic analysis. The intact glycopeptides of macrophages 
were enriched and analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS)-based glycoproteomic 
approaches, followed by the large-scale mapping of site-specific glycan 
structures via StrucGP. Results revealed that bisected GlcNAc, core fucosylated, 
and sialylated glycans (e.g., HexNAc4Hex5Fuc1Neu5Ac1, N4H5F1S1) were increased 
in M1 and M2 macrophages, especially in the latter. The findings indicated that 
these structures may be closely related to macrophage polarization. In addition, 
a high level of glycosylated PD-L1 was observed in M1 macrophages, and the 
LacNAc moiety was detected at Asn-192 and Asn-200 of PD-L1, and Asn-200 
contained Lewis epitopes. The precision structural interpretation of 
site-specific glycans and subsequent intervention of target glycoproteins and 
related glycosyltransferases are of great value for the development of new 
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for different diseases."
241,"Chemotherapy, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and arsenic are effective options 
for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). We conducted a 20-year retrospective 
analysis of newly diagnosed (ND) APL patients treated with arsenic, ATRA and 
mitoxantrone. After achieving complete remission (CR), patients received 3-5 
cycles of chemotherapy followed by AS4S4 maintenance for 3 years. Eighty-eight 
ND APL patients were treated with either oral AS4S4 (n = 42) or arsenic trioxide 
(ATO) (n = 46). The 8-year overall survival (OS) rate was 100% in the AS4S4 
group and 90% in the ATO group. The disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 100% 
and 87.1% (p = 0.027), respectively. Patients in the ATO group had more side 
effects. A subsequent cohort of 33 ND APL patients received triple therapy with 
oral AS4S4, ATRA, and chemotherapy. The 13-year OS and DFS rates were 100% and 
90.9%. Our long-term analyses show that APL patients with oral AS4S4 had better 
outcomes compared to ATO, with no need for hospitalization."
242,"This study was conducted on 600 one-day-old male broiler chicks, using a 2 × 6 
factorial design (ambient temperature, A x feed additive, F), for a period of 
42 days. The chicks assigned to different groups were exposed to thermoneutral 
(TN, 24 ± 1 °C) and constant heat stress (HT, 36 ± 1 °C) conditions, and were 
only fed on a basal diet, and a basal diet supplemented with either 100 mg/kg 
chloramphenicol, 50 IU/kg α-tocopherol, or 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg of cumin 
essential oil (CEO). The results showed that heat stress adversely affected 
performance and carcass characteristics, and increased both the mortality rate 
and footpad lesions. Moreover, constant chronic heat stress showed negative 
effects on serum biochemistry and the intestinal microbiota, increased 
antioxidant activity in both the plasma and breast meat, and increased counts of 
the pathogenic microorganisms in the small intestine. On the other hand, dietary 
CEO supplementation positively affected these parameters. CEO had a slight 
effect on performance, carcass characteristics, mortality rate and the incidence 
of footpad lesions. When compared to the control group, it was determined that 
CEO generally had a positive effect on lipid peroxidation in the plasma and 
tissues and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity. Furthermore, CEO positively 
affected serum biochemistry and counts of beneficial microorganisms in the small 
intestine."
243,"BACKGROUND: Accurate classification of sites of interest on prostate-specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) images is an 
important diagnostic requirement for the differentiation of prostate cancer 
(PCa) from foci of physiologic uptake. We developed a deep learning and 
radiomics framework to perform lesion-level and patient-level classification on 
PSMA PET images of patients with PCa.
METHODS: This was an IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study. Lesions 
on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT scans were assigned to PSMA reporting and data system 
(PSMA-RADS) categories and randomly partitioned into training, validation, and 
test sets. The framework extracted image features, radiomic features, and tissue 
type information from a cropped PET image slice containing a lesion and 
performed PSMA-RADS and PCa classification. Performance was evaluated by 
assessing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). A 
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis was performed. 
Confidence and probability scores were measured. Statistical significance was 
determined using a two-tailed t test.
RESULTS: PSMA PET scans from 267 men with PCa had 3794 lesions assigned to 
PSMA-RADS categories. The framework yielded AUROC values of 0.87 and 0.90 for 
lesion-level and patient-level PSMA-RADS classification, respectively, on the 
test set. The framework yielded AUROC values of 0.92 and 0.85 for lesion-level 
and patient-level PCa classification, respectively, on the test set. A t-SNE 
analysis revealed learned relationships between the PSMA-RADS categories and 
disease findings. Mean confidence scores reflected the expected accuracy and 
were significantly higher for correct predictions than for incorrect predictions 
(P < 0.05). Measured probability scores reflected the likelihood of PCa 
consistent with the PSMA-RADS framework.
CONCLUSION: The framework provided lesion-level and patient-level PSMA-RADS and 
PCa classification on PSMA PET images. The framework was interpretable and 
provided confidence and probability scores that may assist physicians in making 
more informed clinical decisions."
244,"Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the most dangerous complications of pregnancy, 
characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and symptoms of multiple organ 
failure, which are detected de novo after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is one of the first to recognize 
pregnancy and is an important regulator of blood pressure. The placenta has its 
own RAAS, the role of which in the development of PE is not fully understood. In 
this work, for the first time, we characterized the expression of RAAS 
components and miRNAs controlling it in the placenta at various times of PE 
manifestation. The data obtained will allow the development of a new strategy in 
the future for the search for therapeutic agents for patients suffering from PE 
and cardiovascular diseases."
245,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) has been used to detect rare causative variants in 
neurological diseases. However, the efficacy of WES in genetic diagnosis of 
clinically heterogeneous familial stroke remains inconclusive. We prospectively 
searched for disease-causing variants in unrelated probands with defined 
familial stroke by candidate gene/hotspot screening and/or WES, depending on 
stroke subtypes and neuroimaging features at a referral center. The clinical 
significance of each variant was determined according to the American College of 
Medical Genetics guidelines. Among 161 probands (mean age at onset 53.2 ± 13.7 
years; male 63.4%), 33 participants (20.5%) had been identified with 19 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (PVs; WES applied 152/161 = 94.4%). Across 
subtypes, the highest hit rate (HR) was intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH, 
7/18 = 38.9%), particularly with the etiological subtype of structural 
vasculopathy (4/4 = 100%, PVs in ENG, KRIT1, PKD1, RNF213); followed by ischemic 
small vessel disease (SVD, 15/48 = 31.3%; PVs in NOTCH3, HTRA1, HBB). In 
contrast, large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 4/44 = 9.1%) and cardioembolism 
(0/11 = 0%) had the lowest HR. NOTCH3 was the most common causative gene 
(16/161 = 9.9%), presenting with multiple subtypes of SVD (n = 13), ICH (n = 2), 
or LAA (n = 1). Importantly, we disclosed two previously unreported PVs, KRIT1 
p.E379* in a familial cerebral cavernous malformation, and F2 p.F382L in a 
familial cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The contribution of monogenic 
etiologies was particularly high in familial ICH and SVD subtypes in our 
Taiwanese cohort. Utilizing subtype-guided hotspot screening and/or subsequent 
WES, we unraveled monogenic causes in 20.5% familial stroke probands, including 
1.2% novel PVs. Genetic diagnosis may enable early diagnosis, management and 
lifestyle modification. Among 161 familial stroke probands, 33 (20.5%) had been 
identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic monogenic variants related to stroke. 
The positive hit rate among all subtypes was high in intracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH) and ischemic small vessel disease (SVD). Notably, two previously 
unreported variants, KRIT1 p.E379* in a familial cerebral cavernous malformation 
and F2 p.F382L in familial cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, were disclosed. CVT

246,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The omega-3 fatty acids (n3-FAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have recently undergone testing for their 
ability to reduce residual cardiovascular (CV) risk among statin-treated 
subjects. The outcome trials have yielded highly inconsistent results, perhaps 
attributable to variations in dosage, formulation, and composition. In 
particular, CV trials using icosapent ethyl (IPE), a highly purified ethyl ester 
of EPA, reproducibly reduced CV events and progression of atherosclerosis 
compared with mixed EPA/DHA treatments. This review summarizes the mechanistic 
evidence for differences among n3-FAs on the development and manifestations of 
atherothrombotic disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Large randomized clinical trials with n3-FAs have produced 
discordant outcomes despite similar patient profiles, doses, and triglyceride 
(TG)-lowering effects. A large, randomized trial with IPE, a prescription EPA 
only formulation, showed robust reduction in CV events in statin treated 
patients in a manner proportional to achieved blood EPA concentrations. Multiple 
trials using mixed EPA/DHA formulations have not shown such benefits, despite 
similar TG lowering. These inconsistencies have inspired investigations into 
mechanistic differences among n3-FAs, as EPA and DHA have distinct membrane 
interactions, metabolic products, effects on cholesterol efflux, antioxidant 
properties, and tissue distribution. EPA maintains normal membrane cholesterol 
distribution, enhances endothelial function, and in combination with statins 
improves features implicated in plaque stability and reduces lipid content of 
plaques. Insights into reductions in residual CV risk have emerged from clinical 
trials using different formulations of n3-FAs. Among high-risk patients on 
contemporary care, mixed n3-FA formulations showed no reduction in CV events. 
The distinct benefits of IPE in multiple trials may arise from pleiotropic 
actions that correlate with on-treatment EPA levels beyond TG-lowering. These 
effects include altered platelet function, inflammation, cholesterol 
distribution, and endothelial dysfunction. Elucidating such mechanisms of 
vascular protection for EPA may lead to new interventions for atherosclerosis, a 
disease that continues to expand worldwide."
247,"PURPOSE: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) patients often have suspected 
isolated aortic arch anomalies (IAAA) on imaging. The purpose of this work was 
to describe the incidence and outcomes of CDH + IAAA patients.
METHODS: Cardiovascular data were collected for infants from the CDH Study Group 
born between 2007 and 2019. IAAA were defined as coarctation of aorta, 
hypoplastic aortic arch, interrupted aortic arch, and aortic aneurysmal disease 
on early, postnatal echocardiography. Patients with major cardiac malformations 
and/or chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. Primary outcomes included the 
rate of aortic intervention, rates of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) 
utilization, and mortality.
RESULTS: Of 6357 CDH infants, 432 (7%) were diagnosed with a thoracic aortic 
anomaly. Of these, 165 were diagnosed with IAAA, most commonly coarctation of 
the aorta (n = 106; 64%) or hypoplastic aortic arch (n = 58; 35%). CDH + IAAA 
patients had lower birthweights (3 kg vs. 2.9 kg) and Apgar scores (7 vs. 6) 
than patients without IAAA (both χ2 p < 0.001). CDH + IAAA were less likely to 
undergo diaphragm repair (72 vs. 87%, p < 0.001), and overall mortality was 
higher for CDH + IAAA infants (58 vs. 24%, p < 0.001). When controlling for 
defect size, birth weight, and Apgar, IAAA were significantly associated with 
mortality (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.2-5.0; p < 0.01) but not associated with ECLS (OR 
0.98, 95% CI 0.65-1.50; p = 0.90). Only 17% (n = 28) of CDH + IAAA patients 
underwent aortic intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: IAAA in CDH are associated with increased mortality. This often 
simply reflects severity of the defect and thoracic anatomic derangement, as 
opposed to unique aortic pathology, given few CDH + IAAA patients undergo aortic 
intervention."
248,"Bone marrow-derived neural stem cells (BM-NSCs) have shed light on novel 
therapeutic approaches for PD with the potential to halt or even reverse disease 
progression. Various strategies have been developed to promote therapeutic 
efficacy via optimizing implanted cells and the microenvironment of 
transplantation in the central nervous system (CNS). This current study further 
proved that the combination of fasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, and BM-NSCs 
exhibited a synergetic effect on restoring neuron loss in the MPTP-PD mice 
model. It simultaneously unveiled cellular mechanisms underlying synergistic 
neuron-protection effects of fasudil and BM-NSCs, which included promoting the 
proliferation, and migration of endogenous NSCs, and contributing to microglia 
shift into the M2 phenotype. Corresponding molecular mechanisms were observed, 
including the inhibition of inflammatory responses, the elevation of 
neurotrophic factors, and the induction of WNT/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
signaling pathways. Our study provides evidence for the co-intervention of 
BM-NSCs and fasudil as a promising therapeutic method with enhanced efficacy in 
treating neurodegenerative diseases."
249,"BACKGROUND: The basidiomycete fungus, Ganoderma boninense is the main 
contributor to oil palm Basal Stem Rot (BSR) in Malaysia and Indonesia. 
Lanosterol 14α-Demethylase (ERG11) is a key enzyme involved in biosynthesis of 
ergosterol, which is an important component in the fungal cell membrane. The 
Azole group fungicides are effective against pathogenic fungi including G. 
boninense by inhibiting the ERG11 activity. However, the work on molecular 
characterization of G. boninense ERG11 is still unavailable today.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study aimed to isolate and characterize the 
full-length cDNA encoding ERG11 from G. boninense. The G. boninense ERG11 gene 
expression during interaction with oil palm was also studied. A full-length 
1860 bp cDNA encoding ERG11 was successfully isolated from G. boninense. The G. 
boninense ERG11 shared 91% similarity to ERG11 from other basidiomycete fungi. 
The protein structure homology modeling of GbERG11 was analyzed using the 
SWISS-MODEL workspace. Southern blot and genome data analyses showed that there 
is only a single copy of ERG11 gene in the G. boninense genome. Based on the 
in-vitro inoculation study, the ERG11 gene expression in G. boninense has shown 
almost 2-fold upregulation with the presence of oil palm.
CONCLUSION: This study provided molecular information and characterization study 
on the G. boninense ERG11 and this knowledge could be used to design effective 
control measures to tackle the BSR disease of oil palm."
250,"Diabetes-related cognitive impairment has been shown in diverse epidemiological 
investigations and lab-based studies, although the underlying pathological 
mechanisms remain unclear. Unbalanced protein homeostasis may contribute to 
cognitive decline by inducing abnormal protein aggregation in the diabetic 
brain. This study aimed to determine possible changes in the proteasome, which 
is an important pathway involved in abnormal protein degradation. To this end, 
we examined potential alterations of proteasomal subunits and hydrolytic 
activity in the brain of diabetic rats fed with high-fat diet combined with 
small doses of streptozotocin (STZ). Furthermore, lactacystin were used to 
inhibit proteasomal activity in vivo and typical Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like 
pathologies were detected, including amyloid-beta, tau phosphorylation, and 
oxidative protein changes. Our results showed that proteasomal activity 
increased in the brains of diabetic rats compared to age-matched control rats. 
After proteasome inhibition, the levels of tau phosphorylation and protein 
oxidative modification significantly increased; however, no changes were 
detected in the pathway involved in amyloid production. These results indicated 
that changes in protein homeostasis balance in diabetes play a role in some 
typical AD-like changes, especially in oxidative protein degradation, providing 
evidence that prevention of diabetes-induced protein imbalance may be a 
potential therapeutic target."
251,"This study aimed to assess the associations of total body fat and fat 
distribution with bone mineral density (BMD) among children and adolescents in 
this cross-sectional study. A total of 1032 boys and 897 girls aged 6-17 years 
were enrolled between May 2019 and June 2019 in Guangzhou, China. BMD, total 
body fat (fat mass index [FMI] and body fat percentage [BF%]), and fat 
distribution (trunk-to-limb and android-to-gynoid ratios) were measured by 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Inverse probability of treatment weighting 
regression was used to explore the association between fat and BMD. Traditional 
regression of covariate adjustment was applied as sensitivity analysis. 
Regression with inverse probability weighting suggested BF% and 
android-to-gynoid ratio were negatively associated with BMD in boys (β =  - 0.12 
and - 0.16, respectively; P < 0.05). Android-to-gynoid ratio was also inversely 
associated with BMD in girls (β =  - 0.08, P < 0.05). When stratified by age, 
the negative associations were retained in boys aged 12-17 years (β =  - 0.23 
and - 0.25, respectively; P < 0.001). But for girls, it showed a positive 
association of FMI with BMD in the 6-9 years group (β = 0.33, P < 0.001) and a 
negative association between the android-to-gynoid ratio and BMD in the 
10-17 years group (β =  - 0.10, P < 0.05). Traditional regression supported the 
robustness of the results.  Conclusion: Total body fat is positively associated 
with BMD in younger girls but inversely associated in older boys. As for 
abdominal adipose, it is associated with lower BMD in both older boys and girls. 
What is Known: • The lean mass has been consistently positively associated with 
bone mineral density (BMD) among children and adolescents. However, the impact 
of fat mass on BMD remained controversial. • Beyond total body fat, 
site-specific fat mass, especially abdominal adiposity, might impede bone 
formation. What is New: • The associations of total body fat and fat 
distribution with BMD in children and adolescents were gender- and age-specific. 
• More attention should be paid to the abdominal fat accumulation to promote 
bone health in older children."
252,"Older adults have diminished immune responses that increase susceptibility to 
infectious diseases, such as influenza (flu). In older adults, flu infection can 
lead to hospitalization, catastrophic disability, and mortality. We previously 
demonstrated severe and prolonged muscle degradation and atrophy in aged mice 
during flu infection. Here, we utilized an unbiased transcriptomic analysis to 
elucidate mechanisms of flu-induced muscular declines in a mouse model. Our 
results showed age-related gene expression differences including downregulation 
of genes associated with muscle regeneration and organization and upregulation 
of genes associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and migratory immune 
pathways in aged mice when compared to young. Pathway analysis revealed 
significant enrichment of leukocyte migration and T cell activation pathways in 
the aged muscle during infection. Intramuscular CD4 T cells increased in both 
young and aged mice during infection, while intramuscular CD8 T cells increased 
exclusively in aged muscle. CD4 T cells in young muscle were regulatory T cells 
(Treg), while those in aged were T follicular helper (Tfh) and Th2 cells. 
Correspondingly, IL-33, an important cytokine for Treg accumulation within 
tissue, increased only in young flu-infected muscle. Conversely, CXCL10 (IP-10) 
increased only in aged muscle suggesting a continued recruitment of CD8 T cells 
into the aged muscle during flu infection. Overall, our findings elucidate a 
link between flu-induced disability and dysregulated intracellular T cell 
recruitment into flu-injured muscle with aging. Furthermore, we uncovered 
potential pathways involved that can be targeted to develop preventative and 
therapeutic interventions to avert disability and maintain independence 
following infection."
253,"HIV disclosure is crucial for HIV prevention and control, but may also lead to 
discrimination, insult, and even violence against people living with HIV and 
AIDS (PLWHAs). In this study, we examined HIV disclosure, its influencing 
factors, and its association with intimate partner violence (IPV) among 1153 
PLWHAs through the sexual route in Jinan, Shandong Province, China. Our results 
showed that 76.4% (881/1153) PLWHAs had disclosed someone about their HIV 
infection, the HIV disclosure rates among family members, friends, spouses, and 
current fixed partners of PLWHAs were 43.5% (501/1153), 47.9% (552/1153), 56.8% 
(129/227), and 43.2% (336/777), respectively. HIV disclosure was affected by 
socio-demographics, disease characteristics, and psycho-social factors and 
varied among family members, close friends, spouses, and current fixed sexual 
partners. Age ≤ 33 years (aOR 1.79, 95% CI 1.27-2.53), heterosexual infection 
route (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06-2.17), HIV diagnosis time > 36 months (aOR 1.84, 
95% CI 1.30-2.59), with other chronic diseases (aOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.34-2.61), 
lower self-stigma (aOR 4.03-4.36, 95% CI 1.98-8.74), higher social support (aOR 
1.71-1.73, 95% CI 1.03-2.83), no depression (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.12-2.11), and no 
suicidal ideation (aOR 1.79, 95% CI 1.28-2.50) were all independently associated 
with increased likelihood of HIV disclosure. HIV disclosure was associated with 
an increased risk of IPV among current fixed sexual partners (aOR 1.87, 95% CI 
1.38-2.54) and spouses (aOR 2.54, 95% CI 1.41-4.56). Our findings suggest that 
the HIV disclosure rate of PLWHAs is still low and is affected by multiple 
factors. There is an urgent need to design targeted and comprehensive 
interventions to improve HIV disclosure. IPV prevention should also be 
incorporated into the intervention system of HIV disclosure to ensure adequate 
and continuous support for PLWHAs."
254,"Maintainance of sulfomucin is a key end point in the treatment of diarrhea and 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the mechanisms underlying the 
microbial sense to sulfomucin are poorly understood, and to date, there are no 
therapies targeting the secretion and maturation of sulfomucin in IBD. Herein, 
we biosynthesized poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and found that PHB could 
alleviate inflammation caused by diarrhea and colitis by enhancing the 
differentiation of sulfomucin. Microbiota transplantation and clearance together 
demonstrate that PHB promoting sulfomucin is mediated by Lactobacillus johnsonii 
(L. johnsonii). Further studies revealed that PHB provides a favorable niche for 
L. johnsonii biofilm formation to resist disturbance and support its growth. L. 
johnsonii-biofilm alleviates colitis by regulating fucose residues to promote 
goblet cell differentiation and subsequent sulfomucin maturation. Importantly, 
PHB alleviates colitis by enhancing sulfomucin secretion and maturation in a L. 
johnsonii-dependent manner. PHB represents a class of guardians, acting as a 
safe probiotic-biofilm delivery system that significantly promotes probiotic 
proliferation. Altogether, this study adds weight to the possible role of 
probiotics and functional materials in the treatment of intestinal inflammation. 
The application of PHB and biofilm self-coating L. johnsonii carries high 
translational potential and may be of clinical relevance."
255,"Silent information regulator (SIRT) has distinctive enzymatic activities and 
physiological functions to control cell-cycle progression, gene expression, and 
DNA stability by targeting histone and non-histone proteins. SIRT1 enhances 
synaptic formation and synaptic activity, and therefore, can reduce the 
progression of various degenerative brain diseases including Parkinson's disease 
(PD). SIRT1 activity is decreased by aging with a subsequent increased risk for 
the development of degenerative brain diseases. Inhibition of SIRT1 promotes 
inflammatory reactions since SIRT1 inhibits transcription of nuclear factor 
kappa B (NF-κB) which also inhibits SIRT1 activation via activation of microRNA 
and miR-34a which reduce NAD synthesis. SIRT1 is highly expressed in microglia 
as well as neurons, and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. 
Therefore, this review aimed to find the possible role of SIRT1 in PD 
neuropathology. SIRT1 has neuroprotective effects; therefore, downregulation of 
SIRT1 during aging promotes p53 expression and may increase the vulnerability of 
neuronal cell deaths. PD neuropathology is linked with the sequence of 
inflammatory changes and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to the 
activation of inflammatory signaling pathways. In addition, oxidative stress, 
inflammatory disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis contribute 
mutually to PD neuropathology. Thus, SIRT1 and SIRT1 activators play a crucial 
role in the mitigation of PD neuropathology through the amelioration of 
oxidative stress, inflammatory disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, 
and inflammatory signaling pathways."
256,"The anti-inflammatory actions of phytochemicals have attracted much attention 
due to the current state of numerous inflammatory disorders. Thai traditional 
medicine uses Maclura cochinchinensis (Lour.) Corner to treat chronic fever and 
various inflammatory diseases, as well as to maintain normal lymphatic function. 
Five flavonoids and five xanthones were isolated from the heartwood of M. 
cochinchinensis and we investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of the 
isolated compounds. All isolated compounds possessed an anti-inflammatory effect 
by decreasing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-activated murine macrophages with varying degrees of potency. The greatest 
decrease in M1 inflammatory mediators, nitric oxide, PGE2, and proinflammatory 
cytokines was observed with 1,3,7-trihydroxyxanthone and 
1,3,5-trihydroxyxanthone treatment of LPS-activated macrophages. The 
anti-inflammatory mechanism of the two xanthones is mediated by the suppression 
of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase/protein kinase B expression and the upregulation of M2 
anti-inflammatory signalling proteins phosphorylated signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 6 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-γ. 
1,3,7-Trihydroxyxanthone exhibits superior induction of anti-inflammatory M2 
mediator of LPS-activated macrophages by upregulating arginase1 expression. 
Following the resolution of inflammation, the two xanthones enhanced surface 
TLR4 expression compared to LPS-stimulated cells, possibly preserving macrophage 
function. Our research highlights the role of the two xanthones in modulating 
the M1/M2 macrophage polarisation to reduce inflammation and retain surface TLR4 
once inflammation has been resolved. These findings support the use of xanthones 
for their anti-inflammatory effects in treating inflammatory dysregulation."
257,"PURPOSE: To investigate the accompanying ocular findings in patients with 
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and evaluate the susceptibility to 
ophthalmological diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, qualifying study subjects 
were patients who had been diagnosed with severe OSAS (apnea/hypopnea index 
(AHI > 30/h), n = 31), and control subjects (n = 30) who had an AHI index of < 5 
(as normal). General ophthalmological examination, eyelid laxity measurements, 
corneal topography, visual field, retinal nerve fiber layer parameters, dry eye 
tests were performed on the patients.
RESULTS: It was observed that the two groups had similar characteristics in 
terms of gender, age, presence of hypertension, diabetes, and body mass index. 
According to eyelid laxity measurements, the incidence of loose eyelids was 
higher in the OSAS patient group. Choroidal thickness was thinner in the study 
group than in the control group. Schirmer test and tear break-up time were 
significantly lower in the study group than in the control group. The percentage 
of meibomian gland loss in meibography and the ocular surface disease index 
score for symptoms was significantly higher in the study group than in the 
control group.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we found significant changes in ocular surface 
parameters, eyelid laxity, choroidal thickness, and visual field indices in OSAS 
patients. Dry eye syndrome might be related eyelid laxity and inflammation in 
OSAS patients. Early diagnosis and follow-up of ocular diseases in OSAS, which 
affect the quality of life and visual prognosis in advanced ages, are important."
258,"There are highly conflicting data on relative frequency (2-32%), prognosis, and 
management of pT1b-gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), with 5-year survival ranging 
from > 90% in East/Chile where cholecystectomy is regarded as curative, 
versus < 50% in the West, with radical operations post-cholecystectomy being 
recommended by guidelines. A total of 473 in situ and invasive extensively 
sampled GBCs from the USA (n = 225) and Chile (n = 248) were re-evaluated 
histopathologically per Western invasiveness criteria. 349 had invasive 
carcinoma, and only 24 were pT1. Seven cases previously staged as pT1b were 
re-classified as pT2. There were 19 cases (5% of all invasive GBCs) qualified as 
pT1b and most pT1b carcinomas were minute (< 1mm). One patient with extensive 
pTis at margins (but pT1b focus away from the margins) died of GBC at 27 months, 
two died of other causes, and the remainder were alive without disease (median 
follow-up 69.9 months; 5-year disease-specific survival, 92%). In conclusion, 
careful pathologic analysis of well-sampled cases reveals that only 5% of 
invasive GBCs are pT1b, with a 5-year disease-specific survival of > 90%, 
similar to findings in the East. This supports the inclusion of pT1b in the 
""early GBC"" category, as is typically done in high-incidence regions. Pathologic 
mis-staging of pT2 as pT1 is not uncommon. Cases should not be classified as 
pT1b unless extensive, preferably total, sampling of the gallbladder to rule out 
a subtle pT2 is performed. Critical appraisal of the literature reveals that the 
Western guidelines are based on either SEER or mis-interpretation of stage IB 
cases as ""pT1b."" Although the prognosis of pT1b-GBC is very good, additional 
surgery (radical cholecystectomy) may be indicated, and long-term surveillance 
of the biliary tract is warranted."
259,"We found some clear cell glands appeared in the endometrioid cysts (ECs) of the 
ovary (EC-CCG). To explore the clinicopathological features, molecular 
biological changes, and prognosis in EC-CCG and analyze the association with 
ovarian clear cell borderline tumors (CCBT) and clear cell carcinoma (CCC). We 
retrospectively examined 35 cases of EC-CCG, compared them to 13 cases of clear 
cell cystadenomas, 14 cases of CCBT, and 49 cases of CCC. We analyzed the 
differences in clinicopathological features and prognosis between the four 
groups. Data on clinicopathology and survival were gathered. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in all cases, and we analyzed the 
molecular changes of 2 cases of EC-CCG and 1 case of CCC by whole-exome 
sequencing (WES). EC-CCG shared some common clinicopathological features with 
CCBT: they occurred before menopause, had an elevated serum CA125 level in some 
cases, had an ovarian cystic mass on B-ultrasound, and had a risk of recurrence. 
Microscopically, both diseases were based on typical EC, and clear cell glands 
in the EC cyst wall were seen in varying numbers. Some cases of EC-CCG had IHC 
results similar to those of CCBT and CCC, with positive expression of HNF1β and 
NapsinA; decreased expression of ER, PR, and ARID1A; and increased expression of 
Ki67 (> 5%). WES results revealed that EC-CCG had mutations in TP53BP1, ZNF462, 
FN1, and FTL (which was also mutated in CCC). In summary, we found that clear 
cell glands appearing around EC in the ovary have an association with CCC."
260,"The recently published International Consensus Classification (ICC) of myeloid 
neoplasms summarized the results of an in-depth effort by pathologists, 
oncologists, and geneticists aimed to update the 2017 World Health Organization 
classification system for hematopoietic tumors. Along these lines, several 
important modifications were implemented in the classification of 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). For chronic myeloid leukemia, 
BCR::ABL1-positive, the definition of accelerated and blast phase was 
simplified, and in the BCR::ABL1-negative MPNs, the classification was slightly 
updated to improve diagnostic specificity with a more detailed and better 
validated morphologic approach and the recommendation of more sensitive 
molecular techniques to capture in particular early stage diseases. In this 
regard, high sensitive single target (RT-qPCR, ddPCR) or multi-target 
next-generation sequencing assays with a minimal sensitivity of VAF 1% are now 
important for a proper diagnostic identification of MPN cases with low allelic 
frequencies at initial presentation. This review discusses the updated 
diagnostic criteria of MPN according to the ICC, particularly by highlighting 
the new concepts and how they can be applied in clinical settings to obtain an 
appropriate prognostic relevant diagnosis."
261,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern that 
affects 37 million adults in the United States. It is well known that CKD 
presents a large economic burden, especially in the Medicare population. 
However, studies of the economic burden of CKD in younger populations are 
scarce. In particular, there is a gap in understanding how the presence of type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects the burden of CKD in commercially insured 
populations. OBJECTIVE: To describe the economic and health care resource 
utilization (HCRU) burden of CKD within 3 patient groups (T2DM only, CKD only, 
and CKD and T2DM) aged 45-64 years overall and by Kidney Disease Improving 
Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD estimated glomerular filtration rate-based stage 
categories. METHODS: A descriptive, observational retrospective cohort study was 
conducted using administrative medical and pharmacy claims integrated with 
laboratory results data available in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database 
from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2019. Three mutually exclusive groups of 
commercially insured patients aged 45-64 years were identified: T2DM only, CKD 
only, and CKD and T2DM. All-cause and disease-specific HCRU and costs in total, 
by medical and pharmacy benefits and across all places of service, were 
described for each of these groups 12 months after index date. For the CKD only 
and CKD and T2DM groups, costs were also described by KDIGO CKD stage. RESULTS: 
The CKD and T2DM group (n = 13,052) had numerically higher 12-month post-index 
all-cause and CKD/T2DM-related HCRU across all places of service. Mean 12-month 
all-cause costs for this group were $35,649, whereas costs for the CKD only 
group (n = 7,876) were $25,010 and costs for the T2DM only group (n = 120,364) 
were $16,121. Costs also tended to increase as CKD stage increased, with the 
greatest increases beginning at KDIGO stage 3b and higher. Mean 12-month 
all-cause costs for the CKD and T2DM group ranged from $29,993 to $41,222 for 
stages 1 to 3a and from $46,796 to $119,944 for stages 3b to 5. CONCLUSIONS: 
Commercially insured patients aged 45-64 years with CKD, especially those who 
also have T2DM, present a substantial burden in terms of elevated HCRU and 
costs. Costs tend to increase across KDIGO CKD stages and increase most rapidly 
at stage 3b and later. Therefore, there is an opportunity to reduce the burden 
of CKD in this population by investing in interventions to prevent or delay CKD 
disease progression. DISCLOSURES: HealthCore, Inc, received funding to perform

262,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is associated with a 
substantial clinical and economic burden. Inhaled prostacyclins are a 
well-established part of pharmacotherapy for PAH. There are differences between 
inhaled therapies in the burden imposed by administration frequency. Simpler and 
less time-consuming inhaled PAH therapies may improve both adherence and 
persistence and potentially affect outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To compare real-world 
health care resource use, costs, and treatment adherence and persistence in 
patients with PAH who initiated inhaled treprostinil or iloprost. METHODS: Adult 
patients with 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient medical claims separated by at least 
30 days with a diagnosis of PAH were identified using International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or Tenth Revision, Clinical 
Modification codes with a pharmacy claim for inhaled treprostinil or iloprost. 
Patients were required to be continuously enrolled in the health plan for 6 
months prior to and 12 months after the index date. A proportion of days covered 
of 0.8 or more was considered adherent; persistence was no gap in therapy for at 
least 60 days. All-cause health care resource utilization and all-cause costs 
were assessed. RESULTS: 405 and 62 patients were included in the inhaled 
treprostinil and iloprost cohorts, respectively. Adherence (50.9% and 22.6%; P < 
0.0001) and persistence (6 months, 65.2% vs 35.5%; 12 months, 46.7% vs 16.1%; 
log-rank P < 0.001) were significantly better with inhaled treprostinil. 
Post-index allcause inpatient admissions (39.3% vs 54.8%; P = 0.02) and 
post-index emergency department (ED) utilization (36.3% vs 50.0%; P = 0.04) were 
lower with inhaled treprostinil. Among patients who were persistent with therapy 
through 12 months, there was no significant difference between groups in mean 
(SD) all-cause total costs ($266,462 [137,324] vs $262,826 [112,452] for inhaled 
treprostinil vs iloprost, respectively; P = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The results 
suggest that inhaled treprostinil is less burdensome, is associated with greater 
adherence and persistence, and may reduce all-cause hospitalizations and ED 
visits. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by the United Therapeutics

263,"The influence of race and ethnicity on clinical outcomes in medicine are widely 
acknowledged. However, the effect of race on adult congenital heart disease 
(ACHD) surgery is not known. We sought to evaluate the possible association 
between race and outcomes following ACHD operations. Discharge records for 
patients who underwent ACHD surgery between 2005 and 2014, were isolated from an 
all-payer voluntary database in the United States. Hierarchical case-mix 
regression models and sensitivity analyses examined any complication, 
in-hospital mortality, and discharge disposition (home/non-home) by race 
(white-WP, black-BP, non-white non-black-NWNB). Of the 174,370 patients (WP: 
80.8%, BP: 5.8%, NWNB: 13.4%), black patients were youngest to undergo surgery 
(WP: 57.9 ± 15.8 years, BP: 50.2 ± 16.1 years, NWNB: 51.6 ± 16.9 years, 
P < 0.0001), the most likely to have a comorbidity (WP: 70.3%, BP: 74.3%, NWNB: 
68.6%, P < 0.0001), and most likely to have had a post-operative cardiac 
complication (WP: 9.4%, BP: 15.3%, NWNB: 10.9%, P < 0.0001). BP had similar odds 
of having any complication (AOR = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.94-1.04), while NWNB had 
significantly decreased odds of a major complication (AOR = 0.90, 
95%CI = 0.87-0.93). BP had equivalent in-hospital mortality compared to WP 
(AOR = 1.03, 95%CI = 0.91-1.18), while NWNB had significantly increased odds of 
in-hospital mortality (AOR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.18-1.41). Among survivors, BP were 
less likely to discharge home (AOR = 0.88, 95%CI = 0.82-0.94), and NWNB were 
more likely to discharge home than WP (AOR = 1.26, 95%CI = 1.19-1.33). Race and 
clinical outcomes are associated among patients undergoing surgery for ACHD. 
Understanding why and how these factors are impactful will help improve care for 
this complex population."
264,"BACKGROUND: Experience with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts 
(TIPS) in the pediatric population, especially in infants, is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of TIPS placement in 
infants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective non-comparative observational cohort 
study analyzed all pediatric patients  < 12 months of age treated with TIPS 
while waiting for liver transplant between October 2018 and April 2021. The 
sample consisted of 10 infants with chronic liver disease. All had refractory 
ascites and decreased portal vein size. Their mean age ± standard deviation was 
5 ± 1 months and their mean weight was 5.4 ± 1.0 kg. We calculated the pediatric 
end-stage liver disease score and portosystemic gradients before and after TIPS 
placement. We used ultrasound to check for complications and to assess the 
presence of ascites. We used paired-sample t-test for the mean comparison of 
paired variables.
RESULTS: Ten TIPS procedures were performed that were technically and 
hemodynamically successful except for one, in which an extrahepatic portal 
puncture required surgical repair. Ascites resolved in three infants and was 
reduced in six. The portal vein size remained stable after TIPS placement. Four 
infants had early stent thrombosis and two had late stent thrombosis treated 
with angioplasty or covered stents.
CONCLUSION: TIPS placement in infants is a feasible, safe and effective 
procedure."
265,"Osteoporosis care in men is suboptimal due to low rates of testing and 
treatment. Applying biomechanical computed tomography (BCT) analysis to existing 
CT scans, we found a high proportion of men with osteoporosis have never been 
diagnosed or treated. BCT may improve identification of patients at high risk of 
fracture.
PURPOSE: Osteoporosis care in men is suboptimal due to low rates of DXA testing 
and treatment. Biomechanical computed tomography analysis (BCT) can be applied 
""opportunistically"" to prior hip-containing CT scans to measure femoral bone 
strength and hip BMD.
METHODS: In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, we used BCT in male 
veterans with existing CT scans to investigate the prevalence of osteoporosis, 
defined by hip BMD (T-score ≤  - 2.5) or fragile bone strength (≤ 3500 N). 577 
men, age ≥ 65 with abdominal/pelvic CTs performed in 2017-2019, were randomly 
selected for BCT analysis. Clinical data were collected via electronic health 
records and used with the femoral neck BMD T-score from BCT to estimate 10-year 
hip fracture risks by FRAX.
RESULTS: Prevalence of osteoporosis by BCT increased with age (13.5% age 65-74; 
18.2% age 75-84; 34.3% age ≥ 85), with an estimated overall prevalence of 18.3% 
for men age ≥ 65. In those with osteoporosis (n = 108/577), only 38.0% (41/108) 
had a prior DXA and 18.6% (7/108) had received osteoporosis pharmacotherapy. 
Elevated hip fracture risk by FRAX (≥ 3%) did not fully capture those with 
fragile bone strength. In a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for 
age, BMI, race, and CT location, end stage renal disease (odds ratio 7.4; 95% 
confidence interval 2.3-23.9), COPD (2.2; 1.2-4.0), and high-dose inhaled 
corticosteroid use (3.7; 1.2-11.8) were associated with increased odds of having 
osteoporosis by BCT.
CONCLUSION: Opportunistic BCT in male veterans provides an additional avenue to 
identify patients who are at high risk of fractures."
266,"OBJECTIVES: Lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) results in limb 
ischemia and is strongly associated with sarcopenia. This study aimed to 
retrospectively evaluate the association between the quantity of muscle mass in 
the lower extremities and the severity of vascular stenosis in PAD patients.
METHODS: Between January 2018 and August 2021, 128 patients with PAD and 53 
individuals without PAD, diagnosed by computed tomography, were enrolled. The 
severity of stenosis of lower-extremity arteries was measured using a grading 
system. The muscle and fat mass areas were calculated in the abdomen at the L3 
or L4 level, mid-thigh, and lower leg. Multivariable logistic regression was 
conducted to clarify the risk associated with low muscle mass. The difference in 
muscle mass between PAD and non-PAD patients was evaluated by using propensity 
score matching.
RESULTS: A strong positive correlation between the abdomen muscle area and leg 
muscle area was observed. The muscle area and muscle index of the leg were lower 
in PAD patients. These changes occurred earlier than in the abdomen muscle area. 
The group with more severe artery stenosis had more muscle wasting in the lower 
extremities. Greater age, female, lower BMI, and PAD were associated with low 
muscle mass. After propensity score matching, the leg muscle area was still 
lower in PAD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a direct association between PAD and regional muscle 
wasting. This occurs earlier regionally in the lower extremities than in central 
muscles. Early diagnosis of PAD might prevent progressive muscle loss, improving 
disease outcome and quality of life.
KEY POINTS: • Peripheral arterial disease is strongly associated with 
sarcopenia. • Muscle wasting in the lower extremities is earlier and more 
prominent than that in the abdomen. • More severe arterial stenoses are 
associated with higher muscle wasting in the lower extremities."
267,"PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory joint 
disease, and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an established treatment. The extent to 
which HCQ impacts ocular microvascular vessel density (VD) in patients with RA 
without evidence of HCQ retinopathy has not yet been conclusively clarified. The 
main aim of this study was to evaluate VD measured by optical coherence 
tomography angiography (OCTA) in patients with RA treated with HCQ.
METHODS: The VD data of the 3 × 3 mm OCT angiogram (RTVue XR Avanti, Optovue 
Inc., Fremont, California, USA) as well as the retinal thickness (RT) data of 
patients with RA (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30) were extracted and 
analyzed. The study group was further divided into patients undergoing HCQ 
treatment for > 5 years (high-risk-group) and < 5 years (low-risk group).
RESULTS: Patients with RA showed no evidence of VD reduction compared to the 
control group in all obtained regions (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed 
no dependency between VD, RT, and HCQ therapy duration or cumulative HCQ dose 
(p > 0.05). High-risk patients showed a decreased VD in the superficial quadrant 
of the superficial capillary plexus compared to low-risk-patients (p = 0.022). 
Whole-en-face RT was reduced in the high-risk group compared to the control 
group (p = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed no evidence that HCQ diminishes VD in patients with 
RA without HCQ retinopathy measured by OCTA. However, RA patients with a long 
duration of therapy showed a significantly reduced RT. Our results suggest that 
quantitative VD analysis by OCTA may not be suitable for early detection of HCQ 
retinopathy and that the focus on detecting early HCQ retinopathy should be on 
intensive and sequential OCT diagnostics."
268,"Takayasu arteritis (TA) is an extremely uncommon vasculitis that primarily 
affects the aorta and its branches. Due to the genetic and ethnicity effect, a 
diverse array of TA clinical manifestations has been reported worldwide. The 
purpose of the present study was to compare the clinicodemographic 
characteristics and pattern of vascular involvement of Iranian and Turkish TA 
patients. This study was a retrospective, cross-sectional investigation of 126 
TA patients in Iran and Turkey. All of the variables analyzed were extracted 
from historical medical records. In 126 TA patients, the ratio of females to 
males was 8.6:1, and the average age at onset of disease was 30.5±11.1 years. 
Fatigue (49.2%) and a weak or absent pulse (79.4%) were the most prevalent 
symptoms and signs, respectively. The most prevalent angiographic 
classifications were types V and I in Iranian patients (41.09%) and type I in 
the Turkish population (47.7%) The left subclavian artery was the vessel most 
frequently affected by TA (66.6%). Our findings indicated that there were no 
significant differences between the two countries in terms of clinicodemographic 
characteristics or vascular involvement. Some clinical manifestations, such as 
claudication, were more prevalent in the Turkish population due to a higher 
incidence of occlusive lesions in the right subclavian artery."
269,"This cross-sectional online study was designed by the study group on 
Capillaroscopy and Microcirculation in Rheumatic Diseases (CAP) of the Italian 
Society of Rheumatology (SIR) to provide an overview of the management of 
nailfold capillaroscopy in Italian rheumatology centers. Therefore, SIR 
distributed the survey to its members in July 2021, and each center's physician 
with the most expertise in capillaroscopy completed the questionnaire. The 
survey was completed by 102 centers, with at least one representative from each 
Italian region. Ninety-three centers perform capillaroscopy, and 52 (56) conduct 
more than 200 investigations annually. Seventy-eight (84%) of respondents have 
more than five years of experience with the technique, and 75 centers (80.6%) 
have received certification from specific national or international training 
courses. In 85 centers, a videocapillaroscope with 200x magnification is 
employed (91.4%). The average waiting period for the examination is 2.4 months, 
and less than 3 months in 64 of the locations (68.8%). The study demonstrates 
that capillaroscopy is an integral part of both the diagnostic phase of 
Raynaud's phenomenon and the monitoring of autoimmune connective tissue diseases 
(CTDs). However, the reporting methods and timing of patient followup are 
heterogeneous."
270,"The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
tofacitinib and baricitinib up to 24 months of follow-up in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated in Southern Italy. Patients' data, activity 
index, and clinimetric scores were collected at baseline (T0), six (T6), twelve 
(T12), and twenty-four (T24) months following treatment initiation. At six, 
twelve, and twenty-four months, adverse events and treatment cessation were also 
recorded. Sixty-eight patients (mean age: 62.2±10.9 years; mean RA duration: 
15±9.6 years) were enrolled over a period of 12 weeks. At baseline, twenty-four 
patients (35.3%) were treated with tofacitinib, and forty-four patients (64.7%) 
were treated with baricitinib. The baseline mean disease activity was moderate 
as measured by DAS28- ESR (5.0±1.0), DAS 28 CRP (4.69±0.94), and SDAI 
(26.87±10.73) score. Before beginning JAKinhibs therapy, thirty-two patients 
(61.8%) were taking bDMARDs, while the remaining thirty-six (38.2%) were 
bDMARDs-naïve. The 24-month retention rate for JAKinhibs was 91.1%. Six months 
after beginning treatment with JAKinhibs, a statistically significant 
improvement was observed in all evaluated activity indices and clinimetric 
scores. Improvement was confirmed during the 12- and 24-month follow-up 
evaluations. The positive correlation between baseline-T6 SDAI delta and 
discontinuation of JAKinhibs (p=0.02) suggests that RA worsening in the first 
six months may be a predictor of therapy withdrawal. Patients with RA responded 
favorably to tofacitinib and baricitinib in this prospective, real-world study 
from a single center in Southern Italy. Efficacy was observed despite an 
underlying persistent and treatment-resistant disease."

evaluate the quantity and quality of rheumatology-related research conducted in 
the Arab world. This review examined the number of rheumatological clinical 
publications produced by Arab countries between 2017 and 2021 and cited by 
PubMed/MEDLINE. Publications with authors from multiple nations were 
disqualified. Publications were then categorized by type, including randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, systematic 
reviews, narrative reviews, and case reports. Publications were also organized 
according to the regions of the Arab world: North and East Africa, the Middle 
East, and the Arabian Peninsula. The review also used data from the world bank 
to evaluate the gross domestic product (GDP) and total population of Arabian 
nations in order to calculate a ratio of publications to GDP and publications to 
population. Egypt had the highest number of publications among north and east 
African countries and Arab countries in general, with 261 publications, 
including the highest number of RCTs, which were 23. With 81 publications, Saudi 
Arabia had the highest number of publications on the Arabian peninsula. However, 
no individual country on the Arabian peninsula published an RCT. Lebanon had the 
most publications in the Middle East, but the majority were reviews and case 
reports. Tunisia had the highest ratio of publications to GDP. Notably, the 
number of publications increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 era in some 
countries. The Arab world is still able to produce clinical rheumatology 
publications despite its political instability and lack of resources. The 
influence of such publications on the daily practice of rheumatology is still 
debatable."
272,"BACKGROUND: The Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart (SAS) score is a new, validated 
machine learning-derived outcome measure that requires six input parameters. The 
SAS score has the potential to replace legacy shoulder outcome scores.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of a multinational shoulder 
arthroplasty database of one platform shoulder prosthesis (used interchangeably 
for anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty). All primary shoulder 
arthroplasties with a minimum of two-year follow-up and an available SAS score 
were evaluated. Associations between scoring systems were assessed using Pearson 
correlations, with 95% confidence intervals stratified by time point 
(preoperatively and postoperatively at 2- and 5-year follow-ups, respectively) 
and procedure (anatomic verses reverse total shoulder arthroplasty). Conversion 
equations were developed using the best-fit line from linear regression 
analysis. Ceiling effects were assessed based on two definitions: (1) >15% of 
participants scoring the maximal possible score and (2) a standardized distance 
less than 1.0, whereby the standardized distance is calculated by subtracting 
the mean from the maximal score and dividing by the standard deviation.
RESULTS: Two thousand four hundred six shoulders were evaluated at 4,553 
clinical encounters. For preoperatively collected data, the SAS score correlated 
strongly with the Constant (R = 0.83), University of California at Los Angeles 
(R = 0.85), and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (R = -0.70) scores and 
moderately with the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (R = 0.69) and Simple 
Shoulder Test (R = 0.65) scores. The SAS score strongly correlated (R > 0.7) 
with all legacy outcome scores collected at 2- and 5-year postoperative visits. 
Score predictions made using the conversion equations between the SAS score and 
legacy outcome scores strongly correlated with their actual values. Neither the 
SAS nor the Constant score were influenced by ceiling effects. All other outcome 
scores evaluated demonstrated ceiling effects.
CONCLUSION: The SAS score correlates well with legacy shoulder scores after 
primary shoulder arthroplasty while mitigating ceiling effects. Surgeons may 
decrease patient questionnaire burden by using the brief six-question SAS score."
273,"Ganglion cysts represent the most common soft-tissue mass in the hand and wrist. 
Ganglion cysts are most commonly encountered at the dorsal or volar aspects of 
the wrist, although cysts may arise from the flexor tendon sheath, 
interphalangeal joint, and extensor tendons. Intraosseous and intraneural 
ganglion cysts have also been described. Diagnosis of ganglion cysts relies 
primarily on history and physical examination. Transillumination and aspiration 
of masses may be useful adjuncts to diagnosis. Imaging such as radiography and 
ultrasonography may be indicated to evaluate for associated conditions, such as 
degenerative joint disease, or to rule out a solid or heterogeneous mass. 
Advanced imaging such as MRI is generally reserved for patients in whom occult 
ganglions, intraosseous ganglions, or solid tumors, including sarcoma, remain a 
concern. Treatment of ganglion cysts includes observation, aspiration or 
puncture with possible corticosteroid injection, and surgical excision. 
Nonsurgical management may result in cyst resolution in over 50% of patients. 
Surgical excision is associated with recurrence rates of 7% to 39%. Advances in 
surgical techniques have allowed surgeons to conduct arthroscopic ganglion 
excision, with recurrence rates similar to those of open management. This study 
highlights the advances in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes that have taken 
place over the past 2 decades for this common condition affecting the hand and 
wrist in the adult population."
274,"The National Institute of Health now estimates that there are well over 37 
million persons with diabetes in the United States alone, a number well over 11 
per cent of our population. The associated multiple organ system disease is 
responsible for more than 327 billion dollars in direct and indirect medical 
costs and more than 140,000 lower extremity amputations yearly in the United 
States. Because healthcare professionals have begun to appreciate the economic 
and pathologic burden that diabetes imparts on our society, there has been a 
growth in both the understanding and treatment of the responsible pathologic 
disorders. The goal of this monograph is to provide an evidence-supported 
foundation to better understand the pathophysiology that leads to the 
development of neuropathic (Charcot) foot arthropathy and provide insight into 
developing a treatment plan for addressing this complex disease process that 
presents in a highly comorbid patient population."
275,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) results in substantial improvement for most 
patients with end-stage arthritis of the knee; however, approximately 20% of 
patients have an unsatisfactory result. Although many problems contributing to 
an unsatisfactory result after TKA are best addressed by revision TKA, some 
problems may be effectively addressed with arthroscopic treatment. The 
categories of pathology that can be addressed arthroscopically include 
peripatellar soft-tissue impingement (patellar clunk syndrome and patellar 
synovial hyperplasia), arthrofibrosis, and popliteus tendon dysfunction. 
Recognizing these disease entities and the role of arthroscopic surgery in the 
treatment of these lesions may be helpful in achieving a good outcome in certain 
patients who are unsatisfied with their knee arthroplasty."
276,"In order to prepare for the twindemic of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection, we 
investigated the association between influenza infection and subsequent severity 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A population-based nationwide cohort study was 
performed using data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) in the 
Republic of Korea. This study included 274,126 individuals who underwent 
SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing between 20 January 2020 and 1 October 2020. Among these 
patients, 28,338 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 4,003 of these individuals 
had a history of influenza. The control group was selected through 1:1 
propensity score matching. In the group of 4,003 COVID-19-positive individuals 
with no history of influenza, 192 (4.8%) experienced severe illness from 
COVID-19 infection. In the group of 4,003 COVID-19-positive individuals with a 
history of influenza, 260 (6.5%) had severe illness from COVID-19, and the 
overall adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.59). 
Among the 4,003 COVID-19-positive individuals with a history of influenza, 
severe COVID-19 infection was experienced by 143 of 1,760 (8.1%) with an 
influenza history within 1 year before the onset of COVID-19, 48 of 1,129 (4.3%) 
between 1 and 2 years, and 69 of 1,114 (6.2%) between 2 and 3 years before 
COVID-19 onset, and the aORs were 1.54 (1.20-1.98), 1.19 (0.84-1.70), and 1.00 
(0.73-1.37), respectively. In conclusion, individuals who had an influenza 
infection less than 1 year before COVID-19 infection were at an increased risk 
of experiencing severe illness from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. To control the 
public health burden, it is essential that effective public health control 
measures, which include influenza vaccination, hand washing, cough etiquette, 
and mask use are in place."
277,"BACKGROUND: The boundaries between myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 
immune-mediated cytopenias are often difficult to establish and both conditions 
may benefit from immunosuppressive therapy. The optimal timing and doses of 
immunosuppressants are largely unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically evaluated a retrospective cohort of 79 
patients with low-risk MDS tested for anti-erythrocyte or anti-platelet 
autoantibodies to assess their frequency and the efficacy of immunosuppression, 
particularly with steroids.
RESULTS: We found autoantibody positivity in 43% of cases and overt autoimmune 
diseases in 18%, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thromboctyopenia, 
and Evans syndrome. Steroid treatment improved cytopenia in about half of 
patients, with 26% achieving a complete recovery lasting for a median of 12 
months. Better responses were observed in anemic patients with anti-erythrocyte 
autoantibodies than in those with anti-platelet autoantibodies, and the 
combination with recombinant erythropoietin (7/10) had a possible synergistic 
effect. Steroid doses were heterogeneous depending on the clinical intent (i.e., 
anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anabolizing). Patients treated with a dose 
of 1 mg/kg day of prednisone for overt autoimmune cytopenia showed high rates of 
complete responses (60%).
DISCUSSION: This observation suggests a trial with a short course (2-3 weeks) of 
standard steroid doses to ascertain efficacy and properly silence the autoimmune 
pathogenic mechanism. Steroid-related adverse events (16% of cases) should be 
monitored carefully in this elderly, frail population. In conclusion, features 
of autoimmunity are present in more than two-thirds of low-risk MDS patients and 
a trial with prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg day for 2-3 weeks, with proper monitoring of 
adverse events, may be useful to improve cytopenias in selected cases."
278,"BACKGROUND: Congenital factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency is a rare coagulation 
disorder characterized by muscular or mucocutaneous bleeding with 
life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs), especially in cases with 
severe disease. The best treatment is the use of prophylactic plasma-derived or 
recombinant FXIII (rFXIII). Few data on the use of rFXIII in the real-world 
scenario are available. The main goal of this study was to assess the efficacy 
and safety of catridecacog (NovoThirteen®) in a population of patients with 
FXIII deficiency. Other objectives were to compare the different pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profiles of each patient and to use them to create a tailored prophylaxis 
regimen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected and analyzed all pharmacokinetic and 
clinical data in our registry of the patients with congenital FXIII deficiency 
treated with rFXIII at eleven Italian hemophilia centers. Data were collected 
from January 2019 to December 2020.
RESULTS: Overall, data on 20 patients with FXIII deficiency were collected, 16 
of whom presented with severe disease. Pharmacokinetics was assessed in 18 cases 
before starting prophylaxis. Prophylaxis was subsequently started in these 
patients using a wide range of dosages (25.0-80.0 IU/kg; mean 33.8 IU/kg) and 
infusion intervals (3.0-8.0 weeks). During a mean follow up of 47 months, two 
minor bleeds and one ICH in a severe patient who had remained under on-demand 
treatment were reported.
DISCUSSION: Efficacy and safety of rFXIII were proven in all patients. The 
dosage and infusion timing for the treated patients sometimes differed to those 
reported in the MENTOR pivotal studies, thus underlying the importance of 
tailored management in a real-world scenario."
279,"OBJECTIVE: Mitochondria are found in the extracellular space in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). However, whether mitochondria are a source of autoantigens in RA 
has not been carefully addressed. Thus, we investigated the presence and 
significance of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in patients with RA.
METHODS: AMAs were measured in sera from three cross-sectional RA cohorts (n=95, 
n=192, and n=117) and healthy individuals (n=38, n=72, n=50) using a flow 
cytometry-based assay. Further, AMAs were detected using anti-mitofusin-1 (MFN1) 
IgG ELISA and Western blot. A longitudinal inception cohort, followed for a 
median of 8 years, was used to study disease progression.
RESULTS: AMA levels were elevated in all three RA cohorts as compared to healthy 
individuals (p<0.001, p<0.05, and p<0.01), with a range of 14-26% positivity. 
Levels of anti-MFN1 antibodies correlated with AMA levels (r=0.31, p=0.006) and 
were elevated in RA as compared to healthy individuals (p<0.001). Presence of 
AMA was associated with erosive disease (p<0.05) and interstitial lung disease 
(p<0.01). Further, AMA levels could predict erosive disease (OR=4.59, p=0.006) 
and joint space narrowing (OR=3.08, p=0.02) independent of anti-citrullinated 
protein antibodies. Finally, anti-MFN1 antibodies identified seronegative 
patients developing erosive disease (OR=9.33, p=0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the presence of novel autoantibodies 
targeting mitochondria in RA. AMAs stratified patients based on disease 
phenotype and predicted development of erosive disease, including in patients 
with seronegative disease. Our results highlight the essential role of 
mitochondria in RA pathogenesis and suggest a possible benefit of therapies 
targeting mitochondrial-mediated inflammation and clearance in these patients.

280,"BACKGROUND: Persistent infection with high-risk (HR) Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) 
genotypes has been shown to play a significant role in the development of 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and CC (cervical cancer). The present 
study aimed to determine the distribution and quantification of viral load of 
HPV genotypes in numerous genital samples obtained from women undergoing routine 
gynaecological care in different regions of Turkey.
METHODS: HPV typing was done by HPV QUANT-21 Quantitative RT-PCR Kit®, which is 
intended for the specific identification and quantification of low-risk (HPV 6, 
11, 44) and high-risk (HPV 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 
59, 66, 68, 73, 82) from female subjects in Turkey.
RESULTS: From the total of 5975 samples, 2777 were positive for at least one HPV 
genotype, with an overall frequency of 46.4%. 1695 patients were positive for 
only one or more LR-HPV genotypes (61%) and 812 patients were positive for one 
or more HR-HPV genotypes (29%). The frequency of LR-HPV genotypes was 31.4%, 
while the frequency of HR-HPV genotypes was 118.8%. Our tecnology had a positive 
advantage to calculate the concentration of each genotypes. Although genotype 52 
ranked fifth in frequency, it showed the highest mean concentration, with a 
value of 5.38 log (copies/sample).
CONCLUSION: The presence and genotype of viruses before HPV vaccination have 
also gained importance. The data obtained would provide guidance for prevention 
strategies, mainly of vaccination. We decided to add a new estimate to the 
effectiveness of currently available HPV vaccines and the development of 
screening programs to prevent and decrease the incidence of CC in Turkey. 
Further studies would be planned to measure and define the high infection level 
that can lead to the development of cervical neoplasia. Using this tecnology 
could give us a clinical desicion to degree the cytological changes."
281,"BACKGROUND: Caspases (CASPs) are the main executors of the apoptotic process. 
Studies to date have shown the role of caspase-8 (CASP8) and caspase-9 (CASP9) 
in carcinogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the 
associations between CASP9-rs4233532, CASP9-rs4646018, and CASP8- rs1045485 gene 
polymorphisms and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) susceptibility in an Iranian 
population-based study. Moreover, it was examined whether such the genotype of 
these polymorphisms is related with clinicopathological characteristics of NHL.
METHODS: 175 patients with NHL and 175 age- and sex-matched controls were 
enrolled in this study. We determined the genotypes of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) from CASP genes with Tetra ARMS-PCR (Amplification 
refractory mutation system) method.
RESULTS: Statistically significant association were observed between 
CASP9-rs4646018 and increased risk of NHL under codominant CC, codominant TC, 
and dominant TC+CC genetic models. Our results showed that the A allele of 
CASP8-rs1045485 was a protective factor for NHL and GArs1045485 genotype 
significantly reduced risk of NHL. In contrast, CASP9- rs4233532 was not linked 
to NHL susceptibility. No relationship was detected between CASP8-rs1045485 and 
CASP9-rs4233532 and NHL clinicopathological characteristics, however genetic 
variation in CASP9-rs4646018 was associated with histology, treatment and radio 
therapy of NHL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study presented that the CASP8- rs1045485 and CASP9-rs4646018 
polymorphisms could affect the risk of NHL in Iranian populations which was the 
first report to show the significant relationship between rs1045485, rs4646018 
polymorphisms and NHL susceptibility. Replication large-scale case-control 
studies in different ethnicities are warranted to verify these findings."
282,"OBJECTIVE: ADH1B, ADH1C and ALDH2 genes are mainly responsible for alcohol 
metabolism in the body. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these 
genes have been reported to be associated with alcohol dependence and are 
considered risk factors for various human diseases. This study aims to identify 
the prevalence of three SNPs of ADH1B (rs1229984), ADH1C (rs698) and ALDH2 
(rs671) in 235 unrelated individuals living in Thai Nguyen province, the 
northeast region of Vietnam.
METHODS: The target genotypes were identified by using PCR direct sequencing, 
and their frequencies were compared to previous reports.
RESULT: Our data showed that allele frequencies of ADH1B*2, ADH1C*2 and ALDH2*2 
were 68.8%, 8.3% and 20.4%, respectively. The ADH1B*2 and ADH1C*2 frequencies 
were similar to those of the Kinh ethnic individuals living in the south region 
of Vietnam, while the ALDH2*2 frequency was higher. Compared to data from other 
countries, ADH1B*2 frequency is similar to the Philippines (60.5%) and Mongolia 
(62.9%) but significantly different from the other populations. The ADH1C*2 
frequency is not so different compared to Japanese (5.7%) and Chinese (7.1%) but 
is quite different in other populations. ALDH2*2 frequency was lower than 
Japanese (29.3%), Indonesian (30%) and higher than other countries. Regarding 
the risk of alcoholism, the percentage of Vietnamese people in this study with 
genotypes related to alcohol dependence is 8.1%. In contrast, the carrier has 
genotypes protecting against alcoholism with high frequency, 91.9%. Among them, 
the individuals can cause high acetaldehyde accumulation accounting for 33.2%.
CONCLUSION: This study helps to understand the genetic polymorphisms of alcohol 
metabolism genes in the community living in Thai Nguyen province, northeast of 
Vietnam, and provides valuable scientific data relating to alcohol consumption 
behavior as well as public health protection."
283,"OBJECTIVE: Truth-telling in oncology is a major challenge, particularly in the 
absence of disclosure protocols in Egypt and the lack of Egyptian studies 
examining patients' preferences regarding cancer disclosure. This study aimed to 
reveal the preferences of patients seeking care at the National Cancer Institute 
- Cairo University regarding disclosing cancer diagnosis and the type and amount 
of information to be told.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 patients selected 
consecutively from those attending the outpatient clinics of the National Cancer 
Institute - Cairo University. Face-to-face interviews were performed with the 
patients according to a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 
five parts: socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge about cancer disease, 
attitudes towards cancer disease, experience during the disclosure of the 
diagnosis, and preferences regarding disclosure of cancer diagnosis.
RESULTS: Most patients (89.5%) preferred to know the diagnosis. Of them, 94.4% 
wished to know from the physician. No agreement was found between most patients' 
preferences and physicians' practice. On multivariate logistic regression 
analysis, patients' education was the only significant predictor of the 
preference to know the diagnosis (OR = 5.298, 95% CI = 1.258 - 22.301, P = 
0.023).
CONCLUSION: Patients have a great desire to know the diagnosis and other 
information related to treatment and prognosis."
284,"OBJECTIVE: Cancer is a non-communicable disease that accounts for 71% of deaths 
globally. The prevalence of people living with cancer in Indonesia increased 
from 1.4/1000 population (2013) to 1.8/1,000 population (2018). This study aims 
to evaluate usability, user experience, and user feedback on the use of the 
Oncodoc m-health application.
METHODS:  The research method uses mixed methods with a cross-sectional approach 
and online survey sampling techniques (677 respondents), in December 
2021-January 2022 in Indonesia. The instruments used are the System Usability 
Scale and User Experience Questionnaire. The variables measured include the 
characteristics of respondents, usability, user experience, and responses to 
using applications qualitatively. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively 
and the User Experience Questionnaire's analysis tool. Qualitative data were 
analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Evaluation of the usability of Oncodoc's m-health application is in the 
""acceptable"" category (70.88), and the adjective rating is in the ""Good"" 
category. Evaluations of the relative quality of user experience are in the 
""good"" and ""very good"" types. The average user experience scale is (mean; SD): 
attractiveness (1.80; 0.99), perspicuity (1.82; 1.05), efficiency (1.78; 1.09), 
dependability (1.56; 1.01), stimulation (1.81; 1.06), and novelty (1.32; 1.10). 
The findings of this study are 1) the ability to accommodate user needs, 2) 
usage barriers, and 3) user expectations for the Oncodoc application.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the Oncodoc m-health application is acceptable to users. We 
recommend developing a cancer early detection application with an approach that 
refers to user needs for further research."
285,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the main epidemiological 
characteristics of AML (morbidity, survival, distribution by AML variants and 
age groups) in 5 regions participating in the study.
METHODS: This stat study was conducted on patients diagnosed with acute myeloid 
leukemia in 5 regions of Kazakhstan, from January 2017 to December 2020. 
Compared with self-assessment of acute myeloid leukemia using a questionnaire, 
postoperative histopathology in patients with suspected acute myeloid leukemia. 
The questionnaire, compiled by artificial intelligence, is grouped into 
categories ""risk"" and ""no risk"". Statistical processing and analysis of data was 
carried out using the analytical package SAS 9.4. Methods of reporting 
statistics, standardization of morbidity were used.
RESULT: According to the standardized morbidity indicators obtained (from 1.39 
to 2.43 per 100 thousand population), we can say that the registered incidence 
of AML remains low. This value practically does not differ from the incidence of 
AML (2.71) according to the Kazakhstan Cancer Registry for 2016 and is 
significantly lower than the data of European and American registries (4-5 cases 
per 100 thousand inhabitants per year).
CONCLUSION: This study identified specific areas with a high risk of acute 
myeloid leukemia in Eastern Kazakhstan, as well as spatial inequality in their 
distribution with the formation of this disease. These results can be useful in 
developing any strategy for responding to a high risk of cancer in specific 
areas."
286,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The viewpoints of Shahid Beheshti University of 
Medical Sciences medical experts'' were compared with those of auxiliary health 
workers regarding health culture related to human papillomavirus vaccination in 
2020.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 220 medical experts' (gynecologists, 
cultural, psychological, infectious, dermatological, and educational) and 
auxiliary health workers were randomly selected and investigated. The required 
data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire modeled on 
international questionnaires. These questionnaire contained demographic 
information on the subjects' age and sex as well as health culture was also 
assessed by measuring the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the subjects.
RESULTS: The mean age of the included medical experts' and auxiliary health 
workers was 38.0 3±8.3 and 35.2±7.5 years old, respectively. There was a 
significant difference in the knowledge of auxiliary health workers as 55.3 ± 
3.8 in comparison with the medical experts' as 51.6 3± 6.3 (p <0.002). There was 
a significant difference on whether changing cultural attitudes about the need 
for vaccination could be effective on reducing sexually transmitted diseases 
between the auxiliary health workers  and medical experts'  (p <0.001). There 
was a significant difference in the knowledge of auxiliary health workers 55.3 ± 
3.8 in comparison with the psychology and cultural experts' as 48.5± 6.3, 48.3± 
6.8 (p<0.001) respectively.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge among the auxiliary health workers was significantly 
different from that of psychology and cultural experts' in relation to health 
culture for human papillomavirus vaccination. It was indicated that these 
experts need to upgrade their health culture knowledge to increase the rate of 
community participation in human papillomavirus vaccination."
287,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in females in 
Bangladesh. This is caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Multiple sex 
partners, HIV infection, smoking, using birth control pills, and having more 
than three children are risk factors of cervical cancer. Hence, female sex 
workers have a high prevalence of infection with high risk HPV genotypes which 
eventually may causes cervical cancer. Unfortunately, the status of knowledge, 
attitude and practice among female sex workers regarding cervical cancer is 
mostly unknown. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and 
practice of women living in Daulatdia brothel regarding cervical cancer and its 
screening.  Methods: A cross-sectional knowledge-practice survey was conducted 
among 400 female sex workers in Daulatdia Brothel, Rajbari District, Bangladesh. 
The women's total score on knowledge, and practice were categorized as 
sufficient or insufficient. We calculated frequencies and used binary logistic 
regression to describe and assess the association between scores and 
socio-demographic characteristics of respondents.
RESULTS: Most sex workers (61%) were between 29 to 35 years, married at 13 to 15 
years of age, and divorced (91%). Middle aged sex workers were more likely have 
a VIA test  than women in the 29 to 35 years group (18%, OR:5.2; CI: 2.0, 13.5). 
Less than half of the studied women (40%) had sufficient knowledge regarding 
cervical cancer and 12% knew that infection by HPV is a risk factor. Respondents 
with primary and secondary education were more likely to have sufficient 
knowledge than the illiterate (42%, OR: 1.32; CI: 0.82, 2.12). Practices to 
prevent cervical cancer were very poor. Nearly all women (99%) would recommend 
other women to have a VIA test. There were only 7% who had a VIA test and 2% 
were vaccinated against HPV. Unmarried sex workers were more likely to take 
action to prevent cervical cancer. Sex workers educated up to the primary level 
were more likely to have a VIA or other tests than the illiterate sex workers 
(10%, OR: 1.3; CI: 0.6, 3.2).
CONCLUSION: Sex workers in Daulatdia brothel were less knowledgeable about 
cervical cancer and less likely to have a VIA test and poor practices towards 
preventing cervical cancer. The sex workers underutilized the VIA test and HPV 
vaccine.

were more likely to have a VIA or other tests than the illiterate sex workers 
(10%, OR: 1.3; CI: 0.6, 3.2).
CONCLUSION: Sex workers in Daulatdia brothel were less knowledgeable about 
cervical cancer and less likely to have a VIA test and poor practices towards 
preventing cervical cancer. The sex workers underutilized the VIA test and HPV

288,"Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases of women, which can increase 
the survival of patients with its early diagnosis. Despite the existence of 
relatively sensitive methods of early detection of breast cancer, such as 
mammography, statistics show that a small number of women perform mammography 
according to the recommended clinical guidelines. Using the health belief model, 
this study aims to determine the factors affecting mammography among women 
teachers in Hamedan.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 458 female teachers aged 40 years and older 
of Hamadan city, in western part of Iran, during October to December of 2019. 
The participants were asked about the factors affecting mammography based on the 
health belief model. Questionnaires were completed by self-reported method and 
analyzed by SPSS software at 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: The average age of the study participants was 46±4.1 years. Among the 
participants, about 41.5% had performed mammography at least once. In univariate 
analysis, the constructs of the health belief model generally predicts 
performing mammography between 35 and 49 percent. In multivariate analysis, age 
46 to 50 years, having supplementary insurance, history of breast disease, 
perceived barriers with odds ratio of 3.4, 3.4, 10.6 and .89, respectively, were 
significantly related to mammography.
CONCLUSIONS: Female teachers over 45 years of age with a history of breast 
disease, if they do not have financial or other barriers to do mammography, 
perform breast cancer screening."
289,"BACKGROUND: Chromium (Cr) is a transition metal, natural element. Chromium is 
the 21st most abundant element in Earth's crust. Cr is found in soil, rocks and 
living organisms. It may have various oxidation states, from -2 to +6, but most 
of these states are too unstable to exist in any significant quantities. The 
purpose of this review and meta-analysis is to critically assess the scientific 
evidence on the carcinogenic effects of chromium (Cr) and to determine whether 
there is currently sufficient evidence to suggest that that there is a link 
between chromium levels in hair and blood serum and breast cancer in women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Research on the relationship between heavy metal chromium 
and the risk of developing breast cancer has been searched in PubMed, EMBASE, 
Web of Science, Scopus among papers published between January 2000 and September 
2020. The search used the following terms (MeSH): breast cancer, women, trace 
elements, metals, chromium, chemically-induced, hair, serum using additional 
terms.
RESULTS: In the second group of comparisons of women from ""ecologically clean"" 
districts of Aktobe Region, there were significantly lower indicators of the 
microelements in tumor tissue. The amount of Fe ranges from 38.46 to 65.39 ug/g 
(average 49.56±5.81 ug/g), Cu from 2.8 to 6.69 ug/g (average 5.06±1.01 ug/g), Zn 
from 1.89 to 5.38 ug/g (average 3.88±0.89 ug/g), Cr from zero to 6,1 ug/g 
(average 2.13±1.29 ug/g), Ni from 0.11 to 0.42 ug/g (average 0.28±0.067 ug/g) и 
Pb from zero to 0.19 ug/g (average 0.098±0.06 ug/g).
CONCLUSION: The article established that women who live or work in ecologically 
polluted areas or have problems with micronutrient exchange need in-depth 
screening and more frequent screening for early detection of pre- and breast 
cancer."
290,"BACKGROUND: Oral cancer screening strategies help reduce associated mortality 
and could be performed by a trained frontline health worker (FHW). The present 
review aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of commonly used screening 
modalities for oral cancer performed by FHW in apparently healthy individuals.
METHODS: Electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and 
Google Scholar, were searched. The review included studies conducted where 
apparently healthy adult individuals were screened by the FHW for cancer or PMD 
of the lip and oral cavity by any of the four commonly used techniques - 
Conventional Oral Examination (COE), toluidine blue staining (TBS), Oral 
Cytology (OC), and Chemiluminescent Illumination (CLI).
FINDINGS: A total of 2,413 potentially relevant articles were retrieved from the 
search, among which five studies for COE were included in the review. Four out 
of those five studies were done before the year 2000. None of the studies fitted 
the inclusion criteria for TBS, OC, and CLI. Pooled sensitivity of oral 
screening by COE performed by an FHW (n=5) was 88.8% (95% CI: 71.6-96.1), 
whereas pooled specificity was 91.9% (95% CI: 78.3-97.3). On subgroup analysis, 
the pooled sensitivity and specificity of studies where the prevalence of 
disease was <50% (n=4) was 84.5% (95% CI: 62.6 - 94.7) and 94.1% (95% CI: 82.2 - 
98.2), respectively.
INTERPRETATION: COE by trained FHW had high pooled sensitivity and specificity 
for screening of oral cancer and PMDs. The screening techniques TBS, OC, and 
CLI, were not studied for mass screening by trained FHW. COE by trained FHW 
could be utilized for oral screening in limited-resource settings. However, the 
FHW should be sufficiently trained to get the desired benefits of early 
detection.

291,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance in 
pneumococcal infections in adults and to provide a perspective regarding 
serotype coverage of both current and future pneumococcal vaccines.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This passive surveillance study was conducted with the 
Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from the specimens of patients with 
pneumonia (materials isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage), bacteraemia, 
meningitis, pleuritis and peritonitis between 2015 and 2018. Serogrouping and 
serotyping were performed by latex particle agglutination and by conventional 
Quellung reaction using commercial type-specific antisera, respectively. The 
strains were analysed for penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin and moxifloxacin 
susceptibilities by E-test.
RESULTS: In the whole study group (410 samples from adults aged ≥18 years), the 
most frequent serotypes were 3 (14.1%), 19 F (12%) and 1 (9.3%). The vaccine 
coverage for PCV13, PCV15, PCV20 and PPV23 was 63.9%, 66.6%, 74.1% and 75.9%, 
respectively, in all isolates. Penicillin non-susceptibility in invasive 
pneumococcal disease (IPD) was 70.8% and 57.1% in the patients aged <65 and 
≥65 years, respectively. About 21.1% and 4.3% of the patients with and without 
IPD had cefotaxime resistance. Non-susceptibility to erythromycin and 
moxifloxacin was 38.2% and 1.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that novel PCV vaccines may provide improved 
coverage as compared with the currently available vaccine, PCV13. The 
significant antibiotic resistance rates imply the need to extend the serotype 
coverage of the vaccines. Continuing the surveillance in pneumococcal diseases 
is critical to explore the serotype distribution and incidence changes of IPD 
cases in the population and to inform policy makers to make necessary 
improvements in the national immunization programmes.Key messagesThis 
multicentre study demonstrated the most recent serotype distribution and 
antibiotic resistance in adult population in Turkey.Shifting from PCV13 to novel 
conjugated vaccines will significantly increase the coverage.Continuing the 
surveillance in pneumococcal diseases is critical to explore the serotype 
distribution changes and the incidence of cases with invasive pneumococcal 
disease in the population."
292,"INTRODUCTION: Caffeine has long been vilified as a cause for urinary urgency 
incontinence (UUI) along with other potential bladder irritants such as 
carbonation, alcohol, and acidic juices. The objective of this study was to 
assess the fluid intake behavior of people with urgency, UUI, and those with 
lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) without UUI or urgency to assess if they 
avoided certain potential bladder irritants or had different fluid intake. We 
hypothesized that patients with UUI would avoid caffeine as a self-management 
method more so than these other two groups.
METHODS: Treatment-seeking men and women with LUTS in the Symptoms of Lower 
Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) Observational Cohort study 
completed a baseline 3-day voiding and intake diary. ""Complete"" diaries had 
3 days of data and no missing intake or voided volumes. Beverages with any 
caffeine, alcohol, carbonation, or acidic juice were identified and the total 
volume was recorded as well as the type of beverage containing caffeine to 
calculate the daily caffeine dose.
RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-one participants (277 men and 214 women) with a 
median age of 63 had complete diaries. Urinary urgency was more prevalent in 
women than men (79% vs. 55%, p < 0.0001) as was UUI (84% vs. 47%, p < 0.0001). 
Total fluid intake over 3 days was lower among the urgency group versus the 
nonurgency group (median [interquartile range] 5.2 [4.0-6.8] L vs. 5.7 
[4.3-7.0] L, p = 0.028) and the UUI group compared to the urgency without 
incontinence group were less likely to consume alcohol (26% vs. 37%, p = 0.04). 
After adjusting for sex, BMI, age, and total intake volume, UUI participants had 
54% lower odds of consuming any caffeine (odds ratio = 0.46, 95% confidence 
interval = 0.22-0.96, p = 0.04) than those without incontinence, but among those 
that did consume caffeine, no difference in the volume of caffeinated beverages 
or milligrams of caffeine consumed was detected between those with UUI and those 
with urgency without incontinence. No difference in carbonation or acidic juice 
intake was detected between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with urgency consume a lower volume of fluid than those 
without urgency. UUI participants more often abstain from caffeine, but among 
those that consume caffeine, the dose is similar to those without UUI. One 
explanation for these results is that only a subset of individuals with urgency 
or UUI are caffeine sensitive."
293,"BACKGROUND: Limited epidemiological data exist describing how patients engage 
with various treatments for overactive bladder (OAB). To improve care for 
patients with OAB, it is essential to gain a better understanding of how 
patients interface with OAB treatments longitudinally, that is, how often 
patients change treatments and the pattern of this treatment change in terms of 
escalation and de-escalation.
OBJECTIVES: To describe treatment patterns for women with bothersome urinary 
urgency (UU) and/or urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) presenting to specialty 
care over 1 year.
STUDY DESIGN: The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network 
(LURN) study enrolled adult women with bothersome UU and/or UUI seeking care for 
lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) between January 2015 and September 2016. An 
ordinal logistic regression model was fitted to describe the probabilities of 
escalating or de-escalating level of treatment during 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Among 349 women, 281 reported UUI and 68 reported UU at baseline. At 
the end of 1 year of treatment by a urologist or urogynecologist, the highest 
level of treatment received by participants was 5% expectant management, 36% 
behavioral treatments (BT), 26% physical therapy (PT), 26% OAB medications, 1% 
percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, 3% intradetrusor onabotulinum toxin A 
injection, and 3% sacral neuromodulation. Participants using BT or PT at 
baseline were more likely to be de-escalated to no treatment than participants 
on OAB medications at baseline, who tended to stay on medications. Predictors of 
the highest level of treatment included starting level of treatment, 
hypertension, UUI severity, stress urinary incontinence, and anticholinergic 
burden score.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment patterns for UU and UUI are diverse. Even for patients 
with significant bother from OAB presenting to specialty clinics, further 
treatment often only involves conservative or medical therapies. This study 
highlights the need for improved treatment algorithms to escalate patients with 
persistent symptoms, or to adjust care in those who have been unsuccessfully 
treated."
294,"INTRODUCTION OR BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is an important summary measure of 
population health. In the absence of a significant event like war or disease 
outbreak, trends should, and historically have, increase over time, albeit with 
some fluctuations.
SOURCES OF DATA: Data were extracted from the human mortality database for life 
expectancy at birth and age 65 years from 1980 to the latest available year for 
England & Wales, Scotland (Great Britain), France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands 
and Germany.
AREAS OF AGREEMENT: It is well established that life expectancy improvements in 
Great Britain have stalled in recent years, and that a similar stalling was seen 
in other high-income countries during the mid-2010s.
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The significance and causes of the slowdown in improvement 
in life expectancy in Britain are disputed. First, was Britain's slowdown in 
progress in life expectancy in the 2010s a deviation 'from' earlier sustained 
improvements or simply returning to normal (slower) improvement rates following 
faster gains in the 2000s? Second, did other European countries have slowdowns 
comparable to that in Britain?
GROWING POINTS: Life expectancy, as a summary measure, conceals inequalities. 
Other measures, such as lifespan disparity, complement it in understanding 
changing trends. While annual fluctuations in life expectancy are expected, 
continued stalls should raise concern. The three British nations examined were 
the only ones among these European countries to experience stalling of life 
expectancy gains in both sexes.
AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: While it is clear that Britain is making 
less progress in health than similar countries, more research is needed to 
explain why."
295,"DBI/ACBP (diazepam binding inhibitor, acyl-CoA binding protein) is a 
phylogenetically conserved paracrine inhibitor of macroautophagy/autophagy. As 
such, DBI/ACBP acts as a pro-aging molecule. Indeed, we observed that the 
knockout of ACB1 (the yeast equivalent of human DBI/ACBP) induces autophagy and 
prolongs lifespan in an autophagy-dependent fashion in chronological lifespan 
experiments. Intriguingly, circulating DBI/ACBP protein augments with age in 
humans, and this increase occurs independently from the known correlation of 
DBI/ACBP with body mass index (BMI). A supraphysiological DBI/ACBP level 
announces future cardiovascular disease (such as heart surgery, myocardial 
infarction and stroke) in still healthy individuals, suggesting that, beyond its 
correlation with chronological age, DBI/ACBP is a biomarker of biological age. 
Plasma DBI/ACBP concentrations correlate with triglycerides and anticorrelate 
with high-density lipoprotein. Of note, these associations with cardiovascular 
risk factors are independent from age and BMI in a multivariate regression 
model. In mice, we found that antibody-mediated neutralization of DBI/ACBP 
reduces signs of anthracycline-accelerated cardiac aging including the 
upregulation of the senescence marker CDKN2A/p16 (cyclin dependent kinase 
inhibitor 2A) and the functional decline of the heart. In conclusion, it appears 
that extracellular DBI/ACBP can be targeted to combat age-associated 
cardiovascular disease.Abbreviations: BMI: body mass index; CDKN2A/p16: cyclin

296,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is an infectious disease 
with a prevalence rate of up to 50% worldwide. It can cause indigestion, 
gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication treatment can 
effectively control disease progression and reduce the risk of the above 
conditions. However, the escalating trend of antibiotic resistance presents a 
global challenge for H. pylori eradication. We aim to provide guidance on 
pharmacological treatment of H. pylori infection.
METHODS: This clinical practice guideline is developed following the World 
Health Organization's recommended process, adopting Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation in assessing evidence quality, and 
utilizing Evidence to Decision framework to formulate clinical recommendations, 
minimizing bias and increasing transparency of the clinical practice guideline 
development process. We used the RIGHT statement and AGREE II as reporting and 
conduct guides to ensure the guideline's completeness and transparency.
RESULTS: Though decreasing in developed countries, the prevalence of H. pylori 
remains high in developing countries, causing a major public health burden. This 
clinical practice guideline contains 12 recommendations concerning 
pharmacological treatment for H. pylori eradication. Among them, it is worth 
highlighting that bismuth preparations are inexpensive, safe, and effective, 
consequently making bismuth quadruple therapy a preferred choice for initial and 
rescue treatment. In empirical treatment, high-dose dual therapy is equally 
effective compared with bismuth quadruple therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The 12 recommendations in this clinical practice guideline are 
formed with consideration for stakeholders' values and preferences, resource 
use, feasibility, and acceptability. Recommendations are generalizable to 
resource limited settings with similar antibiotic resistance pattern as China, 
and lower middle-income countries facing comparable sociological and technical 
challenges.

modalities targeting NAFLD are lifestyle interventions such as weight loss 
through diet and exercise. At present, there is no established therapy for the 
treatment of NAFLD, and many therapies are associated with a variety of side 
effects. A great number of in vitro and in vivo experiments have indicated that 
there are many natural foods that have therapeutic potential for NAFLD. This

298,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that 
destroys memory and cognitive function. Inflammasome activation has been 
suggested to play a critical role in the neuroinflammatory response in AD 
progression, but the cell-type expression of inflammasome proteins in the brain 
has not been fully characterized. In this study, we used samples from the 
hippocampus formation, the subiculum, and the entorhinal cortex brain from 17 
donors with low-level AD pathology and 17 intermediate AD donors to assess the 
expression of inflammasome proteins. We performed analysis of hippocampal 
thickness, β-amyloid plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau to ascertain the 
cellular pathological changes that occur between low and intermediate AD 
pathology. Next, we determined changes in the cells that express the 
inflammasome sensor proteins NOD-like receptor proteins (NLRP) 1 and 3, and 
caspase-1. In addition, we stained section with IC100, a humanized monoclonal 
antibody directed against the inflammasome adaptor protein apoptosis-associated 
speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and a 
commercially available anti-ASC antibody. Our results indicate that hippocampal 
cortical thickness did not significantly change between low and intermediate AD 
pathology, but there was an increase in pTau and β-amyloid clusters in 
intermediate AD cases. NLRP3 was identified mainly in microglial populations, 
whereas NLRP1 was seen in neuronal cytoplasmic regions. There was a significant 
increase of ASC in neurons labeled by IC100, whereas microglia in the 
hippocampus and subiculum were labeled with the commercial anti-ASC antibody. 
Caspase-1 was present in the parenchyma in the CA regions where amyloid and pTau 
were identified. Together, our results indicate increased inflammasome protein 
expression in the early pathological stages of AD, that IC100 identifies neurons 
in early stages of AD and that ASC expression correlates with Aβ and pTau in 
postmortem AD brains."
299,"BACKGROUND: Assessing the maternal mental health status during the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is necessary to prevent the occurrence of 
severe mental disorders. Prenatal depression, anxiety and stress disorders are 
prominent in pregnant women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 
highly associated with poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. Therefore this study 
aimed to assess the level of depression, anxiety, and stress among HIV-positive 
pregnant women in Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Amhara 
region referral hospitals from 17 October 2020 to 1 March 2021. A systematic 
random sampling technique was used to select 423 eligible women. A structured, 
pretested and interviewer-administered questionnaire was employed to collect the 
data. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was implemented to identify 
factors associated with women's depression, anxiety and stress. Statistical 
association was certain based on the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with its 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and p-values ≤0.05.
RESULTS: Prenatal depression, anxiety and stress among HIV-positive pregnant 
women were 37.6% (95% CI 33 to 42.3), 42.1 (95% CI 37.7 to 46.7) and 34.8% (95% 
CI 30.3 to 39.2), respectively. Having an HIV-negative sexual partner (AOR 1.91 
[95% CI 1.16 to 3.15]) and being on antiretroviral therapy >1 year (AOR 2.18 
[95% CI 1.41 to 3.36]) were found to be statistically significant with women's 
antenatal depression, while unplanned pregnancy (AOR 1.09 [95% CI 1.02 to 2.33]) 
and did not discuss with the sexual partner about HIV (AOR 3.21 [95% CI 2.12 to 
7.07]) were the factors associated with prenatal anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, more than one in three HIV-positive pregnant women 
had depression and anxiety. Thus, implementing strategies to prevent unplanned 
pregnancy and advocating open discussion with sexual partners about HIV will 
play a large role in reducing pregnancy-related depression and anxiety."
300,"Salvia rosmarinus is considered a sacred plant because of its special fragrance 
and is commonly used in cooking and traditional medicine. Here, we report a 
high-quality chromosome-level assembly of the S. rosmarinus genome of 1.11 G in 
size; the genome has a scaffold N50 value of 95.5 Mb and contains 40,701 
protein-coding genes. In contrast to other diploid Labiatae, an independent 
whole genome duplication (WGD) event was shown by S. rosmarinus at approximately 
15 MYA. Transcriptomic comparison of two S. rosmarinus cultivars with 
contrasting carnosic acid (CA) content identified 842 genes significantly 
positively associated with carnosic acid biosynthesis in S. rosmarinus. Many of 
these genes have been reported to be involved in CA-biosynthesis previously, 
such as several MVA/MEP pathways and CYP71-coding genes. Based on the genomes 
and these genes, we propose a model of CA biosynthesis in S. rosmarinus. 
Further, comparative genome analysis of the congeneric species revealed the 
species-specific evolution of CA biosynthetic genes. The genes encoding 
diterpene synthase and the cytochromes P450 (CYPs) family of CA 
synthesis-associated genes form a biosynthetic gene cluster (CPSs-KSLs-CYP76AHs) 
responsible for the synthesis of leaf and root diterpenoids, which are located 
on S. rosmarinus chromosome 1 and 2, respectively. Such clustering is also 
observed in other sage plants, thus suggesting that genes involved in 
diterpenoid synthesis are conserved in the Labiataceae family. These findings 
provide new insights into the synthesis of aromatic terpenoids and their 
regulation."

302,"BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease that significantly affects 
countries in the developing world. This study evaluated the environmental 
factors and building conditions associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in 
northeast Iran.
METHODS: A population-based case-control study was performed between 1 July 2018 
and 1 March 2021 in northeast Iran; two controls were selected for each case. 
Patients and controls were compared for environmental factors, building 
conditions and demographic characteristics.
RESULTS: There were 170 confirmed leishmaniasis cases during the study period. 
Familiarity with people with active leishmaniasis in open areas of the body 
increased the odds of getting the disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.41 [95% confidence 
interval {CI} 1.18 to 4.93]). In the case group, the history of contact with 
animals such as sheep, goats, cows, mice and camels was significantly higher. 
Housewives (OR 0.08 [95% CI 0.02 to 0.27]) and self-employed people (OR 0.22 
[95% CI 0.07 to 0.70]) were less likely to become infected. The individuals who 
lived in houses with asbestos cement roofs were more likely to become infected 
(OR 4.77 [95% CI 1.34 to 16.91]) compared with those who lived in houses with 
bituminous roofs.
CONCLUSIONS: The most significant risk factor identified in the present study 
was the type and condition of the home's roof. Housing construction improvement 
is vital to prevent leishmaniasis in northeast Iran."
303,"BACKGROUND: A increasing number of studies have revealed associations between 
country-level determinants and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. 
This ecological study was conducted to analyze country-level parameters related 
to COVID-19 infections and deaths during the first year of the pandemic.
METHODS: The examined predictors comprised demographics, economic factors, 
disease prevalence and healthcare system status, and the relevant data were 
obtained from public databases. The index dates were set to 15 July 2020 (Time 
1) and 15 December 2020 (Time 2). The adjusted spatial autoregression models 
used a first-order queen contiguity spatial weight for the main analysis and a 
second-order queen contiguity spatial weight for a sensitivity analysis to 
examine the predictors associated with COVID-19 case and mortality rates.
RESULTS: Obesity was significantly and positively associated with COVID-19 case 
and mortality rates in both the main and sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity 
analysis revealed that a country's gross domestic product, population density, 
life expectancy and proportion of the population older than 65 y are positively 
associated with COVID-19 case and mortality rates.
CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing global prevalence of obesity, the relationship 
between obesity and COVID-19 disease at the country level must be clarified and 
continually monitored."
304,"AIM: Impulse-control disorder is a common neuropsychiatric complication in 
Parkinson's disease under dopamine replacement therapy. Prior studies tested the 
balance between enhanced desire towards reward and cognitive control deficits, 
hypothesized to be biased toward the former in impulse control disorders. We 
provide evidence for this hypothesis by measuring behavioural and neural 
patterns behind the influence of sexual desire over response inhibition and 
tools towards functional restoration using repetitive transcranial stimulation 
in patients with hypersexuality as predominant impulsive disorder.
METHODS: The effect of sexual cues on inhibition was measured with a novel 
erotic stop-signal task under on and off dopaminergic medication. Task-related 
functional and anatomical connectivity models were estimated in 16 hypersexual 
and 17 non-hypersexual Parkinson's disease patients as well as in 17 healthy 
controls. Additionally, excitatory neuromodulation using intermittent 
theta-burst stimulation (sham-controlled) was applied over the pre-supplementary 
motor area in 20 additional hypersexual Parkinson's disease patients aiming to 
improve response inhibition.
RESULTS: Compared with their non-hypersexual peers, patients with hypersexuality 
recruited caudate, pre-supplementary motor area, ventral tegmental area, and 
anterior cingulate cortex while on-medication. Reduced connectivity was found 
between pre-supplementary motor area and caudate nucleus in hypersexual compared 
to non-hypersexual patients (while medicated), a result paralleled by 
compensatory enhanced anatomical connectivity. Furthermore, stimulation over the 
pre-supplementary motor area improved response inhibition in hypersexual 
Parkinson's disease patients when exposed to sexual cues.
CONCLUSION: This study, therefore, has identified a specific fronto-striatal and 
mesolimbic circuitry underlying uncontrolled sexual responses in medicated 
Parkinson's disease patients where cortical neuromodulation halts its 
expression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
305,"MOTIVATION: The growing number of microbial reference genomes enables the 
improvement of metagenomic profiling accuracy but also imposes greater 
requirements on the indexing efficiency, database size, and runtime of taxonomic 
profilers. Additionally, most profilers focus mainly on bacterial, archaeal, and 
fungal populations, while less attention is paid to viral communities.
RESULTS: We present KMCP, a novel k-mer-based metagenomic profiling tool that 
utilizes genome coverage information by splitting the reference genomes into 
chunks and stores k-mers in a modified and optimized COBS index for fast 
alignment-free sequence searching. KMCP combines k-mer similarity and genome 
coverage information to reduce the false positive rate of k-mer-based taxonomic 
classification and profiling methods. Benchmarking results based on simulated 
and real data demonstrate that KMCP, despite a longer running time than all 
other methods, not only allows the accurate taxonomic profiling of prokaryotic 
and viral populations but also provides more confident pathogen detection in 
clinical samples of low depth.

branched vascular grafts often results in acute angulation between the 
reimplanted vessels and the aortic arch hampering antegrade catheterization of 
the thoraco-abdominal aorta during the second endovascular stage. Here we 
present our ""Switch Technique"" for arch vessels reimplantation to facilitate 
antegrade aortic catheterization of the thoraco-abdominal aorta and visceral 
vessels."
307,"OBJECTIVES: Knee joint distraction (KJD) has been associated with clinical and 
structural improvement and synovial fluid (SF) marker changes. The current 
objective was to analyze radiographic changes after KJD using an automatic 
AI-based measurement method, and relate these to clinical outcome and SF 
markers.
METHODS: 20 knee osteoarthritis patients were treated with KJD in regular care. 
Radiographs and WOMAC were collected before and ∼1-year post-treatment. SF was 
aspirated before, during, and after treatment; biomarker levels were assessed by 
immunoassay. Radiographs were analyzed to obtain compartmental minimum and 
standardized joint space width (JSW), Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades, 
compartmental joint space narrowing (JSN) scores, and osteophytosis and 
sclerosis scores. Results were analyzed for the most (MAC) and least affected 
compartment. Radiographic changes were analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests 
for categorical and paired t-test for continuous variables. Linear regression 
was used to calculate associations between changes in JSW, WOMAC pain, and SF 
markers.
RESULTS: 16 Patients could be evaluated. JSW, KL and JSN improved in around half 
of the patients, significant only for MAC JSW (p< 0.05). MAC JSW change was 
positively associated with WOMAC pain change (p< 0.04). Greater MCP-1 and lower 
TGFβ-1 increases were significantly associated with changes in MAC JSW (p< 
0.05). MCP-1 changes were positively associated with WOMAC pain changes (p< 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: Automatic radiographic measurements show improved joint structure in 
most patients after KJD in regular care. MAC JSW increased significantly and was 
associated with SF biomarker level changes and even with improvements in pain as 
experienced by these patients."
308,"MOTIVATION: During disease progression or organism development, alternative 
splicing may lead to isoform switches that demonstrate similar temporal patterns 
and reflect the alternative splicing co-regulation of such genes. Tools for 
dynamic process analysis usually neglect alternative splicing.
RESULTS: Here we propose Spycone, a splicing-aware framework for time course 
data analysis. Spycone exploits a novel IS detection algorithm and offers 
downstream analysis such as network and gene set enrichment. We demonstrate the 
performance of Spycone using simulated and real-world data of SARS-CoV-2 
infection.
AVAILABILITY: The Spycone package is available as a PyPI package. The source 
code of Spycone is available under the GPLv3 license at

309,"Cell polarity is essential for ameloblast differentiation and enamel formation. 
Smurf1 can mediate cell polarization through ubiquitination degradation of 
specific substrates. But it remains unclear whether Smurf1 could regulate 
ameloblast polarity and the underlying mechanism. Here, immuno-fluorescence 
staining and RT-qPCR were applied to detect the expression of Smurf1 and 
F-actin. A mouse lower incisor defect model was constructed. Scanning electron 
microscope, rat lower incisor culture, western blot, wound healing assay and 
trans-well migration assay were performed to detect the influence of Smurf1 
knockdown on ameloblast. IF double staining, western blot and 
co-immunoprecipitation were conducted to detect the interaction between Smurf1 
and RhoA. The in vivo experiment was also performed. We found that Smurf1 was 
mainly expressed in the membrane and cell cortex of ameloblast, similar to 
F-actin. Smurf1 expression increased along ameloblast polarization and 
differentiation. After knocking down Smurf1, the cytoskeleton and cell 
morphology changed and the cell polarity was damaged. Smurf1 regulated 
ameloblast polarity through ubiquitination degradation of activated RhoA in 
vitro. Local knockdown of Smurf1 in rat lower incisor ameloblast resulted in 
ameloblast polarity loss, enamel matrix secretion disorder and chalky enamel, 
but RhoA inhibitor Y-27632 could reverse this effect. Collectively, Smurf1 could 
regulate the polarization of ameloblast through ubiquitination degradation of 
activated RhoA, which contributed to the knowledge of tooth development and 
provided new research ideas for cell polarity."
310,"At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), DOK7 enhances the phosphorylation of 
muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) and induces clustering of acetylcholine receptors 
(AChRs). We identified a patient with congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) with 
two heteroallelic mutations in DOK7, c.653-1G>C in intron 5 and c.190G>A 
predicting p.G64R in the pleckstrin homology domain. iPS cells established from 
the patient (CMS-iPSCs) showed that c.653-1G>C caused in-frame skipping of exon 
6 (120 bp) and frame-shifting activation of a cryptic splice site deleting seven 
nucleotides in exon 6. p.G64R reduced the expression of DOK7 to 10% of wild-type 
DOK7, and markedly compromised AChR clustering in transfected C2C12 myotubes. 
p.G64R-DOK7 made insoluble aggresomes at the juxtanuclear region in transfected 
C2C12 myoblasts and COS7 cells, which were co-localized with molecules in the 
autophagosome system. A protease inhibitor MG132 reduced the soluble fraction of 
p.G64R-DOK7 and enhance the aggresome formation of p.G64R-DOK7. To match the 
differentiation levels between patient-derived and control iPSCs, we corrected 
c.190G>A (p.G64R) by CRISPR/Cas9 to make isogenic iPSCs while retaining 
c.653-1G>C (CMS-iPSCsCas9). Myogenically differentiated CMS-iPSCs showed 
juxtanuclear aggregates of DOK7, reduced expression of endogenous DOK7, and 
reduced phosphorylation of endogenous MuSK. Another mutation, p.T77M, also made 
aggresome to a less extent compared to p.G64R in transfected COS7 cells. These 
results suggest that p.G64R-DOK7 makes aggresomes in cultured cells and is 
likely to compromise MuSK phosphorylation for AChR clustering."
311,"Corneal transplantation remains gold standard for the treatment of severe cornea 
diseases, however, scarcity of donor cornea is a serious bottleneck. 3D 
bioprinting holds tremendous potential for cornea tissue engineering (TE). One 
of the key technological challenges is to design bioink compositions with ideal 
printability and cytocompatibility. Photo-crosslinking and ionic crosslinking 
are often used for the stabilization of 3D bioprinted structures, which can 
possess limitations on biological functionality of the printed cells. Here, we 
developed a hyaluronic acid-based dopamine containing bioink using hydrazone 
crosslinking chemistry for the 3D bioprinting of corneal equivalents. First, the 
shear thinning property, viscosity, and mechanical stability of the bioink were 
optimized before extrusion-based 3D bioprinting for the shape fidelity and 
self-healing property characterizations. Subsequently, human adipose stem cells 
(hASCs) and hASC-derived corneal stromal keratocytes were used for bioprinting 
corneal stroma structures and their cell viability, proliferation, 
microstructure and expression of key proteins (lumican, vimentin, connexin 
43,α-smooth muscle actin) were evaluated. Moreover, 3D bioprinted stromal 
structures were implanted intoex vivoporcine cornea to explore tissue 
integration. Finally, human pluripotent stem cell derived neurons 
(hPSC-neurons), were 3D bioprinted to the periphery of the corneal structures to 
analyze innervation. The bioink showed excellent shear thinning property, 
viscosity, printability, shape fidelity and self-healing properties with high 
cytocompatibility. Cells in the printed structures displayed good tissue 
formation and 3D bioprinted cornea structures demonstrated excellentex 
vivointegration to host tissue as well asin vitroinnervation. The developed 
bioink and the printed cornea stromal equivalents hold great potential for 
cornea TE applications."
312,"BACKGROUND: Early in the pandemic, cruise travel exacerbated the global spread 
of SARS-CoV-2. We report epidemiologic and molecular findings from an 
investigation of a cluster of travelers with confirmed COVID-19 returning to the 
U.S. from Nile River cruises in Egypt.
METHODS: State health departments reported data on real-time reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 cases with a history 
of Nile River cruise travel during February-March 2020 to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Demographic and epidemiologic data were 
collected through routine surveillance channels. Sequences were obtained from 
either state health departments or from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian 
Flu Data (GISAID). We conducted descriptive analyses of epidemiologic data and 
explored phylogenetic relationships between sequences.
RESULTS: We identified 149 Nile River cruise travelers with confirmed COVID-19 
who returned to 67 different U.S. counties in 27 states: among those with 
complete data, 4.7% (6/128) died and 28.1% (38/135) were hospitalized. These 
individuals traveled on 20 different Nile River cruise voyages (12 unique 
vessels). Fifteen community transmission events were identified in four states, 
with 73.3% (11/15) of these occurring in Wisconsin (as the result of a more 
detailed contact investigation in that state). Phylogenetic analyses supported 
the hypothesis that travelers were most likely infected in Egypt, with most 
sequences in Nextstrain clade 20A 93% (87/94). We observed genetic clustering by 
Nile River cruise voyage and vessel.
CONCLUSIONS: Nile River cruise travelers with COVID-19 introduced SARS-CoV-2 
over a very large geographic range, facilitating transmission across the United 
States early in the pandemic. Travelers who participate in cruises, even on 
small river vessels as investigated in this study, are at increased risk of 
SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Therefore, history of river cruise travel should be 
considered in contact tracing and outbreak investigations."
313,"Dengue viral illness is endemic in many tropical countries with temperate 
climates. The haematological and cardiovascular sequelae of dengue are well 
known; however, respiratory manifestations are still an area of active medical 
research. We conducted a literature search on PubMed, Medline CINAHIL, EMBASE 
and found 64 articles on respiratory sequelae of dengue. All relevant original 
articles and case reports were included and the relevant information regarding 
the respiratory manifestations of dengue was retrieved from the relevant 
eligible articles. Respiratory manifestations of dengue range from mild pleural 
effusion to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The former was the most common 
complication, seen in 5.1% of patients, followed by acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) in 1.7%, pneumonia in 0.5%, respiratory distress in 0.3%, 
pulmonary hemorrhage in 0.1%, and haemothorax in 0.01%. Involvement of the 
respiratory system indicates severe disease and is difficult to manage. 
Therefore its early detection is important."
314,"PURPOSE: Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) is a sight threatening disease, 
often immune mediated and can rapidly progress to corneal perforation. Here we 
report the successful management of simultaneous bilateral peripheral ulcerative 
keratitis presenting with corneal perforation with surgical intervention and 
systemic immunosuppression.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old female presented with similarly located 
super-nasal peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) in both eyes and focal area of 
adjoining scleritis in the left eye. Serological investigations for systemic 
immune-mediated conditions showed positive rheumatoid factor test. She underwent 
cyanoacrylate glue application in both eyes, and was started on topical and oral 
corticosteroids and oral immunomodulators, and the right eye stabilized. The 
left eye required a second surgical intervention with a corneal patch graft 
following which the condition stabilized.
CONCLUSION AND IMPORTANCE: This case highlights the importance of investigating 
for an underlying systemic etiology in PUK and the role of systemic 
immunosuppression prior to and after surgical intervention in order to arrest 
the disease and prevent recurrences."
315,"Background: First-pass efficacy (FPE) has been established as an important 
predictor of favorable functional outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy (ET) 
in anterior circulation strokes. In this retrospective cohort study, we 
investigate predictors and clinical outcomes of FPE in posterior circulation 
strokes (pcAIS). Methods: The Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry database 
was used to identify pcAIS patients who achieved FPE. Their baseline 
characteristics and outcomes were compared with the non-FPE group. The primary 
outcome was a 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-3. Univariate (UVA) and 
multivariate (MVA) analyses were done to evaluate predictors of FPE. Safety 
outcomes included distal emboli, vessel rupture, symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage, and mortality. Results: Of 359 patients, 179 (50%) achieved FPE. 
Clot burden, occlusion site, and ET technique-related variables were similar 
between the two groups except for shorter procedure time with FPE. The primary 
outcome was significantly better with FPE (56.4% vs. 32.8%, p < 0.001). 
Complications were similar except for a higher rate of distal emboli in non-FPE 
group (11.1% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.032). Atrial fibrillation (Afib) had increased odds 
(aOR: 2.06, 95% CI; 1.24, 3.4, p = 0.005) and prior ischemic stroke had 
decreased odds (aOR: 0.524, 95% CI; 0.28, 0.97, p = 0.04) of FPE. Afib was the 
only independent predictor of FPE on MVA (1.94, 95% CI; 1.1, 3.43, p = 0.022). 
Conclusions: Higher rate of FPE in Afib-related pcAIS could possibly be 
explained by the differences in clot composition and degree of in-situ 
atherosclerotic disease burden. Future studies are warranted to explore the 
relationship of clot composition with ET outcomes."
316,"BACKGROUND: The extent of pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer 
remains controversial, and more high-level clinical evidence is needed. This 
study aimed to evaluate the outcome of extended pancreatoduodenectomy (EPD) with 
retroperitoneal nerve resection in pancreatic head cancer.
METHODS: This multicenter randomized trial was performed at 6 Chinese 
high-volume hospitals that enrolled patients between October 3, 2012, and 
September 21, 2017. Four hundred patients with stage I or II pancreatic head 
cancer and without specific pancreatic cancer treatments (preoperative 
chemotherapy or chemoradiation) within three months were randomly assigned to 
undergo standard pancreatoduodenectomy (SPD) or EPD, with the latter followed by 
dissection of additional lymph nodes (LNs), nerves and soft tissues 270° on the 
right side surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis. The 
primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) by intention-to-treat (ITT). The 
secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), mortality, morbidity, and 
postoperative pain intensity.
RESULTS: The R1 rate was slightly lower with EPD (8.46%) than with SPD (12.56%). 
The morbidity and mortality rates were similar between the two groups. The 
median OS was similar in the EPD and SPD groups by ITT in the whole study cohort 
(23.0 vs. 20.2 months, P = 0.100), while the median DFS was superior in the EPD 
group (16.1 vs. 13.2 months, P = 0.031). Patients with preoperative CA19-9 < 
200.0 U/mL had significantly improved OS and DFS with EPD (EPD vs. SPD, 30.8 vs. 
20.9 months, P = 0.009; 23.4 vs. 13.5 months, P < 0.001). The EPD group 
exhibited significantly lower locoregional (16.48% vs. 35.20%, P < 0.001) and 
mesenteric LN recurrence rates (3.98% vs. 10.06%, P = 0.022). The EPD group 
exhibited less back pain 6 months postoperation than the SPD group.
CONCLUSIONS: EPD for pancreatic head cancer did not significantly improve OS, 
but patients with EPD treatment had significantly improved DFS. In the subgroup 
analysis, improvements in both OS and DFS in the EPD arm were observed in 
patients with preoperative CA19-9 < 200.0 U/mL. EPD could be used as an 
effective surgical procedure for patients with pancreatic head cancer, 
especially those with preoperative CA19-9 < 200.0 U/mL."
317,"BACKGROUND: Evaluating caregiver burden and its health impact is an essential 
components of long-term care plan for children with disabilities, the Caregiver 
Difficulties Scale (CDS) have high conceptual sensitivity. The aim of this study 
was to adapt the CDS to Chinese and investigates the psychometric properties of 
this tool.
METHODS: The study was carried out among caregivers of children with Cerebral 
Palsy (n=194). The CDS, Caregivers Burden Inventory (CBI), World Health 
Organization Quality of Life- BREF (WHOQOL -BREF) were used for data collection. 
Twenty experts were consulted to evaluate the content validity of the scale. The 
confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to measure the construct validity of 
CDS. The Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated among CDS, CBI and 
WHOQOL -BREF to examine the convergent validity and discriminant validity. The 
reliability was evaluated by examining internal consistency and test-retest 
reliability.
RESULTS: The result of expert consultation showed that the S-CVI was 0.894, and 
the I-CVI ranged from 0.70 to 1.00. The fit indices showed that the original 
correlated four-factor model of CDS was adequate: χ2 =268.397; df=243; χ2 
/df=1.105; RMSEA=0.023; CFI=0.985; NNFI=0.869; TLI=0.982; IFI=0.986. The score 
of CDS were positively strong associated with the scores of CBI (r=+0.764); 
negatively correlating with the scores of WHOQOL-BREF (r =-0.627). The 
Cronbach's alpha was 0.840, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value was 
0.843.
CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese version of the CDS is a valid and reliable tool to 
evaluate burden for caregivers of children with CP in China."

319,"INTRODUCTION: To define the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) in young 
patients and to compare their postoperative treatment with that of older 
patients.
METHODS: This multicenter study enrolled 5,457 patients with primary CRC who 
underwent surgical resection. The overall survival (OS), clinicopathologic 
characteristics, and postoperative treatment of 253 young patients aged 18-44 
years and 5,204 older patients aged 44-80 years were analyzed.
RESULTS: The OS rate was 77.1% for young and 74.2% for older patients (P = 
0.348). Landmark analysis showed a significant difference in survival between 
young and older patients, with 63.8% of deaths among young patients being within 
25 months of surgery compared with 42.4% among older patients (P = 0.002). Among 
those who survived more than 25 months, young patients had significantly better 
survival than older patients (P = 0.009). Multivariable analysis of young 
patients revealed that the tumor location, perineural invasion, and stage were 
associated with poor survival within 25 months; after this period, stage was the 
only prognostic marker. Young patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy, 
particularly multiagent regimens. For young patients, no significant difference 
in OS was found based on the chemotherapy regimen, regardless of disease stage 
(II, III, or IV, all P > 0.05). In addition, unlike in older patients, no 
difference in OS was found in young patients regardless of the drug regimen 
administered (all P > 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Young-onset CRC may have a unique disease biology that warrants 
further research and therapy development."
320,"Wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance enables unbiased and comprehensive 
monitoring of defined sewersheds. We performed real-time monitoring of hospital 
wastewater that differentiated Delta and Omicron variants within total 
SARS-CoV-2-RNA, enabling correlation to COVID-19 cases from three tertiary-care 
facilities with >2100 inpatient beds in Calgary, Canada. RNA was extracted from 
hospital wastewater between August/2021 and January/2022, and SARS-CoV-2 
quantified using RT-qPCR. Assays targeting R203M and R203K/G204R established the 
proportional abundance of Delta and Omicron, respectively. Total and 
variant-specific SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater was compared to data for variant 
specific COVID-19 hospitalizations, hospital-acquired infections, and outbreaks. 
Ninety-six percent (188/196) of wastewater samples were SARS-CoV-2 positive. 
Total SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in wastewater increased in tandem with total 
prevalent cases (Delta plus Omicron). Variant-specific assessments showed this 
increase to be mainly driven by Omicron. Hospital-acquired cases of COVID-19 
were associated with large spikes in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 and levels were 
significantly increased during outbreaks relative to non-outbreak periods for 
total SARS-CoV2, Delta and Omicron. SARS-CoV-2 in hospital wastewater was 
significantly higher during the Omicron-wave irrespective of outbreaks. 
Wastewater-based monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants represents a novel 
tool for passive COVID-19 infection surveillance, case identification, 
containment, and potentially to mitigate viral spread in hospitals. This article

321,"INTRODUCTION: The hospital environment can be considered a high risk for the 
occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission outbreaks, either for health professionals 
who are directly involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of the 
disease, or for patients, for being in an environment more vulnerable to the 
acquisition of nosocomial infections.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to analyze the occurrence and transmission 
dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in outbreaks and local chains of transmission in a large 
tertiary teaching hospital in southern Brazil, in addition to verifying 
circulating strains and their stromepidemiological relation in the local 
context.
METHODS: Molecular epidemiology study from September 21, 2020 to October 5, 
2021. Positive samples involved in COVID-19 clusters or outbreaks were analyzed 
using clinical, epidemiological and genomic data.
RESULTS: Different lineages and sublineages among patients in the same room were 
observed. Most patients had their first clinical manifestation, evidence of 
suspicion, and diagnostic confirmation within 7-14 days or >14 days after 
hospital admission. The patients who have contact with confirmed cases of 
COVID-19 spent, on average, 6.28 days in the same environment until the positive 
test. There was a significant association between the outcome and the number of 
vaccine doses (p<0.05), where those who received two doses presented a lower 
occurrence of death. There was a total replacement of Variant of Concern (VOC) 
Gamma by VOC Delta from August 2021 at the study site.
CONCLUSION: Although the epidemiological analysis indicates nosocomial 
infections, through genomic sequencing, it was established that most of the 
hospital outbreaks had different origins. These findings highlight the utility 
of integrating epidemiological and genomic data to identify possible routes of 
viral entry and dissemination. This article is protected by copyright. All

322,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). Though many 
methods have been used for detecting SARS-COV-2, development of an ultrafast and 
highly sensitive detection strategy to screen and/or diagnose suspected cases in 
the population, especially early-stage patients with low viral load, is 
significant for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. In this study, a novel 
restriction endonuclease-mediated reverse transcription multiple cross 
displacement amplification (MCDA) combined with real-time fluorescence analysis 
(rRT-MCDA) was successfully established and performed to diagnose COVID-19 
infection (COVID-19 rRT-MCDA). Two sets of specific SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA primers 
targeting opening reading frame 1a/b (ORF1ab) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes were 
designed and modified according to the reaction mechanism. The SARS-COV-2 
rRT-MCDA test was optimized and evaluated using various pathogens and clinical 
samples. The optimal reaction condition of SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA assay was 65°C 
for 36 min. The SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA limit of detection (LoD) was 6.8 copies per 
reaction. Meanwhile, the specificity of SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA assay was 100%, and 
there was no cross-reaction with nucleic acids of other pathogens. In addition, 
the whole detection process of SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA, containing the RNA template 
processing (15 min) and real-time amplification (36 min), can be accomplished 
within 1 hour. The SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA test established in the current report is 
a novel, ultrafast, ultrasensitive, and highly specific detection method, which 
can be performed as a valuable screening and/or diagnostic tool for COVID-19 in 
clinical application. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

323,"BACKGROUND: Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) and clinical 
splenomegaly by 6 months of age appeared at greater risk of invasive infections 
after 5 years of the Jamaican Cohort Study. We determined whether this risk 
remained significant over a longer study period, using a more rigorous 
definition of infection and examining the contribution of potential confounders.
METHODS: Newborn screening of 100,000 consecutive deliveries during 1973-1981 
detected 311 births with HbSS. Age at first clinical splenomegaly was used to 
categorize 285 of these patients in whom this could be determined: at or before 
7 months (early), after 7 months (later), or 'never' palpated despite repeated 
examinations. Infective episodes were confined to 'first infections confirmed by 
positive culture'. Using a generalized linear model, the risk of septicaemia was 
assessed in each group, after adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Of 93 'first infections', 42 occurred in 105 subjects in the 'early' 
group, 49 in 157 subjects in the 'later' group, and two in 23 subjects in the 
'never' group; the observed to expected ratio of 1.42, 0.90 and 0.22 was highly 
significant (p = .003). Assessed as risk ratios, 'early' splenomegaly had a 
significantly higher risk ratio (RR) for septicaemia (RR = 7.4, confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.1-50.7, p < .05) when compared to the 'never' group adjusting 
for vaccine exposure and foetal haemoglobin concentration. The most common 
organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella species, Haemophilus 
influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus.
CONCLUSION: Early clinical splenomegaly in HbSS remains a predictor of 
septicaemia, defining a group that may require closer monitoring."
324,"Anticancer drug development is important for human health, yet it remains a 
tremendous challenge. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which induces cancer cell 
apoptosis via light-triggered production of reactive oxygen species, is a 
promising method. However, it has minimal efficacy in subcellular targeting, 
hypoxic microenvironments, and deep-seated malignancies. Here, we constructed a 
breast cancer photo-activable theranostic nanosystem through the rational design 
of a synthetic lysosomal-targeted molecule with multifunctions as 
aggregation-induced near-infrared (NIR) emission, a photosensitizer (PDT), and 
organosilver (chemotherapy) for NIR imaging and synergistic cancer therapy. The 
synthetic molecule could self-assemble into nanoparticles (TPIMBS NPs) and be 
stabilized with amphiphilic block copolymers for enhanced accumulation in tumor 
sites through passive targeting while reducing the leakage in normal tissues. 
Through photochemical internalization, TPIMBS NPs preferentially concentrated in 
the lysosomes of cancer cells and generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon 
light irradiation, resulting in lysosomal rupture and release of PSs to the 
cytosol, which led to cell apoptosis. Further, the photoinduced release of Ag+ 
from TPIMBS NPs could act as chemotherapy, significantly improving the overall 
therapeutic efficacy by synergistic effects with PDT. This research sheds fresh 
light on the creation of effective cancer treatments."
325,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a glycoprotein expressed in 
epithelial cells and leukocytes, has an antibacterial effect and plays a role in 
innate immunity. The delivery of LCN2 encapsulated in liposomes to oral 
epithelium may be useful to prevent oral infectious diseases. This study aimed 
to investigate the inhibitory effect of LCN2, artificially synthesized using a 
cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system, on the adhesion of Porphyromonas 
gingivalis to oral epithelial cells in order to approach oral healthcare using 
LCN2.
METHODS: LCN 2 was synthesized using a CFPS system and assayed by Western 
blotting, mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The 
bilayer liposomes were prepared by the spontaneous transfer method using 
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine (DOPC), 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine from 
Egg Yolk (Egg-PC), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The 
cellular and medium fractions derived from the culture of oral epithelial cells 
with liposome-encapsulated LCN2 were assayed by Western blotting and ELISA. The 
effect of the synthesized LCN2 on adhesion of the labeled P. gingivalis to oral 
epithelial cells was investigated as an evaluation of its antibacterial 
activity.
RESULTS: The synthesized LCN2 protein was identified by Western blotting; its 
amino acid sequence was similar to that of recombinant LCN2 protein. The 
additions of DOPE and octa-arginine in the outer lipid-layer components of 
liposome significantly increased the delivery of liposomes to epithelial cells. 
When oral epithelial cells were cultured with the synthesized and 
liposome-encapsulated LCN2, LCN2 was identified in the cellular and medium 
fractions by Western blotting and its concentration in the cellular fraction 
from the culture with the synthesized LCN2 was significantly higher than that of 
a template DNA-free protein. The synthesized LCN2 and liposome-encapsulated LCN2 
significantly inhibited the adhesion of P. gingivalis to oral epithelial cells 
compared with template DNA-free protein.
CONCLUSION: LCN2 was artificially synthesized by a CFPS system, encapsulated in 
liposomes, and delivered to oral epithelial cells, and demonstrated an 
antibacterial action against P. gingivalis. This approach may become a useful 
model for oral healthcare."
326,"BACKGROUND: There have been significant changes in clinical guidelines for 
sickle cell disease (SCD) over the past two decades, including updated 
indications for hydroxyurea, transfusions, and iron overload management. In 
practice however, there are few studies that examine SCD care utilization over 
time.
METHODS: We conducted a serial cross-sectional cohort study of pediatric SCD 
patients from 2004 to 2019 using Georgia Medicaid claims data. For each year, we 
reported receipt of any transfusion, chronic transfusion, or three or more 
filled hydroxyurea prescriptions. For children receiving chronic transfusion 
(six or more annual transfusions), we evaluated iron overload diagnosis, 
monitoring, and chelation use. Among children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), we 
examined rates of transfusions and hydroxyurea use. The Cochran-Armitage test 
was used to assess trend.
RESULTS: There were 5316 unique children 2-18 years old with SCD enrolled in 
Georgia Medicaid from 2004 to 2019. Children receiving any transfusion increased 
from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized. In SCA patients, chronic transfusions 
initially increased from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized from 2010 to 2019. For 
chronically transfused children, monitoring of iron burden and filled chelator 
prescriptions both increased significantly. Hydroxyurea use in SCA patients 
increased from 12% to 37%, with increases noted within each age group, most 
notably from 21% to 60% in the 13-18-year-old cohort.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated changes in SCD care utilization over time, including 
increased hydroxyurea use, changes in transfusion rates, and increased attention 
to iron overload management. While trends in clinical management do follow 
updates in treatment guidelines, there is still delayed and suboptimal uptake of 
guideline recommendations in pediatric SCD patients."
327,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACLI) is a common sports injury 
of the knee joint, and ACLI patients often develop early knee osteoarthritis 
(KOA) after surgery. This may be due to the activation of a post-surgical 
inflammatory response.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the treatment efficacy of arthroscopic anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction (AACLR) combined with sodium hyaluronate (SH) 
in ACLI patients with and without KOA.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 226 ACLI patients 
with or without KOA who were admitted between July 2015 and December 2018 into 
The Second Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China. All patients received AACLR 
surgery combined with 50 mg SH. Serum levels of inflammatory markers were 
evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and knees were 
assessed using the Lysholm Knee Score and the International Knee Documentation 
Committee Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC). The range of motion of the knee joint was 
also measured.
RESULTS: The mean disease course was 73.39 ±30.90 months for ACLI patients with 
KOA, which was significantly longer than for those without KOA (3.74 ±1.70 
months). Also, surgery duration was remarkably longer for patients with KOA than 
it was for those without this disease. The Lysholm Knee Score and IKDC score, as 
well as the range of knee joint motion were significantly improved in all 
patients after treatment compared to baseline. However, no significant 
differences were found between the groups. One day, 3 days and 7 days after 
surgery, significantly higher inflammatory marker levels were found in the 
patients with KOA than in those without KOA.
CONCLUSIONS: The AACLR combined with SH was efficacious as it improved knee 
function and inflammation in all patients, while patients without KOA exhibited 
a more rapid recovery from the post-surgical inflammatory response."
328,"OBJECTIVE: To inform efforts to improve equity in the quality of behavioral 
healthcare by examining income-related differences in performance on HEDIS 
behavioral health measures in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Reporting Year 2019 MA HEDIS data were obtained 
and analyzed.
STUDY DESIGN: Logistic regression models were used to estimate differences in 
performance related to enrollee income, adjusting for sex, age, and 
race-and-ethnicity. Low-income enrollees were identified by Dual Eligibility for 
Medicare and Medicaid or receipt of the Low-Income Subsidy (DE/LIS). Models 
without and with random effects for plans were used to estimate overall and 
within-plan differences in measure performance. Heterogeneity by 
race-and-ethnicity in the associations of low-income with behavioral health 
quality were examined using models with interaction terms.
DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data were included for all MA contracts in 
the fifty states and the District of Columbia that collect HEDIS data.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For six of eight measures, enrollees with DE/LIS coverage 
were more likely to have behavioral health conditions that qualify for HEDIS 
measures than higher income enrollees. In mixed-effects logistic regression 
models, DE/LIS coverage was associated with statistically significantly worse 
overall performance on five measures, with four large (>5 percentage point) 
differences (-7.5 to -11.1 percentage points) related to follow-up after 
hospitalization and avoidance of drug-disease interactions. Where the 
differences were large, they were primarily within-plan rather than 
between-plan. Interactions between DE/LIS and race-and-ethnicity were 
statistically significant (p<0.05) for all measures; income-based quality gaps 
were larger for White enrollees than for Black or Hispanic enrollees.
CONCLUSIONS: Low income is associated with lower performance on behavioral 
health HEDIS measures in MA, but these associations differ across 
racial-and-ethnic groups. Improving care integration and addressing barriers to 
care for low-income enrollees may improve equity across income levels in 
behavioral healthcare. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

329,"Device-measured physical activity and sedentary time are suggested to be more 
important determinants of all-cause mortality compared to body mass index (BMI) 
in mainly older adults. However, the joint associations of physical activity and 
sedentary time with BMI in relation to mortality risk in relatively healthy 
middle-aged individuals are unclear. We followed 770 adults (56 % women, mean 
age 55.6 years) from a population-based cohort study for up to 15.3 years. BMI 
categories were combined with tertiles of total, light, and moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity and sedentary time. Cox proportional hazards models estimated 
hazard ratios (HR) of all-cause mortality with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
High total and light intensity physical activity and low sedentary time were 
associated with a lower risk of mortality in normal weight individuals compared 
with low active overweight/obese; HR: 0.35 (CI: 0.14, 0.86), HR: 0.33 (CI 0.12, 
0.89) and HR: 0.34 (CI: 0.13, 0.92). Among overweight/obese individuals, those 
who were medium active in light physical activity had a lower mortality risk, 
HR: 0.36 (CI: 0.15, 0.83), compared with low active. Medium sedentary 
individuals had a lower risk, HR: 0.43 (CI: 0.20, 0.94) compared with those who 
were most sedentary. Associations among the most active or least sedentary 
tertiles were similar irrespective of BMI category. In conclusion, higher 
physical activity and lower sedentary time were associated with lower mortality 
risk irrespective of BMI. Physical activity should be promoted and prescribed to 
individuals with low physical activity levels irrespective of weight status."
330,"Through his broad perspectives and curiosity, Howard Rachlin took behaviorism, 
added critical perspectives and behavioral economics, and contributed 
substantially to developing behaviorism as an approach to addressing complex 
human actions and engagements. This essay describes the influence of Rachlin's 
work in three areas that reflect this broader growth of the field: 1) 
teleological behaviorism as a response to essentialist thinking about behavior, 
typified by Ryle's category mistake and including concepts in psychopathology; 
2) self-control as choices among rewards differing by amount and delay and the 
application of this model to clinical and preventive interventions; and 3) 
behavioral economic modeling of social support as a commodity substitutable for 
other commodities of interest such as nicotine. These and the body of Rachlin's 
work suggest a view not only of interdependencies among behaviors, patterns of 
behavior, and their consequences, but more broadly, of interdependencies among 
different settings and their effects on behavior, leading to a behaviorism of 
systems and contexts. Replacing essentialist discourse of individuals, 
individual behaviors, and discrete influences, a world view or Weltanschauung 
emerges of diffuse interdependencies across patterns, individuals, settings, 
systems, probabilities, and consequences."
331,"OBJECTIVES: Aeromonas spp. often cause life-threatening diseases, including 
necrotizing fasciitis, which may lead to septic shock and ultimately death. 
Aeromonas infections are believed to be transmitted via minor wounds or the 
consumption of fresh fish. However, after the detection of Aeromonas hydrophila 
(A. hydrophila) in ticks in areas endemic to Japanese spotted fever (JSF), a 
novel transmission route of A. hydrophila (i.e., via tick bites) has been 
proposed. We investigated the prevalence of A. hydrophila in ticks in areas 
endemic and not endemic to JSF in the Mie Prefecture, Japan.
METHODS: We collected ticks from endemic and nonendemic areas in summer and 
winter and assessed them for presence of A. hydrophila using PCR.
RESULTS: Six A. hydrophila isolates were obtained from 95 ticks in endemic 
areas, while one A. hydrophila isolate was obtained from 142 ticks in 
non-endemic areas, in summer. All ticks that harbored A. hydrophila were 
Haemaphysalis longicornis (H.L); these ticks were almost at the larval stage and 
also carried Rickettsia spp. in the endemic area. In contrast, 51 and 41 ticks 
in the endemic and non-endemic areas were captured in winter, respectively; A. 
hydrophila was not detected in these.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the prevalence of tick-borne A. hydrophila. 
Therefore, the risk of transmission of A. hydrophila via a tick bite should be 
considered in the following conditions: areas abundant in H. L. harboring 
Rickettsia spp., in areas endemic for JSF, presence of ticks in the larval 
stage, and during the summer season. This article is protected by copyright. All

332,"OBJECTIVE: Risk factors of mortality in critically ill children with 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are not well described. This systematic 
review aims to determine overall mortality of critically ill children with HLH, 
and describes etiologies, treatment, and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) 
support employed.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from 
inception until February 28, 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and randomized controlled trials 
reporting children aged 18 years or below, diagnosed with HLH and admitted to 
the PICU.
DATA EXTRACTION: Etiologies, treatment modalities, PICU therapies, and mortality 
outcomes were summarized. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Total 36 studies (total patients = 493, mean age: 49.5 months 
[95% confidence interval (CI): 30.9-79.5]) were included. Pooled mortality rate 
was 32.6% (95% CI: 23.4-42.4). The most frequent etiologies for HLH were 
infections (53.3%) and primary HLH (12.8%), while the remaining cases were due 
to other causes of secondary HLH, including autoimmune diseases, malignancy, and 
drug-induced and idiopathic HLH. Pooled mortality rate was higher in primary 
than secondary HLH (72.2%, 95% CI: 57.8-84.5 vs. 23.9%, 95% CI: 14.4-35.02; p < 
.01). Univariate analysis found that treatment with etoposide was associated 
with higher mortality, while intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) were associated 
with lower mortality. Conversely, multivariable analysis adjusted for etiology 
demonstrated no association between etoposide and IVIG use, and mortality. 
Twenty-one studies (total patients = 278) had detailed information on PICU 
therapies. Mechanical ventilation (MV), continuous renal replacement therapy, 
and inotropes were used in 107 (38.5%), 66 (23.7%), and 51 patients (18.3%), 
respectively. Need for MV was associated with increased risk of mortality (mean 
difference = 28%, 95% CI: 9-47).
CONCLUSION: Critically ill children with HLH have high mortality rates and 
require substantial PICU support. Collaborative work between multiple centers 
with standardized data collection can potentially provide more robust data."
333,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess pain catastrophizing 
and functional disability in pediatric patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) 
and their parents/guardians. Secondary objectives included examining 
relationships between pain catastrophizing, functional disability, and 
correlations with other factors (e.g., age, disease severity, and percent of 
body surface area (BSA) involved).
METHODS: Patients with EB ages 8-16 and their parents/guardians who were English 
or Spanish speaking completed a one-time online survey. Parent measures 
included: demographics questionnaire, Pain Catastrophizing Scale-Parent (PCS), 
and Parent Functional Disability Inventory (FDI). Child measures included: PCS 
child and child FDI. Higher scores on both scales indicate higher levels of 
catastrophizing and functional disability.
RESULTS: Of 31 children, the mean age was 11.47 years and the majority (70.97%) 
had dystrophic EB. Mean scores were: 35.84 = PCS parent; 34.58 = PCS child; 
30.87 = parent FDI; 29.77 = child FDI. Total scores for PCS parent, parent FDI, 
and child FDI increased significantly with disease severity and percentage of 
involved BSA (p < .01 for all). Total scores for PCS child increased 
significantly with percent of EB skin involvement (p = .04) but not disease 
severity. Older children reported more functional disability than their parents 
and younger children (p = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate significant positive correlations between 
negative thoughts related to pain and the experience of functional difficulties 
in patients with EB and their caregivers. Psychological, psychiatric, and/or 
behavioral interventions to help managing chronic pain may be effective for 
patients with EB."
334,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To determine the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) in the Mackay-Isaac-Whitsunday region in Northern Queensland (-21.14° S) 
and to allow a comparison with Southern Australian and New Zealand data 
(Geelong, Australia -38.14° S; Tasmania -41.43° S and -42.88° S (Launceston and 
Hobart) and Canterbury, New Zealand -43.46 °S).
DESIGN: A prospective observational community population-based IBD study was 
conducted between 1 June 2017 and 31 May 2018.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary includes the crude annual incidence rate of IBD, 
Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and inflammatory bowel 
disease-unclassified (IBDU), while secondary includes disease phenotype and 
behaviour.
RESULTS: Fifty-six new cases of IBD were identified. Twenty-three were CD, 30 
were UC and 3 were IBDU. The crude annual incidence rate per 100 000 for IBD, 
CD, UC and IBDU were 32.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 24.78-41.84), 13.23 
(95% CI: 8.79-19.90), 17.25 (95% CI: 12.06-24.67) and 1.73 (95% CI: 0.56-5.35). 
When directly age-standardised to the World Health Organisation Standard 
Population Distribution, the overall CD, UC and IBDU incidence were 13.19, 17.34 
and 1.85 per 100 000, with an overall age-standardised IBD incidence of 32.38.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to define the incidence of IBD in a 
Northern Australian cohort and to allow a comparison between North and Southern 
Australia. The IBD crude is the highest reported in Australia. Like others, we 
found a high and low incidence of upper gastrointestinal Crohn's disease and 
complicated disease at diagnosis respectively, likely reflective of the 
increased availability and early uptake of endoscopic procedures."
335,"PURPOSE: With increased concomitant chronic diseases in type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM), the use of multiple drugs increases as well as the risk of drug-drug 
interactions (DDI) and adverse drug reactions (ADR). Nevertheless, how 
medication patterns vary in T2DM patients across different sex and age groups is 
unclear. This study aims to identify and quantify common drug combinations in 
first-time metformin users with polypharmacy (≥5 co-medications).
METHODS: New users of metformin were identified from the IQVIA Medical Research 
Data incorporating data from THIN, A Cegedim Database (2016-2019). A descriptive 
cohort study explored prescription patterns in patients with polypharmacy. The 
Apriori algorithm, used to find frequent item-sets in databases, was first-time 
applied to identify and quantify drug combinations of up to 7 drugs to 
investigate potential harmful polypharmacy patterns.
RESULTS: The cohort included 34,169 new-users of metformin, of which 20,854 
(61.0%) received polypharmacy. Atorvastatin was the most frequently 
co-prescribed drug with metformin overall (38.7%), in women (34.3%) and men 
(42.6%). In the stratified analysis, a higher proportion of women received 
polypharmacy (65.6%) compared to men (57.4%). Moreover, the proportion of 
patients receiving polypharmacy increased with age (18 - 39 years = 30.4%, 40 - 
59 years = 50.5%, 60 - 74 years = 70.9%, and ≥75 years = 84.3%).
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to identify and quantify commonly prescribed 
combinations of drugs compounds in patients with polypharmacy using the Apriori 
algorithm. The high polypharmacy prevalence at all strata indicates the need to 
optimize polypharmacy to minimize DDI and ADR. This article is protected by

336,"The consumption pattern of alcohol varies between cultures and different 
communities. Moreover, alcohol consumption pattern depends on age, religion, 
education, type of drink, and other socio-economic parameters. Alcohol use has 
reportedly declined in most developed counties, but developing countries still 
witnessed an increasing trend. The study investigated socio-economic drivers, 
nature, and patterns of alcohol use among adult men in India. We have also 
investigated the state-level alcohol prevalence in India better to understand 
the impact of state-level alcohol prohibition policies. We have retrieved the 
data from the National Family Health survey's fourth and fifth-round, which was 
conducted in 2015-2016 and 2020-2021, respectively. We used the bi-variate 
technique to estimate that percentage of men who consume alcohol. Furthermore, a 
multivariate logistic regression model was applied to assess the association of 
each background characteristic with alcohol consumption. It is observed that 19 
percent of men aged 15 and above currently drink alcohol, including 20 percent 
in rural and 17 percent in urban areas. The consumption of tadi/madi/country 
liquor/homemade liquor was high in rural areas than in urban areas in both 
rounds of the survey. Additionally, beer or wine consumption is higher in urban 
areas than in rural areas in NFHS-4 and NFHS-5. Among the 35-49 years of age 
group, around 6 and 8 times more likely to consume alcohol in NFHS-4 and NFHS-5, 
respectively. Rural men were 18 and one percent less likely to consume alcohol 
in NFHS-4 & 5 compared to urban (OR: 0.82 and 0.99 in NFHS-4 & 5 respectively). 
Despite an overall reduction in alcohol consumption among men, lowering alcohol 
consumption remains the main priority of policymakers. There is a need to target 
the most vulnerable socio-economic segments where alcohol consumption is still a 
problem, one of the primary reasons for violence against women."
337,"OBJECTIVES: Rotavirus infection is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in 
children. Children with rotavirus infection may have symptoms such as diarrhea 
or vomiting. Diarrheal diseases caused by rotavirus and other enteric pathogens 
cannot be differentiated on the basis of clinical symptoms. Therefore, 
diagnostic testing is essential to confirm a diagnosis of rotavirus infection. 
The aim of the meta-analysis is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 
immunochromatographic rotavirus antigen tests in children.
METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar 
databases for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of antigen tests for 
rotavirus in children. We included studies that provided sufficient data to 
construct a 2 × 2 table on a per patient basis. The overall sensitivity and 
specificity of the antigen tests were determined using a bivariate 
random-effects model.
RESULTS: Twelve studies with 4407 participants were included in the study. The 
meta-analysis yielded a pooled sensitivity of 89.2% (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 77.4%-95.3%) and pooled specificity of 93.2% (95% CI: 83.8%-97.3%). A 
subgroup analysis of such tests in children aged ≤5 years yielded a pooled 
sensitivity of 87.1% and pooled specificity of 91.8%. Another subgroup analysis 
of high-quality studies involving 820 participants yielded a pooled sensitivity 
of 92.3% and pooled specificity of 95.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus antigen tests have high sensitivity for the diagnosis of 
rotavirus infection in children with acute gastroenteritis. In addition, such 
tests may be effective for the identification and clinical management of 
rotavirus infection in children and the prevention of disease progression. This

338,"Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain 
multiple motions often clustered around three motional modes: ultrafast 
librational motions of amide groups, fast local backbone conformational 
fluctuations and slow chain segmental motions. This dynamic picture is mainly 
based on 15N NMR relaxation studies of IDPs at relatively low temperatures where 
the amide-water proton exchange rates are sufficiently small. Less is known, 
however, about the dynamics of IDPs at more physiological temperatures. Here, we 
investigate protein dynamics in a 441-residue long IDP, tau protein, in the 
temperature range from 0-25 °C, using 15N NMR relaxation rates and spectral 
density analysis. While at these temperatures relaxation rates are still better 
described in terms of amide group librational motions, local backbone dynamics 
and chain segmental motions, the temperature-dependent trend of spectral 
densities suggests that the timescales of fast backbone conformational 
fluctuations and slower chain segmental motions might become inseparable at 
higher temperatures. Our data demonstrate the remarkable dynamic plasticity of 
this prototypical IDP and highlight the need for dynamic studies of IDPs at 
multiple temperatures."
339,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Kidney transplant failure results in significant patient 
morbidity and mortality, increased financial burden and exacerbates the organ 
shortage faced by kidney transplant candidates. The different strategies to 
maximize graft survival in kidney transplant recipients is presented in this 
review.
RECENT FINDINGS: Maximizing kidney graft survival requires optimizing 
immunosuppression, preventing and managing recurrent disease and using general 
chronic kidney disease strategies to slow allograft injury. Herein, we review: 
1) strategies to tailor immunosuppression to the individual patient to avoid 
over and underimmunosuppression, and avoid immunosuppression-related drug 
toxicities, 2) latest findings in the following recurrent diseases: focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, complement-mediated kidney 
disease and monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance, and, 3) approaches to 
slow allograft injury including BP control, and the use of antiproteinuric 
agents and SGLT-2 inhibitors.
SUMMARY: The last two decades has seen significant improvement in allograft 
outcomes resulting from advances in immunosuppression. With the federal 
government's renewed focus on kidney disease and transplantation, and recent 
advances in biomarkers, genetic testing, big data analytics and machine 
learning, we hope to see further outcome improvements in the next decade."
340,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite the availability of potent antivirals, consensus 
guidelines and decades of research, cytomegalovirus (CMV) continues to be 
associated with negative outcomes after solid organ transplant. This has been 
attributed to postprophylaxis CMV infection and a lack of development of 
CMV-specific cell mediated immunity (CMI). A shift from a focus on antiviral 
prevention to a focus on CMI target attainment is needed to improve CMV outcomes 
after transplantation.
RECENT FINDINGS: There are many obstacles to CMI target attainment. Antiviral 
stewardship programs (AVS) have been employed to improve patient outcomes 
through appropriate antiviral use, reduction of unnecessary exposure and 
resistance mitigation. By focusing on the patient's unique substrate of 
conglomerate risk factors and addressing these factors specifically with 
evidenced based methodology, the AVS can address these obstacles, increasing 
rates of CMI and subsequently reducing risk of future CMV infection and negative 
outcomes.
SUMMARY: With its multidisciplinary composition utilizing decades of experience 
from antimicrobial stewardship principles and practices, the AVS is uniquely 
poised to facilitate the shift from a focus on prevention to CMI target 
attainment and be the supporting pillar for the frontline transplant clinician 
caring for transplant patients with CMV."
341,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Delayed graft function is a common early posttransplant event 
predictive of adverse outcomes including hospital readmission, impaired 
long-term graft function, and decreased graft and patient survival. The purpose 
of this review is to summarize recent literature describing delayed graft 
function in hopes of better understanding and managing this condition.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research efforts have been garnered towards risk factor 
modification, prevention, and earlier detection of delayed graft function. In 
this review, we aim to summarize current innovative approaches and future 
directions.
SUMMARY: Delayed graft function portends worse graft and patient outcomes. 
Continued research to prevent, and detect early perturbations in allograft 
function, and more optimally manage this disease will hopefully improve graft 
function, along with graft/patient survival."
342,"OBJECTIVE: HIV infection and malaria have been associated with different 
complications during pregnancy and delivery. HIV-positive pregnant women are at 
increased risk for all adverse outcomes of malaria during pregnancy. The main 
objective was to analyze the obstetric and perinatal consequences of malaria, 
HIV infection and HIV/malaria coinfection in pregnant women and newborns, which 
has been less well evaluated.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Maternity Service of the 
Provincial Hospital of Tete Mozambique, involving completion of a structured 
questionnaire that included demographic data, and information on the current 
pregnancy, delivery and the newborn. In total 819 women (13 to 45 years old) in 
the immediate postpartum period were enrolled between 1 March and 31 October 
2016.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HIV and malaria, considered separately, in 
pregnant women was approximately 12% (103 women with HIV and 101 with malaria). 
Only one-fifth of HIV-infected women knew their HIV status before pregnancy. A 
significantly higher proportion of women with HIV attended 4 or more antenatal 
care visits than women without HIV. Caesarean section was less frequent in HIV 
patients, and peripartum urinary infection was more frequent than in 
seronegative women [13/103 (12,6%) vs 34/716 (4,7%)]. HIV/malaria coinfection 
was 17/819 (2%) and was significantly associated with the development of 
preeclampsia when HIV-infected patients received antiretroviral treatment, and 
with an increase in urinary tract infections around delivery. With respect to 
the newborn, coinfection increased the frequency of early neonatal death, as 
well as neonatal asphyxia and jaundice.
CONCLUSIONS: In Mozambique, the prevalence of malaria and HIV infection in women 
of childbearing age continues to be high and contributes additively to 
complications during pregnancy and childbirth, and in the newborn. Therefore, 
integrating HIV, malaria and reproductive health services is essential if 
maternal and fetal outcomes are to improve. This article is protected by

343,"AIM: We applied natural language processing and machine learning to explore the 
disease-related language patterns which deserve objective measures for assessing 
language ability in Japanese patients with Alzheimer disease, while most 
previous studies have used large publicly available datasets in Euro-American 
languages.
METHODS: We obtained 276 speech-samples from 42 patients with Alzheimer disease 
and 52 healthy controls, aged 50 years or over. We used a natural language 
processing library for Python called spaCy with an add-on library called GiNZA, 
which is a Japanese parser based on Universal Dependencies designed to 
facilitate multilingual parser development. We used eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
for our classification algorithm. Each unit of part-of-speech and dependency was 
tagged and counted to create features such as tag-frequency and tag-to-tag 
transition-frequency. Each feature's importance was computed during the 100-fold 
repeated random sub-sampling validation and averaged.
RESULTS: The model resulted in an accuracy of 0.84 (SD = 0.06), and an Area 
Under the Curve of 0.90 (SD = 0.03). Among the features that were important for 
such predictions, 7 of the top 10 features were related to part-of-speech, while 
the remaining 3 were related to dependency. A box-plot analysis demonstrated 
that the appearance rates of content word-related features were lower among the 
patients, whereas those with stagnation-related features were higher.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a promising level of accuracy for predicting 
Alzheimer disease and found the language patterns corresponding to the type of 
lexical-semantic decline known as ""empty speech,"" which is regarded as a 
characteristic of Alzheimer disease. This article is protected by copyright. All

345,"The positive relationship between increased levels of circulating triglycerides 
and cardiovascular events has been observed for decades. Driven by genetic 
cohort studies, inhibitors of APOC3 and ANGPTL (angiopoietin-like protein) 3 
that reduce circulating triglycerides are poised to enter clinical practice. We 
will review the biology of how inhibition of these 2 proteins affects 
circulating lipoproteins as well as the current state of clinical development of 
monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, and silencing RNAs targeting 
APOC3 and ANGPTL3."
346,"Ischemic heart disease including myocardial infarction is still the leading 
cause of death worldwide. Although the survival early after myocardial 
infarction has been significantly improved by the introduction of percutaneous 
coronary intervention, long-term morbidity and mortality remain high. The 
elevated long-term mortality is mainly driven by cardiac remodeling processes 
triggering ischemic heart failure and electric instability. Despite the new 
developments in pharmaco-therapy of heart failure, we still lack targeted 
therapies for cardiac remodeling and fibrosis. Single-cell and genomic 
technologies allow us to map the human heart at unprecedented resolution and 
allow to gain insights into cellular and molecular heterogeneity. However, these 
technologies rely on digested tissue and isolated cells or nuclei and thus lack 
spatial information. Spatial information is critical to understand tissue 
homeostasis and disease and can be utilized to identify disease-driving cell 
populations and mechanisms including cellular cross-talk. Here, we discuss 
recent advances in single-cell and spatial genomic technologies that give 
insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms of cardiac remodeling after 
injury and can be utilized to identify novel therapeutic targets and pave the 
way toward new therapies in heart failure."
347,"Despite recent advances in treatment and prevention, stroke remains a leading 
cause of morbidity and mortality. There is a critical need to identify novel 
modifiable risk factors for disease, including environmental agents. A body of 
evidence has accumulated suggesting that elevated levels of ambient air 
pollutants may not only trigger cerebrovascular events in susceptible people 
(short-term exposures) but also increase the risk of future events (long-term 
average exposures). This review assesses the updated evidence for both short and 
long-term exposure to ambient air pollution as a risk factor for stroke 
incidence and outcomes. It discusses the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms 
and makes recommendations to mitigate exposure on a personal and community 
level. The evidence indicates that reduction in air pollutant concentrations 
represent a significant population-level opportunity to reduce risk of 
cerebrovascular disease."
348,"Accurate predictions of pathogenicity for mutations associated with genetic 
disease are key to the success of precision medicine. Inherited, missense coding 
mutations in the myocilin gene (MYOC), within its olfactomedin (OLF) domain, 
comprise the strongest genetic link to primary open angle glaucoma via a toxic 
gain of function, and MYOC is an attractive precision medicine target. However, 
not all mutations in MYOC cause glaucoma, and common variants are expected to be 
neutral polymorphisms. The gnomAD database lists ∼100 missense variants 
documented within OLF, all of which are relatively rare (allele frequency 
<0.001%) and nearly all are of unknown pathogenicity. To disambiguate disease 
from benign OLF variants, we first characterized the most prevalent 
population-based variants using a suite of cellular and biophysical assays, and 
identify two variants with features of aggregation-prone familial disease 
variants. Next, we consider all available biochemical and clinical data to 
demonstrate that pathogenic and benign variants can be differentiated 
statistically based on a single metric, thermal stability of OLF. Our results 
motivate genotyping MYOC in patients for clinical monitoring of this widespread, 
painless, and irreversible age-onset disease."
349,"OBJECTIVES: Numerous diseases and disorders are associated with mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA) mutations, among which m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations in the 
12 S ribosomal RNA gene contribute to aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic 
hearing loss worldwide.
METHODS: A total of 76,842 qualified non-invasive prenatal (NIPT) samples were 
subjected to mtDNA mutation and haplogroup analysis.
RESULTS: We detected 181 m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations, 151 of which 
were subsequently sequenced for full-length mitochondrial genome verification. 
The positive predictive values for the m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations 
were 90.78% and 90.00%, respectively, a performance comparable to that attained 
with newborn hearing screening. Furthermore, mitochondrial haplogroup analysis 
revealed that the 12 S rRNA 1555A > G mutation was enriched in sub-haplotype 
D5[p = 0, OR = 4.6706(2.81-7.78)].
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the non-invasive prenatal testing of 
cell-free DNA obtained from maternal plasma can successfully detect m.1555A > G 
and m.1494C > T mutations."
350,"Five-year survival of pancreatic cancer (PC) remains low. Murine models may not 
adequately mimic human PC and can be too small for medical device development. A 
large animal PC model could address these issues. We induced and characterized 
pancreatic tumors in Oncopigs (transgenic swine containing KRASG12D and 
TP53R167H). Oncopigs underwent injection of adenovirus expressing Cre 
recombinase (AdCre) into one of the main pancreatic ducts. Resultant tumors were 
characterized by histology, cytokine expression, exome sequencing and 
transcriptome analysis. Ten out of fourteen Oncopigs (71%) had gross tumor 
within three weeks. At necropsy all of these subjects had gastric outlet 
obstruction secondary to pancreatic tumor and phlegmon. Oncopigs with injections 
without Cre recombinase and wild type pigs with AdCre injection did not show 
notable effect. Exome and transcriptome analysis of the porcine pancreatic 
tumors revealed similarity with the molecular signatures and pathways of human 
PC. While further optimization and validation of this porcine PC model would be 
beneficial, it is anticipated that this model will be useful for focused 
research and development of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies for PC."
351,"Dynamic regulation of wound physiological signals is the basis of wound healing. 
Conventional biomaterials delivering growth factors to drive wound healing leads 
to the passive repair of soft tissues because of the mismatch of wound healing 
stages. Meanwhile, the bioactivity of wound exudate is often restricted by 
oxidation and bacterial contamination. Herein, an extracellular matrix mimicked 
nanofiber/hydrogel interpenetrated network (NFHIN) was constructed with a 3D 
nanofibrous framework for cell immigration, and interfiled aerogel containing 
cross-linked hyaluronic acid and hyperbranched polyamidoamine to balance the 
wound microenvironment. The aerogel can collect wound exudate and transform into 
a polycationic hydrogel with contact-killing effects even against intracellular 
pathogens (bactericidal rate > 99.9% in 30 min) and real-time scavenging 
property of reactive oxygen species. After co-culturing with the NFHIN, the 
bioactivity of fibroblast in theex vivoblister fluid was improved by 389.69%. 
The NFHIN showed sustainable exudate management with moisture-vapor transferring 
rate (6000 g m-2×24 h), equilibrium liquid content (75.3%), Young's modulus 
(115.1 ± 7 kPa), and anti-tearing behavior similar to human skin. The NFHIN can 
collect and activate wound exudate, turning it from a clinical problem to an 
autoimmune-derived wound regulation system, showing potential for wound care in 
critical skin diseases."
352,"Background: Students at universities increasingly struggle with mental health 
issues such as anxiety, depression, and stress. The present prevalence of these 
diseases may arise in the event of a crisis such as the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic. Aim: To estimate the level of anxiety, depression, and 
stress in female university nursing students, and to identify predictors for 
students' anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: 
An online cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using a convenient 
sample of 115 female university nursing students. The Depression Anxiety Stress 
Scale (DASS-21) questionnaire was used to assess symptoms of anxiety, 
depression, and stress. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify 
predictors of anxiety, depression, and stress. Results: Stress, anxiety, and 
depression had prevalence rates of 23.7%, 18.5%, and 34.6%, respectively. 
Significant anxiety predictors included family support, family salary, being 
diagnosed with chronic illness, and being exposed to patients with COVID-19. 
Significant correlations were found between family support, family salary, 
family history of mental illness, and fear of being infected with COVID-19 and 
depression in female university nursing students. Students' levels of stress 
were predicted by family support. Conclusion: The level of anxiety, depression, 
and stress among female university nursing students was determined to be 
moderate. It is advised that university nursing students receive interventions 
that support their mental health."
353,"Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that affects primarily the retinal 
ganglion cells (RGCs). Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the major 
risk factors for glaucoma. The mainstay of current glaucoma therapy is limited 
to lowering IOP; however, controlling IOP in certain patients can be futile in 
slowing disease progression. The understanding of potential biomolecular 
processes that occur in glaucomatous degeneration allows for the development of 
glaucoma treatments that modulate the death of RGCs. Neuroprotection is the 
modification of RGCs and the microenvironment of neurons to promote neuron 
survival and function. Numerous studies have revealed effective neuroprotection 
modalities in animal models of glaucoma; nevertheless, clinical translation 
remains a major challenge. In this review, we select the most clinically 
relevant treatment strategies, summarize preclinical and clinical data as well 
as recent therapeutic advances in IOP-independent neuroprotection research, and 
discuss the feasibility and hurdles of each therapeutic approach based on 
possible pathogenic mechanisms. We also summarize the potential therapeutic 
mechanisms of various agents in neuroprotection related to glutamate 
excitotoxicity."
354,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The adverse events associated with endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients 
undergoing hemodialysis (HD) have not been sufficiently evaluated. This study 
aimed to review the morbidity and mortality associated with ERCP in ESRD 
patients on HD using a systematic review and pooled analysis.
METHODS: A systematic review and pooled analysis were conducted on studies that 
evaluated the clinical outcomes of ERCP in patients on HD. Random-effect model 
meta-analyses with subgroup analyses were conducted. The methodological quality 
of the included publications was evaluated using the risk of bias assessment 
tool for nonrandomized studies. The publication bias was assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 239 studies were identified, and 12 studies comprising 7921 
HD patients were included in the analysis. The pooled estimated frequency of 
bleeding associated with ERCP in HD patients was 5.8% (460/7921). In the 
subgroup analysis of seven comparative studies, the ERCP-related bleeding rate 
was significantly higher in HD patients than in non-HD patients (5.5% (414/7544) 
vs. 1.5% (6734/456,833), OR 3.84; 95% CI 4.26-25.5; p &lt; 0.001). The pooled 
frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis was 8.3%. The pooled frequency of bowel 
perforation was 0.3%. The pooled estimated mortality associated with ERCP was 
7.1% The publication bias was minimal.
CONCLUSION: This pooled analysis showed that ERCP-related morbidity and 
mortality are higher in HD patients than in non-dialysis patients."
355,"Tuberculosis remains a global health threat with high morbidity. Dendritic cells 
(DCs) participate in the acute and chronic inflammatory responses to 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by directing the adaptive immune response and 
are present in lung granulomas. In macrophages, the interaction of lipid 
droplets (LDs) with mycobacteria-containing phagosomes is central to 
host-pathogen interactions. However, the data available for DCs are still a 
matter of debate. Here, we reported that bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) were 
susceptible to Mtb infection and replication at similar rate to macrophages. 
Unlike macrophages, the analysis of gene expression showed that Mtb infection 
induced a delayed increase in lipid droplet-related genes and proinflammatory 
response. Hence, LD accumulation has been observed by high-content imaging in 
late periods. Infection of BMDCs with killed H37Rv demonstrated that LD 
accumulation depends on Mtb viability. Moreover, infection with the attenuated 
strains H37Ra and M. bovis-BCG induced only an early transient increase in LDs, 
whereas virulent Mtb also induced delayed LD accumulation. In addition, 
infection with the BCG strain with the reintroduced virulence RD1 locus induced 
higher LD accumulation and bacterial replication when compared to parental BCG. 
Collectively, our data suggest that delayed LD accumulation in DCs is dependent 
on mycobacterial viability and virulence."
356,"Psoriasis is a predominantly Th17 cell-driven chronic autoinflammatory skin 
disorder. Brevilin A, a natural sesquiterpene lactone extracted from Centipeda 
minima, has been used as a traditional oriental medicine for allergic diseases 
for centuries. However, the effects of brevilin A on psoriasis have yet to be 
established. In this study, we investigated brevilin A to elucidate its 
potential effects on T cell activities in psoriasis, in animal models and 
patients. An imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis murine model was 
utilized. Experimental mice were administered different doses of brevilin A (5, 
10, 20 mg/kg respectively) for a duration of 5 days. Cutaneous manifestations 
were measured daily. Under hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC), acanthosis and proinflammatory cytokine expression 
in the dorsal skin of mice were detected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) was used for the measurement of IL-17A levels in serum samples. Naïve 
CD4+ T cells, isolated from mice spleen and lymph nodes and from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of psoriatic patients, were used to evaluate the 
effects of brevilin A on Th17 differentiation. In brevilin A-treated mice, 
brevilin A significantly reduced skin redness and scaling; acanthosis as well as 
IL-6, IL-17A, and ki-67 expressions were downregulated in the dorsal skin, and 
serum levels of IL-17A were lowered. Brevilin A also inhibited Th17 
differentiation. In conclusion, brevilin A demonstrated significant capability 
in ameliorating skin inflammation in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis and 
could modulate Th17 differentiation. Therefore, brevilin A is potentially 
pharmacologically effective in the treatment of psoriasis."
357,"BACKGROUND: The accuracy of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a diagnostic marker for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is insufficient, and the application of abnormal 
prothrombin (PIVKA-II) in HCC is still controversial.
METHODS: Serum AFP and PIVKA-II levels were analyzed in 145 cases of HCC, 57 of 
benign liver disease, 55 of cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma, 112 of 
other gastrointestinal tumors with liver metastasis, and 101 healthy controls. 
Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were used to 
evaluate the diagnostic value of AFP and PIVKA-II for HCC. The changes in serum 
AFP and PIVKA-II levels before and after treatment in 47 HCC patients who 
underwent surgery and 77 who received interventional treatment were used to 
evaluate treatment efficacy and prognosis in HCC.
RESULTS: The concentrations of AFP and PIVKA-II in the HCC group were 
significantly higher than those in other groups (p < 0.01). The diagnostic value 
of PIVKA-II in HCC was better than that of AFP, and combined detection improved 
the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The levels of AFP and PIVKA-II after 
liver cancer surgery were significantly lower than those before surgery. 
Elevated levels of PIVKA-II before surgery predicted disease progression, and 
patients who remained positive for PIVKA-II after surgery had worse prognosis 
than those who became negative after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined detection of AFP and PIVKA-II is superior to both tests 
alone. We found that higher serum level of PIVKA-II indicates more severe HCC, 
with worse prognosis, while the level of AFP had no correlation with the 
prognosis."
358,"BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether the Academic Research Consortium for High 
Bleeding Risk (ARC-HBR) criteria could apply to peripheral artery disease (PAD) 
patients undergoing endovascular therapy (EVT).
AIMS: We sought to evaluate the application of the ARC-HBR criteria to PAD 
patients undergoing EVT with contemporary drug-coated devices (DCD) for 
femoropopliteal artery lesions.
METHODS: Between May 2012 and December 2019, 542 consecutive patients undergoing 
EVT with DCD for femoropopliteal artery lesions were retrospectively analysed. 
The primary study endpoint was major bleeding events, defined as Bleeding 
Academic Research Consortium type 3 or 5.
RESULTS: Of 542 patients, 435 (80.3%) were stratified into the HBR group. The 
cumulative 5-year incidence of major bleeding events was significantly higher in 
the HBR group than in the no-HBR group (31.9% vs 2.3%; p<0.001). The 5-year 
major bleeding event rate gradually increased with the number of ARC-HBR 
criteria (≥2 major criteria: 48.6%, 1 major: 33.1%, ≥2 minor: 12.9%, and 
non-HBR: 2.3%; p<0.001). Major bleeding events were associated with a 5.4-fold 
increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 5.42, 95% confidence 
interval: 2.91-10.1; p<0.001). Severe chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and 
severe anaemia were predictors of major bleeding events.
CONCLUSIONS: 80.3% of PAD patients undergoing EVT for femoropopliteal artery 
lesions with contemporary drug-coated devices met the ARC-HBR criteria. Given 
that major bleeding events remarkably increased the risk of mortality after EVT, 
the ARC-HBR criteria might be helpful for the risk stratification of PAD 
patients who undergo EVT with contemporary DCD."
359,"The present study aims to evaluate the pretherapeutic Fibrinogen-Albumin-Ratio 
Index (FARI), as currently reliable biomarkers to predict therapy response and 
prognosis of patients with advanced vulvar cancer are missing. Data of 124 
consecutive patients, who underwent primary resection for vulvar cancer ≥ pT1b, 
were retrospectively analyzed. Associations between the FARI and disease 
recurrence were assessed fitting receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and 
binary logistic regression models; univariate and multivariable Cox regression 
models for disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 
were performed. A pretherapeutic low FARI cut at its median (&lt;9.67) is 
significantly associated with younger age (65.5 vs. 74.0 years) and higher risk 
of recurrence (52.4% vs. 26.2%). The ROC analysis calculates the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the FARI for a PFS &lt; 6 months of 0.700 and for a DSS &lt; 12 
months of 0.706, outperforming fibrinogen and albumin alone. The FARI remained 
independently predictive for PFS (HR 0.84, 95% CI [0.99-1.03], p = 0.009) and 
DSS (HR 0.82, 95% CI [0.70-0.99], p = 0.019), also in multivariable survival 
analysis. Despite the FARI's promising predictive and prognostic value, however, 
further elucidation of its precise mode of action is warranted before clinical 
application as it appears to rely only on subtle changes of fibrinogen levels."
360,"Bone disease is among the defining characteristics of symptomatic Multiple 
Myeloma (MM). Imaging techniques such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
can identify plasma cell proliferation and quantify disease activity. This 
function renders these imaging tools as suitable not only for diagnosis, but 
also for the assessment of bone disease after treatment of MM patients. The aim 
of this article is to review FDG PET/CT and MRI and their applications, with a 
focus on their role in treatment response evaluation. MRI emerges as the 
technique with the highest sensitivity in lesions' detection and PET/CT as the 
technique with a major impact on prognosis. Their comparison yields different 
results concerning the best tool to evaluate treatment response. The 
inhomogeneity of the data suggests the need to address limitations related to 
these tools with the employment of new techniques and the potential for a 
complementary use of both PET/CT and MRI to refine the sensitivity and achieve 
the standards for minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation."
361,"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease of the airways with a high prevalence 
worldwide characterized by chronic inflammation [...]."
362,"Uterine leiomyomas usually arise from the uterine body (95%), and rarely from 
the cervix (0.6%) or other urogenital sites. Lipoleiomyomas are benign, uncommon 
variants of leiomyomas (0.03-0.2%), histologically composed of smooth muscle 
cells and mature adipocytes; they usually occur in the uterine body and 
exceptionally in the cervix. We performed the first systematic literature review 
of cervical lipoleiomyomas (PRISMA guidelines), presenting five new cases. 
Including our series, thirty-one detailed cases were reported in the literature 
(mainly in Asia). The age range was 35-74 years, revealing a higher mean age 
than conventional cervical leiomyomas (46.5 vs. 39.4 years). Patients were 
usually multiparous (94%), typically complaining of vaginal bleeding (11/31, 
36%), pelvic/abdominal pain (10/31, 32%), and/or urinary disturbances (6/31, 
19%) 1 week to 10 months before presentation. Clinical examination revealed a 
pedunculated tumor (48%), or prolapse of ≥1 pelvic organs (16%). Twenty-four 
(77%) patients underwent total hysterectomy ± additional surgery; simple 
myomectomy/excision was performed in five (16%) cases. Only one (3%) of our 
cases recurred 2 years after partial excision; no evidence of disease was found 
13 years after recurrence excision. Adipocytes occupied ≤50% of the tumor 
volume. Hyaline or myxoid changes and cartilaginous metaplasia were uncommon 
histological findings. Surgically challenging cases or pregnant patients may 
require expert gynecologists. Interventional radiology or conservative 
treatments were rarely proposed."
363,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based 
radiomics models for high-risk endometrial cancer (EC) prediction 
preoperatively, to be able to estimate deep myometrial invasion (DMI) and 
lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and to discriminate between low-risk and 
other categories of risk as proposed by ESGO/ESTRO/ESP (European Society of 
Gynaecological Oncology-European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology and 
European Society of Pathology) guidelines.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 96 women with EC who underwent 1.5-T 
MR imaging before surgical staging between April 2009 and May 2019 in two 
referral centers divided into training (T = 73) and validation cohorts (V = 23). 
Radiomics features were extracted using the MODDICOM library with manual 
delineation of whole-tumor volume on MR images (axial T2-weighted). Diagnostic 
performances of radiomic models were evaluated by area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve in training (AUCT) and validation (AUCV) 
cohorts by using a subset of the most relevant texture features tested 
individually in univariate analysis using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney.
RESULTS: A total of 228 radiomics features were extracted and ultimately limited 
to 38 for DMI, 29 for LVSI, and 15 for risk-classes prediction for logistic 
radiomic modeling. Whole-tumor radiomic models yielded an AUCT/AUCV of 0.85/0.68 
in DMI estimation, 0.92/0.81 in LVSI prediction, and 0.84/0.76 for 
differentiating low-risk vs other risk classes 
(intermediate/high-intermediate/high).
CONCLUSION: MRI-based radiomics has great potential in developing advanced 
prognostication in EC."
364,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a disease affecting upper and lower motor 
neurons. Although motor neuron death is the core event of ALS pathology, it is 
increasingly recognized that other tissues and cell types are affected in the 
disease, making potentially major contributions to the occurrence and 
progression of pathology. We review here the known cellular and molecular 
characteristics of muscle tissue affected by ALS. Evidence of toxicity in 
skeletal muscle tissue is considered, including metabolic dysfunctions, impaired 
proteostasis, and deficits in muscle regeneration and RNA metabolism. The role 
of muscle as a secretory organ, and effects on the skeletal muscle secretome are 
also covered, including the increase in secretion of toxic factors or decrease 
in essential factors that have consequences for neuronal function and survival."
365,"The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic status to 
mild infections, to severe disease and death. In this context, the 
identification of specific susceptibility factors is crucial to detect people at 
the higher risk of severe disease and improve the outcome of COVID-19 treatment. 
Several studies identified genetic variants conferring higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 
infection and COVID-19 severity. The present study explored their genetic 
distribution among different populations (AFR, EAS, EUR and SAS). As a result, 
the obtained data support the existence of a genetic basis for the observed 
variability among populations, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease 
outcomes. The comparison of ORs distribution for genetic risk of infection as 
well as for disease outcome shows that each population presents its own 
characteristics. These data suggest that each country could benefit from a 
population-wide risk assessment, aimed to personalize the national vaccine 
programs and the preventative measures as well as the allocation of resources 
and the access to proper therapeutic interventions. Moreover, the host genetics 
should be further investigated in order to realize personalized medicine 
protocols tailored to improve the management of patients suffering from 
COVID-19."
366,"Disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is influenced by activation of 
circulating and synovial immune cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and monocytes 
are key cells that drive inflammation in RA. This study investigated if a 
relationship exists between disease activity in RA and circulating Treg and 
monocyte numbers and phenotypes. A potential sialic acid (Sia) mediated link 
between Tregs and monocytes was also probed in vitro. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from RA patient (n = 62) and healthy 
control (n = 21) blood using density gradient separation. Flow cytometry was 
used to count and phenotype Treg and monocyte subsets, and to sort healthy 
control Tregs for Sia cell culture experiments. The effects of Sia on activated 
Treg FoxP3 and NFκB expression was assessed by flow cytometry and concentrations 
of secreted TNFα, IL-10 and IFNγ determined by ELISA. High disease activity RA 
patients who were unresponsive to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (n = 
31), have significantly lower relative numbers (percentages) of CD4+CD25+CD127- 
Tregs (p &lt; 0.01) and memory CD45RA-FoxP3+ Tregs (p &lt; 0.01), compared to 
low disease activity responders (n = 24). Relative numbers of non-classical 
CD169+ monocytes are associated with disease activity in RA (p = 0.012). Sia 
reduced Treg expression of FoxP3, NFκB and cytokines in vitro. A strong 
association has been identified between non-classical CD169+ monocytes and 
post-treatment disease activity in RA. This study also indicates that Sia can 
reduce Treg activation and cytokine release. We postulate that such a reduction 
could be mediated by interaction with sialyted proteins captured by CD169+ 
monocytes."
367,"Studies observed that women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy had a 
higher risk of preterm birth. Although it is likely that COVID-19 during the 
late trimester of pregnancy can trigger premature birth, prematurity remains a 
concern, and it is vital to study additional clinical and biological patient 
factors that are highly associated with this negative pregnancy outcome and 
allow for better management based on the existing predictors. In order to 
achieve this goal, the current study retrospectively recruited 428 pregnant 
patients that were separated into three study groups using a 1:2:4 matching 
ratio and a nearest-neighbor matching method. Sixty-one pregnant patients had a 
history of COVID-19 during pregnancy and gave birth prematurely; 124 pregnant 
patient controls had COVID-19 and gave birth full-term, while the second control 
group of 243 pregnant patients had a premature birth but no history of COVID-19. 
It was observed that a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the third 
trimester was significantly more likely to be associated with premature birth. 
Even though the rate of ICU admission was higher in these cases, the mortality 
rate did not change significantly in the COVID-19 groups. However, SARS-CoV-2 
infection alone did not show statistical significance in determining a premature 
birth (β = 1.09, CI = 0.94-1.15, p-value = 0.067). Maternal anemia was the 
strongest predictor for prematurity in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection (β 
= 3.65, CI = 1.46-5.39, p-value &lt; 0.001), followed by elevated CRP (β = 2.11, 
CI = 1.20-3.06, p-value &lt; 0.001), and respectively IL-6 (β = 1.92, CI = 
1.20-2.47, p-value = 0.001. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased 
risk of preterm birth, as shown by our data. If SARS-CoV-2 infection arises 
during the third trimester, it is recommended that these patients be 
hospitalized for surveillance of clinical evolution and biological parameters, 
such as anemia and high inflammatory markers, which have a multiplicative 
influence on the pregnancy result."
368,"Suboptimal states of vitamin D may play a role in psoriasis evolution, but the 
interconnections have been studied over the past years with controversial 
results. Although a peerless therapy among moderate to severe types of 
psoriasis, the therapeutic effectiveness of biological therapy may vary 
unforeseeably between patients and leads to biologics switch. We conducted a 
pilot study in patients diagnosed with psoriasis and treated with biologics, the 
purpose of which was to explore the prevalence of suboptimal states of vitamin 
D, especially in the group of patients characterized by the failure of previous 
biologics, and to investigate the associations between vitamin D levels and 
psoriasis, regarding aspects such the severity of the disease and quality of 
life. Their current result of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) was also 
considered concerning a feasible relationship with vitamin D levels. From July 
to December 2021, 45 patients corresponding to our inclusion criteria were 
assessed. Variables such as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and 
the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score, as well as vitamin D serum 
concentrations and their LTBI result, were recorded for them. Lower serum 
concentrations of vitamin D were not more common in patients characterized by 
failure to previous biologics (p = 0.443), but we concluded a weak correlation 
between the DLQI score and vitamin D (rho = -0.345, p-value = 0.020), although a 
statistically insignificant result was obtained between vitamin D and the PASI 
score (rho = -0.280, p-value = 0.062), and with the LTBI result (rho = -0.053, 
p-value = 0.728). These results establish a connection between higher levels of 
vitamin D and a better outcome of psoriasis from the perspective of the 
patient's quality of life, with no significant association with psoriasis 
severity and no significant prevalence of suboptimal states among patients that 
failed previous biologics compared to those with a continuously good response."
369,"A machine learning platform operated without coding knowledge (Teachable 
machine®) has been introduced. The aims of the present study were to assess the 
performance of the Teachable machine® for diagnosing tympanic membrane lesions. 
A total of 3024 tympanic membrane images were used to train and validate the 
diagnostic performance of the network. Tympanic membrane images were labeled as 
normal, otitis media with effusion (OME), chronic otitis media (COM), and 
cholesteatoma. According to the complexity of the categorization, Level I refers 
to normal versus abnormal tympanic membrane; Level II was defined as normal, 
OME, or COM + cholesteatoma; and Level III distinguishes between all four 
pathologies. In addition, eighty representative test images were used to assess 
the performance. Teachable machine® automatically creates a classification 
network and presents diagnostic performance when images are uploaded. The mean 
accuracy of the Teachable machine® for classifying tympanic membranes as normal 
or abnormal (Level I) was 90.1%. For Level II, the mean accuracy was 89.0% and 
for Level III it was 86.2%. The overall accuracy of the classification of the 80 
representative tympanic membrane images was 78.75%, and the hit rates for 
normal, OME, COM, and cholesteatoma were 95.0%, 70.0%, 90.0%, and 60.0%, 
respectively. Teachable machine® could successfully generate the diagnostic 
network for classifying tympanic membrane."
370,"Postoperative complications such as seroma formation and wound-site infection 
occur following completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for melanoma. 
We analyzed the impact of time-to-drain removal and drainage volume on seroma 
formation after ALND. We retrospectively analyzed data from 118 patients after 
completion ALND for melanoma. Primary endpoints were daily amount of drainage 
volume, seroma formation and time-to-drain removal. Secondary endpoints included 
patient-related, disease-specific and perioperative parameters as well as the 
number of histologically analyzed lymph nodes and surgical complications graded 
by the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDCL). Statistical analyses were performed 
using logistic regression models. Drain removal around the 8th postoperative day 
was statistically associated with a lower risk for the occurrence of seroma 
formation (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with an increased drainage volume during the 
early postoperative days were more prone to develop seroma after drain removal. 
With 49% (CDCL I and II), most complications were managed conservatively, while 
only 5.9% (CDCL III) required revision surgery (CDCL overall: 55.9%). ALND is a 
safe procedure with a low rate of severe CDCL III type of complications. To 
decrease seroma evacuation, our results imply that drains should be removed 
around the 8th postoperative day to reduce the risk of infection, readmission or 
prolonged hospitalization."
371,"COVID-19 continues to afflict the global population, causing several 
pathological diseases and exacerbating co-morbidities due to SARS-CoV-2's high 
mutation. Recent interest has been devoted to some neuronal manifestations and 
to increased levels of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain-derived Neurotrophic 
Factor (BDNF) in the bloodstream during SARS-CoV-2 infection, neurotrophins that 
are well-known for their multifactorial actions on neuro-immune-endocrine and 
visual functions. Nineteen (19) patients were enrolled in this monocentric 
prospective study and subjected to anamnesis and biosamples collection (saliva 
and blood) at hospitalization (acute phase) and 6 months later (remission 
phase). NGF and BDNF were quantified by ELISA, and biochemical data were related 
to biostrumental measurements. Increased NGF and BDNF levels were quantified in 
saliva and serum during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (hospitalized 
patients), and reduced levels were observed in the next 6 months (remission 
phase), never matching the baseline values. Salivary and circulating data would 
suggest the possibility of considering sera and saliva as useful matrices for 
quickly screening neurotrophins, in addition to SARS-CoV2 antigens and RNA. 
Overall, the findings described herein highlight the importance of NGF and BDNF 
as dynamic biomarkers for monitoring disease and reinforces the possibility of 
using saliva and sera for quick, non-invasive COVID-19 screening."
372,"Lung cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide. Numerous 
medications targeting specific molecular alterations in non-small cell lung 
cancer have been introduced in the last decade and have revolutionized the 
clinical management of the disease. Their use has brought to a parallel 
evolution of molecular testing techniques to identify alterations in druggable 
molecular targets within the genetic material of the tumors. To perform 
molecular testing, biopsy or surgery tissue specimens are needed, which in 
addition allow the histological characterization of the tumors. Unfortunately, 
in real-life practice not all the patients are suitable for biopsy or surgery 
procedures. The use of liquid biopsy for blood extracted tumoral DNA analysis is 
a promising approach in unbiopsied cases, but it is also weighted by several 
methodological and technical limitations. We report here a case of 
histologically undiagnosed lung cancer managed with a liquid biopsy and 
subsequently with anti-EGFR treatment. Our report highlights that the use of 
liquid biopsy molecular testing in specific clinical situations can offer 
treatment opportunities for fragile patients affected by lung cancer."
373,"It is known that pneumothorax (PX) and pneumomediastinum (PM) develop due to 
COVID-19 disease. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of 
PX/PM due to COVID-19 in the intermediate intensive care unit (IMCU) and to 
evaluate the factors causing barotrauma and also the clinical outcomes of these 
patients. A total of 283 non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia followed 
up in the IMCU in a 1-year period were included in the study. The patients were 
classified as group 1 (having barotrauma) and group 2 (without barotrauma). The 
rate of barotrauma was 8.1% (n = 23, group 1). PX developed on the right 
hemithorax in 12 (70.6%) patients. Group 1 had statistically significantly 
higher 28-day mortality rates compared with group 2 (p = 0.014). The eosinophil 
and d-dimer levels of the patients in group 1 were higher, while C-reactive 
protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and albumin levels were lower than Group 2 (p &lt; 
0.001, p = 0.017, p = 0.001, p &lt; 0.001), and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The 
similar rates of NIMV administration in our study groups support that barotrauma 
is not the only mechanism in the development of PX/PM. The findings of high 
blood eosinophil count and low blood levels of CRP, albumin, and fibrinogen in 
the barotrauma group of our study might be a pathfinder for future studies."
374,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common and 
devastating central nervous disease, the treatment of which faces many 
challenges to the medical community and society as a whole. Treatment measures 
based on oxidative stress of spinal motor neurons during SCI are expected to 
help restore biological functions of neurons under injury conditions. However, 
to date, there are no systematic reports regarding oxidative stress on spinal 
motor neuron injury. Our aim is to better understand and explain the influences 
and mechanisms of oxidative stress on spinal motor neurons during SCI.
METHODS: We first exposed VSC4.1 motor neurons to hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and 
evaluated the effects on cell viability, morphology, cycling, and apoptosis, 
with an emphasis on the changes to the cytoskeleton and the effect of 
N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) on these changes. Then, we investigated the effects of 
NAC on these cytoskeletal changes in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We found that H2 O2 caused severe damage to the normal cytoskeleton, 
leading to a reduction in neurite length and number, rearrangement of the actin 
cytoskeleton, and disorder of the microtubules and neurofilaments in VSC4.1. 
Importantly, NAC attenuated the oxidative damage of spinal motor neurons in 
vitro and in vivo, promoting the recovery of hindlimb motor ability in mice with 
SCI at the early stage of injury.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that oxidative stress plays an important role in 
the cytoskeleton destruction of spinal motor neurons in SCI, and treatment of 
SCI on this basis is a promising strategy. These findings will help to elucidate 
the role of oxidative stress in spinal motor neuron injury in SCI and provide 
references for further research into the study of the pathology and underlying 
mechanism of SCI."
375,"Fine particulate matter that have a diameter of &lt;2.5 μm (PM2.5) are an 
important factor of anthropogenic pollution since they are associated with the 
development of acute respiratory illnesses. The aim of this prospective study is 
to examine the correlation between PM2.5 levels in the semi-urban city of Volos 
and Emergency Department (ED) visits for respiratory causes. ED visits from 
patients with asthma, pneumonia and upper respiratory infection (URI) were 
recorded during a one-year period. The 24 h PM2.5 pollution data were collected 
in a prospective manner by using twelve fully automated air quality monitoring 
stations. PM2.5 levels exceeded the daily limit during 48.6% of the study 
period, with the mean PM2.5 concentration being 30.03 ± 17.47 μg/m3. PM2.5 
levels were significantly higher during winter. When PM2.5 levels were beyond 
the daily limit, there was a statistically significant increase in 
respiratory-related ED visits (1.77 vs. 2.22 visits per day; p: 0.018). PM2.5 
levels were also statistically significantly related to the number of 
URI-related ED visits (0.71 vs. 0.99 visits/day; p = 0.01). The temperature was 
negatively correlated with ED visits (r: -0.21; p &lt; 0.001) and age was found 
to be positively correlated with ED visits (r: 0.69; p &lt; 0.001), while no 
statistically significant correlation was found concerning humidity (r: 0.03; p 
= 0.58). In conclusion, PM2.5 levels had a significant effect on ED visits for 
respiratory causes in the city of Volos."
376,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis in patients after cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary 
bypass (CPB) has a high rate of mortality. We sought to determine whether 
changes in lipidomics can predict sepsis after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: We used high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass 
spectrometry to explore global lipidome changes in samples from a prospective 
case-control cohort (30 sepsis vs. 30 nonsepsis) hospitalized with 
cardiovascular surgery. All patients were sampled before and within 48-72 h 
after surgery. A bioinformatic pipeline was applied to acquire reliable features 
and MS/MS-driven identifications. Furthermore, a multiple-step machine learning 
framework was performed for signature discovery and performance evaluation.
RESULTS: Compared with preoperative samples, 94 features were upregulated and 
282 features were downregulated in the postoperative samples of the sepsis 
group, and 73 features were upregulated and 265 features were downregulated in 
the postoperative samples of the nonsepsis group. ""Autophagy"", ""pathogenic 
Escherichia coli infection"" and ""glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor 
biosynthesis"" pathways were significantly enriched in the pathway enrichment 
analysis. A multistep machine learning framework further confirmed that two 
cholesterol esters, CE (18:0) and CE (16:0), were significantly decreased in the 
sepsis group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, oleamide and stearamide were increased 
significantly in the postoperative sepsis group (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed characteristic lipidomic changes in the plasma 
of septic patients before and after cardiac surgery with CPB. We discovered two 
cholesterol esters and two amides from peripheral blood that could be promising 
signatures for sepsis within a dynamic detection between the preoperative and 
postoperative groups."

378,"BACKGROUND: The present study was devoted to the search for possible 
associations between various adipokines/cytokines associated with the secretory 
activity of visceral adipocytes, elevated blood levels of LDL-C and abdominal 
obesity in people under 45 years.
METHODS: A population sample of Novosibirsk residents (n = 1415) was divided 
into deciles based on the levels of LDL-C. The study included 158 people, 87 men 
and 71 women, who had serum LDL-C levels of ≥4.2 mmol/L. Abdominal obesity was 
found in 50% of people (54% men, 45% women). By multiplex analysis using the 
human metabolic hormone V3 panel and the human adipokine magnetic bead panel, 
levels of adipokines and inflammatory markers were determined on a Luminex 
MAGPIX flow fluorimeter.
RESULTS: According to multivariate regression analysis (binary logistic 
regression), the most significant biomolecules, regardless of other factors, 
associated with the presence of AO against the background of hyper-LDL-C in 
young people were leptin (direct association) and lipocalin-2 (reverse 
association), leptin in young men (direct association), and leptin and TNF-alpha 
in women (direct association).
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in young people under 45 years with the presence of two 
important, potentially atherogenic risk factors-hyper-LDL-C and abdominal 
obesity-a complex of adipokines and metabolic hormones were associated with the 
presence of these diseases."
379,"Public education programs about chronic kidney disease (CKD) are important 
activities worldwide. The present study investigated the knowledge of CKD in the 
general population of 58 out of 179 cities or towns in Hokkaido between 1 April 
and 30 September 2019. A total of 15,012 respondents who underwent specific 
health checkups at these centers answered the questionnaire. In response to a 
questionnaire item asking about the respondent's familiarity with the term 
""CKD"", only 6% of the respondents answered ""know it well"" and 13% answered 
""heard of it"". In contrast, in response to a questionnaire item asking about the 
respondent's familiarity with ""chronic kidney disease"", 31% answered ""know it 
well"" and 33% answered ""heard of it"". The leading avenue by which the 
respondents learned about CKD was television, followed by newspapers, magazines, 
and a family doctor or nurse. The leading component that the respondents 
considered essential for the diagnosis of CKD was proteinuria. These results 
indicated that the knowledge of CKD in Hokkaido prefecture is still inadequate. 
Many people did not appear to realize that the term ""CKD"" represents ""chronic 
kidney disease"". Further continuous public education efforts are required to 
enlighten people about CKD."
380,"Patients with neurological comorbidities are more likely to develop severe 
COVID-19. We aimed to detect the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with spontaneous 
intracerebral hemorrhage comorbidity and the role of enoxaparin in decreasing 
the mortality rate in these cases, even though enoxaparin is a potential cause 
of intracerebral hemorrhage. The patients were checked on to detect surveillance 
outcomes, the relationship between mortality and patient characteristics, and 
the relationship between enoxaparin and study outcomes. Chest condition and GCS 
improved in 67.9% of participants. Hematoma course increased in 49.1%. 
Midline-shift, brain-edema, and COVID symptoms improved in 67.9%. There was a 
non-significant difference in mortality regarding age and gender. There was a 
significant difference in mortality regarding treatment with enoxaparin; 75% of 
the patients who did not receive enoxaparin died. 92.6% of the patients who 
showed decreases in hematoma course were administered enoxaparin. 76.9% of the 
patients who showed increases in hematoma-course were administered enoxaparin. 
Most of the patients who were admitted to the neurosurgical unit with 
spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage acquired the COVID-19 infection. Most of 
the cases included in this study did not progress to severe cases. The dying 
patients showed deterioration in both neurological and COVID-19 symptoms. The 
anticoagulant properties of enoxaparin given earlier before and throughout the 
infection can considerably reduce mortality in COVID-19 individuals with 
spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. It is recommended to use enoxaparin for 
cases with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 regardless of 
hematoma size because the rate of improvement was greater than the mortality 
rate after using enoxaparin in this study."
381,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease 
of the central nervous system characterized by broad inter- and intraindividual 
heterogeneity and different prognoses. Multisystem comorbidities are frequent 
features in people with MS (PwMS) and can affect treatment choices, quality of 
life, disability and mortality. In this scenario, autoimmune comorbidities play 
a cardinal role for several reasons, such as the implication on MS pathogenesis, 
diagnostic delay, disease activity, disability progression, brain atrophy, and 
treatment choice. However, the impact of an autoimmune comorbid condition on MS 
is not fully elucidated. This review aims to summarize the currently available 
data on the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune diseases in PwMS, the 
possible effect of this association on clinical and neuroradiological MS course

382,"The ""Blood pressure levels, clinical features and markers of subclinical 
cardiovascular Damage of Asthma patients"" (BADA) study is aimed at defining the 
cardiovascular risk profile and the markers of subclinical and clinical vascular 
and cardiac damage in asthmatic patients. Very few studies have assessed 
asthmatic patients without concomitant heart disease through a transthoracic 
echocardiogram. The goal of the present study is to investigate the prevalence 
of morphology and/or function changes in the cardiac chambers of a sample of 86 
patients with chronic asthma, referred to the dedicated outpatient unit of the 
Division of Respiratory Diseases of the AOUP ""P. Giaccone"" of the University of 
Palermo, and the results obtained were compared with those of a control group 
without respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. Patients with asthma showed a 
marked and widespread involvement of the four cardiac chambers compared with the 
controls: enlargement of the two atria, greater left ventricular remodeling with 
interventricular septal thickening, increased indexed left ventricular mass with 
a significantly greater percentage of patients with overt left ventricular 
hypertrophy, worse left ventricular diastolic function proven by the significant 
difference in the E/A ratio, and worse right ventricular systolic function with 
global right ventricular dysfunction estimated by the Myocardial Performance 
Index (Tei Index). Multivariate regression analysis, after adjustment for 
essential hypertension, hypertension severity, diabetes, Body Mass Index, and 
creatinine clearance, seems to indicate that the indexed left ventricular mass, 
right atrial volume, and right ventricular Tei index (but not left ventricular 
hypertrophy) correlate significantly with asthma, severe asthma, and FEV1 (and 
to a lesser extent with asthma duration). No correlation is apparent between 
inhaled therapy (ICS, SABA) and myocardial involvement. These results seem to 
confirm that a more in-depth cardiovascular evaluation in patients with chronic 
respiratory disease allows the identification of unrecognized cardiovascular 
involvement. A transthoracic echocardiogram performed in asthmatic patients 
without clinically overt signs or symptoms of cardiovascular impairment has 
identified some features indicative of an early subclinical cardiac impairment 
not found in the control group. These findings, considering also the higher 
frequency of hypertension in the asthma group, deserve further validation in the 
future."
383,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic multifactorial and complex 
neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and the loss of 
cognitive ability, which is a problem affecting the elderly. The pathological 
intracellular accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated Tau proteins, forming 
neurofibrillary tangles, and extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, forming 
senile plaques, as well as neural disconnection, neural death and synaptic 
dysfunction in the brain, are hallmark pathologies that characterize AD. The 
prevalence of the disease continues to increase globally due to the increase in 
longevity, quality of life, and medical treatment for chronic diseases that 
decreases the mortality and enhance the survival of elderly. Medical awareness 
and the accurate diagnosis of the disease also contribute to the high prevalence 
observed globally. Unfortunately, no definitive treatment exists that can be 
used to modify the course of AD, and no available treatment is capable of 
mitigating the cognitive decline or reversing the pathology of the disease as of 
yet. A plethora of hypotheses, ranging from the cholinergic theory and dominant 
Aβ cascade hypothesis to the abnormally excessive phosphorylated Tau protein 
hypothesis, have been reported. Various explanations for the pathogenesis of AD, 
such as the abnormal excitation of the glutamate system and mitochondrial 
dysfunction, have also been suggested. Despite the continuous efforts to deliver 
significant benefits and an effective treatment for this distressing, globally 
attested aging illness, multipronged approaches and strategies for ameliorating 
the disease course based on knowledge of the underpinnings of the pathogenesis 
of AD are urgently needed. Immunosenescence is an immune deficit process that 
appears with age (inflammaging process) and encompasses the remodeling of the 
lymphoid organs, leading to alterations in the immune function and 
neuroinflammation during advanced aging, which is closely linked to the 
outgrowth of infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignant cancers. It is well 
known that long-standing inflammation negatively influences the brain over the 
course of a lifetime due to the senescence of the immune system. Herein, we aim 
to trace the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, we 
explore alternative avenues, such as neuroimmune involvement in the pathogenesis 
of AD. We determine the initial triggers of neuroinflammation, which is an early 
episode in the pre-symptomatic stages of AD and contributes to the advancement 
of the disease, and the underlying key mechanisms of brain damage that might aid 
in the development of therapeutic strategies that can be used to combat this 
devastating disease. In addition, we aim to outline the ways in which different 
aspects of the immune system, both in the brain and peripherally, behave and 
thus to contribute to AD."
384,"OBJECTIVES: Interstitial pneumonia is a severe complication induced by the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Several 
treatments have been proposed alone or, more often, in combination, depending, 
also, on the presence of other organ disfunction. The most frequently related, 
well-described, and associated phenomenon is pan-lymphopenia with circulating, 
high levels of cytokines. We report, here, on two patients with COVID-19 and 
lymphoproliferative disorders treated with Tocilizumab (a humanized monoclonal 
antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor) and followed by an [18F]FDG PET/CT 
to early evaluate the therapy's efficacy.
METHODS: One patient with angioimmunoblastic T-lymphoma (A), one with Hodgkin 
lymphoma (A), and both with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and with similar 
clinical findings of interstitial pneumonia at the CT scan, were imaged by 
[18F]FDG PET/CT before and 14 days after a single dose of Tocilizumab.
RESULTS: In both patients, the basal [18F]FDG PET/CT showed a diffused lung 
parenchyma uptake, corresponding to the hyperdense areas at the CT scan. After 2 
weeks of a Tocilizumab infusion, patient B had an improvement of symptoms, with 
normalization of the [18F]FDG uptake. By contrast, patient A, who was still 
symptomatic, showed a persisting and abnormal distribution of [18F]FDG. 
Interestingly, both patients showed a low bone marrow uptake of [18F]FDG at the 
diagnosis and after 15 days, while the spleen uptake was low only in lymphopenic 
patient A; both are indirect signs of an immune deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in these two patients, interstitial pneumonia was 
efficiently treated with Tocilizumab, as demonstrated by the [18F]FDG PET/CT. 
Our results confirm that interleukin-6 (IL6) has a role in the COVID-19 disease 
and that anti-cytokine treatment can also be performed in patients with 
lymphoproliferative disorders."
385,"(1) Background: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is widely performed in 
bariatric surgery. However, the prevalence and risk factors of gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD) symptoms after LSG remain unclear to date. This study 
aimed to identify risk factors of GERD after LSG. (2) Methods: We conducted a 
retrospective study at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and reviewed 296 
patients who underwent LSG from 2016 to 2019. A total of 143 patients who 
underwent preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy and completed the 12-month 
postoperative follow-up were enrolled. Patients' demographic data, 
comorbidities, and postoperative weight loss results were recorded for analysis. 
The GerdQ questionnaire was used to assess GERD after LSG. (3) Results: There 
were eight surgical complications (5.6%) among the 143 studied patients (median 
age, 36 years; 56 (39.2%) men; median body weight 105.5 kg; median body mass 
index [BMI], 38.5 kg/m2). Twenty-three patients (16.1%) developed de novo GERD 
symptoms. GERD was significantly associated with older age (p = 0.022) and lower 
BMI (&lt;35 kg/m2, p = 0.028). In multiple logistic regression analysis, age and 
BMI were significantly associated with GERD. (4) Conclusions: LSG is a safe and 
effective weight loss surgery. In our study, it led to 16.1% of de novo GERD 
symptoms, which were significantly related to older age and lower BMI (&lt;35 
kg/m2)."
386,"The predictive factors of long-term clinical benefits in patients with hepatitis 
C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis after Direct Antiviral Agents (DAA) 
treatment are still undefined. The aim of this study was to identify any 
predictors of liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and/or death in 
patients with compensated liver cirrhosis who achieved the sustained virological 
response (SVR). To this purpose, 324 consecutive cirrhotic patients who started 
DAA treatment from 1 April 2015 to 31 December 2016 were retrospectively 
analyzed. All patients were followed up for a median time of 63 months (range 
19-77) through clinical/biochemical/instrumental examinations performed at 
baseline and after stopping the DAA treatment. At the end of the evaluation, 230 
(71%) individuals showed stable clinical liver disease over time, 43 (13.3%) 
developed HCC, and 24 (7.4%) developed hepatic decompensation without HCC. 
Overall, 49 (15,1%) patients died. Multivariate regression analysis showed that 
hepatic decompensation was significantly associated with at baseline older age, 
higher liver stiffness, higher spleen longitudinal size values and 
hypergammaglobulinemia (p = 0.003, p = 0.005, p = 0.001, p = 0.029, 
respectively). HCC development was significantly associated with 
hypergammaglobulinemia (p &lt; 0.001). Death was associated with older age and 
hypergammaglobulinemia (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). Finally, 
survival analysis confirmed that patients with gamma globulin levels ≥ 1.8 gr/dl 
had a significantly higher risk of death compared to those with gamma globulin 
levels &lt; 1.8 gr/dl (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, hypergammaglobulinemia 
before starting DAA therapy represents a strong predictor of hepatic 
decompensation, HCC and death in cirrhotic patients even after HCV clearance."

correlate them with radiological aspects. Furthermore, there is a special focus 
on degenerative disc disease terminology, and, finally, some considerations 
regarding disc morphology and its specific function, as well as the way in which 
these aspects change in degenerative disease. Radiologists, clinicians and spine

388,"AIM: To investigate the factors affecting hemodialysis patients' self-management 
ability at a dialysis center in Taiwan.
BACKGROUND: Taiwan has the highest incidence and prevalence of end-stage kidney 
disease (ESKD) in the world. Over 90% of patients with ESKD receiving 
hemodialysis (HD) and self-management behaviors are critical among these 
patients. Failure to adhere to self-managed care increases the cost of medical 
care and the risk of morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 150 HD patients were observed 
for their self-management behaviors and the factors influencing these behaviors 
including education level, comorbid conditions, biochemical analysis, 
depression, and social support, etc., were analyzed.
RESULTS: Self-management behaviors in HD patients were significantly impaired in 
the presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and 
depression. The major predictor of patients' self-management was depression, 
explaining 14.8% of the total variance. Further addition of social support, 
hypertension, and diabetes mellitus into the regression model increased the 
total explained variance to 28.6%. Of the various domains of self-management, 
the partnership domain received the highest score, whereas emotional processing 
received the lowest score.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found the important factors influencing self-management 
behaviors; through this acknowledgement and early correction of these factors, 
we hope to improve HD patients' individual life quality and further decrease 
their morbidity and mortality."

390,"Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with global clinical and socioeconomic burden 
worldwide owing to its poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence has implicated the 
possible contribution of gut microbiota-derived metabolites, short-chain fatty 
acids (SCFAs), on the pathology of a variety of diseases. The changes of SCFA 
concentration were reported to be observed in various cardiovascular diseases 
including HF in experimental animals and humans. HF causes hypoperfusion and/or 
congestion in the gut, which may lead to lowered production of SCFAs, possibly 
through the pathological changes of the gut microenvironment including 
microbiota composition. Recent studies suggest that SCFAs may play a significant 
role in the pathology of HF, possibly through an agonistic effect on 
G-protein-coupled receptors, histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibition, 
restoration of mitochondrial function, amelioration of cardiac inflammatory 
response, its utilization as an energy source, and remote effect attributable to 
a protective effect on the other organs. Collectively, in the pathology of HF, 
SCFAs might play a significant role as a key mediator in the gut-heart axis. 
However, these possible mechanisms have not been entirely clarified and need 
further investigation."
391,"One of the next frontiers in medical research, particularly in orthopaedic 
surgery, is personalized treatment outcome prediction. In personalized medicine, 
treatment choices are adjusted for the patient based on the individual's and 
their disease's distinct features. A high-value and patient-centered health care 
system requires evaluating results that integrate the patient's viewpoint. 
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are widely used to shed light on 
patients' perceptions of their health status after an intervention by using 
validated questionnaires. The aim of this study is to examine whether 
meteorological or light (night vs. day) conditions affect PROM scores and hence 
indirectly affect health-related outcomes. We collected scores for PROMs from 
questionnaires completed by patients (N = 2326) who had undergone hip and knee 
interventions between June 2017 and May 2020 at the IRCCS Orthopaedic Institute 
Galeazzi (IOG), Milan, Italy. Nearest neighbour propensity score (PS) matching 
was applied to ensure the similarity of the groups tested under the different 
weather-related conditions. The exposure PS was derived through logistic 
regression. The data were analysed using statistical tests (Student's t-test and 
Mann-Whitney U test). According to Cohen's effect size, weather conditions may 
affect the scores for PROMs and, indirectly, health-related outcomes via 
influencing the relative humidity and weather-related conditions. The findings 
suggest avoiding PROMs' collection in certain conditions if the odds of 
outcome-based underperformance are to be minimized. This would ensure a balance 
between costs for PROMs' collection and data availability."
392,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment 
for many patients suffering from hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, inborn 
errors of metabolism or genetic disorders. Despite decades of successful HSCT, 
clinical outcomes are still far from satisfactory due to treatment-related 
complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cardiovascular 
complications (CVC). CVC may affect patients in the acute period post-HSCT; 
however, the occurrence is far higher among long-term survivors. Induction 
treatment using cardiotoxic treatments, e.g., anthracyclines and radiotherapy, 
conditioning regimens containing cyclophosphamide, and post-HSCT comorbidities, 
including GvHD, are factors contributing to CVC. Cardiac function evaluation 
prior to and post-transplantation is an important strategy for choosing the 
proper conditioning regimen, HSCT protocol and post-HSCT supportive care. 
Cardiac systolic function evaluation by echocardiography, in addition to serum 
cardiac biomarkers, such as troponins and brain natriuretic peptides, is 
recommended as a routine follow-up for HSCT patients. Angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II-receptor blockers, and beta-blockers, which 
are mostly used for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, might 
be used as treatments for HSCT-related CVC. In summary, the present review 
reveals the urgent need for further investigations concerning HSCT-related CVC 
both at the preclinical and clinical levels due to the lack of knowledge about 
CVC and its underlying mechanisms."
393,"This study aimed to determine the impact of modifications in emergency 
department (ED) practices caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic on the clinical outcomes and management of patients with septic shock. 
We performed a retrospective study. Patients with septic shock who presented to 
the ED between 1 January 2018 and 19 January 2020 were allocated to the 
pre-COVID-19 group, whereas those who presented between 20 January 2020 and 31 
December 2020 were assigned to the post-COVID-19 group. We used propensity score 
matching to compare the sepsis-related interventions and clinical outcomes. The 
primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Of the 3697 patients 
included, 2254 were classified as pre-COVID-19 and 1143 as post-COVID-19. A 
total of 1140 propensity score-matched pairings were created. Overall, the 
in-hospital mortality rate was 25.5%, with no statistical difference between the 
pre- and post-COVID-19 groups (p = 0.92). In a matched cohort, the post-COVID-19 
group had delayed lactate measurement, blood culture test, and infection source 
control (all p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in time to 
antibiotics (p = 0.19) or vasopressor administration (p = 0.09) between the 
groups. Although sepsis-related interventions were delayed during the COVID-19 
pandemic, there was no significant difference in the in-hospital mortality 
between the pre- and post-COVID-19 groups."
394,"PURPOSE: This study examined the association of microalbuminuria (MAU), as 
determined by albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), with hypertension (HTN) among 
Turkish immigrants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) living in deprived neighborhoods 
of The Hague, Netherlands.
METHODS: A total of 110 participants, physician-diagnosed with T2D, aged ≥ 30 
years were recruited from multiple sources from The Hague, Netherlands in a 
cross-sectional design. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) were measured using automated office blood pressure equipment. 
Urine albumin was measured by immunoturbidimetric assay. Urine creatinine was 
determined using the Jaffe method. MAU was defined as ACR ≥ 3.5 mg/mmol for 
females and/or ACR ≥ 2.5 mg/mmol for males.
RESULTS: MAU was present in 21% of Turkish immigrants with T2D. Adjusted 
logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of having MAU were 6.6 
times higher in hypertensive than those that were normotensive (p = 0.007; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.19, 36.4).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HTN and MAU may be assessed as a 
standard of care for T2D management for this population. Prospective studies of 
diabetes outcomes are recommended to further verify these findings."
395,"Cytokine patterns and immune activation in patients with Coronavirus 2019 
(COVID-19) seem to resemble the case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis and 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Biological drugs, such as anti-tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNFα) and interleukin (IL) inhibitors, appear to be protective against 
adverse outcomes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2). However, these treatments are associated with an increased risk of 
secondary infections. The aim of the study was to examine the association 
between the use of immunomodulatory drugs and the risk of SARS-CoV-2-associated 
positivity, hospitalization and death compared to other commonly prescribed 
treatment regimens among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.
METHODS: All patients with RA, Psoriasis and IBD were included in this 
observational analysis and treated with anti-TNFα, IL-inhibitors, Methotrexate 
(MTX) and Sulfasalazine drugs during the year 2020-2021. The population 
consisted of 932 patients and demographic, clinical and pharmacological data 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: Although no significant differences were observed between patients 
treated with biological and synthetic drugs in terms of hospitalization and 
death, the multivariate logistic model showed that the type of drug influences 
the possibility of COVID-19 positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis support the use of biological drugs 
and justify further research investigating the association of these biological 
therapies with COVID-19 outcomes."
396,"Nocardia seriolae is a major causative agent of fish nocardiosis that results in 
serious economic losses in the aquaculture industry. However, the virulence 
factors and pathogenic mechanisms of the bacterium are poorly understood. Here, 
a new N. seriolae strain AHLQ20-01 was isolated from the diseased Micropterus 
salmoides and identified by phenotypic examination combined with 16S rRNA 
sequencing. Subsequently, the potential virulence factors of the strain were 
analysed at genome level by whole-genome sequencing. The results showed that the 
whole-genome sequence derived from N. seriolae AHLQ20-01 circular chromosome 
contains 8,129,380 bp DNA with G + C content of 68.14%, and encompasses 7650 
protein-coding genes, 114 pseudo-genes, 3 rRNAs, 66 tRNAs and 36 non-coding 
RNAs. More importantly, a total of 139 genes, which mainly involved in adhesion, 
invasion, resistance to oxidative and nitrosative stress, phagosome arresting, 
iron acquisition system, toxin production and bacterial secretion systems, were 
identified as core virulence-associated genes. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of 
N. seriolae AHLQ20-01 to M. salmoides was further investigated through 
experimental infection. It was found that the LD50 value of the strain to M. 
salmoides was 9.3 × 106  colony forming unit/fish. Histopathological examination 
demonstrated typical granuloma with varying sizes in the liver, head kidney, 
spleen and heart of the experimentally infected fish. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase dUTP nick end labelling assay and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
staining showed that there were distinctly more apoptotic cells in all the 
tested tissues in the infection group, but not in the control group. Together, 
these findings provide the foundation to further explore the pathogenic 
mechanism of N. seriolae, which might contribute to the prevention and treatment 
of fish nocardiosis."
397,"BACKGROUND: Uterine canceris one of the most common pelvic tumors in females. 
Advanced stage uterine cancer only represents 15% of newly diagnosed cases; 
however, they are related with poor prognosis. Our aim was to analyze the 
benefits of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
in peritoneal carcinomatosis due to uterine cancer.
METHODS: At the Istanbul Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, Surgical 
Oncology Clinic, morbidity, overall survival and survival without progression 
were analyzed over the 5-year follow up. Twenty-two cases who had undergone 
cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy due to 
uterine-peritoneal carcinomatosis were included in this study. Cases were 
followed up in terms of postoperative morbidity-mortality, disease-free survival 
and overall survival. The cut off value for the peritoneal carcinomatosis index 
score was set at 15. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and 
doxorubicin was applied to all patients for 60 min after the suturation of the 
abdomen.
RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 64.6 (43-72). Average PCI score was 12.8 
(3-15). CC score was 0 in 16 (72.7%) cases, 1 in 3 cases and 2 in 3 cases. Of 
these patients, 12 of them were previously operated upon. Median stay at the 
hospital was 13.1 days. No major complications due to chemotherapy were 
reported. A Clavien-Dindo Grade 3 complication was observed in seven (31.8%) 
patients. Mortality was not observed in patients during their stay at the 
hospital. The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 36.8 
(36%) months and 45.3 (57%) months, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We think that due to longer disease-free survival and overall 
survival, cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
should be preferred in peritoneal carcinomatosis due to uterine cancer patients 
having low peritoneal carcinomatosis index scores and manageable complication 
rates. However, prospective randomizedtrials with a high number of cases are 
needed for this subject."
398,"BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a group of common 
musculoskeletal dysfunctions that affect the temporomandibular joint or 
masticatory muscles and related structures or are expressed as a clinical 
combination of these two factors. The etiology of TMD is multifactorial and 
features related to anxiety, depression and mental disorders can contribute to 
the predisposition, onset and progression of TMD. The ability to adapt and 
develop coping attitudes was reduced in patients presenting with chronic pain, 
while suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide 
completion) was increased. The objective of this review was therefore to 
investigate suicidal behavior in relation to TMD.
METHODS: The review was performed according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Six 
databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Ovid, and Google Scholar) were 
consulted through the use of keywords related to the review topic. The study is 
registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022320828).
RESULTS: The preliminary systematic search of the literature yielded 267 
records. Excluding duplicates, 15 were considered potentially relevant and kept 
for title and abstract analysis. Only six articles were considered admissible 
reporting a single exposure factor, TMD and a single outcome, suicidal behavior, 
although these were evaluated through different assessment tools. We found a low 
association of TMD with suicidal behavior in observational studies, with 
estimates partly provided [prevalence ratio (PR) from 1.26 to 1.35, 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) from 1.15 to 1.19 (lower) and from 1.37 to 1.54 
(higher); and odds ratios (OR) from 1.54 to 2.56, 95% CI from 1.014 to 1.157 
(lower) and 2.051 to 6.484 (higher)], a relevant sample size (n = 44,645), but a 
few studies included (n = 6).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the included studies showed that the prevalence data 
of suicidal behavior were more present in young adults with TMD, with a 
controversial association with gender. Suicidal behavior was also correlated and 
aggravated by the intensity of pain."
399,"BACKGROUND: Brain abscess (BA) is a rare, but severe infection and experimental 
BA animal models may prove crucial for advances in treatment. This review 
describes the development of experimental BA models and the clinical advances 
obtained from these, in a historical perspective.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experimental BA studies from inception until June 15, 
2022, were included by searching the PubMed and Embase databases. Inclusion 
required the use of an experimental BA animal model. Non-bacterial BA models, 
in vitro studies, veterinarian case-reports, and articles written in non-English 
language were excluded. Bias was not systematically assessed, and the review was 
not registered at the PROSPERO.
RESULTS: 79 studies were included. The majority of animal BA models have been 
based on small rodents using Staphylococcus aureus. The models have delineated 
the natural development of BA and provided detailed descriptions of the 
histopathological characteristics consisting of a necrotic centre surrounded by 
layers of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts encapsulated by a dense collagenous 
layer. Radiological studies of animal BA have been shown to correlate with the 
corresponding stages of human BA in both computed tomography and magnetic 
resonance imaging and may guide diagnosis as well as the timing of neurosurgical 
intervention. Moreover, pharmacokinetic studies of the intracavitary penetration 
of various antimicrobials have helped inform medical treatment of BA. Other 
studies have examined the diverse effects of corticosteroids including decreased 
cerebral oedema, intracranial pressure, and intracavitary drug concentration, 
whereas concerns on decreased or weakened capsule formation could not be 
confirmed. Finally, studies on the immunological response to BA have highlighted 
potential future immunomodulatory targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Animal models have been vital for improvements in the management of 
BA. Experimental BA models resembling human disease including polymicrobial 
infection by oral cavity flora in large animals are needed."
400,"INTRODUCTION: The most clinically useful concept in asthma is based on the 
intensity of treatment required to achieve good asthma control. Biomarkers to 
guide therapy are needed.
AIMS: To investigate the role of circulating levels of soluble urokinase 
plasminogen activator receptor suPAR as a marker for asthma severity.
METHODS: We recruited patients evaluated at the Asthma Clinic, University of 
Thessaly, Greece. Asthma severity and control were defined according to the GINA 
strategy and Asthma Contro Test (ACT). Anthropometrics, spirometry, fractional 
exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), suPAR, blood cell count, c-reactive protein (CRP), 
and analyses of kidney and liver function were obtained. Patients with a history 
of inflammatory, infectious, or malignant disease or other lung disease, more 
than 5 pack years of smoking history, or corticosteroid therapy were excluded.
RESULTS: We evaluated 74 asthma patients (69% female, mean age 57 ± 17 years, 
mean body mass index (BMI) 29 ± 6 kg/m2). In total, 24%, 13%, 6%, 5%, 29% and 
23% of the participants had mild well-controlled, mild uncontrolled, moderate 
well-controlled, moderate uncontrolled, severe well-controlled, and severe 
uncontrolled asthma, respectively. Overall, 67% had T2-high asthma, 26% received 
biologics (15% and 85% received omalizumab and mepolizumab, respectively), and 
34% had persistent airway obstruction. suPAR levels were significantly lower in 
asthmatics with moderate uncontrolled asthma than in patients with severe 
uncontrolled asthma without (2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 3.3 ± 0.7 ng/mL, p = 0.023) or with 
biologics (2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 3.6 ± 0.8 ng/mL, p = 0.029). No correlations were found 
between suPAR levels and age, BMI, T2 biomarkers, CRP, or spirometric 
parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: suPAR levels were higher in asthmatics with severe disease than in 
those with moderate uncontrolled asthma."
401,"BACKGROUND: A high pre-treatment De Ritis ratio, the aspartate 
transaminase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, has been suggested to be of 
prognostic value for mortality in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Our 
purpose was to evaluate if a high ratio was associated with mortality and 
downstaging.
METHODS: A total of 347 Swedish patients with clinically staged T2-T4aN0M0, with 
administered neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or eligible for NAC and undergoing 
radical cystectomy (RC) 2009-2021, were retrospectively evaluated with a low 
ratio &lt; 1.3 vs. high ratio &gt; 1.3, by Log Rank test, Cox regression and 
Mann-Whitney U-test (MWU), SPSS 27.
RESULTS: Patients with a high ratio had a decrease of up to 3 years in 
disease-free survival (DFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival 
(OS) (p = 0.009, p = 0.004 and p = 0.009) and 5 years in CSS and OS (p = 0.019 
and p = 0.046). A high ratio was associated with increased risk of mortality, 
highest in DFS (HR, 1.909; 95% CI, 1.265-2.880; p = 0.002). No significant 
relationship between downstaging and a high ratio existed (p = 0.564 MWU).
CONCLUSION: A high pre-treatment De Ritis ratio is on a population level, 
associated with increased mortality post-RC in endpoints DFS, CSS and OS. 
Associations decrease over time and require further investigations to determine 
how strong the associations are as meaningful prognostic markers for long-term 
mortality in MIBC. The ratio is not suitable for downstaging-prediction."
402,"Macrophages, critical components of bone marrow microenvironment, are reported 
to be remodeled into leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs) in leukemic 
microenvironment where they contribute to leukemia development, characterized as 
M2 macrophages with pro-tumor effects. However, how leukemic microenvironment 
transforms macrophages into LAMs remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the clinical 
relevance of LAMs and profiled their RNA-Seq from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
patients with complete remission (CR) after induction treatment and refractory 
AML patients. Our results showed that the proportion and number of LAMs in 
refractory AML patients was higher than that in CR patients and LAM was a poor 
prognostic factor of AML patients. Furthermore, let-7b was a potentially 
aberrant gene in LAMs contributed to M2-subtype characteristics. Knockdown of 
let-7b in LAMs could inhibit the development of AML by repolarizing LAMs towards 
M1-subtype characteristics through the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 
and NF-κB pathway. Our study provides insight for future LAM-based immunotherapy 
strategies for AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
403,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection is one of the most common types of 
healthcare-associated infections. There is currently limited data regarding the 
incidence and characteristics of healthcare-associated urinary tract infections 
(HA-UTIs) in children. This study was conducted to determine the incidence of 
HA-UTIs and their characteristics and associated risk factors.
METHODS: A case-control study was performed from 2016 to 2020 on children under 
15 years old who were diagnosed with HA-UTI. Patients who had HA-UTI were 
compared to non-UTI patients. The incidence rate of HA-UTIs was calculated and 
reported as events per 1000 patient days. Potential associated risk factors were 
analyzed using multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Eighty cases and 80 controls were included in the study. The incidence 
of HA-UTIs was 0.32 events per 1,000 patient days. The median time to UTI was 
18 days. The most common causative organism was Escherichia coli (43.2%) and the 
rates of third-generation cephalosporin resistance and carbapenem resistance 
were 75.6% and 4.9%, respectively. Longer admission than 7 days (OR = 21.61, 95% 
CI 6.30-74.11; p < 0.001), neurogenic bladder (OR = 26.24, 95% CI 3.77-182.87; p 
< 0.001), mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.60, 95% CI 1.23-10.54; p = 0.019), and 
immunosuppressant (OR = 2.59; 95% CI 1.01-6.60; p = 0.047) were the risk factors 
significantly associated with HA-UTIs.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HA-UTIs was low in this single-center experience. 
Identifying patients with the risk factor is imperative to preventing the 
development of HA-UTIs."
404,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathological vascular remodeling is 
important for treating cardiovascular diseases and complications. Recent studies 
have highlighted a role of deubiquitinases in vascular pathophysiology. Here, we 
investigate the role of a deubiquitinase, OTUD1, in angiotensin II (Ang 
II)-induced vascular remodeling. We detect upregulated OTUD1 in the vascular 
endothelium of Ang II-challenged mice and show that OTUD1 deletion attenuates 
vascular remodeling, collagen deposition, and EndMT. Conversely, OTUD1 
overexpression aggravates these pathological changes both in vivo and in vitro. 
Mechanistically, SMAD3 is identified as a substrate of OTUD1 using 
co-immunoprecipitation followed by LC-MS/MS. We find that OTUD1 stabilizes SMAD3 
and facilitates SMAD3/SMAD4 complex formation and subsequent nuclear 
translocation through both K48- and K63-linked deubiquitination. OTUD1-mediated 
SMAD3 activation regulates transcription of genes involved in vascular EndMT and 
remodeling in HUVECs. Finally, SMAD3 inhibition reverses OTUD1-promoted vascular 
remodeling. Our findings demonstrate that endothelial OTUD1 promotes Ang 
II-induced vascular remodeling by deubiquitinating SMAD3. We identify SMAD3 as a 
target of OTUD1 and propose OTUD1 as a potential therapeutic target for diseases 
related to vascular remodeling."
405,"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) integrates both immunological and 
non-immunological inputs to control cell survival and death. Small GTPases are 
versatile functional switches that lie on the very upstream in signal 
transduction pathways, of which duration of activation is very transient. The 
large number of homologous proteins and the requirement for site-directed 
mutagenesis have hindered attempts to investigate the link between small GTPases 
and IRF3. Here, we constructed a constitutively active mutant expression library 
for small GTPase expression using Gibson assembly cloning. Small-scale screening 
identified multiple GTPases capable of promoting IRF3 phosphorylation. 
Intriguingly, 27 of 152 GTPases, including ARF1, RHEB, RHEBL1, and RAN, were 
found to increase IRF3 phosphorylation. Unbiased screening enabled us to 
investigate the sequence-activity relationship between the GTPases and IRF3. We 
found that the regulation of IRF3 by small GTPases was dependent on TBK1. Our 
work reveals the significant contribution of GTPases in IRF3 signaling and the 
potential role of IRF3 in GTPase function, providing a novel therapeutic 
approach against diseases with GTPase overexpression or active mutations, such 
as cancer."
406,"Autophagy is a process of eliminating damaged or unnecessary proteins and 
organelles, thereby maintaining intracellular homeostasis. Deregulation of 
autophagy is associated with several diseases including cancer. Contradictory 
dual roles of autophagy have been well established in cancer. Cytoprotective 
mechanism of autophagy has been extensively investigated for overcoming 
resistance to cancer therapies including radiotherapy, targeted therapy, 
immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Selective autophagy inhibitors that directly 
target autophagic process have been developed for cancer treatment. Efficacies 
of autophagy inhibitors have been tested in various pre-clinical cancer animal 
models. Combination therapies of autophagy inhibitors with chemotherapeutics are 
being evaluated in clinal trials. In this review, we will focus on genetical and 
pharmacological perturbations of autophagy-related proteins in different steps 
of autophagic process and their therapeutic benefits. We will also summarize 
combination therapies of autophagy inhibitors with chemotherapies and their 
outcomes in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Understanding of current 
knowledge of development, progress, and application of cytoprotective autophagy 
inhibitors in combination therapies will open new possibilities for overcoming 
drug resistance and improving clinical outcomes."
407,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is a conventional chemotherapeutic drug for glioma, however, 
its clinical application and efficacy is severely restricted by its drug 
resistance properties. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA 
repair enzyme, which can repair the DNA damage caused by TMZ. A large number of 
clinical data show that reducing the expression of MGMT can enhance the 
chemotherapeutic efficacy of TMZ. Therefore, in order to improve the resistance 
of glioma to TMZ, an angiopep-2 (A2) modified nanoprodrug of polytemozolomide 
(P(TMZ)n) that combines with MGMT siRNA (siMGMT) targeting MGMT was developed 
(A2/T/D/siMGMT). It not only increased the amount of TMZ within tumor lesion 
site, but also reduced MGMT expression in glioma. The in vitro experiments 
indicated that the A2/T/D/siMGMT effectively enhanced the cellular uptake of TMZ 
and siMGMT, and resulted in a significant cell apoptosis and cytotoxicity in the 
glioma cells. The in vivo experiments showed that glioma growth was inhibited 
and the survival time of animals were prolonged remarkably after A2/T/D/siMGMT 
was injected via tail vein. The results showed that the therapeutic effect of 
A2/T/D/siMGMT in the treatment of glioma was significantly improved."
408,"PURPOSE: This review investigated medical students' satisfaction level with 
e-learning during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its 
related factors.
METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was performed of international 
literature databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Persian 
databases such as Iranmedex and Scientific Information Database using keywords 
extracted from Medical Subject Headings such as ""Distance learning,"" ""Distance 
education,"" ""Online learning,"" ""Online education,"" and ""COVID-19"" from the 
earliest date to July 10, 2022. The quality of the studies included in this 
review was evaluated using the appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies (AXIS 
tool).
RESULTS: A total of 15,473 medical science students were enrolled in 24 studies. 
The level of satisfaction with e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic among 
medical science students was 51.8%. Factors such as age, gender, clinical year, 
experience with e-learning before COVID-19, level of study, adaptation content 
of course materials, interactivity, understanding of the content, active 
participation of the instructor in the discussion, multimedia use in teaching 
sessions, adequate time dedicated to the e-learning, stress perception, and 
convenience had significant relationships with the satisfaction of medical 
students with e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, due to the inevitability of online education and 
e-learning, it is suggested that educational managers and policymakers choose 
the best online education method for medical students by examining various 
studies in this field to increase their satisfaction with e-learning."
409,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a chronic, mucocutaneous, autoimmune bullous disease. 
Double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) may be effective when PV fails to be 
controlled by conventional corticosteroid treatment. The patient was a 
64-year-old man with erythema, blisters, and erosions on his head, face, mouth, 
trunk, limbs, and scrotum for over a month. He was diagnosed with severe PV, and 
the original rash area continued to expand after treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and intravenous immunoglobulin, with 
massive exudate and ≥5 new blisters and macules still occurring daily. 
Subsequently, the patient completed three sessions of DFPP. After the first 
DFPP, the original erosion surface exudate was significantly reduced and 
gradually healed. After the second DFPP, the erosion area and exudate increased 
compared with the previous one. After the third DFPP, the rash did not improve 
further and had a tendency to continue to progress. During the entire three 
sessions of DFPP, the patient had new blisters and bullae on his limbs every 
day. The Nikolsky's sign of the limbs turned negative at the initial stage, and 
then the trunk and limbs Nikolsky's sign became positive again. The titer of 
autoantibodies did not decrease significantly after the plasmapheresis. The 
patient eventually died of secondary lung infection and septic shock. The 
efficacy of DFPP in this patient with refractory severe PV was poor."
410,"BACKGROUND: Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) and Glycogen storage 
diseases (GSDs) are inborn metabolic disorders caused by defects in some 
metabolic pathways. These disorders are a heterogeneous group of diseases caused 
by impaired O- as well as N-glycosylation pathways. CDG patients show a broad 
spectrum of clinical presentations; many GSD types (PGM1-CDG) have muscle 
involvement and hypoglycemia.
METHODS: We applied WES for all seven patients presenting GSD and CDG symptoms. 
Then we analyzed the data using various tools to predict pathogenic variants in 
genes related to the patients' diseases.
RESULTS: In the present study, we identified pathogenic variants in Iranian 
patients suffering from GSD and CDG, which can be helpful for patient 
management, and family counseling. We detected seven pathogenic variants using 
whole exome sequencing (WES) in known AGL (c.1998A>G, c.3635T>C, c.3682C>T), 
PGM1 (c.779G>A), DPM1 (c.742T>C), RFT1 (c.127A>G), and GAA (c.1314C>A) genes.
CONCLUSION: The suspected clinical diagnosis of CDG and GSD patients was 
confirmed by identifying missense and or nonsense mutations in PGM1, DPM1, RFT1, 
GAA, and AGL genes by WES of all 7 cases. This study helps us understand the 
scenario of the disorder causes and consider the variants for quick disease 
diagnosis."
411,"Climate change has important implications on human health, affecting almost 
every system in the body. Multiple studies have raised the possibility of 
climate change impacting eye health. In this review, we aimed to summarize 
current literature on the impact of air pollution and climate change on eye 
health. We performed a search in four different databases, including Medline, 
Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Sciences databases. The search strategy combined 
terms regarding eye health and environmental/climate changes. The outcome of 
interest included all eye conditions. The search yielded 2,051 unique articles. 
After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 61 articles were included in 
this systematic review with data covering 2,620,030 participants. Most studies 
originated from China, India, South Korea, and USA. Climate change adversely 
affected different eye conditions, with ocular surface diseases (e.g., 
conjunctivitis and dry eye) being most affected. Moreover, higher particulate 
matter (PM) was the most widely assessed pollutant and was adversely associated 
with the majority of eye conditions, increasing the burden on patients and 
healthcare providers. We found a low frequency of publications related to the 
delivery of eye care and its impact on climate change in countries with high air 
pollution and climate change burden."
412,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving 
cognitive dysfunction like short-term memory and behavioral changes as the 
disease progresses due to other unaltered physiological factors. The solution 
for this problem is Multi-targeted Drugs (MTDs), which can affect multiple 
determinants to realize the multifunctional effects. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptor antagonist memantine are FDA-approved drugs used to treat AD 
symptomatically. The key objective of this review is to understand multitargeted 
bioactive natural molecules that could be considered as leads for further 
development as effective drugs for treating AD, along with understanding its 
pharmacology and structure-activity relationship (SAR). Understanding the 
molecular mechanism of the AD pathophysiology, the role of existing drugs, 
treatment of AD via amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque, and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) 
inhibition by natural bioactive molecules were also discussed in the review. The 
current quest and recent advancements with natural bioactive compounds like 
physostigmine, resveratrol, curcumin, and catechins, along with the study of in 
silico SAR, were reported in the present study. This review summarises the 
structural properties required for bioactive natural molecules to show 
anti-Alzheimer's activity by emphasizing on SAR of several bioactive natural 
molecules targeting various AD pathologies, their key molecular interactions 
that are critical for target specificity, their role as multitargeted ligands, 
used with adjunctive therapy for AD followed by related US patents granted 
recently. This article highlights the significance of the structural features of 
natural bioactive molecules in the treatment of AD and establishes a connection 
between them.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
413,"Our present knowledge about the efficacy of tea consumption in improving 
age-related cognitive disorders is incomplete since previous epidemiological 
studies provide inconsistent evidence. This unified systematic review and 
meta-analysis based on updated epidemiological cohort studies and randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) evidence aimed to overcome the limitations of previous 
reviews by examining the efficacy of distinct types of tea consumption. PubMed, 
Embase, and MEDLINE were searched up to May 20, 2022, and 23 cohorts and 12 
cross-sectional studies were included. Random-effects meta-analyses were 
conducted to obtain pooled RRs or mean differences with 95% CIs. The pooled RRs 
of the highest versus lowest tea consumption categories were 0.81 (95% CIs: 
0.75-0.88) and 0.69 (95% CIs: 0.61-0.77), respectively. The pooled mean 
difference of four included RCTs revealed a beneficial effect of tea on 
cognitive dysfunction (MMSE ES: 1.03; 95% CI, 0.14-1.92). Subgroup analyses 
further demonstrated that green and black tea intake was associated with a lower 
risk of cognitive disorders in eastern countries, especially in women. The 
evidence quality was generally low to moderate. The present review provides 
insight into whether habitual tea consumption can be an effective approach 
against age-related neurodegenerative cognitive disorders and summarizes 
potential mechanisms based on currently published literature."
414,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between spiritual well-being and 
spiritual intelligence with mental health in students.
METHODS: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted among 277 students (110 
boys and 167 girls) through convenience sampling. The data collection 
instruments in this study included a spiritual well-being questionnaire, King's 
spiritual intelligence questionnaire, and Goldberg's general health 
questionnaire. After being entered into SPSS statistical software, the data were 
analyzed using descriptive and analytical.
RESULTS: The results of multivariate regression analysis using the step-by-step 
method showed that spiritual well-being predicts 14% of the variance of 
students' mental health. Also, on the scale of spiritual well-being, the two 
dimensions of communication with oneself and communication with others were 
predictors for the social functioning dimension of mental health. Also, among 
the subscales of spiritual well-being, the subscale of connection with God had 
an inverse and significant relationship with anxiety and physical health 
(p<0.05), and an inverse and significant relationship were observed between the 
subscale of connection with self with anxiety and depression (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study confirm that spiritual well-being 
and spiritual intelligence affect mental health and its dimensions."
415,"There is an overlap between the International Classification of Diseases for 
Mortality and Morbidity Statistics- 11th Revision (ICD-11) diagnoses of complex 
post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) and personality disorder. When the latter 
is comorbid with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this may allow for a 
false positive CPTSD diagnosis. This fact has both clinical implications and 
throws into relief theoretical questions about the ontology of trauma and 
personality disorder-related pathology. These questions are presented as a call 
for further research."
416,"Nematode chitinases are critical components of the nematode life cycle, and 
CeCht1 is a potential target for developing novel nematicides. Herein, 
lunidonine, a natural quinoline alkaloid, was first discovered to have 
inhibitory activity against CeCht1, which was acquired from a library of over 
16,000 natural products using a structure-based virtual screening methodology. A 
pocket-based lead optimization strategy was employed based on the predicted 
binding mode of lunidonine. Subsequently, a series of 
benzo[d][1,3]dioxole-5-carboxylate derivatives were designed and synthesized, 
and their inhibitory activities against CeCht1 as well as in vitro nematicidal 
activities against Caenorhabditis elegans were assessed. The analysis of 
structure-activity relationship and inhibitory mechanisms provided insights into 
their interactions with the CeCht1 active site, which could facilitate future 
research in improving the potency of the inhibitory activity. Especially, 
compound a12 interacted well with CeCht1 and exhibited excellent in vitro 
nematicidal activity against C. elegans with a LC50 value of 41.54 mg/L, 
suggesting that it could be a promising candidate for a novel chemical 
nematicide targeting CeCht1. The known binding modes and structural features of 
these inhibitors will contribute to the design of stronger CeCht1-based 
nematicides to control nematodes in agriculture."
417,"Noninvasive methods of estimating invasively measured fractional flow reserve 
(FFRinvasive ) are actively being explored, aiming to avoid the use of an 
invasive pressure wire and the administration of hyperemia-inducing drugs. 
Coronary angiography-derived FFR (FFRangio ) has already demonstrated its 
diagnostic performance in the context of stable coronary artery disease. 
However, its applicability in the context of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial 
infarction (NSTEMI) has yet to be established. We sought to determine the 
diagnostic performance of FFRangio exclusively in patients presenting with 
NSTEMI. We performed a prospective, single-center, single-arm, double-blinded 
study comparing FFR calculated by FFRangio to FFRinvasive in NSTEMI patients. 
FFRinvasive was measured in all angiographically intermediate lesions (30%-70% 
stenosis) and was then compared to FFRangio which was calculated at the same 
position, by a blinded operator. The primary endpoints were the sensitivity and 
specificity of FFRangio for predicting FFRinvasive using a cut-off value of 
≤0.80. Among 100 NSTEMI patients who were screened, 46 patients with 60 vessels 
in total underwent FFRinvasive and were included in the study. The mean value of 
FFRinvasive was 0.83 ± 0.3 with 22 (36%) being ≤0.80 while the mean FFRangio was 
0.82 ± 0.1 with 22 (36%) being ≤0.80. FFRangio exhibited a sensitivity of 95.5%, 
a specificity of 97.4%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 96.7%. FFRangio can 
precisely and noninvasively estimate FFRinvasive in acute coronary syndromes and 
may have a role in guiding treatment decisions related to angiographically 
intermediate coronary lesions in this context.
WHAT IS KNOWN: FFRangio has demonstrated its diagnostic performance in 
validation studies, as a noninvasive and cost-effective method in the context of 
stable coronary artery disease but its performance has never been exclusively 
evaluated in NSTEMI patients.
WHAT IS NEW: The present prospective single-center study demonstrates the 
excellent diagnostic performance of FFRangio in detecting functionally 
significant coronary artery stenosis in the setting of NSTEMI, providing more 
confidence in utilizing FFRangio in this population, avoiding the risk of an 
invasive pressure wire and the administration of hyperemia-inducing drugs.
WHAT IS NEXT: Future randomized trials evaluating FFRangio -guided treatment of 
coronary artery disease (stable or ACS) are now needed to definitively establish 
the role of FFRangio in the physiological assessment of coronary lesions."
418,"Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) patients experience severe burning pain 
after light exposure, which results in a markedly reduced quality of life. 
However, there is limited information on the psychosocial aspects of EPP. To 
investigate the clinical features and social aspects of living with EPP, before 
and during afamelanotide treatment in the Netherlands. A single-center 
prospective longitudinal study of adult patients with EPP attending the Erasmus 
MC Rotterdam. Patients completed questionnaires, comprising demographic, 
clinical and social details, including two generic (DS-14 and SF-36) and a 
disease specific (EPP-QoL) QoL questionnaires. 121 adult EPP patients were 
included. The educational level of EPP patients seemed higher compared to the 
Dutch population (36% vs. 30% high-education, 42% vs. 37% middle-education). At 
baseline 5% of the EPP patients were unemployed, none were unemployed during 
afamelanotide treatment. Full- and part-time employment rate increased from 
59.5% to 69.9% on afamelanotide treatment (p > 0.05). EPP-QoL improved from 44% 
to 75% on afamelanotide treatment (p < 0.001). Type-D personality was present in 
27.4% of patients; their social inhibition scores improved significantly on 
afamelanotide treatment (p = 0.019). EPP patients scored low on the social 
functioning domain (SF-36) compared to the Dutch population (74.4 ± 27.3 vs. 
84.0 ± 22.4; respectively), and improved during afamelanotide treatment 
(84.3 ± 20.9, p = 0.001). EPP has a significant negative impact on social 
aspects, with less employment despite a higher education level. Afamelanotide 
treatment improves quality of life, social functioning and possibly employment 
rate. It is important to recognize the impact of EPP on social life, although, 
more research is needed."
419,"Balloon undilatable lesions are lesions that have been successfully crossed by 
both a guidewire and a balloon but cannot be expanded despite multiple 
high-pressure balloon inflations. Balloon undilatable lesions can be de novo or 
in-stent. We describe a systematic, algorithmic approach to treat both de novo 
and in-stent balloon undilatable lesions using various techniques, such as 
high-pressure balloon inflation, plaque modification balloons, intravascular 
lithotripsy, very high-pressure balloon inflation, coronary atherectomy, laser 
coronary angioplasty, and extraplaque lesion crossing. Knowledge of the various 
techniques can increase the efficiency, success and safety of the procedure."
420,"The innate immune system protects the host from external pathogens and internal 
damage in various ways. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway, comprised of cyclic 
GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING), and downstream 
signaling adaptors, plays an essential role in protective immune defense against 
microbial DNA and internal damaged-associated DNA and is responsible for various 
immune-related diseases. After binding with DNA, cytosolic cGAS undergoes 
conformational change and DNA-linked liquid-liquid phase separation to produce 
2'3'-cGAMP for the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized STING. 
However, further studies revealed that cGAS is predominantly expressed in the 
nucleus and strictly tethered to chromatin to prevent binding with nuclear DNA, 
and functions differently from cytosolic-localized cGAS. Detailed delineation of 
this pathway, including its structure, signaling, and regulatory mechanisms, is 
of great significance to fully understand the diversity of cGAS-STING activation 
and signaling and will be of benefit for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
and cancer. Here, we review recent progress on the above-mentioned perspectives 
of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and discuss new avenues for further study."
421,"BACKGROUND: The world has seen nearly 2 years of a pandemic caused by the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus, notoriously known as COVID-19. Several vaccines have been 
approved under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to combat the disease, one of 
which is Covaxin, an inactivated adjuvant SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that is generally 
well tolerated and has fewer side effects. However, we recently have seen a rare 
case of facial palsy (paralysis) following Covaxin vaccination in an adolescent 
girl.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 16 years old adolescent girl presented with chief 
complaints of left side deviation of mouth with difficulty in closing right eye 
after 29 days of receiving the first dose of Covaxin, which was finally 
diagnosed as a ""Covaxin induced facial palsy"". Her symptoms were alleviated with 
some supportive measures, steroid and antiviral treatment, with full recovery."
422,"The human lifespan is increasing, and mankind is aging. It is estimated that, 
until the year 2050, this population worldwide will reach 22% of the total world 
population. Along with aging, the human immunologic system changes, a process 
called immunosenescence or even inflammaging. The aging immune system increases 
mortality and morbidity in the elderly mainly because it loses its capacity to 
react against internal and external aggressions. There is a decrease in B and T 
lymphocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes lose the CD28 protein expression that is needed 
for co-stimulation, leading to reduced response to viral infections. This could 
be responsible for more deleterious consequences of coronavirus disease 
infection in the elderly. Besides that, the human brain ages, being more 
susceptible to damage and viral infections, such as COVID-19 infection. There 
are several pathways that could explain the susceptibility to the COVID-19 
infection in the elderly brain, one of them is binding to ACE 2 receptors in 
cerebral cells through the spike protein. It has been reported that glial cells 
and neurons, in addition to endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells in the 
brain, express the ACE 2 receptor, which would justify the neurological symptoms 
and consequences of the disease. This infection can have several clinical 
manifestations such as hemorrhagic stroke, delirium and long-term cognitive 
complaints, such as brain fog, polyneuropathies, short time memory complaints 
and insomnia. Although none of the studies could prove that there is a long-term 
neuronal damage, there are clinical sequelae that should be taken into account 
and more studies are necessary to know the consequences of the infection in the 
elderly brain."
423,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex and progressive neurodegenerative disease, 
and the most common cause of dementia usually occurs due to old age. Production 
and accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) represent the major pathological 
event of the disease. The formation of amyloid-β results due to proteolytic 
cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site amyloid precursor 
protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) shown as the amyloid hypothesis, a prevalent 
theory for AD pathogenesis. Thus, BACE1 represents a novel target to decrease 
cerebral Aβ concentration and slow down the disease's progression. The 
structure-based drug design approach led to a wide variety of small molecules 
with the mechanism of action centered around inhibition of β-secretase protease 
(BACE1), which are shown to have drug-like properties and reduce brain Aβ 
levels. Based on transition state isosteres, BACE1 inhibitors can largely be 
classified as peptidomimetics and non-peptidomimetics. The subclasses of the two 
categories have been covered with different scaffolds like statin, norstatin, 
carbinamine, hydroxyethylene, hydroxyethylamine, acyl guanidine, 
2-aminopyridine, aminoimidazole, aminohydantoin, aminothiazoline, 
aminooxazoline, aminoquinoline, piperazine-based. Among these small molecules, 
those who fulfilled general requirements for a drug aimed at the central nervous 
system (CNS) and selectivity over other aspartyl proteases reached the final 
pipeline of clinical trials. Here, in this review, we summarize the journey of 
BACE1 inhibitors through different practices of drug design development, 
Structural Activity Relationship (SAR), and other inhibitor candidates that are 
currently in clinical trials as BACE1 inhibitors."
424,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and its incidence 
is linearly associated with age. The development of cancer treatments has 
changed the prognosis of this disease. Despite effective treatments, 
cardiovascular complications in middle-aged and older women have become 
challenging. Physical exercise is a powerful tool to prevent senescence symptoms 
and diseases, besides being an essential component for cardiovascular diseases 
and cancer prevention and treatment. The present narrative review considers the 
vascular dysfunction associated with breast cancer treatment, specifically 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the effects of exercise on vascular toxicity. 
We also explored the mechanisms involved in these responses. The search strategy 
involved three databases (Pubmed, Scielo, and Web of Science) with the following 
descriptors: breast cancer, vascular toxicity, physical exercise, chemotherapy, 
and radiotherapy. The evidence showed that breast cancer patients, especially 
those under chemotherapy and over 50 years old, have a potential risk of 
developing vascular dysfunction, which may persist in the long term. Decreases 
in nitric oxide bioavailability and increases in oxidative stress and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines might mediate the chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy-induced vascular dysfunction. Exercise seems to be a promising 
strategy for managing this risk. However, there is a need for well-constructed 
studies evaluating vascular toxicity in breast cancer, especially in middle-aged 
and elderly patients, to establish whether exercise is beneficial."
425,"BACKGROUND: The HIV viral protein R (Vpr) is a multifunction protein involved in 
the pathophysiology of HIV-1. Recent evidence has suggested that Vpr amino acid 
substitutions influence the pathophysiology of HIV-1 and clinical outcomes in 
people living with HIV (PLWH). Several studies have linked Vpr amino acid 
substitutions to clinical outcomes in PLWH, however, there is no clear consensus 
as to which amino acids or amino acid substitutions are most important in the 
pathophysiology and clinical outcomes in PLWH. We, therefore, conducted a 
systematic review of studies investigating Vpr amino acid substitutions and 
clinical outcomes in PLWH.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched according to 
PRISMA guidelines using a search protocol designed specifically for this study.
RESULTS: A total of twenty-two studies were included for data extraction, 
comprising fourteen cross-sectional and eight longitudinal studies. Results 
indicated that Vpr amino acid substitutions were associated with specific 
clinical outcomes including disease progressions, neurological outcomes, 
treatment status, and other clinical manifestations. Studies consistently showed 
that the Vpr substitution 63T was associated with slower disease progression, 
whereas 77H and 85P were associated with no significant contribution to disease 
progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Vpr-specific amino acid substitutions may be contributors to 
clinical outcomes in PLWH, and future studies should consider investigating the 
Vpr amino acid substitutions highlighted in this review."
426,"BACKGROUND: Onychomatricoma (OM) is a rare nail unit tumor with a characteristic 
presentation of fingerlike projections arising from the nail matrix. Due to the 
lack of transcriptome information, the mechanisms underlying its development are 
largely unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize molecular features involved in the disease 
pathogenesis.
METHODS: Digital spatial profiling (DSP) was conducted in 2 cases of OM and 
normal control nail units. Based on the histological evaluation, we selectively 
profiled 69 regions of interest covering epithelial and stromal compartments of 
each tissue section. Dermoscopic and histopathologic findings were reviewed in 6 
cases. Single-cell RNA sequencing of nail units and DSP were combined to define 
cell type contributions of OM.
RESULTS: We identified 173 genes upregulated in stromal compartments of OM 
compared to onychodermis, specialized nail mesenchyme. Gene ontology analysis of 
the upregulated genes suggested the role of Wnt pathway activation in OM 
pathogenesis. We also found PLA2G2A, a known modulator of Wnt signaling, is 
strongly and specifically expressed in the OM stroma. The potential role of Wnt 
pathway was further supported by strong nuclear localization of β-catenin in OM. 
Compared to the nail matrix epithelium, only a few genes were increased in OM 
epithelium. Deconvolution of nail unit cell types showed that onychofibroblasts 
are the dominant cell-type in OM stroma.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated spatial and single-cell multi-omics concluded that OM is 
a tumor that derives a significant proportion of its origin from 
onychofibroblasts and is associated with upregulation of Wnt signals, which play 
a key role in the disease pathogenesis."
427,"Single-cell sequencing has scientific impacts on better understanding the 
immunity. There is a rapid development in single cell-based databases and 
analytic tools to provide the potential of clinical and translational discovery. 
The understanding of single-cell based immunity needs a strong program and solid 
evidence of preclinical and clinical validation and evaluation. The current 
special topic issue on single cell and immunity aimed to provide a strong 
communication for the progress of single cell-based studies on immune cell 
functional diversity in development and disease. The topic has a clear scope on 
the application of single cell sequencing to better understand immune cell 
heterogeneities, functions, cell-cell interactions, responses and regulatory 
roles in systems immunology and diseases."
428,"AIMS: For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving neoadjuvant 
therapy, the major pathologic response (MPR) is defined as the percentage of 
residual viable tumor cells (%RVT) in the tumor bed of no more than 10%. It has 
been proposed as a predictor of survival in neoadjuvant therapy-treated cohorts. 
Nonetheless, the significance of %RVT in the pathological assessment of lung 
adenocarcinoma cohorts remains undetermined.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Overall, 152 lung adenocarcinoma patients were included in 
this retrospective study, among whom 67 received neoadjuvant targeted therapy 
and 85 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Clinicopathological characteristics, 
neoadjuvant treatment response, and survival status were investigated. The 
routinely adopted standard for MPR (%RVT ≤10%) failed to differentiate prognosis 
in the lung adenocarcinoma population. For the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort, 
the optimal %RVT cutoff value of RFS was 60%. However, this cutoff value was 
clinically insignificant in the neoadjuvant targeted therapy cohort. Hence, for 
these patients, we built a nomogram model including high-grade patterns and ypN 
stage to predict disease recurrence, demonstrating a high efficacy (a 
bootstrap-corrected C-index of 0.731).
CONCLUSIONS: %RVT served as a strong indicator of the prognosis of lung 
adenocarcinoma in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy but not 
neoadjuvant targeted therapy. Residual high-grade pathological patterns might 
substitute MPR in prognostic evaluation of lung adenocarcinoma post-targeted 
therapy."
429,"Clinical tuberculosis (TB) screening and diagnosis are crucial for controlling 
the spread of this life-threatening infectious disease. In this work, a novel, 
rapid, and simple colorimetric detection platform for TB was developed based on 
a quantum dot-based nanobeacon (QD-NB) and multicomponent nucleic acid enzyme 
(MNAzyme). In the presence of target DNA (IS1081 gene fragment), the recombinase 
polymerase amplification (RPA) was performed and the amplicons were chemically 
DNA-denatured and then subjected to MNAzyme reaction. RNA-cleaving MNAzyme 
assembly included the recognition of target DNA and hybridization with a QD-NB 
fluorescence probe. Under the addition of Mg2+, the RNA-containing QD-NB as a 
cleavable substrate could be broken into two DNA fragments, leading to green 
fluorescence release due to their departure from a black hole quencher (BHQ2). 
The TB detection could be achieved with the naked eye under a portable and 
inexpensive UV flashlight. Our results demonstrated that QD-NB-based MNAzyme 
colorimetric assays improved the detection sensitivity by 1 order of magnitude 
compared with the detection using RPA. The limit of detection (LOD) of the 
visual reading was as low as 2 copies/μL (3.3 amol/L). Excellent specificity and 
reproducibility could also be achieved. Furthermore, the practical application 
of the colorimetric method for TB diagnosis was verified by 36 clinical TB 
patients and 20 healthy individuals. The developed QD-NB-based MNAzyme 
colorimetric assays provided a rapid, convenient, sensitive, and accurate 
alternative for clinical TB screening and diagnosis."
430,"PURPOSE: To evaluate measures of corneal epithelium in eyes that showed 
documented signs of keratoconus (KC) progression and compare with stable eyes 
and healthy controls. Also, to determine the correlation of these epithelial 
parameters with maximum keratometry (K max) and pachymetry.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational, comparative study.
PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred and fifty eyes from 150 patients. The study included 
50 eyes from patients with documented KC progression, 50 eyes with stable KC, 
and 50 clinically normal eyes to serve as controls.
METHODS: A spectral-domain (SD)-OCT imaging was obtained in all eyes, and mean 
values were compared between the groups. The correlation of epithelial 
parameters with K max and thinnest pachymetry was also investigated.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For the purposes of this study, the epithelial measures 
maximum, minimum, superior, and inferior values as well as the difference 
between the minimum and maximum (min-max) and epithelial standard deviation were 
considered, obtained from SD-OCT and compared between groups. Measurements of 
the thinnest point and min-max in pachymetry were also recorded.
RESULTS: The only epithelial parameter that presented a statistically 
significant difference between stable and progressive KC was epithelium min-max. 
Although stable KC presented epithelium min-max mean values of -18.2 ± 6.6, 
progressive KC eyes presented mean values of -23.4 ± 10.3 (P < 0.0001). 
Epithelial maximum (P = 0.16), minimum (P = 0.25), superior (P = 0.28), inferior 
(P = 0.23), and standard deviation (P = 0.25) values were not significantly 
different between stable and progressive eyes. Difference min-max pachymetry 
points in stable (-108.3 ± 33.5) and progressive KC (-115.2 ± 56.0) were not 
significantly different (P = 0.723). There was no significant correlation 
between epithelium min-max with corneal thinning (P = 0.39) or K max (P = 0.09) 
regardless of disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial measures are useful to identify KC eyes that are 
progressing; the parameters that measure the difference between min-max 
epithelium points were significantly different between stable and progressive 
groups, unlike this difference in pachymetry. Finally, this epithelial parameter 
seems to be independent of corneal thinning and K max.

431,"PURPOSE: Timely diagnosis of eye diseases is paramount to obtaining the best 
treatment outcomes. OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) have several advantages that 
lend themselves to early detection of ocular pathology; furthermore, the 
techniques produce large, feature-rich data volumes. However, the full clinical 
potential of both OCT and OCTA is stymied when complex data acquired using the 
techniques must be manually processed. Here, we propose an automated diagnostic 
framework based on structural OCT and OCTA data volumes that could substantially 
support the clinical application of these technologies.
DESIGN: Cross sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-six OCT and OCTA volumes were scanned from the 
eyes of 91 healthy participants, 161 patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR), 95 
patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and 108 patients with 
glaucoma.
METHODS: The diagnosis framework was constructed based on semisequential 
3-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks. The trained framework 
classifies combined structural OCT and OCTA scans as normal, DR, AMD, or 
glaucoma. Fivefold cross-validation was performed, with 60% of the data reserved 
for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The training, validation, 
and test data sets were independent, with no shared patients. For scans 
diagnosed as DR, AMD, or glaucoma, 3D class activation maps were generated to 
highlight subregions that were considered important by the framework for 
automated diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating 
characteristic curve and quadratic-weighted kappa were used to quantify the 
diagnostic performance of the framework.
RESULTS: For the diagnosis of DR, the framework achieved an AUC of 0.95 ± 0.01. 
For the diagnosis of AMD, the framework achieved an AUC of 0.98 ± 0.01. For the 
diagnosis of glaucoma, the framework achieved an AUC of 0.91 ± 0.02.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning frameworks can provide reliable, sensitive, 
interpretable, and fully automated diagnosis of eye diseases.

432,"BACKGROUND: The 5-factor modified frailty index (mFI-5) has been shown to be a 
concise and effective tool for predicting adverse events following various spine 
procedures. However, there have been no studies assessing its utility in 
patients undergoing anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF). Therefore, the aim 
of this study was to analyze the predictive capabilities of the mFI-5 for 30-day 
postoperative adverse events following elective ALIF.
METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was 
queried from 2010 through 2019 to identify patients who underwent elective ALIF 
using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes in patients over the age of 50. 
The mFI-5 score was calculated using variables for hypertension, congestive 
heart failure, comorbid diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 
partially or fully dependent functional status which were each assigned 1 point. 
Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to 
identify the associations between mFI-5 scores, and 30-day rates of overall 
complications, readmissions, reoperations, and mortality.
RESULTS: 11,711 patients were included (mFI-5=0: 4,026 patients, mFI-5=1: 5,392, 
mFI-5=2: 2,102, mFI-5=3+: 187. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that 
mFI-5 scores of 1 (OR: 2.2, CI: 1.2-4.2, p=0.02), 2 (OR: 3.6, CI: 1.8-7.3, 
p<0.001), and 3+ (OR: 7.0, CI: 2.5-19.3, p<0.001) versus a score of 0 were 
significant predictors of pneumonia. An mFI-5 score of 2 (OR: 1.3; CI: 1.01-1.6, 
p=0.04), and 3+ (OR: 1.9; CI: 1.1-3.1; p=0.01) were both independent predictors 
of related readmissions. An mFI score of 3+ was an independent predictor of any 
complication (OR: 1.5, CI: 1.01-2.2, p=0.004), UTI (OR: 2.4, CI: 1.1-5.2, 
p=0.02), and unplanned intubation (OR: 4.5, CI: 1.3-16.1, p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The mFI-5 is an independent predictor for 30-day postoperative 
complications, readmissions, UTI, pneumonia, and unplanned intubations following 
elective ALIF surgery in adults over the age of 50."
433,"OBJECTIVE: to describe a case of severe sepsis and complicated bacteremia caused 
by Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and review similar cases in the literature.
CASE SUMMARY: A 26-year-old gentleman with a history of epilepsy presented with 
symptoms of sore throat, productive cough, periumbilical abdominal pain, watery 
diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, subjective fevers along with progressive jaundice 
for seven days. The patient had acute fulminant liver failure, septic shock, and 
Multi-organ failure. He required vasopressors, underwent intubation, and had 
grown Arcanobacterium haemolyticum in the blood and Bronchoalveolar lavage 
samples. He developed a peritonsillar abscess and cavitary pneumonia and 
required chest tube drainage followed by thoracotomy for hemothorax. The patient 
improved on Ampicillin-Sulbactam treatment and was treated with a total 
antibiotic duration of 6 weeks. He fully improved on post-discharge follow-up.
DISCUSSION: Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a Gram-positive (sometimes Gram 
variable), catalase-negative facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, 
non-spore-forming, and variably β-hemolytic and is known to be a cause of 
pharyngitis and skin and soft tissue infections. Rarely A. Haemolyticum can be 
associated with severe systemic infections such as infective endocarditis, 
systemic abscesses, osteomyelitis, and septicemia. In previous literature 
reviews, the source of A. haemolyticum depended on the host, and pharyngeal and 
upper respiratory sources were likely to be associated with immunocompetent 
hosts.
CONCLUSION: A. haemolyticum should be included in the differential diagnosis of 
bacterial pharyngitis complicated by severe systemic illness. Penicillins are 
the most commonly used antibiotics for treating A. haemolyticum bacteremia, and 
macrolides can be used for Penicillin's treatment failure."
434,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Standard Precautions (SP) are infection control 
procedures universally applicable to every patient. Though SP reduces disease 
transmission, their implementation is dependent on the knowledge and skills of 
healthcare workers (HCWs). Poor knowledge regarding the appropriate use of SP 
can cause fear among HCWs, leading to stigma and discrimination while treating 
people living with HIV (PLWH). Stigma and discrimination are known barriers for 
PLWH to access HIV care services. The aim of the study was to assess nursing 
student knowledge of SP, SP self-efficacy and SP perceived efficacy of nursing 
students, and (2) to assess the association between SP knowledge, perceived 
efficacy, and intention to utilize unwarranted precautions, like using double 
gloves while treating PLWH.
METHODS: This paper analyzes baseline (non-randomized) data of a cluster 
randomized controlled trial amongst 1868 Indian nursing students. Data was 
collected using computer-administered structured questionnaire. The associations 
between the measures were done using multiple, logistic and poisson regression 
models.
RESULTS: Although 97% nursing students could identify SP, only 35.5% understood 
that they need to be used with all patients. Awareness of the importance of 
using SP with all patients was positively associated with self-efficacy. 
Students performing high-risk tasks frequently were significantly more likely to 
be confident in their ability to correctly use SP, but also had higher intention 
to use unwarranted precautions.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing teaching and training programs for HCWs need to provide 
clear guidelines and emphasize on the correct use of SP with all patients. This 
will increase both skills and confidence in their abilities (self-efficacy)."
435,"PURPOSE: To assess the utility, safety, and accuracy of in-office needle 
arthroscopic (IONA) synovial biopsy as a diagnostic tool during treatment of 
drug-resistant monoarticular inflammatory arthritis of the knee.
METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed with rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis 
with treatment-resistant monoarticular knee involvement who underwent in-office 
needle arthroscopic synovial biopsy were considered for inclusion. The exclusion 
criteria were any current malignancies or infection. All patients underwent 
systematic physical and laboratory examination. IONA was undertaken to inspect 
the macroscopic appearance of the joint, choose the biopsy site, and classify 
synovial inflammation. Once collected, synovial tissue specimens were examined 
histologically using the Krenn scoring system.
RESULTS: In total, 12 patients (9 male and 3 female, median age 57 
[interquartile range {IQR} 8] years, median disease duration 156 [IQR 201] 
months) affected by psoriatic arthritis (n = 6) or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 6) 
were included in this study. Median operating time was 12 (IQR 11) minutes. 
Three biopsies per patient were collected. The success rate of specimen 
collection was 97%, the median postoperative 0-10 visual analog scale pain score 
was 2 (IQR 3), and only one minor complication occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Knee IONA with synovial biopsy is an effective and well-tolerated 
procedure that can help clinicians formulate specific treatment strategies in 
patients with refractory pain in the setting of rheumatoid and psoriatic 
arthritis.

436,"Law enforcement officers (LEOs) often encounter rapidly changing and 
uncontrolled situations that expose them to various hazards. A law enforcement 
agency requested an evaluation by the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health (NIOSH) when multiple LEOs reported illness after executing a search 
warrant and taking a suspect into custody. NIOSH investigators interviewed LEOs 
and reviewed medical records, forensic laboratory results for collected 
evidence, and environmental testing results of samples taken after the 
operation. Two-thirds (25 of 38) of LEOs who participated in the operation 
reported ≥1 symptom. Eleven LEOs met a case definition for influenza-like 
illness (ILI). Members of one unit were more likely to have ILI than non-members 
(prevalence ratio (PR), 4.1; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3-13.0; p = 0.01). 
Influenza vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of ILI (PR, 0.2; 
95% CI, 0.1-0.9; p = 0.02). Preventing employees from working while ill and 
annual influenza vaccination might prevent similar occurrences."
437,"Substance use disorder is a chronic and relapsing disease that burdens both the 
individual and the society. In addition to psychosocial treatment approaches, 
currently there are approved pharmacological treatment options for opioid, 
alcohol and tobacco use disorders, but only symptomatic treatment can be offered 
to patients with other substance use disorders. Advances in neuroscience and a 
better understanding of the addiction process offer an opportunity to create new 
treatment options. There is a wide range of studies, ranging from the use of 
drugs with different indications to the development of new pharmacological 
treatments, and from vaccine studies to neuromodulation techniques. Establishing 
novel treatment goals in addition to complete abstinence and individualizing 
treatment by focusing on endophenotypes may increase the treatment alternatives 
and the efficacy of these treatments for SUD."
438,"Diabetes represents one of the most significant, and rapidly escalating, global 
healthcare crises we face today. Diabetes already affects one-tenth of the 
world's adults-more than 537 million people, numbers that have tripled since 
2000 and are estimated to reach 643 million by 2030. Type 2 diabetes (T2D), the 
most prevalent form, is a complex disease with numerous contributing factors, 
including genetics, epigenetics, diet, lifestyle, medication use, and 
socioeconomic factors. In addition, the gut microbiome has emerged as a 
significant potential contributing factor in T2D development and progression. 
Gut microbes and their metabolites strongly influence host metabolism and immune 
function, and are now known to contribute to vitamin biosynthesis, gut hormone 
production, satiety, maintenance of gut barrier integrity, and protection 
against pathogens, as well as digestion and nutrient absorption. In turn, gut 
microbes are influenced by diet and lifestyle factors such as alcohol and 
medication use, including antibiotic use and the consumption of probiotics and 
prebiotics. Here we review current evidence regarding changes in microbial 
populations in T2D and the mechanisms by which gut microbes influence glucose 
metabolism and insulin resistance, including inflammation, gut permeability, and 
bile acid production. We also explore the interrelationships between gut 
microbes and different T2D medications and other interventions, including 
prebiotics, probiotics, and bariatric surgery. Lastly, we explore the particular 
role of the small bowel in digestion and metabolism and the importance of 
studying small bowel microbes directly in our search to find metabolically 
relevant biomarkers and therapeutic targets for T2D."
439,"PURPOSE: To report a unique case of Dent Disease presenting with nyctalopia 
associated with vitamin A deficiency and abnormal electroretinogram findings 
without prior systemic symptomatology.
OBSERVATIONS: A 16-year-old male presented with a several month history of 
nyctalopia and peripheral vision deficits. Central visual acuity, anterior and 
posterior segment examinations, and macular optical coherence tomography were 
unremarkable. Electroretinogram (ERG) testing revealed a rod-cone dystrophic 
pattern, with further workup demonstrating serum vitamin A deficiency (VAD). 
Laboratory evaluation revealed renal dysfunction and proteinuria with a 
significantly elevated urinary retinol-binding protein (RBP). Kidney biopsy 
showed glomerular and tubular disease.Genetic screening for inherited renal 
disease was performed identifying a hemizygous pathogenic variant c.2152C>T 
(p.Arg718*) in the Chloride Voltage-Gated Channel 5 (CLCN5) gene, confirming the 
diagnosis of X-linked Dent Disease. Following vitamin A supplementation, our 
patient reported resolution of nyctalopia and reversal of abnormal ERG findings 
were demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first case in the 
literature describing Dent disease solely presenting with ophthalmic symptoms of 
nyctalopia and abnormal electroretinogram findings that later reversed with 
vitamin A repletion. This case stresses the importance for clinicians to 
consider renal tubular disorders in the differential for VAD."
440,"C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) is a cytosolic tyrosine-protein kinase with an 
important role in regulating critical cellular decisions, such as cellular 
apoptosis, survival, proliferation, cytoskeletal organization and many others. 
Current knowledge on the CSK mechanisms of action, regulation and functions is 
still at an early stage, most of CSK's known actions and functions being 
mediated by the negative regulation of the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (SFKs) 
through phosphorylation. As SFKs play a vital role in apoptosis, cell 
proliferation and survival regulation, SFK inhibition by CSK has a pro-apoptotic 
effect, which is mediated by the inhibition of cellular signaling cascades 
controlled by SFKs, such as the MAPK/ERK, STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. 
Abnormal functioning of CSK and SFK activation can lead to diseases such as 
cancer, cardiovascular and neurological manifestations. This review describes 
apoptosis regulation by CSK, CSK inhibition of the SFKs and further explores the 
clinical relevance of CSK in important pathologies, such as cancer, autoimmune, 
autoinflammatory, neurologic diseases, hypertension and HIV/AIDS."
441,"Goal: Smartphone and wearable devices may act as powerful tools to remotely 
monitor physical function in people with neurodegenerative and autoimmune 
diseases from out-of-clinic environments. Detection of progression onset or 
worsening of symptoms is especially important in people living with multiple 
sclerosis (PwMS) in order to enable optimally adapted therapeutic strategies. MS 
symptoms typically follow subtle and fluctuating disease courses, 
patient-to-patient, and over time. Current in-clinic assessments are often too 
infrequently administered to reflect longitudinal changes in MS impairment that 
impact daily life. This work, therefore, explores how smartphones can administer 
daily two-minute walking assessments to monitor PwMS physical function at home. 
Methods: Remotely collected smartphone inertial sensor data was transformed 
through state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, to estimate a 
participant's daily ambulatory-related disease severity, longitudinally over a 
24-week study. Results: This study demonstrated that smartphone-based ambulatory 
severity outcomes could accurately estimate MS level of disability, as measured 
by the EDSS score ([Formula: see text]: 0.56,[Formula: see text]0.001). 
Furthermore, longitudinal severity outcomes were shown to accurately reflect 
individual participants' level of disability over the study duration. 
Conclusion: Smartphone-based assessments, that can be performed by patients from 
their home environments, could greatly augment standard in-clinic outcomes for 
neurodegenerative diseases. The ability to understand the impact of disease on 
daily-life between clinical visits, through objective digital outcomes, paves 
the way forward to better measure and identify signs of disease progression that 
may be occurring out-of-clinic, to monitor how different patients respond to 
various treatments, and to ultimately enable the development of better, and more 
personalised care."
442,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the common cancers in males and its 
incidence keeps increasing globally. Approximately 81% of PCa is diagnosed 
during the early stage of the disease. The treatment options for prostate care 
include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, but these treatments often have 
side effects that may lead to issues such as impotence or decreased bowel 
function. Our central goal is to test the apoptotic effects of Vernonia 
amygdalina Delile (an edible medicinal plant that is relatively inexpensive, 
nontoxic, and virtually without side effects) for the prevention of PCa using 
human adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells as a test model.
METHODS: To address our central goal, PC-3 cells were treated with Vernonia 
amygdalina Delile (VAD). Cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were evaluated by 
Flow Cytometry assessment. Nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected by agarose 
gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: Flow cytometry data showed that VAD induced cell cycle arrest at the 
G0/G1 checkpoint and significantly upregulated caspase-3 in treated cells 
compared to the control cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis resulted in the 
formation of DNA ladders in VAD-treated cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inhibition of cancer cell growth, 
induction of cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis through caspase-3 activation and 
nucleosomal DNA fragmentation are involved in the therapeutic mechanisms of VAD 
as a candidate drug towards the prevention and/or treatment of PCa."
443,"BACKGROUND: Brain damage is a severe and common pathology that leads to 
life-threatening diseases. Despite development in the research, the medical 
evidence of the effectiveness of potential neuroprotective medicines is 
insufficient. As a result, there is an immense and urgent demand for promising 
medication. For millennia, herbal remedies were a fundamental aspect of medical 
treatments. Combretum micranthum (CM), a plant of the family Combretaceae in 
sub-Saharan Africa, has been utilized in folklore medicine to cure diverse human 
ailments. In order to develop a neuroprotective phytomedicine, the current 
research was undertaken to explore the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
anticholinesterase and neuroprotective potential of CM extract.
METHODS: Colorimetric methods were used to determine CM antioxidant activity, 
in-vitro protein denaturation and membrane destabilization assays were used to 
evaluate its anti-inflammatory capacity, anticholinesterase activity was carried 
out using Ellman's method, and neuroprotective potential was assessed on brain 
homogenate stressed with ferric chloride and ascorbic acid (FeCl2-AA) by 
assessing the lipoperoxidation biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA).
RESULTS: In Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (IC50 = 27.15 ± 0.06 µg/mL) and 
Total Antioxidant Capacity (IC50 = 31.13 ± 0.02 µg/mL), CM extract demonstrated 
strong antioxidant activity. Anti-inflammatory effect were improved in 
heat-induced Egg albumin and BSA denaturation (IC 50 = 46.35 ± 1.53 and 
23.94 ± 1.10 µg/mL) as well as heat and hypotonia induced membrane 
destabilization (IC 50 = 20.96 ± 0.11 and 16.75 ± 0.94 µg/mL).CM extract showed 
strong anticholinesterase activity (IC 50 = 59.85 ± 0.91 µg/mL). In an ex-vivo 
neuroprotective model, CM extract showed substantial inhibition (p < 0.001) of 
oxidative damage caused by FeCl2-AA in brain tissue.
CONCLUSION: C. micranthum may be a good candidate for its probable 
neuroprotective potential. Its neuroprotective benefits might be attributed to 
its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticholinesterase effects."
444,"Although thrombocytopenia is common in end-stage liver disease, severe, 
refractory thrombocytopenia during liver transplantation is rare, and if immune 
based, usually presents months or years later. This case describes an adult 
woman in whom preoperative evaluation had not determined an immune-related cause 
of thrombocytopenia. Clot strength was dramatically impaired as measured by 
thrombelastography during the transplant. Following a lack of response to repeat 
platelet transfusions, splenectomy was performed after graft reperfusion with 
rapid temporal restoration of clot strength. This case shows a severe 
manifestation of perioperative thrombocytopenia during liver transplantation and 
clinically guided management when measured clot strength is too low for accurate

446,"Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a rare complication of idiopathic intracranial 
hypertension (IIH); hence, little is known about its pathophysiology and 
treatment options. Here, we report a 29-year-old woman with a 3-month history of 
IIH and HFS. Following a diagnostic and therapeutic lumbar puncture, she 
suffered from attacks of HFS for a few days every time she rose from a supine 
position. The relatively sudden drop in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure led 
to frequent HFS attacks, which, in contrast to the attacks in the previous 
months, were strictly observed only when getting up from the supine position. 
This observation suggests changes in CSF pressure as the likely 
pathophysiological mechanism responsible for HFS in IIH, rather than the 
absolute CSF pressure. She was then successfully treated with topiramate, a 
known therapeutic option in IIH, but not yet described for HFS in IIH."
447,"Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disorder of unknown cause 
characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilage predominantly affecting the 
ears, nose, and upper airway. The bridge of the nose and surrounding tissue can 
collapse, producing a saddle nose deformity. Nasal reconstruction is often 
challenging in these patients due to impaired wound healing and graft take 
caused by autoimmune inflammatory disease and prolonged immunosuppressant 
treatment. Many different reconstruction techniques like autologous rib, fascia 
lata, and calvarial bone grafts have been used. Herein we report the use of a 
cadaver cartilage graft in a 55-year-old woman with relapsing polychondritis and 
saddle nose deformity. Because of the characteristic chondritis of her 
autoimmune condition, cadaver cartilage was selected because it is antigenically 
different from the patient's own cartilage, offering significant structural 
integrity for nasal reconstruction compared to other techniques."
448,"Asthma is a common chronic pediatric disease that negatively impacts the quality 
of patients' lives. While most cases can be effectively managed with a regimen 
of inhaled corticosteroids, severe cases require prolonged or frequent courses 
of oral corticosteroids or the addition of biologic therapies and allergen

reactions as severe as anaphylaxis have been reported. We present a pediatric 
patient with severe persistent asthma who developed hypersensitivity reactions 
to three different biologic agents."
449,"Inherited thrombocytopenia (IT) is a heterogeneous group of diseases with a 
genetic origin. The primary symptom presented by patients is a reduced platelet 
count in the peripheral blood. Nevertheless, certain forms of IT are 
characterized by the occurrence of other congenital malformations or 
predisposition to acquire additional diseases. Five related subjects with 
lifelong thrombocytopenia were admitted to our clinic. A total of 16 cases of 
persistent thrombocytopenia were investigated in the family history. Molecular 
and cytogenetic analysis covered MECOM, MPL, RUNX1, ETV6, and GATA1 genes, whose 
mutations are known to cause predisposing forms of IT. The laboratory testing 
revealed thrombocytopenia ranging from 19 to 65 × 109/L in the subjects. Mild 
bleeding symptoms were present in each of the subjects, while two of five had a 
history of severe hemorrhage requiring transfusion of blood products. 
Establishing a diagnosis of IT protects the patient from unnecessary treatment 
and enables the appropriate surveillance."

colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. This retrospective quality assurance report 
analyzed data for 411 patients from one academic center in Central New York who 
underwent FIT between September 2015 and September 2016. All 67 positive tests 
and 344 of 952 negative tests were analyzed. Subjects from the FIT-negative 
""control group"" were chosen at random. The mean age was 67 years and the 
male/female distribution was 391/20, with differences between the FIT-positive 
and -negative groups. FIT was inappropriately used in 210 (51%) of the 411 
patients. The most common reasons for inappropriate FIT use were a documented 
refusal of colonoscopy (39.60% of inappropriate use), FIT occurring within the 
recommended surveillance interval from previous colonoscopy (27.98%), and a 
Charlson Co-Morbidity Index score ≥5 (22.87%). Other reasons were a history of 
adenoma (9.25%), family history of CRC/high-risk adenoma <60 years of age 
(5.84%), active/overt gastrointestinal bleed (4.87%), history of CRC (1.46%), 
and history of inflammatory bowel disease (1.46%). The results of this study 
show that FIT is being utilized inappropriately about 50% of the time."
451,"Acute liver failure following COVID-19 infection and/or vaccination is very rare 
and can be secondary to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Liver injury 
in such cases appears to be extrinsic and thus treatment hinges on prompt

developed acute liver failure secondary to HLH after receiving a second dose of 
the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Persistently elevated liver function tests, fevers, 
and cytopenia following COVID-19 vaccination should prompt clinicians to 
calculate an H-score to evaluate for the presence of HLH."

454,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in critical patients affect 
the quality and safety of patient care and increase patient morbidity and 
mortality. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the incidence of HAIs, 
particularly device-associated infections (DAIs), was reported worldwide. In 
this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of HAIs in an intensive care unit 
(ICU) during a 10-year period and compare HAI incidence during the preCOVID-19 
and COVID-19 periods.
METHODS: A retrospective, observational study of HAIs in the medical-surgical 
ICU at The Cuban Hospital was conducted. DAIs included central line-associated 
bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections 
(CAUTI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Data included the annual 
incidence of HAIs, etiology, and antimicrobial resistance, using definitions 
provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, except for other 
respiratory tract infections (RTIs).
RESULTS: 155 patients with HAI infections were reported, from which 130 (85.5%) 
were identified during the COVID-19 period. The frequencies of DAIs and non-DAIs 
were higher during the COVID-19 period, except for Clostridium difficile 
infections. Species under Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas dominated in 
both periods, and higher frequencies of Acinetobacter, Enterococcus, Candida, 
Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophoma maltophila were noted 
during COVID-19 period. Device utilization ratio increased to 10.7% for central 
lines and 12.9% for ventilators, while a reduction of 15% in urinary catheter 
utilization ratio was observed. DAI incidence was higher during the COVID-19 
pandemic, with risks for CLABSI, VAP, and CAUTI increased by 2.79 (95% 
confidence interval, 0.93-11.21; p < 0.0050), 15.31 (2.53-625.48), and 3.25 
(0.68-31.08), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of DAIs increased during the pandemic period, with 
limited evidence of antimicrobial resistance observed. The infection control 
program should evaluate strategies to minimize the impact of the pandemic on 
HAIs."
455,"BACKGROUND: The intracorporeal orthotopic modified-Y ""Bordeaux"" neobladder 
(iYNB) was first described in 2016. No urodynamic evaluation of this neobladder 
has yet been performed.
OBJECTIVE: To present the urodynamic features of the iYNB and 
incontinence-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We prospectively assessed 26 patients operated 
between September 2018 and November 2020.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: Robotic radical cystectomy for malignant disease of the 
bladder and iYNB, performed by a single surgeon, were used.
MEASUREMENTS: Three months after surgery and in November 2021, consenting 
patients underwent clinical evaluation and multichannel urodynamic study (UDS). 
The incontinence quality of life (I-QoL) questionnaire was used to evaluate 
HRQoL. Continence was classified into day- and nighttime, and clinically defined 
as the use of zero pads. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The mean age at surgery was 65.4 yr. The mean follow-up 
period was 27 mo (12-38). The mean time for the neobladder reconstruction was 
192 min (110-340). The mean maximum capacity was 431 cm3 (range 200-553). The 
mean postvoid residual was 101.6 ml (0-310), and the rate of clean intermittent 
catheterization was 17.6%. With the exception of a significant reduction in the 
volume of the first sensation of bladder fullness, no other statistically 
significant changes in the UDS parameters of both the storage and the voiding 
phase were observed over time. Day- and nighttime continence rates were 58.8% 
and 23.5%, respectively. The mean postoperative I-QoL score was 103.3 (89-110). 
Limitations include the small number of patients and short follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The UDS evaluation of iYNB demonstrates that both the volumetric 
and the pressure characteristics are acceptable and may enhance quality of life. 
Prospective studies with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up are 
needed to further evaluate the iYNB.
PATIENT SUMMARY: The ""Bordeaux"" neobladder provides acceptable urodynamic 
outcomes. It is associated with high levels of health-related quality of life 
and good rates of continence in patients."
456,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Barrett's esophagus (BE), defined by the presence of intestinal 
metaplasia (IM) on histology, is thought to be the only identifiable precursor 
lesion for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Recent studies have suggested the 
possibility of an alternate, non-IM associated EAC that is a more aggressive 
form of EAC with worse survival. Among EAC patients, we aimed to compare 
survival of patients with and without IM at the time of diagnosis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients with histologic 
confirmed EAC evaluated at a tertiary care center from 2013 to 2019. Cases were 
categorized according to the presence or absence of IM on histologic specimens 
(Group I-IM-EAC and Group II-non-IM-EAC). We compared demographic 
characteristics, clinical stage, therapy, and survival between the 2 groups 
using the Chi-square and ANOVA tests (for categorical and continuous variables, 
respectively). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to determine the 
association of IM with overall survival, adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, 
tumor location, histologic grade, and clinical stage.
RESULTS: A total of 475 patients were included in this analysis (mean age 64.8 
years [SD 10.8], 89% white) and 109 (23.0%) had no evidence of IM. Compared with 
IM-EAC (Group I), individuals in the non-IM-EAC group were younger (P = .01) and 
had a greater proportion of patients diagnosed with advanced disease (49.5 vs 
20.2% for stage 4, P < .001). These patients were less likely to undergo 
endoscopic therapy alone (0.92% vs 29.78%, P < .001) or surgery alone (0 vs 
9.84%, P = .001). On multivariable analysis, the presence of IM-EAC was 
associated with improved overall survival compared to non-IM-EAC (HR 0.69, 95% 
CI 0.49-0.96). Additional factors associated with poor survival was increasing 
stage of diagnosis (HR 6.49: 95% CI 3.77-11.15 for stage 4, HR 2.19: 95% CI 
1.25-3.84 for stage 3, HR 2.04: 95% CI 0.98-4.25 for stage 2 compared to stage 
1) and more advanced histologic stage (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.26-3.19) for 
poorly/undifferentiated compared to well differentiated).
CONCLUSIONS: EAC without the presence of IM on histology was associated with 
worse survival compared to those with IM. Future prospective studies with 
detailed molecular sequencing are required to clarify if 2 separate phenotypes 
of EAC exist (IM-EAC and non-IM-EAC). If confirmed, this may have significant 
implications for screening and management strategies."
457,"PURPOSE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a deadly malignancy that is 
frequently diagnosed in patients with significant medical comorbidities. When 
delivering local and regional therapy, an exceedingly narrow therapeutic window 
is encountered, which often precludes patients from receiving aggressive 
curative therapy. Radiation therapy advances including particle therapy have 
been employed in an effort to expand this therapeutic window. Here we report 
outcomes with the use of proton therapy with curative intent and immunotherapy 
to treat patients diagnosed with high-risk NSCLC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were determined to be high risk if they had 
severe underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction, history of prior thoracic 
radiation therapy, and/or large volume or unfavorable location of disease (eg, 
bilateral hilar involvement, supraclavicular involvement). As such, patients 
were determined to be ineligible for conventional x-ray-based radiation therapy 
and were treated with pencil beam scanning proton beam therapy (PBS-PBT). 
Patients who demonstrated excess respiratory motion (ie, greater than 1 cm in 
any dimension noted on the 4-dimensional computed tomography simulation scan) 
were deemed to be ineligible for PBT. Toxicity was reported using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Overall survival 
and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 29 patients with high-risk NSCLC diagnoses were treated with 
PBS-PBT. The majority (55%) of patients were defined as high risk due to severe 
cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Most commonly, patients were treated definitively 
to a total dose of 6000 cGy (relative biological effectiveness) in 30 fractions 
with concurrent chemotherapy. Overall, there were a total of 6 acute grade 3 
toxicities observed in our cohort. Acute high-grade toxicities included 
esophagitis (n = 4, 14%), dyspnea (n = 1, 3.5%), and cough (n = 1, 3.5%). No 
patients developed grade 4 or higher toxicity. The majority of patients went on 
to receive immunotherapy, and high-grade pneumonitis was rare. Two-year 
progression-free and overall survival was estimated to be 51% and 67%, 
respectively. COVID-19 was confirmed or suspected to be responsible for 2 
patient deaths during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Radical PBS-PBT treatment delivered in a cohort of patients with 
high-risk lung cancer with immunotherapy is feasible with careful 
multidisciplinary evaluation and rigorous follow-up."
458,"INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) is an important treatment 
modality in metastatic NSCLC and management of immunotherapy-related adverse 
effects (irAEs) can be challenging. Retreatment after discontinuation of ICI 
because of irAEs is a frequent clinical dilemma with limited available data.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational study reviewed the 
clinical course of 30 patients with metastatic NSCLC in whom ICI had to be 
discontinued owing to a serious irAE after an initial objective response to 
therapy.
RESULTS: After ICI discontinuation, 14 patients (47%) developed a durable 
response of more than 6 months, seven patients (23%) developed oligoprogression 
treated with local radiotherapy leading to disease control, six patients (20%) 
had progression of disease within 6 months, and three patients (10%) died owing 
to a severe irAE.
CONCLUSIONS: A watchful waiting approach is justified after discontinuation of 
ICI owing to irAEs in patients with metastatic NSCLC with an initial response to 
therapy."
459,"Evidence that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease is already un-ravelling. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a 
bidirectional communication system that is not fully understood but includes 
neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. The progression of 
Alzheimer's disease is supported by mechanisms related to the imbalance in the 
gut microbiota and the development of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are at 
the origin of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in the composition of the gut 
microbiome led to dysregulation in the pathways governing this system. This 
leads to neurodegeneration through neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter 
dysregulation. Neurodegeneration and disruption of the blood-brain barrier are 
frontiers at the origin of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, bacteria populating 
the gut microbiota can secrete large amounts of amyloid proteins and 
lipopolysaccharides, which modulate signaling pathways and alter the production 
of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the pathogenesis of Alz-heimer's 
disease. Importantly, through molecular mimicry, bacterial amyloids may elicit 
cross-seeding of misfolding and induce microglial priming at different levels of 
the brain-gut-microbiota axis. The potential mechanisms of amyloid spreading 
include neuron-to-neuron or distal neuron spreading, direct blood-brain barrier 
crossing, or via other cells such as astrocytes, fibroblasts, microglia, and 
immune system cells. Gut microbiota metabolites, including short-chain fatty 
acids, pro-inflammatory factors, and neurotransmitters may also affect AD 
pathogenesis and associated cognitive decline. The purpose of this review is to 
summarize and discuss the current findings that may elucidate the role of gut 
microbiota in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the 
underlying mechanisms may provide new insights into novel therapeutic strategies 
for Alzheimer's disease, such as probiotics and targeted oligosaccharides."
460,"BACKGROUND: Despite the implementation of various cancer therapies, adequate 
therapeutic efficacy has not been achieved. A growing number of studies have 
been dedicated to the discovery of new molecules to combat refractory cancer 
cells efficiently. Recently, the use of a rare type of sugar, D-allose, has 
attracted the attention of research communities. In combination with the 
first-line treatment of cancers, including different types of radiotherapies and 
chemotherapies, D-allose has been detected with favorable complementary effects. 
Understanding the mechanism of therapeutic target molecules will enable us to 
develop new strategies for cancer patients that do not currently respond to the 
present therapies.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide a review of the effects of D-allose in cancer 
treatment, its mechanisms of action, and gaps in this field that require more 
investigations.
DISCUSSION: With rare exceptions, in many cancer types, including head and neck, 
lung, liver, bladder, blood, and breast, D-allose consistently has exhibited 
anticancer activity in vitro and/or in vivo. Most of the D-allose functions are 
mediated through thioredoxin-interacting protein molecules. D-allose exerts its 
effects via reactive oxygen species regulation, cell cycle arrest, metabolic 
reprogramming, autophagy, apoptosis induction, and sensitizing tumors to 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: D-allose has shown great promise for combating tumor cells with no 
side effects, especially in combination with first-line drugs; however, its 
potential for cancer therapy has not been comprehensively investigated in vitro 
or in vivo."
461,"BACKGROUND: The paper presents the findings of a broad analytical review of the 
use of bentonite clays as a mineral feed additive in poultry farming in order to 
increase productivity and prevent diseases. It has been shown that an important 
direction in improving the technology of veterinary preventive measures is the 
introduction of new methods for the prevention and treatment of diseases in 
quails with the use of drugs with bioactive properties that can have a 
regulatory effect on the intensity of metabolic processes and enhance the 
functional activity of organs and body systems. The emphasis is placed on the 
unique properties of bentonite as high adsorption, catalytic, and ion-exchange 
activity.
METHODS: Using the comparison method, the authors studied preliminary studies of 
the chemical and mineralogical composition of the montmorillonite clay of the 
Pogadaevsky deposit of the West Kazakhstan region. The method of scanning 
electron microscopy was used to determine the local elemental composition of the 
provided samples. The mass spectrometry method was used to determine the 
chemical elemental composition. In addition, the X-ray diffractometry method was 
used to determine the mineralogical composition.
RESULTS: According to the results of scientific and experimental research, it 
was established that the studied clay has a significant sorption activity.
CONCLUSION: The first scientific experiments on the effect of bentonite-like 
(montmorillonite) clay on the egg production of quails showed its significant 
effectiveness."
462,"BACKGROUND: Gout could result in irreversible bone erosion, and chondrocyte 
might be involved in the process. Increased soluble urate is the early stage of 
gout and is strongly oxidative.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of intracellular urate on the oxidative status 
of chondrocytes Methods: A chondrocyte model was used. Serial concentrations of 
exogenous urate were incubated with chondrocytes for increasing amounts of time. 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidant, and anti-oxidant molecules were measured 
with biochemical assays, rt-PCR, and western blot. A urate transport inhibitor 
and oxidative inhibitors were used to confirm the effect of exogenous urate.
RESULTS: All concentrations of exogenous urate stimulated the production of ROS 
in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, as well as oxidant molecules, 
including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
(NADPH) oxidase, nitric oxide (NO) inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 
these effects, could be inhibited by oxidant inhibitors. However, anti-oxidant 
molecules, including acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein-32A (ANP32A), 
ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and the 
transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related (Nrf2), was 
decreased by high concentrations of exogenous urate after prolonged incubation, 
but not by low to medium concentrations of exogenous urate. By inhibiting 
soluble urate trafficking, benzbromarone significantly suppressed the effect of 
urate stimulus on the oxidant and anti-oxidant molecules.
CONCLUSION: Intracellular soluble urate could regulate chondrocyte redox balance 
in a time and concentration-dependent manner, and would be a target for 
regulating and protecting chondrocyte function in the early gout stage."
463,"BACKGROUND: The liver is one of the crucial organs in humans and is responsible 
for the regulation of diverse processes, including metabolism, secretion, and 
detoxification. Ingestion of alcohol and drugs, environmental pollutants, and 
irradiation are among the risk factors accountable for oxidative stress in the 
liver. Plant flavonoids have the potential to protect the liver from damage 
caused by a variety of chemicals.
OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: The present study aims to summarize up-to-date 
information on the protective roles of plant flavonoids against liver damage.
METHODOLOGY: The literature information on the hepatoprotective plant flavonoids 
was assessed through various databases, which were searched from their 
respective inception until March 2022.
RESULTS: More than 70 flavonoids with hepatoprotective activity against a 
variety of models of liver toxicity have been reported across the literature. 
Among these are flavones (19), flavonols (30), flavanones (9), isoflavonoids 
(5), and biflavonoids (2). Several hepatoprotective mechanisms of action were 
reported in various classes of flavonoids, including flavones and flavonols 
(upregulation of the pro-survival ERK1/2 pathway; downregulation of apoptotic 
proteins, including Bax, Bcl-2, Bax, BH3, caspase-3, 8, 9, etc.), flavanones 
(downregulation of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1 β, IL-6, iNOS, etc.), isoflavonoids 
(downregulation of lipogenesis genes, such as SREBP-1c, LXRα, RXRα, PPARγ and 
ACC2, with concomitant upregulation of genes involved in β-oxidation, including 
AMPK and PPARα; inhibition of CYPs, such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2D6, 
CYP2E1 and CYP3A1/2).
CONCLUSION: The present work demonstrated the effectiveness of plant flavonoids 
against hepatic damage. However, more studies need to be performed regarding the 
cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action of these very important 
cytoprotective flavonoids."
464,"World Health Organization has reported an estimated 1.5 million deaths directly 
due to diabetes in 2019. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in its 
National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020, says that 1 in 10 United States 
residents has diabetes. This rapid progression of diabetes is noteworthy despite 
significant advances in the field of antidiabetic medicine. The critical 
challenges in treatment are dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. 
The latest research has also linked diabetes to carcinogenesis. The diabetic 
condition leads to the acceleration of cell growth, proliferation, migration, 
inflammation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and inhibition of apoptosis in cancer 
cells. In addition, diabetic complications of nephropathy, retinopathy, 
neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery 
disease, and stroke increase morbidity. Amidst all these challenges, a ray of 
hope is the advent of nanocarriers. The nano size helps in the targeted and 
controlled delivery of drugs. In addition, nanocarrier formulation helps in the 
delivery of acid-labile and enzyme-labile molecules, and plant-based 
macromolecules via the oral route. Its use in the form of dendrimers, ethosomes, 
niosomes, transfersomes, and polymeric nanoparticles is established. In 
addition, different polymers used to formulate nanocarriers are also established 
for targeting in diabetes. Thus, this review aims to compile approaches 
involving the use of nanocarriers for the betterment of pharmacotherapy of 
diabetes and to provide a way ahead for researchers in the field."
465,"BACKGROUND: Recent community-based studies have demonstrated that experiencing 
multiple concurrent functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) is associated 
with increased somatization, worse quality of life (QoL), and greater health 
care utilization. However, the presence of multiple overlapping FGIDs is 
unstudied specifically in chronic constipation and functional defecation 
disorders (FDD). We investigated the prevalence and impact of additional 
nonconstipation FGIDs on constipation severity, anorectal physiology, anxiety 
and depression, and QoL, in patients with chronic constipation and FDD.
METHODS: One-hundred and forty-six consecutive patients with functional 
constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C/IBS-M) presenting to a tertiary 
referral Neurogastroenterology Clinic were studied. In addition, 90/146 (62%) 
qualified for FDD due to abnormal defecatory physiology. Patients underwent 
comprehensive baseline assessment comprising anorectal physiology, Bristol Stool 
Chart, Rome questionnaire, Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom (KESS) constipation 
score, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale, and modified 36-Item Short Form 
Health Survey (SF-36) for QoL. Additional FGIDs were diagnosed using Rome III 
criteria.
KEY RESULTS: Additional nonconstipation FGIDs occurred in 85% of patients, with 
a mean of 2.1 (SD 1.6) additional FGIDs. Patients with four or more additional 
FGIDs experienced greater constipation severity compared to those with no 
additional FGIDs (p = 0.004). Comorbid FGIDs were associated with worse SF-36 
scores for physical functioning (p < 0.001), role-physical (p = 0.005), bodily 
pain (p < 0.001), vitality (p = 0.008), social functioning (p = 0.004), and 
mental health index (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Functional gastrointestinal disorders comorbidity is 
highly prevalent in chronic constipation and defecatory disorders, and this is 
associated with greater symptom severity and worse QoL. Multimodal treatments 
targeting comorbid FGIDs may lead to superior outcomes."

468,"Using two imaging modalities, that is, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron 
emission tomography (PET) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) the present study 
tested associations between cortical amyloid-beta (Aβ) burden and fornix 
microstructural changes with cognitive deficits in early Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), namely deficits in working memory (1-back) processing of visual object 
categories (faces, places, objects, bodies and verbal material). Second, we 
examined cortical Aβ associations with fornix microstructure. Seventeen early AD 
patients and 17 healthy-matched controls were included. Constrained spherical 
deconvolution-based tractography was used to segment the fornix and a control 
tract the central branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (CB-SLF) 
previously implicated in working memory processes. Standard uptake value ratios 
(SUVR) of Aβ were extracted from 45 cortical/subcortical regions from the AAL 
atlas and subject to principal component analysis for data reduction. Patients 
exhibited (i) impairments in cognitive performance (ii) reductions in fornix 
fractional anisotropy (FA) and (iii) increases in a component that loaded highly 
on cortical Aβ. There were no group differences in CB-SLF FA and in a component 
loading highly on subcortical Aβ. Partial correlation analysis in the patient 
group showed (i) positive associations between fornix FA and performance for all 
the visual object categories and (ii) a negative association between the 
cortical Aβ component and performance for the object categories but not for the 
remaining classes of visual stimuli. A subsequent analysis showed a positive 
association between overall cognition (performance across distinct 1-back task 
conditions) with fornix FA but no association with cortical Aβ burden, in 
keeping with influential accounts on early onset AD. This indicates that the 
fornix degenerates early in AD and contributes to deficits in working memory 
processing of visual object categories; though it is also important to 
acknowledge the importance of prospective longitudinal studies with larger 
samples. Overall, the effect sizes of fornical degeneration on visual working 
memory appeared stronger than the ones related to amyloid burden."
469,"Bioorthogonal catalysis mediated by Pd-based transition metal catalysts has 
sparked increasing interest in combating diseases. However, the catalytic and 
therapeutic efficiency of current Pd0 catalysts is unsatisfactory. Herein, 
inspired by the concept that ligands around metal sites could enable enzymes to 
catalyze astonishing reactions by changing their electronic environment, LM-Pd 
catalyst with liquid metal (LM) as an unusual modulator has been designed to 
realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for tumor inhibition. LM matrix can 
serve as a ""ligand"" to afford an electron-rich environment to stabilize the 
active Pd0 and promote nucleophilic turnover of the p-allylpalladium species to 
accelerate the uncaging process. Besides, the photothermal properties of LM can 
lead to the enhanced removal of tumor cells by photo-enhanced catalysis and 
photothermal effect. We believe that our work will broaden the application of LM 
and motivate the design of bioinspired bioorthogonal catalysts."
470,"Among histone deacetylases, HDAC6 is unusual in its cytoplasmic localization. 
Its inhibition leads to hyperacetylation of non-histone proteins, inhibiting 
cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis. Ricolinostat (ACY-1215) is a selective 
inhibitor of the histone deacetylase HDAC6 with proven efficacy in the treatment 
of malignant diseases, but anaemia is one of the most frequent side effects. We 
investigated here the underlying mechanisms of this erythroid toxicity. We first 
confirmed that HDAC6 was strongly expressed at both RNA and protein levels in 
CD34+ -cells-derived erythroid progenitors. ACY-1215 exposure on CD34+ -cells 
driven in vitro towards the erythroid lineage led to a decreased cell count, an 
increased apoptotic rate and a delayed erythroid differentiation with 
accumulation of weakly hemoglobinized immature erythroblasts. This was 
accompanied by drastic changes in the transcriptomic profile of primary cells as 
shown by RNAseq. In erythroid cells, ACY-1215 and shRNA-mediated HDAC6 knockdown 
inhibited the EPO-dependent JAK2 phosphorylation. Using acetylome, we identified 
14-3-3ζ, known to interact directly with the JAK2 negative regulator LNK, as a 
potential HDAC6 target in erythroid cells. We confirmed that 14-3-3ζ was 
hyperacetylated after ACY-1215 exposure, which decreased the 14-3-3ζ/LNK 
interaction while increased LNK ability to interact with JAK2. Thus, in addition 
to its previously described role in the enucleation of mouse fetal liver 
erythroblasts, we identified here a new mechanism of HDAC6-dependent control of 
erythropoiesis through 14-3-3ζ acetylation level, LNK availability and finally 
JAK2 activation in response to EPO, which is crucial downstream of EPO-R 
activation for human erythroid cell survival, proliferation and differentiation."
471,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: In patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding (ANVUGIB), the optimal timing of endoscopy is still a matter of 
dispute. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the 
clinical benefit of early endoscopy.
METHODS: A literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases was 
conducted to identify publications from inception to March 1, 2022. Eligible 
studies included observational cohort studies and randomized controlled trials 
that reported clinical outcomes of endoscopy in patients with ANVUGIB. ANVUGIB 
patients who underwent endoscopy within 24 hours of admission were considered to 
have had an early endoscopy. The primary outcome was the mortality rate in 
ANVUGIB patients who had early or nonearly endoscopy.
RESULTS: The final analysis included five randomized controlled studies (RCTs) 
and 20 observational studies from the 1,206 identified articles. The mortality 
rate was not significantly reduced among patients who received endoscopy 
performed within 24 hours, whether in cohort studies nor in RCTs. For subgroup 
analysis, a higher mortality rate was found only among patients who received 
very early endoscopy within 12 hours (odds ratio, 1.66; p<0.001, I2=0) in cohort 
studies. No significant difference in mortality rates was found among patients 
at high risk of bleeding who received early versus nonearly endoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: Early endoscopy within 24 hours does not appear to significantly 
reduce the mortality rates of patients with ANVUGIB. Further well-designed 
studies are warranted to address if very early endoscopy within 12 hours can 
provide a clinical benefit for patients at high risk of bleeding."
472,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To date, there is no prospective study that specifically 
investigated the efficacy of infliximab in intestinal Behçet's disease (BD). 
This study evaluated the efficacy of infliximab in patients with 
moderate-to-severe active intestinal BD that are refractory to conventional 
therapies.
METHODS: This phase 3, interventional, open-label, single-arm study evaluated 
clinical outcomes of infliximab treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe 
intestinal BD. The coprimary endpoints were clinical response, decrease in 
disease activity index for intestinal BD (DAIBD) score ≥20 from weeks 0 to 8 for 
the induction therapy and week 32 for the maintenance therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 33 patients entered the induction therapy and were treated 
with infliximab 5 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The mean DAIBD score 
changed from 90.8±40.1 at week 0 to 40.3±36.4 at week 8, with a significant mean 
change of 50.5±36.4 (95% confidence interval, 37.5 to 63.4; p<0.001). Thirty-one 
(93.9%) continued to receive 5 mg/kg infliximab every 8 weeks during the 
maintenance therapy. The mean change in the DAIBD score after the maintenance 
therapy was statistically significant (61.5±38.5; 95% confidence interval, 46.0 
to 77.1; p<0.001, from weeks 0 to 32). The proportion of patients who maintained 
a clinical response was 92.3% at week 32. No severe adverse reactions occurred 
during the induction and maintenance therapies.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided evidence that infliximab 5 mg/kg induction and 
maintenance therapies are efficacious and well-tolerated in patients with 
moderate-to-severe active intestinal BD. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 
NCT02505568)."
473,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Few studies have investigated the long-term outcomes of 
endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer (EGC) in very elderly patients. 
The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate treatment strategy and 
identify the risk factors for mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Patients with EGC who underwent endoscopic resection from 2006 to 2017 
were identified using National Health Insurance Data and divided into three age 
groups: very elderly (≥85 years), elderly (65 to 84 years), and non-elderly (≤64 
years). Their long- and short-term outcomes were compared in the three age 
groups, and the survival in the groups was compared with that in the control 
group, matched by age and sex. We also evaluated the risk factors for long- and 
short-term outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 8,426 patients were included in our study: 118 very elderly, 
4,583 elderly, and 3,725 non-elderly. The overall survival and cancer-specific 
survival rates were significantly lower in the very elderly group than in the 
elderly and the non-elderly groups. Congestive heart failure was negatively 
associated with cancer-specific survival. A significantly decreased risk for 
mortality was observed in all groups (p<0.001). The very elderly group had 
significantly higher readmission and mortality rates within 3 months of 
endoscopic resection than the non-elderly and elderly groups. Furthermore, the 
cerebrovascular disease was associated with mortality within 3 months after 
endoscopic resection.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic resection for EGC can be helpful for very elderly 
patients, and it may play a role in achieving overall survival comparable to 
that of the control group."
474,"BACKGROUND Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who require dialysis can 
develop a variety of skin conditions, such as pruritus, xerosis, skin 
infections, and autoimmune reactions. Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune 
bullous disorder with an increasing incidence. It can be caused by over 90 
medications, but levofloxacin-induced BP in hemodialysis patients has not yet 
been reported. This report is of a 27-year-old woman with ESRD on hemodialysis 
who developed BP after levofloxacin treatment. CASE REPORT A 27-year-old woman 
with hemodialysis after kidney transplantation failure was started with 
levofloxacin for suspected urinary tract infection 1.5 months prior to 
admission. Her urinary tract infection symptoms were improved after 3 weeks of 
levofloxacin treatment, but a serious rash developed, presenting with 
progressive bullous throughout the body and facial involvement. A thorough 
workup showed a remarkably elevated hemidesmosomal antigen, BP180 (116 RU/mL), 
and cutaneous indirect immunofluorescence on human salt-split skin substrate was 
positive for serum basement membrane zone IgG with an epidermal pattern. Skin 
biopsy direct immunofluorescence staining showed continuous linear C3 deposition 
along the basement membrane zone. Prednisone 60 mg daily was started with a 
taper schedule. She no longer had new skin rash during a follow-up of over 3 
months. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of 
levofloxacin-induced BP in a patient undergoing hemodialysis. This report 
highlights the importance of recognizing skin reactions associated with ESRD in 
dialysis patients, the correct diagnosis by biopsy and histopathology, and the 
correct and timely management."
475,"Unlike birds and mammals, many teleosts have homomorphic sex chromosomes and 
changes in the chromosome carrying the sex-determining locus, termed 
""turnovers"", are common. Recent turnovers allow studies of several interesting 
questions. One question is whether the new sex-determining regions evolve to 
become completely non-recombining, and if so, how and why. Another is to test 
the prediction that evolutionary changes that benefit one sex will accumulate in 
the newly sex-linked region. To study these questions, we analyzed the genome 
sequences of two seahorse species of the Syngnathidae, a fish group in which 
many species evolved a unique structure, the male brood pouch. We find that both 
seahorse species have XY sex chromosome systems, and their sex chromosome pairs 
are not homologs, implying that at least one turnover event has occurred. The 
Y-linked regions respectively occupy 63.9% and 95.1% of the entire chromosome of 
the two species, and do not exhibit extensive sequence divergence with their 
X-linked homologs. We find evidence for occasional recombination between the 
extant sex chromosomes that may account for their homomorphic pattern. We argue 
that these Y-linked regions did not evolve by recombination suppression after 
the turnover. Instead, it can be explained by the ancestral nature of low 
crossover rate at the corresponding chromosome location. With such an ancestral 
crossover landscape, a turnover can instantly create an extensive Y-linked 
region. Finally, we investigate the adaptive evolution of male pouch related 
genes after they become Y-linked in the seahorse."
476,"Neutrophil elastase (NE) plays a key role in chronic inflammation and acute

to overcome the interference, which was achieved by combining theoretical 
calculation and experimental that permits highly specific and sensitive 
detection of NE in cells and in vivo. The upregulated NE accumulation was 
specifically measured in inflammation by ratiometric photoacoustic and

more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes."
477,"OBJECTIVE: Receipt of follow-up care after Emergency Department (ED) visits for 
chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) - asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, diabetes, and/or hypertension - is 
crucial. We assessed Veterans' follow-up care knowledge, perceptions, and 
receipt of care after visits to Veterans Health Administration (VA) EDs for 
chronic ACSCs.
METHODS: Using explanatory sequential mixed methods, we qualitatively 
interviewed Veterans and manually reviewed ED notes, abstracting interviewees' 
documented follow-up needs, and care received, among Veterans having follow-up 
care needs after ACSC-related VA ED visits.
RESULTS: We interviewed and reviewed ED notes of 35 Veterans, 12-27 (mean 19) 
days after ED visits. Follow-up care was completely received/scheduled in 20, 
partially received/scheduled in eight, and not received in seven Veterans. Among 
those who received care, it was received within specified timeframes half the 
time. However, interviewees often did not recall these timeframes or reported 
them to be longer than specified. Veterans who had not yet received or scheduled 
follow-up care commonly did not recall follow-up care instructions, believed 
that they did not need this care since they were not currently having symptoms, 
or thought that such care would be difficult to obtain due to appointment 
unavailability and/or difficulties communicating with follow-up care providers. 
Among the 28 Veterans in whom all or some follow-up care had been 
received/scheduled, for 25 cases VA staff reached out to the Veteran, or the 
appointment was scheduled prior to or during the ED visit.
CONCLUSION: VA should prioritize implementing processes for EDs to efficiently 
communicate Veterans' needs to follow-up care providers, and systems for 
reaching out to Veterans and/or arranging for care prior to Veterans leaving the 
ED. VA should also enhance practices using multi-modal approaches for educating 
Veterans about recommended ED follow-up care and improve mechanisms for Veterans 
to communicate with follow-up care providers."
478,"As a clinical emergency with a high mortality rate, the treatment of acute liver 
failure has been paid attention to by society. At present, liver transplantation 
is the most effective treatment for acute liver failure, but there is still an 
insufficient supply of liver sources and a poor prognosis. In view of the 
current therapeutic development of this disease, more researchers have turned 
their attention to the research of drugs related to the NF-κB pathway. The NF-κB 
canonical pathway has been proven to play a role in a variety of diseases, 
regulating inflammation, apoptosis, and other physiological processes. More and 
more evidence shows that the NF-κB canonical pathway regulates the pathogenesis 
of acute liver failure. In this review, we will summarize the regulation process 
of the NF-κB canonical pathway on acute liver failure, and develop a new way to 
treat acute liver failure by targeting the components of the pathway."
479,"Fibrosing mediastinitis is caused by a proliferation of fibrous tissue in the 
mediastinum with encasement of mediastinal viscera and compression of 
mediastinal bronchovascular structures. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) may occur as 
a severe complication of the disease. Herein, we report a patient diagnosed with 
fibrosing mediastinitis and pulmonary hypertension, whose imaging tests showed 
obstruction of right pulmonary artery and veins."
480,"OBJECTIVES: When primary treatment has been inadequate, nivolumab and axitinib 
are often used as a secondary treatments for patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC). However, there have been few reports comparing the efficacy 
and safety of these drugs.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 58 patients treated with nivolumab and 
57 patients treated with axitinib as secondary treatment between April 2013 and 
December 2019. We then assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of the 
treatments in both groups.
RESULTS: The most common primary therapy was sunitinib (61.7%). Both nivolumab 
and axitinib groups showed no significant differences in terms of the objective 
response rate and disease control rate (p = 0.280 and p = 0.518, respectively). 
Importantly, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) seemed to 
be similar in patients treated with nivolumab and axitinib (p = 0.527 and 
p = 0.266, respectively), irrespective of the objective response to primary 
therapy. Furthermore, a Cox proportional hazards model showed that pretreatment 
Karnofsky Performance Status was significantly associated with PFS and OS. 
Although the incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the 
patients treated with axitinib, there was no significant difference in time to 
treatment failure between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab and axitinib showed similar clinical benefits as 
secondary treatment in patients with mRCC; thus, they should be an option in 
sequential therapy following treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
Future studies and feasible therapeutic biomarkers would help predict the 
clinical response to TKIs or immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with mRCC."
481,"OBJECTIVES: Chronic periodontal infections may predispose to cardiovascular 
disease. Since tooth loss may be due to periodontitis it is assumed that tooth 
loss can also predisposes cardiovascular disease. The aim was to investigate the 
possible relationship between the severity of the clinical picture of 
periodontitis and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: We evaluated the association between clinical periodontal parameters, 
tooth loss and cardiovascular incident. A total of 100 subjects (50 subjects 
diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and 50 in control group without 
cardiovascular disease) underwent a dental examination. Tooth loss in all 
participants was caused only as a consequence of periodontitis. In addition to 
periodontal status, conventional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases 
(hypertension, smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes) were measured, 
too.
RESULTS: Periodontal status was worse in patients in the group with 
cardiovascular disease compared to the group without cardiovascular disease. A 
significant association was observed between tooth loss levels and 
cardiovascular disease. In the group of patients who had cardiovascular disease 
tooth loss was more than 50%. In the group of patients without cardiovascular 
disease tooth loss was about 20% of the total number of teeth. A significant 
association was observed between tooth loss levels and cardiovascular disease 
prevalence.
CONCLUSION: This study presents relationship between number of teeth and 
cardiovascular disease, indicating a link between oral health and cardiovascular 
disease."
482,"The rapid emergence of various drug resistance and unfavourable aliphatic 
medication side effects endangers people's health. Phytocompounds with 
antibacterial activity and less harmful effects are known to be present in 
medicinal plants. Alkaloids from Eclipta alba were tested for their in vitro 
antibacterial capabilities and in silico docking studies against pathogenic 
bacteria and their target proteins in the current investigation. The alkaloid 
compounds verazine, ecliptine, 4-hydroxyverazine, 20-Epi-4beta-hydroxyverazine 
and hydroxyverazine were subjected to molecular docking studies to determine the 
method of binding as well as potential interactions and the docking score. The 
in vitro antibacterial activity of verazine alkaloid was assessed against two 
gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria. Verazine alkaloid has the best 
inhibitory ability against DNA gyrase of E. coli (ΔG= -8.44 kcal/mol) and 
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of S. aureus (ΔG= -10.04 kcal/mol), according to 
docking studies. Verazine shown substantial in vitro antibacterial activity in 
this investigation against all test bacteria, with MIC and MBC values of 31.25 
and 62.50 µg/mL for S. aureus and 15.63 and 31.25 µg/mL for B. cereus, 
respectively. The results of this work highlighted the value of unique alkaloid 
compounds from E. alba, which may offer effective antibacterial agents and DNA 
gyrase, DHFR inhibitors due to their novel structural properties capable of 
combating antimicrobial resistance. These findings call for more investigation 
into the compounds' function as antibacterial agents, as well as their 
unique-binding locations and mechanisms."
483,"BACKGROUND: Three doses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) messenger RNA 
(mRNA) vaccines produce robust antibody responses, but data are limited among 
individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. From a cohort of health care 
personnel (75.5%), first responders (4.6%), and other frontline workers (19.8%) 
in 6 US states, we longitudinally assessed antibody waning after dose-2, and 
response to dose-3, according to SARS-CoV-2 infection history.
METHODS: Participants submitted sera every three months, after SARS-CoV-2 
infection, and after each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Sera were tested for antibodies 
and reported quantitatively as area under the serial dilution curve (AUC). 
Changes in the AUC values over time were compared as fold-changes using a linear 
mixed model.
RESULTS: Analysis included 388 participants who received dose-3 by November 
2021. Three comparison groups: (1) vaccine only with no known prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection (n = 224); (2) infection prior to dose-1 (n = 123); and (3) infection 
after dose 2 and before dose-3 (n = 41). The interval from dose 2 and dose 3 was 
approximately 8-months. After dose-3, antibody levels rose 2.5-fold 
(95%CI = 2.2-3.0) in group 2, and 2.9-fold (95%CI = 2.6-3.3) in group 1. Those 
infected within 90 days before dose-3 (and median 233 days (IQR = 213-246) after 
dose-2) did not increase significantly after dose-3.
CONCLUSIONS: A third dose of mRNA vaccine typically elicited a robust humoral 
immune response among those with primary vaccination regardless of SARS-CoV-2 
infection >3 months prior to boosting. Those with infection < 3 months prior to 
boosting did not have a significant increase in antibody concentrations in 
response to a booster."
484,"The major autoantigens for pemphigus are desmogleins (Dsgs), cell-cell adhesive 
structure proteins, one of the desmosomal cadherins. Recent progress in 
molecular biology has revealed that IgG autoantibodies of classical pemphigus 
react with Dsg1 or Dsg3. Desmocollins (Dscs) also belong to the cadherin 
supergene family that provides structure to the desmosomes and play an important 
role in cell-to-cell adhesion. In addition to the presence of four desmosomal 
Dsg isoforms, i.e. Dsg1-4, Dsc1, 2 and 3, all of which are derived from 
different genes, Dsc1 has been previously identified as the target antigen of 
IgA autoantibodies in the subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD)-type of 
intercellular IgA dermatosis. In addition to the IgA anti-Dsc1 autoantiboides, 
the presence of IgG anti-Dsc autoantibodies is described in patients of some 
autoimmune bullous diseases. In particular, the current pemphigus detecting 
autoantibodies to Dscs has shown a tendency in atypical variants of pemphigus. 
Therefore, autoantibodies against Dscs alone may cause detachment of cell-cell 
adhesion in the epidermis in some pemphigus. However, except for the findings of 
a few in vitro and in vivo studies, there is currently no clear evidence for the 
pathogenicity of anti-Dsc autoantibodies in pemphigus, whereas significance of 
anti-Dsg autoantibodies is well established. This article describes the 
structure and function of the Dscs, and explores the evidence regarding the 
pathogenic role of anti-Dsc autoantibodies in pemphigus."
485,"Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (BSLE) is a rare blistering disease in 
patients with SLE. BSLE is a heterogenous disease caused by autoantibodies to 
the basement membrane, mainly type VII collagen. The pathogenesis of the 
development of autoantibodies in BSLE remains unknown. We report a case of SLE 
taking dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) who developed tense blister 
lesions after administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Initial erythematous lesion 
before administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine had not shown IgG deposition at 
basement membrane both direct and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). However, 
the result of those examinations became positive after the administration of 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Furthermore, IIF test results using NaCl split skin had 
shown positive against epidermal side. These observations suggest that 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination triggered production of autoantibodies that cause bullous 
SLE. The present case fulfills the diagnostic criteria for both BSLE and 
DPP4i-associated bullous pemphigoid. Skin lesions were cleared after withdrawal 
of DPP4i. Therefore, physicians should ask patients who develop blisters after 
the vaccination whether they are taking DPP4i."
486,"BACKGROUND: Tumor size and consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) are crucial for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis. However, the optimal CTR cutoff 
remains unclear. Whether tumor size and CTR are independent prognostic factors 
for part-solid NSCLC is under debate. Here, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic 
impacts of CTR and tumor size on NSCLC, especially on part-solid NSCLC.
METHODS: We reviewed 1366 clinical T1 NSCLC patients who underwent surgical 
treatment. Log-rank test and Cox regression analyses were adopted for prognostic 
evaluation. The ""surv_cutpoint"" function was used to identify the optimal CTR 
and tumor size cutoff values.
RESULTS: There were 416, 510, and 440 subjects with pure ground-glass opacity 
(pGGO), part-solid, and pure solid nodules. The 5-year overall survival 
(disease-free survival) for patients with pGGO, part-solid, and pure solid 
nodules were 99.5% (99.5%), 97.3% (95.8%), and 90.4% (78.9%), respectively. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that CTR was an independent 
prognostic factor for the whole patients, and the optimal CTR cutoff was 0.99. 
However, for part-solid NSCLC, CTR was not independently associated with 
survival, even if categorized by the optimal cutoffs. The predicted optimal 
cutoffs of total tumor size and solid component size were 2.4 and 1.4 cm for 
part-solid NSCLC. Total tumor size (HR = 6.21, 95% CI: 1.58-24.34, p = 0.009) 
and solid component size (HR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.04-5.92, p = 0.045) grouped by 
the cutoffs were significantly associated with part-solid NSCLC prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: CTR was an independent prognostic factor for the whole NSCLC, but 
not for the part-solid NSCLC. Tumor size was still meaningful for part-solid 
NSCLC."
487,"OBJECTIVES: Narrative medicine promotes the effective practice of medicine by 
requiring clinicians to listen to, reflect on, and manage not only the 
physiology of disease but also patient stories. The Florida International 
University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine offers a narrative medicine 
elective to fourth-year students who participate in reading, writing, and 
discussion activities that focus on processing their medical school experiences. 
This study evaluated the potential roles of this course in promoting strategies 
for personal well-being and improved patient care.
METHODS: Students completed an anonymous, optional, postcourse survey consisting 
of Likert-type and short-answer questions. The Likert-type questions assessed 
students' perceived impact of the curriculum on their knowledge of narrative 
medicine, likelihood to write about patients in the future, and their 
understanding of their own patient care experiences. The short-answer questions 
asked why students took the course and how they would apply their learning to 
patient care and their own well-being. These responses were analyzed separately 
by two coders through an inductive approach that grouped responses into themes, 
which were then agreed upon through an iterative process.
RESULTS: All of the students ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that the course 
encouraged them to write, reflect, and share their experiences. A common theme 
across short-answer responses was a desire to write about, share, and reflect on 
experiences, as well as to develop skills regarding demonstrating empathy, 
processing emotions, and advocating for patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Students reported that the narrative medicine elective taught them 
strategies for improving patient care and personal well-being, which they 
planned to continue to practice in the future. These findings show how the 
practice of narrative medicine during medical school may provide opportunities 
to promote reflection and resilience."
488,"OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common in obstructive sleep apnea 
syndrome (OSAS). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of PH on kidney 
functions in patients with OSAS.
METHODS: The data of patients who were diagnosed as having OSAS after referral 
to the sleep center in the Gaziantep University Medical Faculty between January 
2005 and June 2017 were evaluated. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was 
calculated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 
equation. Renal functions of the subjects who had data after 5 years were 
included for long-term analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 2152 patients with OSAS (n = 1540), PH (n = 49), OSAS and PH 
coexistence (n = 359), and the control group (n = 204) were included in the 
study. Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was 44.51 ± 23.73 in the PH group; it 
was 37.1 ± 13.14 in the group with OSAS + PH (P = 0.001) Urea and uric acid were 
found to be higher in the association of OSAS + PH. CKD-EPI was lower in the 
presence of PH or OSAS + PH than in the presence of OSAS. PH was present in 
16.06% of males and 25.10% of females (P = 0.000), and PAP was detected as 35.80 
± 13.23 and 40.96 ± 16.65, respectively (P = 0.001). PH was present in 15.99% of 
males and 25.84% of females with OSAS (P = 0.000). The PAP of males with OSAS 
was 36.03 ± 13.46, and the PAP of females was 38.68 ± 12.55 (P = 0062). Urea, 
creatinine, and uric acid were higher and CKD-EPI was lower in male subjects in 
the presence of OSAS and PH, whereas the same scenario also was present in the 
presence of PH alone in female subjects. Long-term comparisons (n = 343) 
revealed significant decreases in the CKD-EPI in those with OSAS and OSAS + PH 
and these decrease were more pronounced in the presence of OSAS and PH. The 
regression analysis revealed that female patients had lower CKD-EPI in the 
presence of PH, although the presence of PH had no effect on CKD-EPI in males.
CONCLUSIONS: PH is a risk factor for the deterioration of renal function in OSAS 
and more prominent in the long term."
489,"OBJECTIVES: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 
increased rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related hospitalizations 
and deaths in Black and Hispanic individuals. One contributing factor to this 
may be a difference in access to treatment. We thus sought to compare the 
outcomes of Black, non-Hispanic patients and Hispanic patients with White, 
non-Hispanic individuals using a group of patients with COVID-19 who received 
casirivimab/imdevimab.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data from a previously published 
retrospective chart review of patients who received casirivimab/imdevimab for 
COVID-19 between December 9, 2020 and August 20, 2021, when they were treated at 
one of three facilities within a single hospital system. We compared the 
baseline characteristics (including age, sex, body mass index, duration of 
symptoms, and vaccination status) and outcomes of Black, non-Hispanic patients 
and Hispanic patients with those of White, non-Hispanic patients. Our primary 
outcome was the odds of a return visit to the emergency department (ED) within 
28 days of treatment as assessed by multivariate logistic regression. We also 
assessed the rates of return visits to the ED for symptoms caused by COVID-19, 
hospitalizations, and hospitalizations from hypoxia.
RESULTS: In total, 1318 patients received casirivimab/imdevimab for COVID-19 at 
the three study facilities. Of these, 410 (31.1%) identified themselves as White 
and non-Hispanic, 88 (6.7%) as Black and non-Hispanic, and 736 (55.8%) as 
Hispanic. Vaccination rates at the time of treatment were as follows: Black, 
non-Hispanic 10.2%, Hispanic 13.6%, and White, non-Hispanic 21.5%. On 
multivariate analysis, the odds of return visits to the ED within 28 days were 
higher for Black, non-Hispanic patients and Hispanic patients as compared with 
White, non-Hispanic patients, with odds ratios of 2.8 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.4-5.5, P = 0.003) and of 2.3 (95% CI 1.5-3.6, P = 0.0002), respectively. 
For hospitalizations caused by hypoxia within 28 days of treatment, the adjusted 
odds ratio for Black, non-Hispanic patients was 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-10.5, P = 0.03) 
as compared with White, non-Hispanic patients. There were no other statistically 
significant differences among groups in regard to subsequent hospitalizations 
within 28 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Black, non-Hispanic patients and Hispanic patients are more likely 
to make a return visit to the ED within 28 days after casirivimab/imdevimab 
treatment for COVID-19 as compared with White, non-Hispanic patients. This holds 
true even when adjusting for higher vaccination rates among White, non-Hispanic 
individuals."
490,"Cutaneous lichen planus is a highly pruritic dermatosis with an unmet need in 
its management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effect and 
tolerance of high doses of clobetasol propionate 0.05% in cutaneous lichen 
planus. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study from 2017 to 
2021. All adults treated with high-dose (>5 g/day) clobetasol propionate 0.05% 
for cutaneous lichen planus were included. Patients with less than 10% affected 
body surface area at initial presentation or who received concomitant systemic 
therapy were excluded. The primary endpoint was the rate of complete remission 
by week 16. Secondary endpoints included maximum daily and median cumulative 
doses, reduction in pruritus and occurrence of adverse events. Fifty-seven 
patients, 60% female, with a mean age of 48 years (min-max,18-83) were included. 
Cutaneous lichen planus had been present for a median duration of 2 months at 
initial presentation (min-max, 1-4) and involved a median body surface area of 
27%. Pruritus was reported by 55/57 (96%) patients. At week 16, 41/57 (72%) 
patients had achieved complete remission without treatment modification, among 
whom 25/41 (61%) had achieved it at week 6. The median daily and cumulative 
doses were, respectively, 20 g/day (IQR, 10-20) and 560 g (IQR, 320-925). Three 
patients experienced mild adverse events. No statistical association was 
demonstrated between the duration of the disease before treatment initiation and 
clinical response. In conclusion, high-dose clobetasol propionate 0.05% seems to 
be an effective, well-tolerated, and easy-to-implement treatment for cutaneous 
lichen planus."
491,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system plays a significant role via the 
regulation of the immune system and contributes to the progression and 
protection of many diseases. In our previous study, several HLA-DRB1 alleles 
were found to have a susceptible or protective role towards infection and 
neuroinvasion of West Nile Virus (WNV) in the Greek population. As expected, the 
majority of polymorphic positions are located in the peptide-binding region of 
the molecule. In the present work, the structure of these alleles was studied in 
silico, in order to examine the effect of polymorphism in the conformation of 
DRB1 proteins, with the aspect of WNV association. More specifically, molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations were used for structural prediction of 23 available 
alleles. These modeled alleles were evaluated using Root Mean Square Deviation 
(RMSD) and Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis. Low RMSD values 
indicate that different alleles have similar structures. Also, low fluctuation 
was observed in the peptide-binding region between alleles with the higher and 
the lowest RMSD values. These findings indicate that probably variable residues 
do not affect the behavior of DRB1 alleles in WNV disease, by causing structural 
differences between them. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

492,"AIM: The progression of atherosclerosis can lead to the occurrence of multiple 
cardiovascular diseases (coronary heart disease, etc.). E prostanoid receptor-3 
(EP3) is known to participate in the progression of atherosclerosis. This study 
aimed to investigate the mechanism by which EP3 modulates the development of 
atherosclerosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: ApoE-/- mice were used to construct in vivo model of 
atherosclerosis. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were stimulated with 
oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to construct in vitro model of 
atherosclerosis. mRNA expressions were assessed by qRT-PCR, and western blot was 
applied to assess the protein levels. CCK-8 assay was applied to assess the cell 
viability. The inflammatory cytokines levels were assessed by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry was applied to assess cell apoptosis. In 
vivo experiment was constructed to investigate the impact of EP3 in 
atherosclerosis development. L-798106 (EP3 inhibitor) significantly inhibited 
the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in atherosclerosis in vivo. EP3 
inhibitor (L-798106) significantly reversed ox-LDL-caused HASMCs injury via 
inhibiting the apoptosis and inflammatory responses (P < 0.05). The levels of 
interleukin-17 (IL-17) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in HASMCs 
were elevated by ox-LDL, whereas L-798106 or knockdown of cyclic AMP (cAMP) 
response element-binding protein (CREB) notably restored this phenomenon 
(P < 0.05). EP3 overexpression further aggravated ox-LDL-induced inflammation in 
HASMCs, and EP3 up-regulated the levels of IL-17 and ICAM-1 in ox-LDL-treated 
HASMCs (P < 0.05). EP3 up-regulation promoted the inflammatory responses in 
ox-LDL-treated HASMCs through mediation of cAMP/protein kinase A 
(PKA)/CREB/IL-17/ICAM-1 axis (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: EP3 inhibitor alleviates ox-LDL-induced HASMC inflammation via 
mediation of cAMP/PKA/CREB/IL-17/ICAM-1 axis. Our study might shed new lights on 
discovering novel strategies against atherosclerosis."
493,"Bronchiolar adenoma (BA)/ciliated muconodular papillary tumor (CMPT) is defined 
as a benign tumor composed of epithelial and basal cells. Recently, some cases

an extremely rare case of a 68-year-old woman with a CMPT accompanied by 
adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). BA/CMPT existed inside the AIS. The BA/CMPT 
component did not show any driver mutations; however, the AIS component had an

494,"BACKGROUND: The Harambee study is a cluster randomized trial in Western Kenya 
that tests the effect, mechanisms, and cost-effectiveness of integrating 
community-based HIV and non-communicable disease care within microfinance groups 
on chronic disease treatment outcomes. This paper documents the stages of our 
feasibility study conducted in preparation for the Harambee trial, which include 
(1) characterizing the target population and gauging recruitment capacity, (2) 
determining community acceptability of the integrated intervention and study 
procedures, and (3) identifying key implementation considerations prior to study 
start.
METHODS: Feasibility research took place between November 2019 and February 2020 
in Western Kenya. Mixed methods data collection included surveys administered to 
115 leaders of 105 community-based microfinance groups, 7 in-person meetings and 
two workshops with stakeholders from multiple sectors of the health system, and 
ascertainment of field notes and geographic coordinates for group meeting 
locations and HIV healthcare facilities. Quantitative survey data were analyzed 
using STATA IC/13. Longitude and latitude coordinates were mapped to county 
boundaries using Esri ArcMap. Qualitative data obtained from stakeholder 
meetings and field notes were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Of the 105 surveyed microfinance groups, 77 met eligibility criteria. 
Eligible groups had been in existence from 6 months to 18 years and had an 
average of 22 members. The majority (64%) of groups had at least one member who 
owned a smartphone. The definition of ""active"" membership and model of saving 
and lending differed across groups. Stakeholders perceived the community-based 
intervention and trial procedures to be acceptable given the minimal risks to 
participants and the potential to improve HIV treatment outcomes while 
facilitating care integration. Potential challenges identified by stakeholders 
included possible conflicts between the trial and existing community-based 
interventions, fear of group disintegration prior to trial end, clinicians' 
inability to draw blood for viral load testing in the community, and deviations 
from standard care protocols.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that it was feasible to recruit the number of 
microfinance groups necessary to ensure that our clinical trial was sufficient 
powered. Elicitation of stakeholder feedback confirmed that the planned 
intervention was largely acceptable and was critical to identifying challenges 
prior to implementation.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The original trial was prospectively registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04417127) on 4 June 2020."
495,"BACKGROUND: A preoperative-progesterone intervention increases disease-free 
survival in patients with breast cancer, with an unknown underlying mechanism. 
We elucidated the role of non-coding RNAs in response to progesterone in human 
breast cancer.
METHODS: Whole transcriptome sequencing dataset of 30 breast primary tumors (10 
tumors exposed to hydroxyprogesterone and 20 tumors as control) were re-analyzed 
to identify differentially expressed non-coding RNAs followed by real-time PCR 
analyses to validate the expression of candidates. Functional analyses were 
performed by genetic knockdown, biochemical, and cell-based assays.
RESULTS: We identified a significant downregulation in the expression of a long 
non-coding RNA, Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule antisense DSCAM-AS1, in 
response to progesterone treatment in breast cancer. The progesterone-induced 
expression of DSCAM-AS1 could be effectively blocked by the knockdown of 
progesterone receptor (PR) or treatment of cells with mifepristone 
(PR-antagonist). We further show that knockdown of DSCAM-AS1 mimics the effect 
of progesterone in impeding cell migration and invasion in PR-positive breast 
cancer cells, while its overexpression shows an opposite effect. Additionally, 
DSCAM-AS1 sponges the activity of miR-130a that regulates the expression of ESR1 
by binding to its 3'-UTR to mediate the effect of progesterone in breast cancer 
cells. Consistent with our findings, TCGA analysis suggests that high levels of 
miR-130a correlate with a tendency toward better overall survival in patients 
with breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a mechanism involving the 
DSCAM-AS1/miR-130a/ESR1 genomic axis through which progesterone impedes breast 
cancer cell invasion and migration. The findings highlight the utility of 
progesterone treatment in impeding metastasis and improving survival outcomes in 
patients with breast cancer."
496,"BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ42) neurotoxicity 
stems mostly from its soluble oligomeric aggregates. Studies of such aggregates 
have been hampered by the lack of oligomer-specific research tools and their 
intrinsic instability and heterogeneity. Here, we developed a monoclonal 
antibody with a unique oligomer-specific binding profile (ALZ-201) using 
oligomer-stabilising technology. Subsequently, we assessed the etiological 
relevance of the Aβ targeted by ALZ-201 on physiologically derived, toxic Aβ 
using extracts from post-mortem brains of AD patients and controls in primary 
mouse neuron cultures.
METHODS: Mice were immunised with stable oligomers derived from the Aβ42 peptide 
with A21C/A30C mutations (AβCC), and ALZ-201 was developed using hybridoma 
technology. Specificity for the oligomeric form of the Aβ42CC antigen and Aβ42 
was confirmed using ELISA, and non-reactivity against plaques by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). The antibody's potential for cross-protective 
activity against pathological Aβ was evaluated in brain tissue samples from 10 
individuals confirmed as AD (n=7) and non-AD (n=3) with IHC staining for Aβ and 
phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) aggregates. Brain extracts were prepared and 
immunodepleted using the positive control 4G8 antibody, ALZ-201 or an isotype 
control to ALZ-201. Fractions were biochemically characterised, and toxicity 
assays were performed in primary mouse neuronal cultures using automated 
high-content microscopy.
RESULTS: AD brain extracts proved to be more toxic than controls as demonstrated 
by neuronal loss and morphological determinants (e.g. synapse density and 
measures of neurite complexity). Immunodepletion using 4G8 reduced Aβ levels in 
both AD and control samples compared to ALZ-201 or the isotype control, which 
showed no significant difference. Importantly, despite the differential effect 
on the total Aβ content, the neuroprotective effects of 4G8 and ALZ-201 
immunodepletion were similar, whereas the isotype control showed no effect.
CONCLUSIONS: ALZ-201 depletes a toxic species in post-mortem AD brain extracts 
causing a positive physiological and protective impact on the integrity and 
morphology of mouse neurons. Its unique specificity indicates that a 
low-abundant, soluble Aβ42 oligomer may account for much of the neurotoxicity in 
AD. This critical attribute identifies the potential of ALZ-201 as a novel drug 
candidate for achieving a true, clinical therapeutic effect in AD."
497,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a commonly inherited heart disease. 
In addition, single coronary artery (SCA) is a rare congenital anomaly of the 
coronary arteries. And SCA concomitant with severe hypertrophic obstructive 
cardiomyopathy (HOCM) has seldom been reported in the literature. However, such 
cases have not been reported to be treated with the Morrow procedure.
CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we presented a case of a 64-year-old female diagnosed 
with a single left coronary artery with severe HOCM. The HOCM was treated with 
the Morrow procedure. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative 
day and was asymptomatic during the follow-up.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a single left 
coronary artery with severe HOCM treated with the Morrow procedure. In addition, 
myocardial protection by cardioplegia antegrade perfusion was safe for the 
patient with SCA and HOCM."
498,"BACKGROUND: We present this case of coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute 
kidney injury with rhabdomyolysis-with noteworthy renal biopsy findings 
demonstrating myoglobin cast nephropathy-to add to the limited literature on 
coronavirus disease 2019-related acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old Caucasian man presented to our hospital with 
3 weeks of malaise and decreased oral intake and several days of abnormal taste, 
poor appetite, decrease urine output, gastrointestinal symptoms, and myalgias, 
and was ultimately diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. His hospital course 
was complicated by acute kidney injury and, upon workup of his renal failure, 
was diagnosed with myoglobin cast nephropathy due to coronavirus disease 
2019-mediated rhabdomyolysis. Ultimately, his renal function improved following 
hydration back to his baseline 6 weeks after his initial diagnosis of 
coronavirus disease 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: Given our limited knowledge of manifestations of coronavirus 
disease 2019, it is important to have a more in-depth understanding of the 
spectrum of disease of coronavirus disease 2019, which can affect various organ 
systems, including the kidney, and the manifestations of end-organ damage 
associated with it. We present this case to highlight a rarely reported finding 
of myoglobin cast nephropathy due to coronavirus disease 2019-mediated 
rhabdomyolysis."
499,"PURPOSE: Angiogenesis is involved in many pathological and physiological 
processes and is mainly driven by hypoxia. Karyopherin subunit alpha 2 (KPNA2), 
a member of the nuclear transport protein family, was recently shown to be 
induced by hypoxia in various types of tumours, so we aimed to investigate the 
role and mechanism of KPNA2 in angiogenesis under hypoxia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After overexpression or knockdown of KPNA2 in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by adenovirus vector infection, the 
tube formation, proliferation and migration of HUVEC under hypoxia were detected 
by tubule formation assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining and 
Transwell assay, respectively. After overexpression or knockdown of KPNA2 in a 
murine hindlimb ischemia model by local injection of purified adenovirus vector 
into the gastrocnemius muscle, blood flow changes were examined with a laser 
Doppler system. Changes in KPNA2-binding proteins under hypoxia were detected by 
immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and co-immunoprecipitation 
(Co-IP). The effect of KPNA2 on signal transducer and activator of transcription 
3 (STAT3) was detected by Western blotting and quantitative RT‒PCR.
RESULTS: KPNA2 was upregulated in the HUVEC hypoxia model and murine hindlimb 
ischemia model. Overexpression of KPNA2 increased the proliferation, migration 
and tube formation of HUVEC under hypoxia, while knockdown of KPNA2 reduced the 
proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVEC. Overexpression of KPNA2 
promoted the restoration of blood flow in the murine hindlimb ischemia model, 
while knockout of KPNA2 inhibited the restoration of blood flow in the murine 
hindlimb ischemia model. Mechanistically, hypoxia promoted the binding of STAT3 
to KPNA2. Overexpression of KPNA2 promoted STAT3 phosphorylation and then 
upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 
2(ANGPT2), whereas knockdown of KPNA2 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and then 
downregulated VEGF and ANGPT2.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that hypoxia promotes the binding of STAT3 to 
KPNA2 and KPNA2 promotes angiogenesis under hypoxia by promoting the binding of 
STAT3 and JAK1 and regulating STAT3 phosphorylation."
500,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant radiotherapy (NRT) for resectable retroperitoneal 
sarcoma (RPS) has been shown to be systematically feasible. Whether NRT has 
equivalent or better clinical effects compared to surgery alone for RPS patients 
remains controversial.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, 
Embase, ASCO Abstracts, and Cochrane library databases for studies in humans 
with defined search terms. Articles were independently assessed by 2 reviewers, 
and only randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were included. The 
hazard ratios (HRs) of overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), 
and local recurrence (LR) were extracted from included studies. Heterogeneity 
among study-specific HRs was assessed by the Q statistic and I2 statistic. 
Overall HR was assessed by random-effects or fixed-effects models. Publication 
bias was tested by Begg's tests, and the quality of each study was assessed with 
the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: A total of 12 eligible studies with 7778 resectable RPS patients were 
finally included in this study. The pooled analysis revealed the distinct 
advantages of NRT as compared to surgery alone, including longer OS (HR = 0.81, 
P < 0.001), longer RFS (HR = 0.58, P = 0.04), and lower LR (HR = 0.70, 
P = 0.03). No evidence of publication bias was observed.
CONCLUSION: NRT is likely to be beneficial for resectable RPS patients in terms 
of OS and RFS. However, more multicenter clinical trials are needed to confirm 
these findings."
501,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease with genetic and 
environmental factors. Regional differences in risk factors are an important 
reason for the different incidences of CRC in different regions.
OBJECTIVE: The goal was to clarify the intestinal microbial composition and 
structure of CRC patients in different regions and construct CRC risk prediction 
models based on regional differences.
METHODS: A metagenomic dataset of 601 samples from 6 countries in the GMrepo and 
NCBI databases was collected. All whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data were 
annotated for species by MetaPhlAn2. We obtained the relative abundance of 
species composition at the species level and genus level. The MicrobiotaProcess 
package was used to visualize species composition and PCA. LEfSe analysis was 
used to analyze the differences in the datasets in each region. Spearman 
correlation analysis was performed for CRC differential species. Finally, the 
CRC risk prediction model was constructed and verified in each regional dataset.
RESULTS: The composition of the intestinal bacterial community varied in 
different regions. Differential intestinal bacteria of CRC in different regions 
are inconsistent. There was a common diversity of bacteria in all six countries, 
such as Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Fusobacterium nucleatum at the species 
level. Peptostreptococcus stomatis (species level) and Peptostreptococcus (genus 
level) are important CRC-related bacteria that are related to other bacteria in 
different regions. Region has little influence on the accuracy of the CRC risk 
prediction model. Peptostreptococcus stomatis is an important variable in CRC 
risk prediction models in all regions.
CONCLUSION: Peptostreptococcus stomatis is a common high-risk pathogen of CRC 
worldwide, and it is an important variable in CRC risk prediction models in all 
regions. However, regional differences in intestinal bacteria had no significant 
impact on the accuracy of the CRC risk prediction model."
502,"The standard therapies in lymphoma have predominantly focused on targeting tumor 
cells with less of a focus on the tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a 
critical role in favoring tumor growth and survival. Such an approach may result 
in increasingly refractory disease with progressively reduced responses to 
subsequent treatments. To overcome this hurdle, targeting the TME has emerged as 
a new therapeutic strategy. The TME consists of T and B lymphocytes, 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and other components. Understanding the 
TME can lead to a comprehensive approach to managing lymphoma, resulting in 
therapeutic strategies that target not only cancer cells, but also the 
supportive environment and thereby ultimately improve survival of lymphoma 
patients. Here, we review the normal function of different components of the 
TME, the impact of their aberrant behavior in B cell lymphoma and the current 
TME-direct therapeutic avenues."
503,"BACKGROUND: Osimertinib is associated with a relatively high frequency of 
drug-induced interstitial lung disease (D-ILD), and transient asymptomatic 
pulmonary opacities (TAPO) have been reported to occur during osimertinib 
administration. The frequency of TAPO during first-line treatment and the pros 
and cons of osimertinib continuation is unknown.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective study. The purpose of this study 
was to research the frequency of TAPO and to evaluate osimertinib continuation 
in first-line therapy. We also evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) 
including subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: From August 2018 to December 2020, 133 patients were enrolled into the 
study. The median observation period was 23.2 months (0.3-48.3 months). Thirty 
patients (22.6%) experienced D-ILD events, including 16 patients (12.1%) with 
CTCAE grade 1, five patients (3.8%) with grade 2, and nine patients (6.7%) with 
grade 3 and above D-ILD. Among the patients with grade 1 D-ILD, 11 cases (8.3%) 
of TAPO were observed, and all patients succeeded in osimertinib continuation. 
The TAPO images were characterized by localized patchy opacities (73%). The 
median PFS was 22.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.8-28.7 months). 
Patients with TAPO had a significantly longer PFS than patients with non-TAPO 
D-ILD in the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that grade 1 D-ILD might include TAPO and that 
patients with TAPO might have good PFS. We need to consider the possibility of 
osimertinib continuation when lung opacities appear."
504,"INTRODUCTION: Identification of factors predicting prolonged hospitalization of 
patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) guides the planning, care and flow 
of patients in the COVID-19 Treatment Units (CTUs). We determined the length of 
hospital stay and factors associated with prolonged hospitalization among 
patients with COVID-19 at six CTUs in Uganda.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with 
COVID-19 between January and December 2021 in six CTUs in Uganda. We conducted 
generalized linear regression models of the binomial family with a log link and 
robust variance estimation to estimate risk ratios of selected exposure 
variables and prolonged hospitalization (defined as a hospital stay for 14 days 
or more). We also conducted negative binomial regression models with robust 
variance to estimate the rate ratios between selected exposures and 
hospitalization duration.
RESULTS: Data from 968 participants were analyzed. The median length of 
hospitalization was 5 (range: 1-89) days. A total of 136/968 (14.1%: 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 11.9-16.4%) patients had prolonged hospitalization. 
Hospitalization in a public facility (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) = 2.49, 95% CI: 
1.65-3.76), critical COVID-19 severity scores (ARR = 3.24: 95% CI: 1.01-10.42), 
and malaria co-infection (adjusted incident rate ratio (AIRR) = 0.67: 95% CI: 
0.55-0.83) were associated with prolonged hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: One out of seven COVID-19 patients had prolonged hospitalization. 
Healthcare providers in public health facilities should watch out for 
unnecessary hospitalization. We encourage screening for possible co-morbidities 
such as malaria among patients admitted for COVID-19."
505,"BACKGROUND: For decades, the research community has called for participant 
information sheets/consent forms (PICFs) to be improved. Recommendations include 
simplifying content, reducing length, presenting information in layers and using 
multimedia. However, there are relatively few studies that have evaluated health 
consumers' (patients/carers) perspectives on the type and organisation of 
information, and the level of detail to be included in a PICF to optimise an 
informed decision to enter a trial. We aimed to elicit consumers' views on a 
layered approach to consent that provides the key information for 
decision-making in a short PICF (layer 1) with additional optional information 
that is accessed separately (layer 2). We also elicited consumers' views on the 
optimal content and layout of the layered consent materials for a large and 
complex Bayesian adaptive platform trial (the SNAP trial).
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative multicentre study (4 focus groups and 2 
semi-structured interviews) involving adolescent and adult survivors of 
Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (22) and their carers (2). Interview 
transcripts were examined using inductive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Consumers supported a layered approach to consent. The primary theme 
that emerged was the value of agency; the ability to exert some control over the 
amount of information read before the consent form is signed. Three other themes 
emerged; the need to prioritise participants' information needs; the importance 
of health literacy; the importance of information about a trial's benefits (over 
its risks) for decision-making and the interplay between the two.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that consumers may challenge the 
one-size-fits-all approach currently applied to the development of PICFs in 
countries like Australia. Consumers supported a layered approach to consent that 
offers choice in the amount of information to be read before deciding whether to 
enter a trial. A 3-page PICF was considered sufficient for decision-making for 
the SNAP trial, provided that further information was available and accessible."
506,"BACKGROUND: Bacteriophages (phages) are a promising anti-infective option for 
human disease. Major gaps remain in understanding their potential utility.
METHODS: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of a 
single dose of intravenous phage in approximately 72 clinically stable adult 
cystic fibrosis volunteers recruited from up to 20 US sites with Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa airway colonization. The single dose of phage consists of a mixture 
of four anti-pseudomonal phages. Six sentinel participants will be sequentially 
enrolled with dose escalation of the phage mixture by one log10 beginning with 4 
× 107 plaque-forming units in an unblinded stage 1. If no serious adverse events 
related to the study product are identified, the trial will proceed to a 
double-blinded stage 2. In stage 2a, 32 participants will be randomly assigned 
to one of three phage dosages or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 allocation. An interim 
analysis will be performed to determine the phage dosage with the most favorable 
safety and microbiological activity profile to inform phage dosing in stage 2b. 
During stage 2b, up to 32 additional volunteers will be randomized 1:1 to the 
phage or placebo arm. Primary outcomes include (1) the number of grade 2 or 
higher treatment-emergent adverse events, (2) change in log10 P. aeruginosa 
total colony counts in sputum, and (3) the probability of a randomly selected 
subject having a more favorable outcome ranking if assigned to receive phage 
therapy versus placebo. Exploratory outcomes include (1) sputum and serum phage 
pharmacokinetics, (2) the impact of phage on lung function, (3) the proportion 
of P. aeruginosa isolates susceptible to the phage mixture before and after 
study product administration, and (4) changes in quality of life.
DISCUSSION: This trial will investigate the activity of phages in reducing P. 
aeruginosa colony counts and provide insights into the safety profile of phage 
therapy.

507,"BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of glial cell communication is involved in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathogenesis, and the recent study reported that astrocytic 
secreted interleukin-3 (IL-3) participated in astrocyte-microglia crosstalk and 
restricted AD pathology in mice, but the effect of IL-3 on the pathological 
progression of AD in human is still unclear.
METHODS: A total of 311 participants with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-3, 
soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), and AD 
biomarkers were included from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). We assessed the associations of IL-3 with sTREM2 and AD biomarkers at 
baseline, and with cognitive change in longitudinal study. The mediation models 
were used to explore the potential mechanism of how IL-3 affects AD pathology.
RESULTS: We found that CSF IL-3 was significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 and 
CSF AD core biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau, and t-tau) at baseline, and was also 
markedly related to cognitive decline in longitudinal analysis. Moreover, 
mediation analysis revealed that CSF IL-3 modulated the level of CSF sTREM2 and 
contributed to tau pathology (as measured by CSF p-tau/t-tau) and subsequent 
cognitive decline. In addition, Aβ pathology (as measured by CSF Aβ42) affected 
the development of tau pathology partly by modifying the levels of CSF IL-3 and 
CSF sTREM2. Furthermore, the effect of Aβ pathology on cognitive decline was 
partially mediated by the pathway from CSF IL-3 and CSF sTREM2 to tau pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence to suggest that IL-3 is linked to 
sTREM2 and mediates the correlation between Aβ pathology to tau pathology. It 
indicates that IL-3 may be a major factor in the spreading from Aβ pathology to 
tau pathology to cognitive impairment."
508,"BACKGROUND: Population mobility is a demonstrated barrier to reducing HIV 
incidence. A clear understanding of social networks and their influence on 
mobility among women in the fishing communities of Lake Victoria may contribute 
to tailoring effective interventions that suit the needs of these mobile women.
METHODS: A cross-sectional qualitative methods study was conducted to understand 
mobility patterns among women resident and or working in fishing communities of 
Lake Victoria in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The study was conducted in six 
fishing communities from March 2018 to June 2019. The communities were 
purposively selected, based on population size (1000 people or more) and HIV 
prevalence of > 15% among women aged 18 years or older who had lived in the 
fishing community for at least six months. In-depth interviews were conducted 
with 24 key informants and 72 women from the sites in the three countries. 
Questions focused on women's social networks and other factors that fuelled or 
facilitated women's mobility as well as challenges they faced due to mobility. 
Data analysis followed a thematic framework approach.
RESULTS: Different social groupings/networks existed among women in the fishing 
communities of Lake Victoria. These included female sex workers, women fish 
processors/traders, women bar workers/owners, restaurant workers, and family 
networks. Networks encouraged mobility, supporting finding work opportunities, 
but also increased sexual risks through partner changes. The benefits of 
networks included information sharing, financial support, and group protection, 
especially against violence.
CONCLUSION: Social networks and groupings among women in the fishing communities 
of Lake Victoria could be useful in tailoring HIV prevention and HIV care 
interventions to suit the needs of these highly mobile populations."
509,"BACKGROUND: Osteogenesis of lateral window sinus elevation surgery is the key to 
placement of the subsequent implant, excessive collapse of the sub-antral space 
may adversely affect long-term stability of implants. At present, few studies 
focus on the influence of the contact area of the sub-antral space on 
osteogenesis. This study evaluated whether the change in the contact area of the 
sub-antral space with maxillary sinus bone and the Schneiderian membrane can 
affect osteogenesis.
METHODS: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were collected of patients 
requiring maxillary sinus floor elevation (residual bone height < 6 mm) for 
standard-length implant placement before surgery, after surgery, and at 6-month 
follow-up visits. The postoperative sub-antral space volume (V1) and surface 
area (S1), and the remaining volume after six months of healing (V2) were 
measured. Then, the contact area of sub-antral space with maxillary sinus bone 
(Sbc) and the Schneiderian membrane (Smc), the absorbed volume during healing 
(Va), and the percentage of remaining volume (V2%) and absorbed volume (Va%) 
were calculated. The correlation between anatomical parameters was analyzed 
using multiple linear regression.
RESULTS: A total of 62 maxillary sinuses from 56 patients were augmented, of 
which 57 were considered for the final analysis (5 withdrew due to perforation). 
Multiple linear regression results demonstrated that Sbc was significantly 
positively correlated with Va (β coefficient = 0.141, p < 0.01) without 
correlation between Smc and Va (β coefficient =  - 0.046, p = 0.470). There was 
a positive correlation between Sbc and V2% (β coefficient = 2.269, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the size of the Sbc in lateral window 
sinus elevation surgery affected osteogenesis after six months of healing. 
Clinicians should assess the sinus contour type preoperatively, then consider 
whether it is necessary to expand the range of the Schneiderian membrane 
elevation to avoid excessive collapse of the sub-antral space.

510,"BACKGROUND: Alterations to the gut microbiome have been linked to multiple 
chronic diseases. However, the drivers of such changes remain largely unknown. 
The oral cavity acts as a major route of exposure to exogenous factors including 
pathogens, and processes therein may affect the communities in the subsequent 
compartments of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we perform strain-resolved, 
integrated meta-genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of paired saliva 
and stool samples collected from 35 individuals from eight families with 
multiple cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
RESULTS: We identified distinct oral microbiota mostly reflecting competition 
between streptococcal species. More specifically, we found a decreased abundance 
of the commensal Streptococcus salivarius in the oral cavity of T1DM 
individuals, which is linked to its apparent competition with the pathobiont 
Streptococcus mutans. The decrease in S. salivarius in the oral cavity was also 
associated with its decrease in the gut as well as higher abundances in 
facultative anaerobes including Enterobacteria. In addition, we found evidence 
of gut inflammation in T1DM as reflected in the expression profiles of the 
Enterobacteria as well as in the human gut proteome. Finally, we were able to 
follow transmitted strain-variants from the oral cavity to the gut at the 
individual omic levels, highlighting not only the transfer, but also the 
activity of the transmitted taxa along the gastrointestinal tract.
CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of the oral microbiome in the context of T1DM impact 
the microbial communities in the lower gut, in particular through the reduction 
of ""mouth-to-gut"" transfer of Streptococcus salivarius. Our results indicate 
that the observed oral-cavity-driven gut microbiome changes may contribute 
towards the inflammatory processes involved in T1DM. Through the integration of 
multi-omic analyses, we resolve strain-variant ""mouth-to-gut"" transfer in a 
disease context. Video Abstract."
511,"BACKGROUND: Ovarian insufficiency frequently renders postmenopausal women 
susceptible to osteoporosis and dyslipidaemia. Postmenopausal transplant women 
are at a higher risk developing osteoporosis and dyslipidaemia due to the 
concomitant application of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants after solid 
organ transplantation. Thus, this study aimed to explore the feasibility of 
ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) as an alternative to Hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT) for postmenopausal women with solid organ transplant needs.
RESULTS: Sixty mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation, 
ovariectomised (OVX group), ovariectomy plus oestrogen (E2 group), and 
ovariectomy plus OTT (OTT group). The inhibin levels in the OTT group were 
increased and the follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were 
suppressed to normal levels, which could not be achieved in the E2 group. The 
femoral bone mineral density in the OTT group was significantly increased than 
the E2 group (P < 0.05), and the probability of fracture was reduced by 1.4-2.6 
times. Additionally, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were higher 
in the OTT group than in the E2 group and the triglyceride levels were lower in 
the OTT group than in the E2 group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: OTT not only achieves certain endocrine effects by participating in 
the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian feedback control loop, but 
also ameliorates osteoporosis and dyslipidaemia, which may be an alternative to 
traditional HRT for postmenopausal women with solid organ transplant needs."
512,"INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression has costly consequences for the mother, 
baby, and society. Numerous pharmacological and non-pharmacological 
interventions are available for the prevention and treatment of postpartum 
depression. To date, no attempt has been made to synthesize the evidence from 
comparisons of interventions both within and across these categories.
METHODS: We will perform a systematic review of the literature and perform 
network meta-analysis of interventions to (a) prevent and (b) treat postpartum 
depression. This review will include studies of primiparous or multiparous women 
during pregnancy or within 12 months of delivery of their baby that assess 
either interventions initiated during pregnancy or within 1 year of childbirth. 
Comparators will be other eligible interventions or control conditions. The 
outcome of interests will be related to the antidepressant efficacy of the 
interventions as well as their acceptability. The published literature will be 
searched in Ovid MEDLINE 1946-, Embase.com 1947-, Scopus 1823-, Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The search will use a 
combination of standardized terms and keywords for postpartum depression, a 
sensitive search filter to limit for randomized controlled trials, and a 
librarian-created ""humans"" filter. The search results will be uploaded to the 
Covidence online systematic review platform (Veritas Health Information Ltd., 
Victoria, Australia) where two review team members will independently screen 
articles. We will extract data to include year of publication, language, 
country, participants (number, demographic data, eligibility criteria, 
psychiatric symptoms, and co-morbidities), characteristics of the intervention 
and control conditions, and reported outcomes. Risk of bias for each study will 
be assessed independently by two review authors using the RoB 2: A revised 
Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials. Network meta-analysis will be 
performed using a Bayesian hierarchical model supplemented with a Markov chain 
Monte Carlo approach.
DISCUSSION: Postpartum depression is a devastating disease with long-lasting 
consequences. Given the numerous available interventions to both prevent and 
treat postpartum depression and the great number of studies comparing them, it 
is imperative that clinicians and patients are provided with an assessment of 
their comparative efficacy and acceptability.

513,"BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common and serious complication of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). LN pathogenesis is not fully understood. Axl 
receptor tyrosine kinase is upregulated and contributes to the pathogenic 
progress in LN. We have reported that Axl disruption attenuates nephritis 
development in mice.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles with RNA-seq 
using renal cortical samples from nephritic mice. Axl-KO mice were bred onto a 
B6.lpr spontaneous lupus background, and renal disease development was followed 
and compared to the Axl-sufficient B6.lpr mice. Finally, anti-glomerular 
basement membrane (anti-GBM) Ab-induced nephritic mice were treated with Axl 
small molecule inhibitor, R428, at different stages of nephritis development. 
Blood urine nitrogen levels and renal pathologies were evaluated.
RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis revealed that renal Axl activation contributed 
to cell proliferation, survival, and motility through regulation of the Akt, 
c-Jun, and actin pathways. Spontaneous lupus-prone B6.lpr mice with Axl 
deficiency showed significantly reduced kidney damages and decreased T cell 
infiltration compared to the renal damage and T cell infiltration in 
Axl-sufficient B6.lpr mice. The improved kidney function was independent of 
autoAb production. Moreover, R428 significantly reduced anti-GBM 
glomerulonephritis at different stages of GN development compared to the 
untreated nephritic control mice. R428 administration reduced inflammatory 
cytokine (IL-6) production, T cell infiltration, and nephritis disease activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study emphasize the important role of Axl 
signaling in LN and highlight Axl as an attractive target in LN."
514,"BACKGROUND: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a heterogeneous group of hereditary 
skin diseases characterized by skin fragility. Primary data on Taiwanese 
population remain scarce.
METHODS: We gathered clinical information from EB patients at National Cheng 
Kung University Hospital from January, 2012, to June, 2021. Diagnostic tests 
including transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence studies, and 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) were performed. The pathogenicity of novel 
splice-site mutations was determined through reverse transcriptase-PCR of skin 
mRNA followed by Sanger and/or RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven EB patients from 45 families were included: 19 EB 
simplex, six junctional EB, and 52 dystrophic EB. Pathogenic variants were 
identified in 37 of 38 families (97.4%), in which WES was used as a first-line 
tool for mutational analysis; RNA sequencing determined pathogenic variants in 
the remaining one family. A total of 60 mutations in EB-related genes were 
identified, including 22 novel mutations. The mutations involved KRT5, KRT14, 
PLEC, COL17A1, LAMB3, LAMA3, ITGB4, and COL7A1. Over one-quarter of DEB patients 
had EB pruriginosa.
CONCLUSIONS: The distinct clinical presentation and molecular pathology of EB in 
Taiwan expand our understanding of this disorder. WES was an effective 
first-line diagnostic tool for identifying EB-associated variants. RNA 
sequencing complemented WES when multiple potentially pathogenic splice-site 
mutations were found."
515,"BACKGROUND: Parental imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that leads to 
monoallelic expression of a subset of genes depending on their parental origin. 
Imprinting disorders (IDs), caused by disturbances of imprinted genes, are a set 
of rare congenital diseases that mainly affect growth, metabolism and 
development. To date, there is no accurate model to study the physiopathology of 
IDs or test therapeutic strategies. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
are a promising cellular approach to model human diseases and complex genetic 
disorders. However, aberrant hypermethylation of imprinting control regions 
(ICRs) may appear during the reprogramming process and subsequent culture of 
iPSCs. Therefore, we tested various conditions of reprogramming and culture of 
iPSCs and performed an extensive analysis of methylation marks at the ICRs to 
develop a cellular model that can be used to study IDs.
RESULTS: We assessed the methylation levels at seven imprinted loci in iPSCs 
before differentiation, at various passages of cell culture, and during 
chondrogenic differentiation. Abnormal methylation levels were found, with 
hypermethylation at 11p15 H19/IGF2:IG-DMR and 14q32 MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR, 
independently of the reprogramming method and cells of origin. Hypermethylation 
at these two loci led to the loss of parental imprinting (LOI), with biallelic 
expression of the imprinted genes IGF2 and DLK1, respectively. The epiPS™ 
culture medium combined with culturing of the cells under hypoxic conditions 
prevented hypermethylation at H19/IGF2:IG-DMR (ICR1) and MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR, as 
well as at other imprinted loci, while preserving the proliferation and 
pluripotency qualities of these iPSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: An extensive and quantitative analysis of methylation levels of 
ICRs in iPSCs showed hypermethylation of certain ICRs in human iPSCs, especially 
paternally methylated ICRs, and subsequent LOI of certain imprinted genes. The 
epiPS™ culture medium and culturing of the cells under hypoxic conditions 
prevented hypermethylation of ICRs in iPSCs. We demonstrated that the 
reprogramming and culture in epiPS™ medium allow the generation of control iPSCs 
lines with a balanced methylation and ID patient iPSCs lines with unbalanced 
methylation. Human iPSCs are therefore a promising cellular model to study the 
physiopathology of IDs and test therapies in tissues of interest."

517,"BACKGROUND: The infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) is the largest adipose deposit in 
the knee; however, its contributions to the homeostasis of this organ remain 
undefined. To determine the influence of the IFP and its associated synovium 
(IFP/synovium complex or IFP/SC) on joint health, this study evaluated the 
progression of osteoarthritis (OA) following excision of this unit in a rodent 
model of naturally-occurring disease.
METHODS: Male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (n=18) received surgical removal of the 
IFP in one knee at 3 months of age; contralateral knees received sham surgery as 
matched internal controls. Mobility and gait assessments were performed prior to 
IFP/SC removal and monthly thereafter. Animals were harvested at 7 months of 
age. Ten set of these knees were processed for microcomputed tomography 
(microCT), histopathology, transcript expression analyses, and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC); 8 sets of knees were dedicated to microCT and 
biomechanical testing (material properties of knee joints tissues and anterior 
drawer laxity).
RESULTS: Fibrous connective tissue (FCT) developed in place of the native 
adipose depot. Gait demonstrated no significant differences between IFP/SC 
removal and contralateral hindlimbs. MicroCT OA scores were improved in knees 
containing the FCT. Quantitatively, IFP/SC-containing knees had more osteophyte 
development and increased trabecular volume bone mineral density (vBMD) in 
femora and tibiae. Histopathology confirmed maintenance of articular cartilage 
structure, proteoglycan content, and chondrocyte cellularity in FCT-containing 
knees. Transcript analyses revealed decreased expression of adipose-related 
molecules and select inflammatory mediators in FCTs compared to IFP/SCs. This 
was verified via IHC for two key inflammatory agents. The medial articular 
cartilage in knees with native IFP/SCs showed an increase in equilibrium 
modulus, which correlated with increased amounts of magnesium and phosphorus.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Formation of the FCT resulted in reduced OA-associated 
changes in both bone and cartilage. This benefit may be associated with: a 
decrease in inflammatory mediators at transcript and protein levels; and/or 
improved biomechanical properties. Thus, the IFP/SC may play a role in the 
pathogenesis of knee OA in this strain, with removal prior to disease onset 
appearing to have short-term benefits."
518,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from previous studies has suggested that ginger extract 
exhibits the potential as an alternative treatment for Coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). Here, we want to investigate whether ginger supplement improves the 
clinical manifestation of hospitalized COVID-19 individuals.
METHODS: A total of 227 hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 were randomized 
to either the control (n = 132) or intervention group (n = 95). The intervention 
group took ginger supplement orally at the dosage of 1.5 g twice daily, until 
they were discharged from the hospital. Both groups received the same standard 
of general medical care during hospitalization, and the length of stay was 
recorded and compared between groups.
RESULTS: Among all participants, a significant reduction in hospitalization time 
(the difference between the treatment and control groups was 2.4 d, 95% CI 
1.6-3.2) was detected in response to the ginger supplement. This effect was more 
pronounced in men, participants aged 60 years or older, and participants with 
pre-existing medical conditions, relative to their counterparts 
(P-interactions < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSION: Ginger supplement significantly shortened the length of stay of 
hospitalized individuals with COVID-19.

Registry (ChiCTR2200059824)."
519,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus treatment as a chronic disease 
requires adequate adherence to treatment including controlling blood glucose 
levels and lifestyle management. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
factors affecting of adherence to T2D treatment from the perspective of patients 
and design an intervention program based on Pender's health promotion model 
(HPM) to increase T2D treatment adherence in Bandar Abbas, a city located in the 
south of Iran.
METHODS: This mixed method study will consist of qualitative stage, 
questionnaire design and a randomized, open-label, parallel-group interventional 
study based on HPM in southern Iran. Sampling for qualitative stage will 
continue until reaching the saturation. In the intervention stage, participants 
will be 166 T2D patients referring to the Bandar Abbas Diabetes Clinic will be 
randomized into intervention and control groups (allocation 1:1). After 
identifying the factors affecting adherence to treatment in T2D patients by 
qualitative study and literature review, a questionnaire based on HPM will be 
designed. In the next stage, 10 sessions of intervention for the intervention 
group will be designed. To evaluate the effect of the intervention, intervention 
and control groups will be tested for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) before and 3 months 
after the intervention.
DISCUSSION: This designed study is a program for improving treatment adherence 
in T2D based on the HPM model and contributes to a better understanding of 
effective factors in adherence to treatment in T2D patients. The results of this 
project can be used for macro-diabetic planning.

520,"BACKGROUND: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patient data from two phase 3 secukinumab 
trials (FUTURE 1, 5) were analysed to quantify the prevalence and extent of 
pre-existing radiographic damage (RD) at baseline; investigate the association 
of RD with swollen/tender joint counts (SJC/TJC) at baseline; and investigate 
the extent to which RD at baseline correlated with response to secukinumab.
METHODS: Pooled data (N = 1554) provided baseline radiographic bone erosion and 
joint space narrowing (JSN) scores at pre-specified locations per the van der 
Heijde-modified total Sharp score (vdH-mTSS) for PsA and swollen and tender 
joint scores in the same joints at multiple visits. Overall patient RD and 
individual joints RD bone erosion and JSN scores were assessed. The association 
between joint activity (tenderness, swelling) and vdH-mTSS was assessed at the 
overall patient-level and individual joint tender, swollen scores (yes/no) and 
RD joint JSN and bone erosion scores at the individual joint-level. Treatment 
response was assessed using SJC/TJC at weeks 16 and 52 and the proportion of 
patients achieving minimal disease activity (MDA) over all assessments within 
1 year from FUTURE 5 alone.
RESULTS: A substantial prevalence of pre-existing RD with higher prevalence of 
erosion than JSN was observed (86% and 60% of patients had positive erosion and 
JSN scores, respectively); higher RD prevalence was associated with longer time 
since PsA diagnosis. Joint activity was weakly associated with RD at baseline at 
the patient-level (Pearson's coefficients: range 0.12-0.18), but strongly 
associated at the individual joint-level, with a higher probability of 
tender/swollen joints to associate with higher JSN/erosion scores: all 42 
analysed joints showed statistical significance at the 0.05 level (unadjusted) 
for the relationship between joint tenderness (yes/no) and its JSN score, all 
but one for tenderness and bone erosion scores, and all but 2 for swollen and 
JSN scores and for swollen and bone erosion score. Secukinumab (150/300 mg), 
reduced TJC and SJC across all values of baseline erosion and JSN scores at 
weeks 16 and 52. Patients with higher levels of RD were less likely to achieve 
zero tender/zero swollen joint status and had lower chance of achieving MDA.
CONCLUSIONS: PsA patients showed substantial prevalence of RD at baseline that 
correlated with time since diagnosis, but patient's individual joint activity 
was strongly associated with pre-existing RD at those joints. Patients with the 
highest RD at baseline had a reduced likelihood of achieving zero joint count 
status."
521,"BACKGROUND: Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a member of 
the genus Betacoronavirus, is the causative agent of neurological disease in 
pigs. No effective therapeutics are currently available for PHEV infection. 
Resveratrol has been shown to exert neuroprotective and antiviral effects. Here 
resveratrol was investigated for its ability to inhibit PHEV replication in 
nerve cells and central nervous system tissues.
METHODS: Anti-PHEV effect of resveratrol was evaluated using an in vitro 
cell-based PHEV infection model and employing a mouse PHEV infection model. The 
collected cells or tissues were used for quantitative PCR analysis, western blot 
analysis, or indirect immunofluorescence assay. The supernatants were collected 
to quantify viral loads by TCID50 assay in vitro. EC50 and CC50 were determined 
by dose-response experiments, and the ratio (EC50/CC50) was used as a 
selectivity index (SI) to measure the antiviral versus cytotoxic activity.
RESULTS: Our results showed that resveratrol treatment reduced PHEV titer in a 
dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibition concentration of 6.24 μM. A 
reduction of > 70% of viral protein expression and mRNA copy number and a 
19-fold reduction of virus titer were achieved when infected cells were treated 
with 10 µM resveratrol in a pre-treatment assay. Quantitative PCR analysis and 
TCID50 assay results revealed that the addition of 10 μM resveratrol to cells 
after adsorption of PHEV significantly reduced 56% PHEV mRNA copy number and 
eightfold virus titer. 10 µM resveratrol treatment reduced 46% PHEV mRNA copy 
number and fourfold virus titer in virus inactivation assay. Moreover, the in 
vivo data obtained in this work also demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited 
PHEV replication, and anti-PHEV activities of resveratrol treatment via 
intranasal installation displayed better than oral gavage.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that resveratrol exerted antiviral effects 
under various drug treatment and virus infection conditions in vitro and holds 
promise as a treatment for PHEV infection in vivo."
522,"Semantic dementia (SD) is a clinical subtype of frontotemporal dementia 
consistent with the neuropathological diagnosis frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration (FTLD) TDP type C, with characteristic round TDP-43 protein 
inclusions in the dentate gyrus. Despite this striking clinicopathological 
concordance, the pathogenic mechanisms are largely unexplained forestalling the 
development of targeted therapeutics. To address this, we carried out laser 
capture microdissection of the dentate gyrus of 15 SD patients and 17 
non-demented controls, and assessed relative protein abundance changes by 
label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. To identify SD specific proteins, we 
compared our results to eight other FTLD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) proteomic 
datasets of cortical brain tissue, parallel with functional enrichment analyses 
and protein-protein interactions (PPI). Of the total 5,354 quantified proteins, 
151 showed differential abundance in SD patients (adjusted P-value < 0.01). 
Seventy-nine proteins were considered potentially SD specific as these were not 
detected, or demonstrated insignificant or opposite change in FTLD/AD. 
Functional enrichment indicated an overrepresentation of pathways related to the 
immune response, metabolic processes, and cell-junction assembly. PPI analysis 
highlighted a cluster of interacting proteins associated with adherens junction 
and cadherin binding, the cadherin-catenin complex. Multiple proteins in this 
complex showed significant upregulation in SD, including β-catenin (CTNNB1), 
γ-catenin (JUP), and N-cadherin (CDH2), which were not observed in other 
neurodegenerative proteomic studies, and hence may resemble SD specific 
involvement. A trend of upregulation of all three proteins was observed by 
immunoblotting of whole hippocampus tissue, albeit only significant for 
N-cadherin. In summary, we discovered a specific increase of cell adhesion 
proteins in SD constituting the cadherin-catenin complex at the synaptic 
membrane, essential for synaptic signaling. Although further investigation and 
validation are warranted, we anticipate that these findings will help unravel 
the disease processes underlying SD."
523,"PURPOSE: The safety of an MRI simulation-guided boost after short-course 
preoperative radiotherapy (SCPRT) for unresectable rectal cancer is assessed 
with a planned interim analysis.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients diagnosed with clinical stage T3-4 or regional 
lymph node-positive disease with positive mesorectal fascia or T4b disease 
evaluated by pelvic MRI were randomly assigned to the SCPRT-boost group (25 Gy 
in 5 fractions plus 4 Gy delivered to the gross tumor volume, followed by four 
cycles of chemotherapy) or preoperative chemoradiotherapy group (50 Gy in 25 
fractions with concurrent chemotherapy). Then, patients received total 
mesorectal excision surgery after preoperative treatment. The primary endpoint 
was the R0 resection rate. The interim analysis was performed when 42 patients 
completed their assigned treatments.
RESULTS: From October 2018 to November 2019, a total of 43 patients were 
enrolled, and 42 patients were included in the interim analysis. During 
preoperative therapy, grade 3 or above toxicities were observed in 10/21 (47.6%) 
patients in the experimental group, and 4/21 (19.0%) patients in the control 
group. A total of 17 (81.0%) and 13 (61.9%) patients in the experimental group 
and control group underwent surgery, respectively. Overall, 65.1% of the 
patients achieved R0 resection in the intention-to-treat analysis. 
Surgery-related adverse complications were observed in 2 patients (11.8%) in the 
experimental group and 1 patient (7.7%) in the control group.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the toxicity of an MRI simulation-guided boost 
after SCPRT for unresectable rectal cancer is acceptable. Thus, this clinical 
trial will be continued as planned."
524,"RATIONALE: The effectiveness of universal immunisation with pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been evident in many countries. However, the global 
impact of PCV is limited by its cost, which has prevented its introduction in 
several countries. Reducing the cost of PCV programmes may facilitate vaccine 
introduction in some countries and improve the sustainability of PCV in EPIs in 
low-income countries when they transition away from subsidised vaccine supply.
METHODS AND DESIGN: PVS is a real-world field trial of an alternative schedule 
of one dose of PCV scheduled at age 6 weeks with a booster dose at age 9 months 
(i.e. the alternative '1+1' schedule) compared to the standard schedule of three 
primary doses scheduled at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age (i.e. the standard '3+0' 
schedule). Delivery of the interventions began in late 2019 in 68 geographic 
clusters and will continue for 4 years. The primary endpoint is the prevalence 
of nasopharyngeal vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage in children aged 2-260 
weeks with clinical pneumonia in year 4. Secondary endpoints are the prevalence 
of vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage among all ages in year 4 and the incidence 
of radiological pneumonia in children enrolled to receive the interventions. 
Additional disease and carriage endpoints are included.
PURPOSE: This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the cohorts and 
populations, and follow-up criteria, to be used in different analyses. The SAP 
defines the endpoints and describes how adherence to the interventions will be 
presented. We describe how analyses will account for the effect of clustering 
and stratified randomisation. The SAP defines the approach to non-inferiority 
and other analyses. Defining the SAP early in the trial will avoid bias in 
analyses that may arise from prior knowledge of trial findings."
525,"Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) require chemotherapy due to 
late detection, rapid disease progression, and low surgical resection rate. 
Tumor cell lines are extremely important in cancer research for drug discovery 
and development. Here, we established and characterized a new intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma cell line, ICC-X1. STR testing confirmed the absence of 
cross-contamination and high similarity to the original tissue. ICC-X1 exhibited 
typical epithelial morphology and formed tumor spheres in the suspension 
culture. The population doubling time was approximately 48 h. The cell line had 
a complex hypotriploid karyotype. The cell line exhibited a strong migration 
ability in vitro and cell inoculation into BALB/c nude mice led to the formation 
of xenografts. Additionally, ICC-X1 cells were sensitive to gemcitabine and 
paclitaxel but resistant to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. RNA sequencing 
revealed that the upregulated cancer-related genes were mainly enriched in 
several signaling pathways, including the TNF signaling pathway, NOD-like 
receptor signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The downregulated 
cancer-related genes were mainly enriched in the Rap1 signaling pathway and 
Hippo signaling pathway among other pathways. In conclusion, we have created a 
new ICC cell line derived from Chinese patients. This cell line can be used as a 
preclinical model to study ICC, specifically tumor metastasis and drug 
resistance mechanisms."
526,"BACKGROUND: Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal that may compress 
neurological tissues resulting in pain and disability. Although previous 
qualitative studies have solicited data regarding the life experience of 
patients with spinal stenosis or their opinions on relevant non-surgical 
treatments, their data was collected from participants in a controlled setting. 
Therefore, it remains unclear whether patients' or caregivers' concerns/opinions 
about spinal stenosis would be different in a non-experimental environment. 
Since Twitter is a popular online platform for people to share information and 
interact, it may reveal people's thoughts and attitudes about spinal stenosis. 
This study aimed to identify tweets that are related to spinal stenosis on 
Twitter, and to categorize them into common themes.
METHODS: A social media monitoring and analysis software program (TalkWalker) 
was used to search relevant tweets using the keywords 'spinal stenosis' and 
'stenosis' between 29 May 2019 and 24 June 2020. Two independent reviewers 
screened and conducted content analysis of the tweets and classified the tweets 
into different themes.
RESULTS: Of 510 identified tweets, 362 tweets met the selection criteria. Five 
themes were identified: (1) compromised physical, psychological, and social 
wellbeing (n = 173); (2) diverse treatment options (n = 69); (3) coping 
strategies (n = 30); (4) dissemination of scientific information (n = 86); and 
(5) health policy (n = 4). Most of the tweets revealed negative impacts of 
spinal stenosis on patients' physical and psychosocial wellbeing. People with 
spinal stenosis shared their experiences and sought helps from others, while 
some people used Twitter to disseminate relevant information and research 
findings.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study exploring Twitter using an online 
analytical tool to identify themes related to spinal stenosis. The approach not 
only helps understand people's concerns about spinal stenosis in an uncontrolled 
environment, but also can be adopted to monitor influences of diseases or public 
health education on Twitter users."
527,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits mitochondrial dysfunctions 
associated with dysregulated metabolism, brain inflammation, synaptic loss, and 
neuronal cell death. As a key protein serving as the mitochondrial gatekeeper, 
the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) that controls metabolism and Ca2+ 
homeostasis is positioned at a convergence point for various cell survival and 
death signals. Here, we targeted VDAC1 with VBIT-4, a newly developed inhibitor 
of VDAC1 that prevents its pro-apoptotic activity, and mitochondria dysfunction.
METHODS: To address the multiple pathways involved in AD, neuronal cultures and 
a 5 × FAD mouse model of AD were treated with VBIT-4. We addressed multiple 
topics related to the disease and its molecular mechanisms using immunoblotting, 
immunofluorescence, q-RT-PCR, 3-D structural analysis and several behavioral 
tests.
RESULTS: In neuronal cultures, amyloid-beta (Aβ)-induced VDAC1 and p53 
overexpression and apoptotic cell death were prevented by VBIT-4. Using an 
AD-like 5 × FAD mouse model, we showed that VDAC1 was overexpressed in neurons 
surrounding Aβ plaques, but not in astrocytes and microglia, and this was 
associated with neuronal cell death. VBIT-4 prevented the associated 
pathophysiological changes including neuronal cell death, neuroinflammation, and 
neuro-metabolic dysfunctions. VBIT-4 also switched astrocytes and microglia from 
being pro-inflammatory/neurotoxic to neuroprotective phenotype. Moreover, VBIT-4 
prevented cognitive decline in the 5 × FAD mice as evaluated using several 
behavioral assessments of cognitive function. Interestingly, VBIT-4 protected 
against AD pathology, with no significant change in phosphorylated Tau and only 
a slight decrease in Aβ-plaque load.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction with its 
gatekeeper VDAC1 is a promising target for AD therapeutic intervention, and 
VBIT-4 is a promising drug candidate for AD treatment."
528,"BACKGROUND: With the largest cattle population in Africa and vast swathes of 
fertile lands infested by tsetse flies, trypanosomosis is a major challenge for 
Ethiopian farmers. Managing the problem strategically and rationally requires 
comprehensive and detailed information on disease and vector distribution at the 
national level. To this end, the National Institute for Control and Eradication 
of Tsetse and Trypanosomosis (NICETT) developed a national atlas of tsetse and 
African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) for Ethiopia.
METHODS: This first edition of the atlas focused on the tsetse-infested areas in 
western Ethiopia. Data were collected between 2010 and 2019 in the framework of 
national surveillance and control activities. Over 88,000 animals, mostly 
cattle, were tested with the buffy-coat technique (BCT). Odour-enhanced traps 
were deployed in approximately 14,500 locations for the entomological surveys. 
Animal- and trap-level data were geo-referenced, harmonized and centralized in a 
single database.
RESULTS: AAT occurrence was confirmed in 86% of the districts surveyed 
(107/124). An overall prevalence of 4.8% was detected by BCT in cattle. The mean 
packed cell volume (PCV) of positive animals was 22.4, compared to 26.1 of the 
negative. Trypanosoma congolense was responsible for 61.9% of infections, T. 
vivax for 35.9% and T. brucei for 1.7%. Four tsetse species were found to have a 
wide geographic distribution. The highest apparent density (AD) was reported for 
Glossina pallidipes in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region 
(SNNPR) (3.57 flies/trap/day). Glossina tachinoides was the most abundant in 
Amhara (AD 2.39), Benishangul-Gumuz (2.38), Gambela (1.16) and Oromia (0.94) 
regions. Glossina fuscipes fuscipes and G. morsitans submorsitans were detected 
at lower densities (0.19 and 0.42 respectively). Only one specimen of G. 
longipennis was captured.
CONCLUSIONS: The atlas establishes a reference for the distribution of tsetse 
and AAT in Ethiopia. It also provides crucial evidence to plan surveillance and 
monitor control activities at the national level. Future work on the atlas will 
focus on the inclusion of data collected by other stakeholders, the broadening 
of the coverage to tsetse-free areas and continuous updates. The extension of 
the atlas to data on control activities is also envisaged."
529,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore whether explainable Artificial 
Intelligence methods can be fruitfully used to improve the medical management of 
patients suffering from complex diseases, and in particular to predict the death 
risk in hospitalized patients with SARS-Cov-2 based on admission data.
METHODS: This work is based on an observational ambispective study that 
comprised patients older than 18 years with a positive SARS-Cov-2 diagnosis that 
were admitted to the hospital Azienda Ospedaliera ""SS Antonio e Biagio e Cesare 
Arrigo"", Alessandria, Italy from February, 24 2020 to May, 31 2021, and that 
completed the disease treatment inside this structure. The patients'medical 
history, demographic, epidemiologic and clinical data were collected from the 
electronic medical records system and paper based medical records, entered and 
managed by the Clinical Study Coordinators using the REDCap electronic data 
capture tool patient chart. The dataset was used to train and to evaluate 
predictive ML models.
RESULTS: We overall trained, analysed and evaluated 19 predictive models (both 
supervised and unsupervised) on data from 824 patients described by 43 features. 
We focused our attention on models that provide an explanation that is 
understandable and directly usable by domain experts, and compared the results 
against other classical machine learning approaches. Among the former, JRIP 
showed the best performance in 10-fold cross validation, and the best average 
performance in a further validation test using a different patient dataset from 
the beginning of the third COVID-19 wave. Moreover, JRIP showed comparable 
performances with other approaches that do not provide a clear and/or 
understandable explanation.
CONCLUSIONS: The ML supervised models showed to correctly discern between 
low-risk and high-risk patients, even when the medical disease context is 
complex and the list of features is limited to information available at 
admission time. Furthermore, the models demonstrated to reasonably perform on a 
dataset from the third COVID-19 wave that was not used in the training phase. 
Overall, these results are remarkable: (i) from a medical point of view, these 
models evaluate good predictions despite the possible differences entitled with 
different care protocols and the possible influence of other viral variants 
(i.e. delta variant); (ii) from the organizational point of view, they could be 
used to optimize the management of health-care path at the admission time."
530,"BACKGROUND: The diagnostic yield of genetic testing for inherited cardiac 
diseases is up to 40% and is primarily indicated for screening of at-risk 
relatives. Here, we evaluate the role of genomics in diagnosis and management 
among consecutive individuals attending a specialised clinic and identify those 
with the highest likelihood of having a monogenic disease.
METHODS: A retrospective audit of 1697 consecutive, unrelated probands referred 
to a specialised, multidisciplinary clinic between 2002 and 2020 was performed. 
A concordant clinical and genetic diagnosis was considered solved. Cases were 
classified as likely monogenic based on a score comprising a positive family 
history, young age at onset, and severe phenotype, whereas low-scoring cases 
were considered to have a likely complex aetiology. The impact of a genetic 
diagnosis was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 888 probands fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and genetic 
testing identified likely pathogenic or pathogenic (LP/P) variants in 330 
individuals (37%) and suspicious variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in 73 
(8%). Research-focused efforts identified 46 (5%) variants, missed by 
conventional genetic testing. Where a variant was identified, this changed or 
clarified the final diagnosis in a clinically useful way for 51 (13%). The yield 
of suspicious VUS across ancestry groups ranged from 15 to 20%, compared to only 
10% among Europeans. Even when the clinical diagnosis was uncertain, those with 
the most monogenic disease features had the greatest diagnostic yield from 
genetic testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Research-focused efforts can increase the diagnostic yield by up to 
5%. Where a variant is identified, this will have clinical utility beyond family 
screening in 13%. We demonstrate the value of genomics in reaching an overall 
diagnosis and highlight inequities based on ancestry. Acknowledging our 
incomplete understanding of disease phenotypes, we propose a framework for 
prioritising likely monogenic cases to solve their underlying cause of disease."
531,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic implication of liver fibrosis in acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS) patients are scarce. We sought to evaluate whether liver fibrosis 
scores (LFS) were associated with thrombotic or bleeding events in patients with 
acute coronary syndrome.
METHODS: We included 6386 ACS patients who underwent percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI). This study determined liver fibrosis with aspartate 
aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), aspartate aminotransferase to 
alanine aminotransferase ratio (AST/ALT ratio), Forns score, and nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS). The primary endpoint was major adverse 
cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), a composite of all-cause mortality 
(ACM), myocardial infarction (MI), and ischemic stroke (IS).
RESULTS: During the follow-up, 259 (4.06%) MACCE and 190 (2.98%) bleeding events 
were recorded. As a continuous variable or a categorical variable stratified by 
the literature-based cutoff, LFS was positively associated with MACCE (p > 0.05) 
but not with bleeding events. Compared with subjects with low APRI scores, 
AST/ALT ratio scores, Forns scores, and NFS scores, subjects with high scores 
had a 1.57- to 3.73-fold increase risk of MACCE after adjustment (all p < 0.05). 
The positive relationship between LFS and MACCE was consistent in different 
subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: In ACS patients, increased LFS predicted an elevated risk of 
thrombotic events but not bleeding. LFS may contribute to thrombotic risk 
stratification after ACS."
532,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the asthma medication use in Chinese children of different 
age groups, regions, and levels of cities in China, based on the 2015 Healthcare 
Insurance Data in China.
METHODS: The China Healthcare Insurance Research Association (CHIRA) database 
was searched for children from 0 to 14 years old diagnosed as asthma based on 
the ""J45"" and ""J46"" coded in ICD-10. A cross-sectional study design was 
employed.
RESULTS: A total of 308,550 children were identified, all of whom were treated 
under the coverage of healthcare insurance. Among them, 2,468 children were 
eligible for inclusion in the present study. Compared with the current status of 
asthma care in European and American countries, under the guidelines for the 
diagnosis and treatment of asthma in China, the use percentages of ICS and 
short-acting β2 receptor agonist in children with asthma in China were lower, 
but the use percentages of oral corticosteroids, long-acting β2 receptor 
agonist, and theophylline (especially intravenous theophylline) were higher, 
especially in the Central and West China.
CONCLUSION: The asthma medication use was attributed to many factors, thus 
efforts are still needed to further popularize the GINA programs and China's 
guidelines for asthma diagnosis and treatment, especially in the Central and 
West China."
533,"BACKGROUND: Ginsenoside compound K (GC-K) potentially alleviates ulcerative 
colitis involved in gut microbiota, which is significantly associated with the 
occurrence and development of colitis. However, the effect and mechanism of GC-K 
on anti-colitis in relation to gut microbiota are not clear. This study focused 
on the prevention and mechanism of GC-K on Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced 
colitis of mice pertinent to gut microbiota.
METHODS: DSS was used to establish a chronic colitis mouse model. Body weight 
analysis, colon length measurement, HE staining, and inflammatory factors levels 
were processed in animal experiments. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze 
Th17/Treg cells in the mouse spleen and blood. 16S rRNA sequencing was utilized 
to analyze gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was 
employed to verify the anti-colitis efficacy of GC-K by reshaping gut 
microbiota.
RESULTS: GC-K significantly relieved colitis-related symptoms due to decreased 
disease activity index (DAI) scores, spleen weight, and increased colon length. 
Additionally, the tight junction proteins were increased, and the 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-17, were decreased 
after GC-K treatment. Furthermore, Bacteroides spp. significantly increased 
after modeling. Moreover, FMT experiments confirmed that GC-K-driven gut 
microbiota greatly relieved DSS-induced colitis.
CONCLUSION: GC-K alleviated colitis via the modulation of gut microbiota."
534,"BACKGROUND: Dysregulated activation of the inflammasome is involved in various 
human diseases including acute cerebral ischemia, multiple sclerosis and sepsis. 
Though many inflammasome inhibitors targeting NOD-like receptor protein 3 
(NLRP3) have been designed and developed, none of the inhibitors are clinically 
available. Growing evidence suggests that targeting apoptosis-associated 
speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), the oligomerization of which is the 
key event for the assembly of inflammasome, may be another promising therapeutic 
strategy. Lonidamine (LND), a small-molecule inhibitor of glycolysis used as an 
antineoplastic drug, has been evidenced to have anti-inflammation effects. 
However, its anti-inflammatory mechanism is still largely unknown.
METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) and LPS-induced sepsis mice models were constructed to 
investigate the therapeutic and anti-inflammasome effects of LND. The inhibition 
of inflammasome activation and ASC oligomerization by LND was evaluated using 
western blot (WB), immunofluorescence (IF), quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in murine bone 
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Direct binding of LND with ASC was assessed 
using molecular mock docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and drug affinity 
responsive target stability (DARTS).
RESULTS: Here, we find that LND strongly attenuates the inflammatory injury in 
experimental models of inflammasome-associated diseases including autoimmune 
disease-multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic stroke and sepsis. Moreover, LND 
blocks diverse types of inflammasome activation independent of its known targets 
including hexokinase 2 (HK2). We further reveal that LND directly binds to the 
inflammasome ligand ASC and inhibits its oligomerization.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results identify LND as a broad-spectrum 
inflammasome inhibitor by directly targeting ASC, providing a novel candidate 
drug for the treatment of inflammasome-driven diseases in clinic."
535,"Married women have a higher risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) or develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) than men. Knowledge 
of HIV/AIDS contributes significantly to describing the prevalence and 
consequences of such virus/disease. The study aimed to investigate the level of 
HIV/AIDS knowledge and the socio-demographic variables that influence HIV/AIDS 
knowledge among married women in Bangladesh. We used three waves of Multiple 
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), which included 33,843, 20,727, and 29,724 
married women from 2006, 2012, and 2019 MICS. A score was prepared through their 
interrogation to determine the level of knowledge and logistic regression models 
were used for analyzing the data. This study found that the prevalence of 
knowledge level of HIV/AIDS in different questions increased from 55.20% in 2006 
to 58.69% in 2019. In our study, respondents having highest education had 4.03 
(95% CI 3.50-4.64) times more chance to obtain ""High Score"" in 2019 MICS which 
is 5.30 times in 2012 MICS (95% CI 4.41-6.37) and 2.58 times in 2006 MICS (95% 
CI 2.28-2.93) compared to illiterate married women. Moreover, respondents from 
urban area were 1.13 times more likely to obtain ""High Score"" in 2019 MICS which 
is 1.14 times in 2012 MICS and 1.16 times in 2006 MICS, respectively than the 
rural married women. This study also found respondent's age, division, mass 
media access, and wealth status have played an important role in HIV/AIDS 
knowledge. Although a significant proportion of women had adequate knowledge of 
HIV/AIDS, more knowledge is still required to protect against such 
viruses/diseases. Thus, we advocate for the implementation of educational 
program in the curriculum, counselling, particularly in rural areas, and mass 
media access to ensure quality knowledge throughout the country."
536,"BACKGROUND: Unreasonable use of antibiotics and probiotics can alter the gut 
ecology, leading to antibiotic resistance and suboptimal health outcomes during 
early life. Our study aims are to clarify the association among antibiotic and 
probiotic exposure in early life, the microecology of the gut microbiota, and 
the development of antibiotic resistance; to investigate the long-term impact of 
antibiotics and probiotics on the health outcomes of infants and young children; 
and to provide a theoretical basis for the rational use of antibiotics and 
probiotics from a life course perspective.
METHODS: The study is a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort study conducted 
in Shaanxi Province, China from 2018 to 2024. A total of 3,000 eligible 
mother-child pairs will be enrolled from rural, suburban, and urban areas. The 
recruitment of the participants begins at pregnancy, and the newborns will be 
followed up for 2 years at successive timepoints: within 3 days after birth, 
42 days after birth, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. Sociodemographic 
data, environmental exposures, dietary patterns, psychological conditions, and 
medical and drug histories are collected. Cognitive and behavioural development 
among infants and young children and questionnaires on antibiotic knowledge and 
behaviour among caregivers will be collected at 12 and 24 months of age. The 
faecal samples are collected and analysed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing 
and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for antibiotic resistance genes.
DISCUSSION: The findings will inform antibiotic and probiotic use for pregnant 
women and infants and contribute to establishing rational use strategies of 
antibiotics and probiotics for paediatricians, health practitioners, and drug 
administration policy-makers.

537,"Hypoxia and high accumulation of lactic acid in the tumor microenvironment 
provide fertile soil for tumor development, maintenance and metastasis. Herein, 
we developed a calcium peroxide (CaO2)-loaded nanostructure that can play a role 
of ""one stone kill two birds"", i.e., acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironment 
can be simultaneously regulated by CaO2 loaded nanostructure. Specifically, 
CaO2-loaded mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles modified with sodium 
hyaluronate (denoted as CaO2@mPDA-SH) can gradually accumulate in a tumor site. 
CaO2 exposed in acidic microenvironment can succeed in consuming the lactic acid 
with oxygen generation simultaneously, which could remodel the acid and hypoxia 
tumor microenvironment. More importantly, the relief of hypoxia could further 
reduce lactate production from the source by down-regulating the hypoxia 
inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which further down-regulated the glycolysis 
associated enzymes including glycolysis-related glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) 
and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). As a result, CaO2@mPDA-SH alone without the 
employment of other therapeutics can dually regulate the tumor hypoxia and 
lactic acid metabolism, which efficiently represses tumor progression in 
promoting immune activation, antitumor metastasis, and anti-angiogenesis."
538,"BACKGROUND: The main barriers keeping individuals with high-risk of angle 
closure from seeking eye-care service are the absence of both disease awareness 
and convenient and low-cost access to the ocular health care system. Present 
study described the efficacy of a health examination center-based screening 
model designed to detect eyes with high risk of angle closure (HRAC) among 
healthy individuals using anterior segment optical coherence tomography 
(AS-OCT).
METHODS: From March 1 to April 30, 2017, consecutive individuals aged ≥ 40 years 
undergoing routine physical examinations at a health examination center were 
invited to enroll. Presenting visual acuity (PVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) 
measurement, non-mydriatic fundus photography and AS-OCT were performed by three 
trained nurses. Participants with PVA < 6/12 in the better-seeing eye, 
IOP ≥ 24 mmHg, or abnormal fundus photography in either eye were referred to the 
outpatient clinic, but not included in the analysis. Eyes with HRAC were defined 
as having trabecular-iris angle < 12 degrees in ≥ 3 quadrants. Configuration of 
the iris was classified into flat, bowing, bombe, thick peripheral iris and 
mixed mechanism.
RESULTS: Altogether, 991 participants (77.3%) with readable OCT images (mean age 
55.5 ± 9.0 years; 58.4% men) were included. HRAC was diagnosed in 78 eyes (7.9%, 
61.3 ± 8.2 years, 41.0% men). The prevalence of HRAC increased with age 
(p < 0.001) and was much higher among women (11.2%) than men (5.5%) (p = 0.001). 
The mixed mechanism iris configuration was most common among eyes with HRAC 
(37/78, 47.4%).
CONCLUSION: HRAC is prevalent among asymptomatic Chinese adults undergoing 
routine health screening. Health examination center-based eye screening with 
AS-OCT administered by non-specialists may be a good model to screen narrow 
angles in the population at large."
539,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation between N-terminal probrain 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH) D), high-mobility 
group box 1(HMGB1), endogenous activin A (ACTA), blood glucose 
level, electrolyte levels and developmental quotient (DQ) scores of 
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).
METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 90 neonates diagnosed with HIE 
who were admitted to our hospital from January 2018 to June 2021 were 
retrospectively enrolled, and 40 healthy full-term neonates born in our hospital 
during the same period were randomly selected. Neonates with HIE and healthy 
conditions were set as the study group and control group, respectively. Neonates 
with HIE are divided into three subgroups, mild, moderate, and severe, based on 
the severity of HIE. The Gesell Developmental Scale (GDS) was used to assess 
neural development of neonates at 9 to 12 months postnatal. Biomarkers of 
peripheral venous blood were measured and collected in all neonates, including 
NT-proBNP, (25-(OH) D), HMGB1, ACTA, electrolyte levels and blood glucose 
levels. General demographic information and Apgar score were compared between 
the two groups. The differences between the two groups of biomarkers were 
compared and the correlation between these biomarkers and DQ scores was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in gestational age, maternal age, 
gender, way of birth, birth weight, gestational age and whether the mother was a 
primipara between the two groups (P>0.05). The 10 min Apgar score of the study 
group (5.87±0.36) was lower than that of the control group (9.37±0.32) with 
significant difference (P<0.05). The levels of NT-proBNP, HMGB1, and ACTA in the 
study group were higher than that in the control group (243.87±21.29 pmol/L vs. 
116.98±22.19 pmol/L; 8.92±1.87 μg/L vs. 3.28±1.08 μg/L; 23.78±0.89 ng/ml vs. 
2.98±0.38 ng/ml), while the levels of 25-(OH) D and electrolyte levels 
were lower than that in the control group (24.28±1.87 vs. 31.29±1.93; K+: 
4.49±0.23 mmol/L vs. 4.73±0.21 mmol/L; Na+: 118.76±13.02 mmol/L vs. 134.28±12.29 
mmol/L; Ca2+: 1.77±0.23 mmol/L vs. 2.35±0.26 mmol/L; Mg2+: 0.61±0.17 mmol/L vs. 
0.91±0.17 mmol/L), with statistically significant differences (P<0.001). The 
levels of NT-probNP, HMGB1, ACTA and the incidence of hypoglycemia were the 
highest in the severe group, which were significantly higher than those in the 
moderate group and mild group (P<0.05). The levels of NT-probNP, HMGB1, ACTA and 
the incidence of hypoglycemia were the lowest in the mild group. The 25-(OH) D 
level, the incidence of hyperglycemia and electrolyte levels were the lowest in 
the severe group, which were significantly lower than those in the moderate and 
mild groups (all P<0.05). Meanwhile, the 25-(OH) D level, the incidence of 
hyperglycemia and electrolyte levels in the moderate group were lower than those 
in the mild group, and the differences were statistically significant (all 
P<0.05). The incidence of hyperglycemia in severe group (16 cases) was the 
lowest, significantly lower than that in moderate group (17 cases) and mild 
group (22 cases), and the difference was statistically significant (all P<0.05). 
The DQ scores of HIE neonates were negatively correlated with NT-proBNP, HMGB1, 
and ACTA (r=-0.671, -0.421, -0.518, all P< 0.001). The DQ scores was positively 
correlated with levels of 25-(OH) D and blood glucose level (r =0.621, 0.802, 
all P< 0.001). The DQ scores was also positively correlated with levels of 
potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium (0.367, 0.782, 0.218, 0.678, all 
P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The NT-proBNP, HMGB1, ACTA, 25-(OH) D, blood glucose levels and 
electrolyte levels are correlated with the severity of HIE, and developmental 
quotient scores in neonates with HIE. These biomarkers are suggestive for 
assessing the prognosis of neonate with HIE."
540,"BACKGROUND: Juvenile Scleroderma is a rare autoimmune disease of the connective 
tissue. Its concurrence with COVID-19 can lead to limb ischemia as both disease 
entities are pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic. To date, there is no case 
report describing the symptomatology and course of disease in patients with 
juvenile Scleroderma and COVID-19.
CASE PRESENTATION: An adolescent with acute limb ischemia presented with a 
history of generalized hypo-and-hyperpigmented skin lesions and mild, 
non-productive cough. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab 
RT-PCR. Further work-up revealed elevated anti-phospholipid antibodies, 
anti-nuclear antibody, and D-dimer; low Protein S activity; and evidence of 
peripheral arterial disease on imaging studies. She was started on peripheral 
vasodilators, Methotrexate, and anticoagulation. Close monitoring of the 
affected limbs and other organs involved was done. Control of limb ischemia was 
achieved after 4 months of regular Cyclophosphamide infusion. Continued 
multi-disciplinary care was ensured for this patient.
CONCLUSION: There is evolving knowledge about the interplay of COVID-19 
hyperinflammatory state and rheumatologic disorders. COVID-19 is thought to 
exacerbate cutaneous manifestations of autoimmune disorders via antigen protein 
mimicry and cytokine imbalance. Moreover, COVID-19 is characterized by complex 
hematopathologic processes that put a patient in a hypercoagulable state. 
Elevated D-dimer can be seen in both COVID-19 and systemic sclerosis owing to 
their pro-thrombotic sequela. There is scarcity of data on the association of 
Protein S activity with COVID-19 and systemic sclerosis. More studies need to be 
carried out to ultimately arrive at a consensus on thrombosis prophylaxis for 
patients with Scleroderma and COVID-19."
541,"BACKGROUND: Insecticides play a key role in rural farming; however, their over- 
or misuse has been linked with a negative impact on malaria vector control 
policies. This study was conducted amongst agricultural communities in Southern 
Côte d'Ivoire to identify which insecticides are used by local farmers and how 
it relates to the perception of farmers on malaria. Understanding the use of 
insecticides may help in designing awareness programme on mosquito control and 
pesticides management.
METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to 1399 farming households across ten 
villages. Farmers were interviewed on their education, farming practices (e.g. 
crops cultivated, insecticides use), perception of malaria, and the different 
domestic strategies of mosquito control they use. Based on some pre-defined 
household assets, the socioeconomic status (SES) of each household was 
estimated. Statistical associations were calculated between different variables, 
showing significant risk factors.
RESULTS: The educational level of farmers was significantly associated with 
their SES (p < 0.0001). Most of the householders (88.82%) identified mosquitoes 
as the principal cause of malaria, with good knowledge of malaria resulting as 
positively related to high educational level (OR = 2.04; 95%CI: 1.35, 3.10). The 
use of indoor chemical compounds was strongly associated to the SES of the 
households, their education level, their use of ITNs and insecticide in 
agricultural (p < 0.0001). Indoor application of pyrethroid insecticides was 
found to be widespread among farmers as well as the use of such insecticide for 
crops protection.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the education level remains the key factor 
influencing the use of insecticides by farmers and their awareness of malaria 
control. We suggest that better communication tailored to education level and 
including SES, controlled availability and access to chemical products, should 
be considered when designing campaigns on use of pesticides and vector borne 
disease control for local communities."
542,"Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with multifaceted drug resistance mechanisms 
(e.g., tumour microenvironment [TME], tumour heterogeneity, and immune evasion). 
Natural products are interesting repository of bioactive molecules, especially 
those with anticancer activities. Prodigiosin, a red pigment produced by 
Serratia marcescens, possesses inherent anticancer characteristics, showing 
interesting antitumour activities in different cancers (e.g., breast, gastric) 
with low or without harmful effects on normal cells. The present review 
discusses the potential role of prodigiosin in modulating and reprogramming the 
metabolism of the various immune cells in the TME, such as T and B lymphocytes, 
tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), natural killer (NK) cells, and 
tumour-associated dendritic cells (TADCs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
(MDSCs) which in turn might introduce as an immunomodulator in cancer therapy."
543,"BACKGROUND: It has been known that ABO blood groups are linked to the phenotypes 
of certain diseases; however, and the relationship between ABO blood groups and 
postoperative pain have not been extensively studied, especially in children. 
This study was to investigate whether there would be an association between the 
four major ABO blood groups and postoperative pain, as indicated by the 
differences in pain scores and rescue fentanyl requirements among blood groups 
in children after adenotonsillectomy.
METHODS: A total of 124 children, aged 3-7 years, ASA I or II, and undergoing 
elective adenotonsillectomy were enrolled in the study. Postoperative pain was 
evaluated using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) 
and the rescue fentanyl requirement in post anesthesia care unit (PACU) was 
analyzed. Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score and the duration 
of PACU were recorded. The postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) within 24 h 
were documented.
RESULTS: Among four blood type groups, no significant differences were observed 
regarding surgery time, and the gaps of fentanyl given at the anesthesia 
induction and the first rescue fentanyl injection in PACU. However, patients 
from AB and B blood groups had significantly higher pain score at initial CHEOPS 
assessment and consequently, higher consumption of rescue fentanyl during PACU 
stay. A significantly higher percentage of patients had received > 1 μg/kg 
rescue fentanyl. Higher PAED scores were also observed in AB and B blood groups.
CONCLUSION: Paediatric patients with AB and B blood type had higher 
postoperative CHEOPS pain score and required significantly more fentanyl for 
pain control than those with A and O blood type after T&A. The initial scores of 
PAED in patients with AB and B blood type were also higher than that in patients 
with A and O blood type."
544,"BACKGROUND: Clandestine gold miners remain key hosts for malaria in French 
Guiana (FG) and contribute to imported malaria cases in Suriname and Brazil. The 
Malakit intervention, implemented in FG borders with Suriname and Brazil, 
provided gold miners with training on malaria and kits for self-diagnosis and 
self-treatment. Having shown a likely impact on malaria transmission, Suriname 
has now implemented it in routine care for cross-border moving populations. 
However, a decrease in malaria transmission is frequently associated with a 
decrease in risk perception, knowledge, and good practices regarding malaria. 
This study aims to describe the evolution of the perceptions, knowledge, 
attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to malaria among clandestine gold miners 
between 2015 and 2019, and to estimate the impact of Malakit on the FG/Suriname 
border.
METHODS: The primary outcome was the overall KAP score over time and among 
participants and not participants in the Malakit intervention. A propensity 
score matching analysis and an inverse probability of treatment weighing 
analysis were used to estimate the Average Treatment effect on the Treated and 
the Average Treatment Effect of Malakit, respectively.
RESULTS: Perception and knowledge scores were significantly lower in 2019 
compared to 2015 (- 0.27 and - 0.23 points, respectively, p < 0.001) while 
attitude and practice scores were higher (+ 0.16 and + 0.47 points, 
respectively, p < 0.001). The overall KAP score was significantly higher among 
participants in Malakit with both propensity score matching (+ 0.72 points, 
95%IC [0.29; 1.15]) and inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis 
(+ 0.70 points, 95%IC [0.34; 1.05]).
CONCLUSION: A decrease in perception and knowledge about malaria but an 
improvement of attitudes and practices as the incidence of malaria decreased are 
observed. The Malakit intervention seems to have a significant positive impact 
on the overall KAP related to malaria. The integration of this strategy into 
malaria control programmes could help to improve the KAP, even in areas where 
malaria is nearly eliminated, through optimal training and health empowerment.

545,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Index cholecystectomy is insufficient for curing T3 
incidental gallbladder cancer (IGC), and once residual cancer (RC) is found, the 
prognosis is often poor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect 
of RC on the prognosis and the optimal choice of adjuvant therapy for R0 
reresection patients with T3 IGC.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with T3 IGC who 
underwent radical reresection from January 2013 to December 2018. RC was defined 
as histologically proven cancer at reresection. Demographics and tumour 
treatment-related variables were analysed in correlation with RC and survival. 
Adjuvant (Adj) chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was correlated with overall survival (OS) 
and disease-free survival (DFS).
RESULTS: Of the 167 patients with IGC who underwent surgery, 102 underwent 
radical extended resection. Thirty-two (31.4%) RCs were found. Hepatic side 
tumours (T3h) and both side tumours (T3h + T3p) were associated with the 
presence of RC. In multivariate analysis, RC and lymph node metastasis were 
independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS (P < 0.05). RC was associated with 
a significantly shorter median OS (20 vs. 53 months; P < 0.01) and DFS (11 vs. 
40 months; P < 0.001) despite R0 resection. For R0 reresection patients with RC 
and/or lymph node metastasis, Adj CRT significantly improved OS (P = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: Residual cancer and lymphatic metastasis are important factors for 
the poor prognosis of T3 IGC despite R0 resection, and these patients should 
actively receive adjuvant therapy."
546,"BACKGROUND: High-quality antenatal care (ANC) provides a lifesaving opportunity 
for women and their newborns through providing health promotion, disease 
prevention, and early diagnosis and treatment of pregnancy-related health 
issues. However, systematically synthesised evidence on factors influencing the 
quality of ANC services is lacking. This scoping review aims to systematically 
synthesize the factors influencing in provision and utilisation of quality ANC 
services.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of published evidence on the quality of 
ANC services. We searched records on four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and 
Google scholar) and grey literature from 1 to 2011 to 30 August 2021. We 
analysed data using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis approach. We followed 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guideline for the review. We explained themes using 
the Donabedian healthcare quality assessment model (input-process-output).
RESULTS: Several inputs- and process-related factors contributed to suboptimal 
quality of ANC in many low and lower- or middle-income countries. Input factors 
included facility readiness (e.g., lack of infrastructure, provision of 
commodities and supplies, health workforce, structural and intermediary 
characteristics of pregnant women, and service delivery approaches). 
Processes-related factors included technical quality of care (e.g., lack of 
skilled adequate and timely care, and poor adherence to the guidelines) and 
social quality (lack of effective communication and poor client satisfaction). 
These input and process factors have also contributed to equity gaps in 
utilisation of quality ANC services.
CONCLUSION: Several input and process factors influenced the provision and 
utilization of optimum quality ANC services. Better health system inputs (e.g., 
availability of trained workforces, commodities, guidelines, context-specific 
programs) are essential to creating enabling facility environment for quality 
ANC services. Care processes can be improved by ensuring capacity-building 
activities for workforces (training, technical support visits), and mentoring 
staff working at peripheral facilities. Identifying coverage of quality ANC 
services among disadvantaged groups could be the initial step in designing and 
implementing targeted program approaches."
547,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suddenly broke out in China 
in December 2019. Pandemic-related behavioral changes can cause perioperative 
respiratory adverse events in children with congenital heart disease (CHD). 
Here, we compared the incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events 
(PRAEs) in CHD children with and without upper respiratory infection (URI) 
undergoing the cardiac catheterization before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: This prospective observational single-center study was based at a 
tertiary care center in Shanghai, China. A total of 359 children with CHD with 
and without recent URI were included between January 2019 and March 2021. The 
overall incidence of PRAEs (laryngospasm, bronchospasm, coughing, airway 
secretion, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation) in non-URI and URI 
children undergoing elective cardiac catheterization was compared before and 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. A logistic regression model was fitted to identify 
the potential risk factors associated with PRAEs.
RESULTS: Of the 564 children enrolled, 359 completed the study and were finally 
analyzed. The incidence of URIs decreased substantially during the COVID-19 
pandemic (14% vs. 41%, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the overall PRAEs also 
significantly declined regardless of whether the child had a recent URI (22.3% 
vs. 42.3%, P = 0.001 for non-URI and 29.2% vs. 58.7%, P = 0.012 for URI, 
respectively). Post-operative agitation in children without URI occurred less 
frequently during the pandemic than before (2.3% vs. 16.2%, P = 0.001). 
Behaviors before the COVID-19 pandemic (odds ratio = 2.84, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.76-4.58) and recent URI (odds ratio = 1.79, 95% CI 1.09-2.92) 
were associated with PRAEs.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic-related behavioral changes were associated with a 
reduction in PRAEs in non-URI and URI children undergoing elective therapeutic 
cardiac catheterization."
548,"PURPOSE: The combination of taxanes and anthracyclines is still the mainstay of 
chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Capecitabine is an active drug with a 
favorable toxicity profile, showing strong anti-tumor activity against 
metastatic breast cancer. This trial assessed the efficacy and safety of the TX 
regimen (docetaxel and capecitabine) and compared it with the TE (docetaxel and 
epirubicin) regimen in locally advanced or high risk early HER2-negative breast 
cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted at five 
academic centers in China. Eligible female patients were randomly assigned (1:1) 
to the TX (docetaxel 75 mg/m2 d1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice d1-14, q3w) 
or TE (docetaxel 75 mg/m2 d1 plus epirubicin 75 mg/m2 d1, q3w) groups for four 
cycles. The primary endpoint was a pathological complete response in the breast 
(pCR). Secondary endpoints included pCR in the breast and axilla, invasive 
disease-free survival (iDFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.
RESULTS: Between September 1, 2012, and December 31, 2018, 113 HER2-negative 
patients were randomly assigned to the study groups (TX: n = 54; TE: n = 59). In 
the primary endpoint analysis, 14 patients in the TX group achieved a pCR, and 
nine patients in the TE group achieved a pCR (25.9% vs. 15.3%), with a not 
significant difference of 10.6% (95% CI -6.0-27.3%; P = 0.241). In a subgroup 
with high Ki-67 score, TX increased the pCR rate by 24.2% (95% CI 2.2-46.1%; 
P = 0.029). At the end of the 69-month median follow-up period, both groups had 
equivalent iDFS and OS rates. TX was associated with a higher incidence of 
hand-foot syndrome and less alopecia, with a manageable toxicity profile.
CONCLUSION: The anthracycline-free TX regimen yielded comparable pCR and 
long-term survival rates to the TE regimen. Thus, this anthracycline-free 
regimen could be considered in selected patients.

549,"BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence demonstrating the incidence of Acute 
Coronary Syndrome (ACS) among patients with cirrhosis, with the initiation of 
antiplatelet therapy being subject to debate due to an increased risk of 
bleeding. This study aimed to determine mortality among patients presenting with 
concomitant Acute Variceal Bleeding (AVB) and ACS at Index admission. 
Furthermore, the recurrence of AVB and ACS among patients discharged with or 
without antiplatelet therapy was determined.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at the Aga Khan University 
Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan on patients ≥ 18 years of age admitted to our ER 
with concomitant ACS and AVB between January 2002 to December 2017. Follow-up 
for 6 months or till death (if < 6 months), was observed, to help determine the 
incidence of recurrent AVB and ACS. The incidence of AVB and ACS was then 
compared amongst patient groups based on the usage of anti-platelet drugs on 
discharge.
RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were included, with a mean age of 58.7 ± 11.0 
years. Seven patients died on admission, having worse underlying liver disease. 
No mortality was reported among the remaining 22 patients. All 22 patients 
underwent surveillance endoscopy with variceal band ligation until obliteration, 
as needed. Only 7 patients from the surviving cohort received antiplatelet 
therapy. After 6.05 ± 1.1 months of follow-up, 1/22 (4.5%) developed recurrent 
AVB and 2/22 (9.1%) developed cardiovascular events. Importantly, there was no 
significant difference in the incidence of recurrent AVB (P = 1.000) and ACS 
(P = 0.091), depending on the use of antiplatelet therapy.
CONCLUSION: Concomitant AVB and ACS is a severe disorder with increased 
mortality among cirrhotic patients at presentation. The incidence of AVB does 
not seem to exacerbate with the use of antiplatelet agents, provided successful 
obliteration of varices is achieved using elective band ligation."
550,"BACKGROUND: During surgery, any mismatch between oxygen delivery (DO2) and 
consumption (VO2) can promote the development of postoperative complications. 
The respiratory exchange ratio (RER), defined as the ratio of carbon dioxide 
(CO2) production (VCO2) to VO2, may be a useful noninvasive tool for detecting 
inadequate DO2. The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis 
that RER measured during liver transplantation may predict postoperative 
morbidity. Secondary objectives were to assess the ability of other variables 
used to assess the DO2/VO2 relationship, including arterial lactate, mixed 
venous oxygen saturation, and veno-arterial difference in the partial pressure 
of carbon dioxide (VAPCO2gap), to predict postoperative complications.
METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive adult patients who 
underwent liver transplantation for end stage liver disease from June 27th, 
2020, to September 5th, 2021. Patients with acute liver failure were excluded. 
All patients were routinely equipped with a pulmonary artery catheter. The 
primary analysis was a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve constructed 
to investigate the discriminative ability of the mean RER measured during 
surgery to predict postoperative complications. RER was calculated at five 
standardized time points during the surgery, at the same time as measurement of 
blood lactate levels and arterial and mixed venous blood gases, which were 
compared as a secondary analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 115 patients included, 57 developed at least one postoperative 
complication. The mean RER (median [25-75] percentiles) during surgery was 
significantly higher in patients with complications than in those without 
(1.04[0.96-1.12] vs 0.88[0.84-0.94]; p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve 
was 0.87 (95%CI: 0.80-0.93; p < 0.001) with a RER value (Youden index) of 0.92 
giving a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 74% for predicting the 
occurrence of postoperative complications. The RER outperformed all other 
measured variables assessing the DO2/VO2 relationship (arterial lactate, SvO2, 
and VAPCO2gap) in predicting postoperative complications.
CONCLUSION: During liver transplantation, the RER can reliably predict 
postoperative complications. Implementing this measure intraoperatively may 
provide a warning for physicians of impending complications and justify more 
aggressive optimization of oxygen delivery. Further studies are required to 
determine whether correcting the RER is feasible and could reduce the incidence 
of complications."
551,"BCKGROUND: Edwardsiella tarda, an Enterobacteriaceae family member, is prevalent 
in different aquatic settings and rarely infects humans. As a result of eating 
raw or undercooked seafood, humans become infected through their intestinal 
tracts. Extraintestinal infections have been reported infrequently, mostly in 
immunocompromised and chronically ill patients.
CASE PRESENTATION: Our report describes a case of urinary tract infection caused 
by E. tarda in a 4-year-old female patient with a history of urinary tract 
infection and a complaint of fever, dysuria, and frequency. E. tarda was 
identified as the pathogen isolated from the urine culture. The patient's 
symptoms were alleviated after receiving ceftriaxone and then nitrofurantoin.
CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that even in immunocompetent patients, E. 
tarda can infect extraintestinal organs, including urinary tract. Our patient 
represents the first case of E. tarda infection in Iran and due to the fact that 
this pathogen is transmitted by aquatic animals, there is a possibility of 
infecting more aquatic animals and humans in Iran; therefore, the necessary 
precautions should be taken."
552,"BACKGROUND: Estimating the average effect of a treatment, exposure, or 
intervention on health outcomes is a primary aim of many medical studies. 
However, unbalanced covariates between groups can lead to confounding bias when 
using observational data to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE). In this 
study, we proposed an estimator to correct confounding bias and provide multiple 
protection for estimation consistency.
METHODS: With reference to the kernel function-based double-index propensity 
score (Ker.DiPS) estimator, we proposed the artificial neural network-based 
multi-index propensity score (ANN.MiPS) estimator. The ANN.MiPS estimator 
employed the artificial neural network to estimate the MiPS that combines the 
information from multiple candidate models for propensity score and outcome 
regression. A Monte Carlo simulation study was designed to evaluate the 
performance of the proposed ANN.MiPS estimator. Furthermore, we applied our 
estimator to real data to discuss its practicability.
RESULTS: The simulation study showed the bias of the ANN.MiPS estimators is very 
small and the standard error is similar if any one of the candidate models is 
correctly specified under all evaluated sample sizes, treatment rates, and 
covariate types. Compared to the kernel function-based estimator, the ANN.MiPS 
estimator usually yields smaller standard error when the correct model is 
incorporated in the estimator. The empirical study indicated the point 
estimation for ATE and its bootstrap standard error of the ANN.MiPS estimator is 
stable under different model specifications.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed estimator extended the combination of information from 
two models to multiple models and achieved multiply robust estimation for ATE. 
Extra efficiency was gained by our estimator compared to the kernel-based 
estimator. The proposed estimator provided a novel approach for estimating the 
causal effects in observational studies."
553,"BACKGROUND: Many metagenomic studies have linked the imbalance in microbial 
abundance profiles to a wide range of diseases. These studies suggest utilizing 
the microbial abundance profiles as potential markers for metagenomic-associated 
conditions. Due to the inevitable importance of biomarkers in understanding the 
disease progression and the development of possible therapies, various 
computational tools have been proposed for metagenomic biomarker detection. 
However, most existing tools require prior scripting knowledge and lack user 
friendly interfaces, causing considerable time and effort to install, configure, 
and run these tools. Besides, there is no available all-in-one solution for 
running and comparing various metagenomic biomarker detection simultaneously. In 
addition, most of these tools just present the suggested biomarkers without any 
statistical evaluation for their quality.
RESULTS: To overcome these limitations, this work presents MetaAnalyst, a 
software package with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that (i) automates 
the installation and configuration of 28 state-of-the-art tools, (ii) supports 
flexible study design to enable studying the dataset under different scenarios 
smoothly, iii) runs and evaluates several algorithms simultaneously iv) supports 
different input formats and provides the user with several preprocessing 
capabilities, v) provides a variety of metrics to evaluate the quality of the 
suggested markers, and vi) presents the outcomes in the form of publication 
quality plots with various formatting capabilities as well as Excel sheets.
CONCLUSIONS: The utility of this tool has been verified through studying a 
metagenomic dataset under four scenarios. The executable file for MetaAnalyst 
along with its user manual are made available at 
https://github.com/mshawaqfeh/MetaAnalyst ."
554,"BACKGROUND: During the last few decades, the diverse sources of resistance, 
several genes and QTLs for spot blotch resistance have been identified. However, 
a large set of germplasm lines are still unexplored that have the potential to 
develop highly resistant wheat cultivars for the target environments. Therefore, 
the identification of new sources of resistance to spot blotch is essential for 
breeding programmes to develop spot blotch resistant cultivars and sustain wheat 
production. The association mapping panel of 294 diverse bread wheat accessions 
was used to explore new sources of spot blotch disease resistance and to 
identify genomic regions using genome wide association analysis (GWAS). The 
genotypes were tested in replicated trials for spot blotch disease at three 
major hot spots in India (Varanasi in UP, Pusa in Bihar, and Cooch Behar in West 
Bengal). The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated to 
assess the level of resistance in each genotype.
RESULTS: A total of 19 highly and 76 moderately resistant lines were identified. 
Three accessions (EC664204, IC534306 and IC535188) were nearly immune to spot 
blotch disease. The genotyping of all accessions resulted in a total of 16,787 
high-quality polymorphic SNPs. The GWAS was performed using a Compressed Mixed 
Linear Model (CMLM) and a Mixed Linear Model (MLM). A total of seven significant 
MTAs, common in both the models and consistent across the environment, were 
further validated to develop KASP markers. Four MTAs (AX-94710084, AX-94865722, 
AX-95135556, and AX-94529408) on three chromosomes (2AL, 2BL, and 3BL) have been 
successfully validated through the KASP marker.
CONCLUSIONS: The new source of resistance was identified from unexplored 
germplasm lines. The genomic regions identified through GWAS were validated 
through KASP markers. The marker information and the highly resistant sources 
are valuable resources to rapidly develop immune or near immune wheat varieties."
555,"Our previous study using systems vaccinology identified an association between 
the sterol regulatory binding protein (SREBP) pathway and humoral immune 
response to vaccination in humans. To investigate the role of SREBP signaling in 
modulating immune responses, we generated mice with B cell- or CD11c+ 
antigen-presenting cell (APC)-specific deletion of SCAP, an essential regulator 
of SREBP signaling. Ablation of SCAP in CD11c+ APCs had no effect on immune 
responses. In contrast, SREBP signaling in B cells was critical for antibody 
responses, as well as the generation of germinal centers,memory B cells and bone 
marrow plasma cells. SREBP signaling was required for metabolic reprogramming in 
activated B cells. Upon mitogen stimulation, SCAP-deficient B cells could not 
proliferate and had decreased lipid rafts. Deletion of SCAP in germinal center B 
cells using AID-Cre decreased lipid raft content and cell cycle progression. 
These studies provide mechanistic insights coupling sterol metabolism with the 
quality and longevity of humoral immunity."
556,"Pregnancy is a remarkable time of pronounced growth and development of the 
fetus. Benign pathologies outside of the uterus, including those containing 
hormonally responsive tissue which undergo physiologic changes and other 
incidentally identified lesions, may mimic malignancy on clinical evaluation and 
imaging. A detailed history and physical exam, ultrasound and non-contrast 
magnetic resonance imaging features and comparison with prior imaging if 
available may help to narrow the list of potential differential diagnoses. 
Follow-up imaging in the postpartum period is often vital to confirm benignity 
and, in some cases, sampling to confirm the diagnosis is necessary. This review 
will cover the clinical, pathological and multimodality imaging features of 
numerous potential mimickers of cancer in the setting of pregnancy organized by 
organ systems. The goal is to better equip abdominal radiologists to accurately 
identify benign disease and help guide further imaging or follow-up 
recommendations to avoid unnecessarily aggressive intervention and improve 
patient care."
557,"Bone marrow studies currently provide a lot of valuable information in the 
diagnostics of hematological diseases including hematopoietic stem cells 
disorders. Our studies on low-molecular weight organic compounds in bone marrow 
stem cell niche in various pathogenic conditions, revealed relatively high 
variability of histamine levels in different groups of hematological diseases. 
It was also found that serotonin levels were significantly lower than those 
typically measured in peripheral blood as well as many have the influence on 
stem cells proliferative potential. This paper presents findings from 
quantitative and statistical analyses of histamine and serotonin levels. Bone 
marrow collected from patients undergoing routine diagnostic procedures for 
hematological diseases and receiving inpatient treatment were analyzed. 
Histamine and serotonin levels were measured using hydrophilic interaction 
liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Obtained 
data were analyzed statistically and correlated with the diagnosed groups of 
hematological diseases and the parameters of complete blood counts. Histamine 
was found in all tested samples, including those from patients without 
malignancy, and the reported levels were comparable to the reference values in 
blood. This observation allows us to assume that bone marrow cells can produce 
and accumulate histamine. Moreover, the statistical analysis revealed a 
significant relationship between histamine levels and diagnosed mastocytosis, 
and between histamine levels and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Different results 
were obtained for serotonin, and its concentrations in most cases were below the 
limit of quantification of the method used (< 0.2 ng/mL), which can only be 
compared to peripheral blood plasma. In a few cases, significantly higher 
serotonin levels were observed and it concerned diseases associated with an 
increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow."
558,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common but fatal complication after cardiac 
surgery. In the absence of effective treatments, the identification and 
modification of risk factors has been a major component of disease management. 
However, the optimal blood pressure target for preventing cardiac 
surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) remains unclear. We sought to 
determine the effect of postoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) in CSA-AKI. 
It is hypothesized that longer periods of hypotension after cardiac surgery are 
associated with an increased risk of AKI. This prospective cohort study was 
conducted on adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery requiring 
cardiopulmonary bypass at a tertiary center between October 2018 and May 2020. 
The primary outcome is the occurrence of CSA-AKI. MAP and its duration in the 
ranges of less than 65, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 mmHg within 24 h after surgery 
were recorded. The association between postoperative MAP and CSA-AKI was 
examined by using logistic regression. Among the 353 patients enrolled, 217 
(61.5%) had a confirmed diagnosis of CSA-AKI. Each 1 h epoch of postoperative 
MAP less than 65 mmHg was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.208 (95% 
CI, 1.007 to 1.449; P = 0.042), and each 1 h epoch of postoperative MAP between 
65 and 74 mmHg was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.144 (95% CI, 
1.026 to 1.275; P = 0.016) for CSA-AKI. A potentially modifiable risk factor, 
postoperative MAP less than 75 mmHg for 1 h or more is associated with an 
increased risk of CSA-AKI."
559,"BACKGROUND: The SAGES Guidelines Committee has implemented processes for Quality 
Assessment of SAGES-endorsed guidelines, with the aim of improving the quality 
of published guidelines.
METHODS: We provide details of the processes developed, using standardized tools 
for assessing the methodological quality of practice guidelines. As an example, 
we describe the application of our processes to the recent multi-societal GERD 
consensus guideline.
RESULTS: Assessment of the multi-societal GERD consensus guideline by the 
iterative processes of SAGES Quality Assurance taskforce improved the quality of 
the final manuscript in all domains of appraisal. These processes are easily 
applicable to future guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: Such systems will increase the confidence in SAGES recommendations 
and increase the implementation of SAGES guidelines. By demonstrating the rigor 
of Quality Assessment, this confidence also extends to a further increase in the 
assurance of the publications of the Surgical Endoscopy journal."
560,"BACKGROUND: After subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), early brain injury (EBI) and 
delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) lead to poor outcomes. Discovery of biomarkers 
indicative of disease severity and predictive of DCI is important. We tested 
whether leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a marker of severity, DCI, 
and functional outcomes after SAH.
METHODS: We performed untargeted proteomics using mass spectrometry in plasma 
samples collected at < 48 h of SAH in two independent discovery cohorts (n = 27 
and n = 45) and identified LRG1 as a biomarker for DCI. To validate our 
findings, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed this finding 
in an internal validation cohort of plasma from 72 study participants with SAH 
(22 DCI and 50 non-DCI). Further, we investigated the relationship between LRG1 
and markers of EBI, DCI, and poor functional outcomes (quantified by the 
modified Rankin Scale). We also measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 
LRG1 and investigated its relationship to EBI, DCI, and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Untargeted proteomics revealed higher plasma LRG1 levels across EBI 
severity and DCI in both discovery cohorts. In the validation cohort, the levels 
of LRG1 were higher in the DCI group compared with the non-DCI group (mean 
(SD): 95 [44] vs. 72 [38] pg/ml, p < 0.05, Student's t-test) and in study 
participants who proceeded to have poor functional outcomes (84 [39.3] vs. 72 
[43.2] pg/ml, p < 0.05). Elevated plasma LRG1 levels were also associated with 
markers of EBI. However, CSF levels of LRG1 were not associated with EBI 
severity or the occurrence of DCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma LRG1 is a biomarker for EBI, DCI, and functional outcomes 
after SAH. Further studies to elucidate the role of LRG1 in the pathophysiology 
of SAH are needed."
561,"In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified that has caused significant morbidity 
and mortality worldwide. Like all RNA viruses, severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) evolves over time through random mutation 
resulting in genetic variations in the population. Although the currently 
approved coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines can be given to those over 5 years of 
age and older in most countries, strikingly, the number of people diagnosed 
positive for SARS-Cov-2 is still increasing. Therefore, to prevent and control 
this epidemic, early diagnosis of infected individuals is of great importance. 
The current detection of SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus variants are mainly based on 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Although the sensitivity of 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is high, it has some 
disadvantages, for example, multiple temperature changes, long detection time, 
complicated operation, expensive instruments, and the need for professional 
personnel, which brings considerable inconvenience to the early diagnosis of 
this virus. This review comprehensively summarizes the development and 
application of various current detection technologies for novel coronaviruses, 
including isothermal amplification, CRISPR-Cas detection, serological detection, 
biosensor, ensemble, and microfluidic technology, along with next-generation 
sequencing. Those findings offer us a great potential to replace or combine with 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detection to achieve the purpose 
of allowing predictive diagnostics and targeted prevention of SARS-Cov-2 in the 
future."
562,"This study aimed to explore the role of ribosomal protein L8 (RPL8) in 
controlling hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) development. We measured RPL8 
expression, apoptosis, cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, 
glucose uptake, lactate production, and the ATP/ADP ratio of LIHC cells to 
investigate the effect of RPL8 on LIHC. Bioinformatic analysis was employed to 
analyse RPL8 expression and its potential mechanism in LIHC. RPL8 was 
upregulated in LIHC tissues and cells. RPL8 silencing accelerated apoptosis and 
suppressed viability, growth, and movement of LIHC cells. Additionally, RPL8 
silencing inhibited glycolysis in LIHC cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 
that RPL8 is regulated by the upstream transcription factor upstream stimulating 
factor 1 (USF1) and activates the mTORC1 signalling pathway. USF1 overexpression 
eliminated the inhibitory effect of RPL8 silencing in LIHC cells. RPL8 
overexpression increased cell growth, movement, and glycolysis in LIHC. However, 
inhibition of the mTORC1 signalling pathway eliminated the effect of RPL8 
overexpression on LIHC cells. In conclusion, RPL8 may affect LIHC progression by 
regulating the mTORC1 signalling pathway."
563,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is implicated in the injury of several organs, including 
the brain resulting in neuronal damage, which may lead to cognitive impairment 
and dementia. Additionally, it is linked to inflammation, cytokine release, 
apoptosis and various degenerative conditions. Astrocytes and microglia might 
have a role in mediating these processes. Caffeine, a psychoactive beverage, has 
been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive and memory impairment. This study 
proposes anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic role of caffeine, which can be 
mediated via microglia/astrocyte activation and overexpression of 
pro-inflammatory molecules. T2D was induced in rats by feeding with high fat 
high sugar diet and injecting a single low dose streptozotocin (STZ) 
intraperitoneally. Other diabetic rats were given caffeine orally (in two doses) 
for 5 weeks, starting 1 week before STZ injection. Measurement of plasma 
cytokines, TNFα and IL6, was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) technique. After sacrificing animals, brains were obtained and processed 
for histological evaluation. Immunohistochemistry was also performed using the 
following primary antibodies, anti-astrocyte marker GFAP, anti-microglia marker 
CD11b and apoptotic marker (anti-cleaved caspase-3). There was upregulation of 
IL6 and TNF-α in diabetic rats. Additionally, histological evaluation of the 
hippocampus of diabetic rats revealed cellular degeneration. There was increased 
immunostaining of GFAP, CD11b and cleaved caspase-3 in diabetic rats. 
Pretreatment with caffeine to diabetic rats, resulted in improvement of 
structural changes and decrease in cytokine levels and immuno-markers, 
expression, and this was in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, caffeine had 
an ameliorative role in enhancing hippocampal degenerative changes in T2D."
564,"Homeostasis of the oviductal infundibulum epithelium is continuously regulated 
by signaling pathways under physiological and pathological conditions. Herein, 
we investigated the expression of hedgehog (Hh) signaling-related components in 
the murine oviductal infundibulum, which is known to maintain homeostasis in the 
adult epithelium. Additionally, using autoimmune disease-prone 
MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice showing abnormal morphofunction of the 
ciliated epithelium of the infundibulum related to the oviductal inflammation, 
we examined the relationship between Hh signaling and pathology of the 
infundibulum. The expression and localization of Pax8, a marker for progenitor 
cells in the oviductal epithelium, and Foxj1, a marker for ciliogenesis, were 
examined in the infundibulum. The results showed that Pax8 was downregulated and 
Foxj1 was upregulated with aging, suggesting that homeostasis of the 
infundibulum epithelium of MRL/lpr mice was disturbed at 6 months of age. In all 
mice, the motile cilia of ciliated epithelial cells in the infundibulum harbored 
Hh signaling pathway-related molecules: patched (Ptch), smoothened (Smo), and 
epithelial cells harbor Gli. In contrast, Ptch, Smo, and Gli2 were significantly 
downregulated in the infundibulum of MRL/lpr mice at 6 months of age. The 
expression levels of Pax8 and Foxj1 were significantly positively correlated 
with those of Ptch1, Smo, and Gli2. Hh signaling is thought to be involved in 
homeostasis of the ciliated epithelium in the infundibulum. In MRL/lpr mice, 
which show exacerbated severe systemic autoimmune abnormalities, molecular 
alterations in Hh signaling-related components are considered to interact with 
local inflammation in the infundibulum, leading to disturbances in epithelial 
homeostasis and reproductive function."

566,"INTRODUCTION: Acromegaly is a rare chronic endocrine disorder that can lead to 
significant quality of life (QoL) impairment and persistent symptomatology in 
both biochemically uncontrolled as well as in cured or controlled patients. We 
aimed to conduct an observational cross-sectional study investigating the 
associations between biochemical disease control, associated comorbidities, and 
symptoms severity on QoL in a cohort of acromegalic patients.
METHODS: Thirty-one patients with acromegaly were enrolled in our study. AcroQoL 
and PASQ (Pain assessed acromegaly symptoms questionnaire) questionnaires were 
applied to all patients. Information about disease status, associated 
comorbidities, and other relevant clinical and paraclinical data were gathered.
RESULTS: Patients with uncontrolled acromegaly presented worse QoL and symptoms 
scores than controlled patients, but the difference was not statistically 
significant (AcroQoL 57.22 vs 64.04, p > 0.05; PASQ 12 vs 16.47, p > 0.05). 
Worse symptoms were significantly associated with impaired QoL (overall symptoms 
score on PASQ was negatively correlated with AcroQoL total score, r = - 0.61, 
p < 0.05). Cardiovascular complications were associated with lower QoL scores, 
but not with worse symptoms (AcroQoL total score in patients with- versus 
patients without cardiovascular complications: 54.89 vs 70.14, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving biochemical control of acromegaly might not be enough to 
reverse the QoL impairment and improve symptomatology in acromegalic patients. 
While symptoms severity and the presence of cardiovascular complications seem to 
play an important role in reducing patients QoL, the roles of disease control, 
diabetes, and pituitary insufficiency are less clear."
567,"BACKGROUND: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) plus radiotherapy (BCS + RT) has 
been shown to improve survival compared with mastectomy in patients with early 
breast cancer; however, whether this superiority is maintained in breast cancer 
patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is unclear. We evaluated and 
compared the survival outcomes after BCS + RT and mastectomy in Korean women 
with breast cancer treated with NCT.
METHODS: We evaluated 1641 patients who received NCT before surgery (BCS or 
mastectomy). We performed propensity score matching to minimize potential bias 
due to factors other than the surgical method and compared the 5-year, 
disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and 
overall survival (OS) rates before and after exact matching.
RESULTS: Among the 1641 patients, 839 (51.1%) underwent BCS + RT and 802 (48.9%) 
underwent mastectomy. Patients who underwent mastectomy had larger tumors and 
more frequently had positive nodes. For BCS+RT and mastectomy, the unadjusted 
5-year DFS, 5-year DMFS, and 5-year OS rates were 87.0% and 73.1%, 89.5% and 
77.0%, and 91.8% and 81.0%, respectively (all p < 0.05 = 0.000). After PSM, 
5-year DFS, 5-year DMFS, and 5-year OS rates for BCS + RT and mastectomy were 
87.6% and 69.1%, 89.7% and 76.0%, and 89.1% and 75.7%, respectively (all p < 
0.05). In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses accounting for various 
confounding factors, BCS + RT was significantly associated with improved DFS (p 
< 0.05), DMFS (p < 0.05), and OS (p < 0.05) rates compared with mastectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: BCS + RT does not impair DFS and OS in patients treated with NCT. 
Tumor biology and treatment response are significant prognostic indicators. Our 
results suggest that BCS + RT may be preferred in most breast cancer patients 
when both BCS and mastectomy are suitable."
568,"With the rising number of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT), clinicians are more likely to encounter infectious 
complications in immunocompromised hosts, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
infection. Besides the high mortality of CMV end-organ disease, patients with 
detectable CMV viremia may have worse outcomes and decreased survival even in 
the absence of end-organ disease. In view of the implications on morbidity and 
mortality, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and initiate 
antiviral drugs promptly when CMV infection is confirmed. High-risk patients 
should be identified in order to provide optimal management. Additionally, novel 
antiviral agents with a good safety profile and minor adverse events are now 
available for prophylaxis in high-risk patients and for treatment of resistant 
or refractory CMV infection. The following review provides concise, yet 
comprehensive, guidance on the burden and risk factors of CMV in this 
population, as well as an update on the latest evidence for the management of 
CMV infection."
569,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molecular imaging of the dopamine transporters (DAT) 
provides valuable information about neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
Parkinson's. This study assessed the accuracy and precision of DAT-SPECT 
quantification methods.
METHODS: Twenty-three DAT-SPECT images of a striatal phantom were acquired. The 
specific (caudate and putamen) and the non-specific (background activity) 
chambers were filled with [99mTc]Tc. Different specific-to-non-specific activity 
ratios (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2 to 1) and the specific binding ratio (SBR) 
were calculated. Five methods using ROIs were assessed: (a) Manual ROIs on SPECT 
images; (b) TwoBox and (c) ThreeBox methods and Volume of Interest (VOI) using 
structural images; (d) MRI and (e) CT. Accuracy was evaluated by the concordance 
correlation coefficient (CCC) and precision by Pearson's coefficient and linear 
regression.
RESULTS: The SBR quantified in the specific and striatal chambers resulted in a 
CCC increase with a decrease in the nominal values. For lower SBR, MRI and CT 
showed higher CCCs when caudate ([Formula: see text] = 0.89 e [Formula: see 
text] = 0.84) and putamen ([Formula: see text] = 0.86 e [Formula: see text] = 
0.82) were evaluated. For striatal assessments, the TwoBox method was the most 
accurate ([Formula: see text] = 0.95). High Pearson's coefficients were found in 
the correlations between all methods.
CONCLUSIONS: All five methods showed high precision even when applied to images 
with different activities. MRI and CT were the most accurate for assessing the 
caudate or putamen. To assess the striatal chamber and in the absence of 
structural information, the TwoBox method is advisable."
570,"Cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction and heart failure have been the 
leading cause of death worldwide for more than 20 years, and new treatments 
continue to be investigated. Heart transplantation, a curative treatment for 
severe cardiac dysfunction, is available to only a small number of patients due 
to the rarity of donors and high costs. Cardiac regenerative medicine using 
embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells is expected to be a new 
alternative to heart transplantation, but it has problems such as induction of 
immune response, tumor formation, and low survival rate of transplanted cells. 
On the other hand, there has been a focus on cell-free therapy using 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) due to their high biocompatibility and target 
specificity. Exosomes, one type of EV, play a role in the molecular transport 
system in vivo and can be considered a drug delivery system (DDS) innate to all 
living things. Exosomes contain nucleic acids and proteins, which are 
transported from secretory cells to recipient cells. Molecules in exosomes are 
encapsulated in a lipid bilayer, which allows them to exist stably in body 
fluids without being affected by nuclease degradation enzymes. Therefore, the 
therapeutic use of exosomes as DDSs has been widely explored and is being used 
in clinical trials and other clinical settings. This review summarizes the 
current topics of EVs as DDSs in cardiac disease."
571,"Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning 
regimens have expanded use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(HCT) in AML to include older and medically less-fit patients, but relative 
efficacies and toxicities remain poorly defined. Here, we analyzed outcomes from 
343 adults transplanted in remission after RIC (n = 137) or NMA (n = 206) 
conditioning between 2006 and 2021. The characteristics of RIC and NMA HCT 
patients were similar except that RIC patients were younger and their time 
between most recent remission achievement and allografting was shorter. There 
were no significant differences in relapse risk, relapse-free survival (RFS), 
overall survival (OS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) between RIC and NMA HCT 
patients, both overall (relapse: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80, P = 0.27; RFS: 
HR = 0.93, P = 0.61; OS: HR = 0.93, P = 0.66; NRM: HR = 1.13, P = 0.59) and when 
patients were stratified by pre-HCT measurable residual disease (MRD) status. 
After multivariable adjustment, there was no statistically significant 
association between conditioning intensity and relapse (HR = 0.69, P = 0.088), 
RFS (HR = 0.86, P = 0.37), OS (HR = 0.89, P = 0.49), or NRM (HR = 1.37, 
P = 0.19). In this non-randomized cohort of adults undergoing allografting for 
AML in first or second remission at our center, we could not detect 
statistically significant differences in outcomes between those assigned to RIC 
and those assigned to NMA conditioning."
572,"Cerebral ischemic stroke causes substantial white matter injury, which is 
further aggravated by neuroinflammation mediated by microglia/astrocytes. Given 
the anti-neuroinflammatory action of telmisartan and the enhancing blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) permeability potential of resuscitation-inducing aromatic herbs, 
13 hybrids (3a-m) of telmisartan (or its simplified analogues) with 
resuscitation-inducing aromatic agents were designed, synthesized, and 
biologically evaluated. Among them, the optimal compound 3a (the ester hybrid of 
telmisartan and (+)-borneol) potently inhibited neuroinflammation mediated by 
microglia/astrocytes and ameliorated ischemic stroke. Particularly, 3a 
significantly conferred protection for white matter integrity after cerebral 
ischemic stroke via decreasing abnormally dephosphorylated neurofilament 
protein, upregulating myelin basic protein, and attenuating oligodendrocyte 
damage. Further RNA-sequencing data revealed that 3a upregulated expression of 
transcriptional regulator ATF3 to reduce the expression of CH25H, prevented 
proinflammatory state of lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia/astrocytes to 
limit excessive inflammation, and eventually protected neighboring 
oligodendrocytes to prevent white matter injury. Taken with the desirable 
pharmacokinetics behavior and improved brain distribution, 3a may be a feasible 
therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke and other neurological disorders with 
white matter injury."
573,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential 
contribution of quantitative measurements of dural venous sinuses to the 
diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and the relationship 
between IIH and dural venous sinus dimensions on 3D post-gadolinium T1-weighted 
magnetic resonance (MR) images.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 129 individuals (57 IIH patients and 
72 controls) who complained of headache and underwent both magnetic resonance 
venography (MRV) and precontrast/postcontrast 3D T1-weighted MR imaging between 
2018 and 2021 were included in this retrospective study. Dural venous sinus and 
jugular vein diameters were measured in all cases using post-gadolinium 3D T1 
TFE images. The presence of transverse sinus (TS) hypoplasia and occipital sinus 
variation, the number and size of arachnoid granulations in the TS, and the 
presence of brain parenchymal herniation were also evaluated. Cut-off values 
that maximized accurate diagnosis of IIH were established on the receiver 
operating characteristic curve. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis 
of IIH based on quantitative measurements of the dural sinus were calculated.
RESULTS: The ratios of the maximum to minimum TS diameters and the minimum TS 
diameters to minimum sigmoid sinus (SS) diameters were significantly higher in 
IIH patients than in the control group (p < 0.001). The diagnostic sensitivity 
and specificity values of TSmax/TSmin and TSmin sum/SSmin sum parameters for the 
detection of IIH were 84.2%, 84.7% and 83.3%, 84.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Practical measurements from multiplanar T1 sequences can be useful 
for both quantitative assessment and overcoming misinterpretation due to 
anatomical variation."
574,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a debilitating and deadly disease characterized by low 
body mass index due to diminished food intake, and oftentimes concurrent 
hyperactivity. A high percentage of AN behavioral and metabolic phenotypes can 
be replicated in rodents given access to a voluntary running wheel and subject 
to food restriction, termed activity-based anorexia (ABA). Despite the 
well-documented bodyweight loss observed in AN human patients and ABA rodents, 
much less is understood regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of these 
maladaptive behaviors. Hunger-promoting hypothalamic agouti-related peptide 
(AgRP) neurons have been well characterized in their ability to regulate 
appetite, yet much less is known regarding their activity and function in the 
mediation of food intake during ABA. Here, feeding microstructure analysis 
revealed ABA mice decreased food intake due to increased interpellet interval 
retrieval and diminished meal number. Longitudinal activity recordings of AgRP 
neurons in ABA animals exhibited a maladaptive inhibitory response to food, 
independent of basal activity changes. We then demonstrated that ABA development 
or progression can be mitigated by chemogenetic AgRP activation through the 
reprioritization of food intake (increased meal number) over hyperactivity, but 
only during periods of food availability. These results elucidate a potential 
neural target for the amelioration of behavioral maladaptations present in AN 
patients."
575,"We recently nominated cytokine signaling through the Janus-kinase-signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway as a potential AD 
drug target. As hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has recently been shown to inactivate 
STAT3, we hypothesized that it may impact AD pathogenesis and risk. Among 
109,124 rheumatoid arthritis patients from routine clinical care, HCQ initiation 
was associated with a lower risk of incident AD compared to methotrexate 
initiation across 4 alternative analyses schemes addressing specific types of 
biases including informative censoring, reverse causality, and outcome 
misclassification (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] of 0.92 [0.83-1.00], 
0.87 [0.81-0.93], 0.84 [0.76-0.93], and 0.87 [0.75-1.01]). We additionally show 
that HCQ exerts dose-dependent effects on late long-term potentiation (LTP) and 
rescues impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity prior to significant 
accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 mice. 
Additionally, HCQ treatment enhances microglial clearance of Aβ1-42, lowers 
neuroinflammation, and reduces tau phosphorylation in cell culture-based 
phenotypic assays. Finally, we show that HCQ inactivates STAT3 in microglia, 
neurons, and astrocytes suggesting a plausible mechanism associated with its 
observed effects on AD pathogenesis. HCQ, a relatively safe and inexpensive drug 
in current use may be a promising disease-modifying AD treatment. This 
hypothesis merits testing through adequately powered clinical trials in at-risk 
individuals during preclinical stages of disease progression."
576,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been widely adopted as a tool for measuring 
common variant liability and they have been shown to predict lifetime risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. However, the relationship between PRS and 
AD pathogenesis is largely unknown. To this end, we performed a 
differential gene-expression and associated disrupted biological pathway 
analyses of AD PRS vs. case/controls in human brain-derived cohort sample 
(cerebellum/temporal cortex; MayoRNAseq). The results highlighted already 
implicated mechanisms: immune and stress response, lipids, fatty acids and 
cholesterol metabolisms, endosome and cellular/neuronal death, being disrupted 
biological pathways in both case/controls and PRS, as well as previously less 
well characterised processes such as cellular structures, mitochondrial 
respiration and secretion. Despite heterogeneity in terms of differentially 
expressed genes in case/controls vs. PRS, there was a consensus of commonly 
disrupted biological mechanisms. Glia and microglia-related terms were also 
significantly disrupted, albeit not being the top disrupted Gene Ontology terms. 
GWAS implicated genes were significantly and in their majority, up-regulated in 
response to different PRS among the temporal cortex samples, suggesting 
potential common regulatory mechanisms. Tissue specificity in terms of disrupted 
biological pathways in temporal cortex vs. cerebellum was observed in relation 
to PRS, but limited tissue specificity when the datasets were analysed as 
case/controls. The largely common biological mechanisms between a case/control 
classification and in association with PRS suggests that PRS stratification can 
be used for studies where suitable case/control samples are not available or the 
selection of individuals with high and low PRS in clinical trials."
577,"A potential relationship between dysregulation of immune/inflammatory pathways 
and cognitive impairment has been suggested in severe mental illnesses (SMI), 
such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar (BD) spectrum disorders. However, 
multivariate relationships between peripheral inflammatory/immune-related 
markers and cognitive domains are unclear, and many studies do not account for 
inter-individual variance in both cognitive functioning and inflammatory/immune 
status. This study aimed to investigate covariance patterns between 
inflammatory/immune-related markers and cognitive domains and further elucidate 
heterogeneity in a large SMI and healthy control (HC) cohort (SZ = 343, 
BD = 289, HC = 770). We applied canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify 
modes of maximum covariation between a comprehensive selection of cognitive 
domains and inflammatory/immune markers. We found that poor verbal learning and 
psychomotor processing speed was associated with higher levels of interleukin-18 
system cytokines and beta defensin 2, reflecting enhanced activation of innate 
immunity, a pattern augmented in SMI compared to HC. Applying hierarchical 
clustering on covariance patterns identified by the CCA revealed a high 
cognition-low immune dysregulation subgroup with predominantly HC (24% SZ, 45% 
BD, 74% HC) and a low cognition-high immune dysregulation subgroup predominantly 
consisting of SMI patients (76% SZ, 55% BD, 26% HC). These subgroups differed in 
IQ, years of education, age, CRP, BMI (all groups), level of functioning, 
symptoms and defined daily dose (DDD) of antipsychotics (SMI cohort). Our 
findings suggest a link between cognitive impairment and innate immune 
dysregulation in a subset of individuals with severe mental illness."
578,"INTRODUCTION: Meta-analyses implicate immune dysfunction in depression 
confirming increased levels of circulating immune proteins (e.g., cytokines) in 
depression cases compared to controls. White blood cells (WBC) both produce and 
are influenced by cytokines, and play key roles in orchestrating innate and 
adaptive immune responses, but their role in depression remains unclear. 
Therefore, a systematic review of studies of various WBC subsets in depression 
is required for a greater understanding of the nature of immune dysfunction in 
this illness.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and PsycINFO databases (inception to 5th April 2022) 
and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of identified studies 
comparing absolute count and/or relative percentage of flow cytometry-derived 
WBC subsets between depression cases and controls. Selected studies were quality 
assessed. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included and 27 studies (n = 2277) were 
meta-analysed. We report an increase in mean absolute counts of WBC (seven 
studies; standardised mean difference [SMD] = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.61-1.53; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 64%), granulocytes (two studies; SMD = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.45-2.68; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 0%), neutrophils (four studies; SMD = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.23-1.58; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 82%), monocytes (seven studies; SMD = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.19-1.01; P < 0.01; 
I2 = 66%), CD4+ helper T cells (11 studies; SMD = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.15-0.45; 
P < 0.01; I2 = 0%), natural killer cells (11 studies; SMD = 1.23; 95% CI, 
0.38-2.08; P < 0.01; I2 = 95%), B cells (10 studies; SMD = 0.30; 95% CI, 
0.03-0.57; P = 0.03; I2 = 56%), and activated T cells (eight studies; 
SMD = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24-0.66; P < 0.01; I2 = 0%) in depression, compared to 
controls. Fewer studies reported relative percentage, indicating increased 
neutrophils and decreased total lymphocytes, Th1, and Th2 cells in depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression is characterised by widespread alterations in 
circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells, consistent with dysfunction in both 
innate and adaptive immunity. Immune cells could be useful biomarkers for 
illness subtyping and patient stratification in future immunotherapy trials of 
depression, along with cytokines, other biomarkers, and clinical measures."
579,"The review discusses the diagnostic application of biosensors as point-of-care 
devices in the COVID-19 pandemic. Biosensors are important analytical tools that 
can be used for the robust and effective detection of infectious diseases in 
real-time. In this current scenario, the utilization of smart, efficient 
biosensors for COVID-19 detection is increasing and we have included a few smart 
biosensors such as smart and intelligent based biosensors, plasmonic biosensors, 
field effective transister (FET) biosensors, smart optical biosensors, surface 
enhanced raman scattering (SERS) biosensor, screen printed electrode (SPE) based 
biosensor, molecular imprinted polymers (MIP) based biosensor, MXene based 
biosensor and Metal-Organic frame smart sensor. Their significance as well as 
the benefits and drawbacks of each kind of smart sensor are mentioned in depth. 
Furthermore, we have compiled a list of various biosensors which have been 
developed across the globe for COVID-19 and have shown the promise as commercial 
detection devices. Significant challenges in the development of effective 
diagnostic methods were discussed and recommendations have been made for better 
diagnostic outcomes to manage the ongoing pandemic effectively."
580,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones play a vital function in the maturation in the 
course of mind development. Regarding the well-known effects of choline on 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the study examined the effects of 
choline on hippocampal BDNF gene expression in maternal hypothyroidism rats.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To induce the hypothyroidism, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil was 
introduced to the ingesting water from the sixth day of gestation to 
twenty-first postnatal day (PND). Choline-treatment started twice a day on the 
first day of gestation until PND 21. On PND28, pups were sacrificed. The 
expression of BDNF gene was evaluated after the hippocampus was harvested. Our 
results demonstrated that both male and female pre-pubertal offspring rats' BDNF 
gene expression was decreased by developmental hypothyroidism. Choline increases 
the ratio of relative gene expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of males and 
females in the control/hypothyroidism group, especially in males.
CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that maternal choline supplementation on the 
first day of gestation until PND 21 improves brain development and cognitive 
function in pre-pubertal offspring rats regarding control/hypothyroidism groups."
581,"Chemotherapy plays an important role in debulking tumors in advance of surgery 
and/or radiotherapy, tackling residual disease, and treating metastatic disease. 
In recent years many promising advanced drug delivery strategies have emerged 
that offer more targeted delivery approaches to chemotherapy treatment. For 
example, thermosensitive liposome-mediated drug delivery in combination with 
localized mild hyperthermia can increase local drug concentrations resulting in 
a reduction in systemic toxicity and an improvement in local disease control. 
However, the majority of solid tumor-associated deaths are due to metastatic 
spread. A therapeutic approach focused on a localized target area harbors the 
risk of overlooking and undertreating potential metastatic spread. Previous 
studies reported systemic, albeit limited, anti-tumor effects following 
treatment with thermosensitive liposomal chemotherapy and localized mild 
hyperthermia. This work explores the systemic treatment capabilities of a 
thermosensitive liposome formulation of the vinca alkaloid vinorelbine in 
combination with mild hyperthermia in an immunocompetent murine model of 
rhabdomyosarcoma. This treatment approach was found to be highly effective at 
heated, primary tumor sites. However, it demonstrated limited anti-tumor effects 
in secondary, distant tumors. As a result, the addition of immune checkpoint 
inhibition therapy was pursued to further enhance the systemic anti-tumor effect 
of this treatment approach. Once combined with immune checkpoint inhibition 
therapy, a significant improvement in systemic treatment capability was 
achieved. We believe this is one of the first studies to demonstrate that a 
triple combination of thermosensitive liposomes, localized mild hyperthermia, 
and immune checkpoint inhibition therapy can enhance the systemic treatment 
capabilities of thermosensitive liposomes."
582,"INTRODUCTION: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is currently the most commonly performed 
bariatric procedure worldwide. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
long-term efficacy of SG as a stand-alone bariatric procedure.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis of 104 patients who underwent SG 
as a stand-alone bariatric procedure between January 2005 and December 2009. 
Weight loss, weight regain, remission or improvement of comorbidities and the 
new onset of comorbidities were the main outcomes of the study.
RESULTS: The percent excess body weight loss (%EBWL), percent excess body mass 
weight (BMI) loss (%EBMIL), and percent total body weight loss (%TBWL) were 
59 ± 25, 69 ± 29, and 29 ± 12, respectively, after a mean follow-up of 
13.4 years. At the last follow-up, nearly two thirds of patients (67.3%) had an 
%EBWL greater than 50. The percentage of patients who experienced significant 
weight regain ranged from 47 to 64%, depending on the definition used for weight 
regain. The rate of improvement or remission of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, 
dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and degenerative joint disease at a mean 
follow-up of 13.4 years was 40%, 94.7%, 70%, 100%, and 42.9%, respectively. The 
new onset of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in the same period 
was 43%.
CONCLUSION: Our data supports that SG results in long-lasting weight loss in the 
majority of patients and acceptable rates of remission or improvement of 
comorbidities. Weight regain and GERD may be issues of particular concern during 
long-term follow-up after SG."
583,"To explore the fitting effect of the ARIMA, GM(1,1), and RANSAC model in the 
changes of white blood cells (WBC) in benzene-exposed workers, and select the 
optimal model to predict the WBC count of workers. Among 350 employees in an 
aerospace process manufacturing enterprise in Nanjing, workers with 10 years of 
benzene exposure were selected, and used Excel software to organize the WBC 
data, and the ARIMA model and RANSAC model were established by R software, and 
the GM(1, 1) model was established by DPS software, and the magnitude of the 
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of fitting three models to WBC counts was 
compared. The MAPE based on the ARIMA(2,1,2) model is 6.78%, the MAPE based on 
the GM(1,1) model is 5.19%, and the MAPE based on the RANSAC model is 6.37%, so 
the GM( 1,1) model was more suitable for fitting the trend of WBC counts in 
benzene exposed workers in this study. The GM(1,1) model is suitable for fitting 
WBC counts in a small sample size and can provide a short-term prediction of WBC 
counts in benzene-exposed workers and provide basic information for occupational 
health risk assessment of workers."
584,"The direct link between neuropathology and the symptoms that emerge from damage 
to the brain is often difficult to discern. In this perspective, we argue that a 
satisfying account of neurodegenerative symptoms most naturally emerges from the 
consideration of the brain from the systems-level. Specifically, we will 
highlight the role of the neuromodulatory arousal system, which is uniquely 
positioned to coordinate the brain's ability to flexibly integrate the otherwise 
segregated structures required to support higher cognitive functions. 
Importantly, the neuromodulatory arousal system is highly heterogeneous, 
encompassing structures that are common sites of neurodegeneration across 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. We will review studies that implicate the 
dysfunctional interactions amongst distributed brain regions as a side-effect of 
pathological involvement of the neuromodulatory arousal system in these 
neurodegenerative disorders. From this perspective, we will argue that future 
work in clinical neuroscience should attempt to consider the inherent complexity 
in the brain and employ analytic techniques that do not solely focus on regional 
functional impairments, but rather captures the brain as an inherently dynamic, 
distributed, multi-scale system. Through this lens, we hope that we will devise 
new and improved diagnostic markers and interventional approaches to aid in the 
treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."
585,"Gait and balance disorders are common signs in several neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonism, idiopathic normal 
pressure hydrocephalus, cerebrovascular disease, dementing disorders and

gait and balance alterations depending on the structural and functional brain 
changes through the disease course. In this review, we will summarize the main 
clinical characteristics of gait and balance disorders in the major 
neurodegenerative conditions, providing an overview of the significant 
structural and functional MRI brain alterations underlying these deficits. We 
also will discuss the role of neurorehabilitation strategies in promoting brain 
plasticity and gait/balance improvements in these patients."
586,"Dysregulation of inflammasome activation induces chronic and excess inflammation 
resulting in several disorders, such as metabolic disorders and cancers. Thus, 
screening for its regulator derived from natural materials has been conducted 
progressively. JC2-11 (JC) was designed to enhance the antioxidant activity 
based on a chalcone, which is abundant in edible plants and a precursor of 
flavonoids. This study examined the effects of JC on inflammasome activation in 
human and murine macrophages. JC inhibited the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β 
and lactate dehydrogenases, and the cleavage of caspase-1 and gasdermin D in 
response to the tested activators (i.e., NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and non-canonical 
inflammasome triggers). In addition, JC attenuated IL-1β secretion from 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected mice, an inflammasome-mediating disease model. 
Mechanistically, JC blocked the expression of the inflammasome components during 
the priming step of the inflammasome, and interrupted the production of 
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. In addition, JC inhibited the activity of 
caspase-1. In conclusion, JC may be a candidate pan-inflammasome inhibitor."
587,"Chronic cheilitis (CC) is a spectrum of inflammatory changes of unknown etiology 
that affect the vermilion of the lips. This study aimed to describe the 
epidemiology, clinical presentations and risk factors of CC. Patients with CC 
were recruited from the National Clinical Research Center for Oral Disease of 
China. A convenience sample of inhabitants who live in the same geographical 
region were recruited as the control group. The lip skin transepidermal water 
loss (TEWL) and capacitance of CC patients were compared with that of age- and 
gender-matched controls. Our results demonstrated that of the 109 patients with 
CC, 72 (66.1%; 95% CI: 57.0-75.1%) were female. The common clinical 
presentations of CC consisted of desquamation (n = 99; 90.8%), and/or chapping 
(n = 81; 74.3%), and/or pruritus (n = 64; 58.7%). Multivariable analysis showed 
that allergic dermatologic diseases (P < 0.001; OR: 4.5; 95% CI: 2.4-8.4), 
anemia (P = 0.001; OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.5-7.5), and indoor/outdoor alternate 
working environment (P < 0.001; OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.5-2.8) were the significant 
risk factors for CC. The mean lip skin TEWL was found to be significantly 
higher, while the capacitance was lower in CC patients compared to that of 
control individuals. This study provides insights into the etiopathogenesis of 
CC and may help clinicians to identify the most effective management strategies."
588,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: With the increasing survival of premature infants, there 
is an increased demand to provide adequate retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) 
services. Wide field retinal imaging (WFDRI) and artificial intelligence (AI) 
have shown promise in the field of ROP and have the potential to improve the 
diagnostic performance and reduce the workload for screening ophthalmologists. 
The aim of this review is to systematically review and provide a summary of the 
diagnostic characteristics of existing deep learning algorithms.
SUBJECT/METHODS: Two authors independently searched the literature, and studies 
using a deep learning system from retinal imaging were included. Data were 
extracted, assessed and reported using PRISMA guidelines.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included in this review. Nineteen studies 
used AI systems to diagnose ROP, classify the staging of ROP, diagnose the 
presence of pre-plus or plus disease, or assess the quality of retinal images. 
The included studies reported a sensitivity of 71%-100%, specificity of 74-99% 
and area under the curve of 91-99% for the primary outcome of the study. AI 
techniques were comparable to the assessment of ophthalmologists in terms of 
overall accuracy and sensitivity. Eight studies evaluated vascular severity 
scores and were able to accurately differentiate severity using an automated 
classification score.
CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence for ROP diagnosis is a growing field, and 
many potential utilities have already been identified, including the presence of 
plus disease, staging of disease and a new automated severity score. AI has a 
role as an adjunct to clinical assessment; however, there is insufficient 
evidence to support its use as a sole diagnostic tool currently."
589,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the agreement in evaluating optical coherence tomography 
(OCT) variables in the leading macular diseases such as neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO) and retinal vein 
occlusion (RVO) among OCT-certified graders.
METHODS: SD-OCT volume scans of 356 eyes were graded by seven graders. The 
grading included presence of intra- and subretinal fluid (IRF, SRF), pigment 
epithelial detachment (PED), epiretinal membrane (ERM), conditions of the 
vitreomacular interface (VMI), central retinal thickness (CRT) at the foveal 
centre-point (CP) and central millimetre (CMM), as well as height and location 
of IRF/SRF/PED. Kappa statistics (κ) and intraclass correlation coefficient 
(ICC) were used to report categorical grading and measurement agreement.
RESULTS: The overall agreement on the presence of IRF/SRF/PED was 
κ = 0.82/0.85/0.81; κ of VMI condition was 0.77, that of ERM presence 0.37. ICC 
for CRT measurements at CP and CMM was excellent with an ICC of 1.00. Height 
measurements of IRF/SRF/PED showed robust consistency with ICC = 0.85-0.93. 
There was substantial to almost perfect agreement in locating IRF/SRF/PED with 
κ = 0.67-0.86. Between diseases, κ of IRF/SRF presence was 0.69/0.80 for nAMD, 
0.64/0.83 for DMO and 0.86/0.89 for RVO.
CONCLUSION: Even in the optimized setting, featuring certified graders, 
standardized image acquisition and the use of a professional reading platform, 
there is a disease dependent variability in biomarker evaluation that is most 
pronounced for IRF in nAMD as well as DMO. Our findings highlight the 
variability in the performance of human expert OCT grading and the need for 
AI-based automated feature analyses."
590,"Nephroangiosclerosis (NAS) associated with hypertension continues to be one of 
the most causes of end stage renal diseases in Europe, but it is still poorly 
studied. The prevalence of NAS shows a large variability due to the difference 
among different countries regarding clinical presentations and the indication to 
perform renal biopsy. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence in 
biopsy-proven NAS patients and the association with hypertension and/or 
glomerulonephritis (GN). We included all patients referred for native kidney 
biopsy between 2003-2021 at Policlinic Umberto I of Rome. From 837 patients who 
underwent renal biopsy NAS was diagnosed in 80 (10.5%) patients. Serum 
creatinine was significantly higher in NAS [2.07 mg/dl (IQR 1.13-5.2) vs 
1.1 mg/dl (IQR 0.8-2.1), p < 0.001] compared to patients without NAS. 
Hypertension was present in 45% of patients with NAS. Proteinuria was 
significantly higher in patients with mild-moderate NAS compared to patients 
with severe NAS [2.6 g/die (IQR 1-5) vs 1.5 g/die (IQR 0.86-2.3), p < 0.05]. We 
did not find any significant differences, including histological features, 
between NAS patients with hypertension and NAS patients without hypertension 
(p > 0.05). IgA nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous 
nephropathy were the most frequent GN associated. In conclusion no specific 
histological features are reported in NAS with and without hypertension. More 
information on the phenotype, clinical presentation and markers are needed to 
improve histological and clinical diagnostics."
591,"Treatment of oncological pain is complex and requires a multidisciplinary 
management approach between oncology services and pain units. Although 
significant improvements have been achieved in the treatment and overall 
survival of cancer patients, the management of oncological pain has not followed 
the same directions. Many patients are not referred to pain units even though 
they could benefit from it. The purpose of this Delphi survey was to map the 
current situation in the management of cancer pain, identify barriers and 
propose recommendations to improve its management by emphasizing the importance 
of collaboration and coordination between oncology services and pain units. A 
survey among members with recognized experience in the management of oncology 
patients and oncological pain was held based on the Delphi method principles. 
The experts were asked to vote preselected statements on cancer pain management 
in two rounds and conclusions and recommendations were formulated based on the 
consensus reached for each statement. Barriers and areas for improvement were 
identified: need of multidisciplinary management approach, effective 
communication between oncology services and pain units, timely referral of 
cancer patients to pain units, training of health care professionals dealing 
with cancer aspects and identification of those patients that could benefit from 
a multidisciplinary management of their oncological disease. The experts issued 
recommendations targeting the identified barriers and areas for improvement by 
defining the service requirements of hospital and units treating cancer pain 
patients, establishing referral pathways necessities and adopted measures to 
improve the care of cancer patients."
592,"OBJECTIVES: First, we retrospectively compared the clinical efficacy of 
concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with nimotuzumab vs. chemoradiotherapy 
alone in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and cervical lymph node 
metastasis. Second, we analyzed the value of Ki-67 as a predictor of nimotuzumab 
efficacy.
METHODS: From January 2012 to December 2019, 1250 patients with cervical lymph 
node metastasis eligible for enrollment were included, of whom 383 were treated 
with concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with nimotuzumab (targeted therapy 
group), and 867 were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT group). A 
total of 381 pairs of patients were matched using 1:1 propensity score matching, 
and differences in clinical prognosis were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) (P = 0.028), disease-free survival (DFS) 
(P = 0.040), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (P = 0.040) were better 
in the targeted therapy compared to the CRT group. Multivariate analysis 
revealed that clinical staging, chemotherapy, and nimotuzumab therapy were 
predictors of OS and DFS. In the targeted therapy group, patients with ≥ 50% 
Ki-67 positivity had better OS and DFS rates than those with < 50% Ki-67 
positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage N1-3 NPC and lymph node metastasis, the 
addition of nimotuzumab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy may provide additional 
survival benefits. Ki-67 is a potential biomarker with clinical predictive value 
for the efficacy of nimotuzumab combined with chemoradiotherapy."
593,"Eosinophils are granulocytes that play a significant role in the pathogenesis of 
asthma and other airway diseases. Directing patient treatment based on the level 
of eosinophilia has been shown to be extremely effective in reducing 
exacerbations and therefore has tremendous potential as a routine clinical test. 
Herein, we describe the in vitro selection and optimization of DNA aptamers that 
bind to eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), a protein biomarker unique to eosinophils. 
Fifteen rounds of magnetic bead aptamer selection were performed prior to high 
throughput DNA sequencing. The top 10 aptamer candidates were assessed for EPX 
binding using a mobility shift assay. This process identified a lead aptamer 
candidate termed EAP1-05 with low nanomolar affinity and high specificity for 
EPX over other common sputum proteins. This aptamer sequence was further 
optimized through truncation and used to develop an easy-to-use colourimetric 
pull-down assay that can detect EPX over a concentration range from 1 - 100 nM 
in processed sputum. Forty-six clinical samples were processed using a new 
sputum dispersal method, appropriate for a rapid assessment assay, that avoids 
centrifugation and lengthy processing times. The assay showed 89% sensitivity 
and 96% specificity to detect eosinophilia (compared to gold standard sputum 
cytometry), with results being produced in under an hour. This assay could allow 
for an easy assessment of eosinophil activity in the airway to guide 
anti-inflammatory therapy for several airway diseases."
594,"Cellular senescence caused by oncogenic stimuli is associated with the 
development of various age-related pathologies through the senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP is mediated by the activation of cytoplasmic 
nucleic acid sensors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the 
accumulation of nucleotide ligands in senescent cells is unclear. In this study, 
we revealed that the expression of RNaseH2A, which removes ribonucleoside 
monophosphates (rNMPs) from the genome, is regulated by E2F transcription 
factors, and it decreases during cellular senescence. Residual rNMPs cause 
genomic DNA fragmentation and aberrant activation of cytoplasmic nucleic acid 
sensors, thereby provoking subsequent SASP factor gene expression in senescent 
cells. In addition, RNaseH2A expression was significantly decreased in aged 
mouse tissues and cells from individuals with Werner syndrome. Furthermore, 
RNaseH2A degradation using the auxin-inducible degron system induced the 
accumulation of nucleotide ligands and induction of certain tumourigenic 
SASP-like factors, promoting the metastatic properties of colorectal cancer 
cells. Our results indicate that RNaseH2A downregulation provokes SASP through 
nucleotide ligand accumulation, which likely contributes to the pathological 
features of senescent, progeroid, and cancer cells."
595,"With the world's migratory flow, the risk of infection by the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among migrants is increasing. The prevalence of 
intercourse without condoms with a casual or commercial sex partner, a high-risk 
sexual behavior for HIV infection, is unknown among migrants. The purpose of 
this study was to determine the prevalence of intercourse without condoms among 
migrants and the risk factors associated with not using condoms. In Oujda, we 
conducted a cross-sectional survey of 416 sexually active migrants. We used a 
multistage sampling method. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 
participants to collect socio-demographic information, disease perception, 
behavioral habits, sexual behavioral habits, and para-clinical parameters. A 
multivariate logistical regression analysis identified the risk factors 
associated with high-risk HIV sexual behaviors. The prevalence of intercourse 
without condoms with a casual or commercial sex partner was 72.8%, with a median 
age of 25.0 years, and 212 (69.9%) were males. The prevalence of HIV was 0.2%. 
Being homeless, having difficulty obtaining condoms, and only having a basic 
education were all risk factors for these sexual behaviors. Migrants with 
precarious living conditions are at increased risk of having intercourse without 
condoms. This group must be prioritized by strengthening public health programs 
targeting the health of migrants as well as the intervention of thematic 
non-governmental organizations. Vigilant monitoring of the HIV epidemic, with a 
focus on vulnerable populations, should be a high priority in Morocco."
596,"Cardiomyopathies have unresolved genotype-phenotype relationships and lack 
disease-specific treatments. Here we provide a framework to identify 
genotype-specific pathomechanisms and therapeutic targets to accelerate the 
development of precision medicine. We use human cardiac electromechanical 
in-silico modelling and simulation which we validate with experimental hiPSC-CM 
data and modelling in combination with clinical biomarkers. We select 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a challenge for this approach and study genetic 
variations that mutate proteins of the thick (MYH7R403Q/+) and thin filaments 
(TNNT2R92Q/+, TNNI3R21C/+) of the cardiac sarcomere. Using in-silico techniques 
we show that the destabilisation of myosin super relaxation observed in 
hiPSC-CMs drives disease in virtual cells and ventricles carrying the 
MYH7R403Q/+ variant, and that secondary effects on thin filament activation are 
necessary to precipitate slowed relaxation of the cell and diastolic 
insufficiency in the chamber. In-silico modelling shows that Mavacamten corrects 
the MYH7R403Q/+ phenotype in agreement with hiPSC-CM experiments. Our in-silico 
model predicts that the thin filament variants TNNT2R92Q/+ and TNNI3R21C/+ 
display altered calcium regulation as central pathomechanism, for which 
Mavacamten provides incomplete salvage, which we have corroborated in 
TNNT2R92Q/+ and TNNI3R21C/+ hiPSC-CMs. We define the ideal characteristics of a 
novel thin filament-targeting compound and show its efficacy in-silico. We 
demonstrate that hybrid human-based hiPSC-CM and in-silico studies accelerate 
pathomechanism discovery and classification testing, improving clinical 
interpretation of genetic variants, and directing rational therapeutic targeting 
and design."
597,"Auscultation is an important diagnostic method for lung diseases. However, it is 
a subjective modality and requires a high degree of expertise. To overcome this 
constraint, artificial intelligence models are being developed. However, these 
models require performance improvements and do not reflect the actual clinical 
situation. We aimed to develop an improved deep-learning model learning to 
detect wheezing in children, based on data from real clinical practice. In this 
prospective study, pediatric pulmonologists recorded and verified respiratory 
sounds in 76 pediatric patients who visited a university hospital in South 
Korea. In addition, structured data, such as sex, age, and auscultation 
location, were collected. Using our dataset, we implemented an optimal model by 
transforming it based on the convolutional neural network model. Finally, we 
proposed a model using a 34-layer residual network with the convolutional block 
attention module for audio data and multilayer perceptron layers for tabular 
data. The proposed model had an accuracy of 91.2%, area under the curve of 
89.1%, precision of 94.4%, recall of 81%, and F1-score of 87.2%. The 
deep-learning model proposed had a high accuracy for detecting wheeze sounds. 
This high-performance model will be helpful for the accurate diagnosis of 
respiratory diseases in actual clinical practice."
598,"The effects of cycloplegia on ocular biological parameters in children have been 
extensively studied, but few studies have compared these parameters between 
different refractive states, ages, and sexes. Therefore, the purpose of this 
study was to investigate the changes in ocular biometry before and after 
cycloplegia in different groups based on dioptre, age and sex. We examined a 
total of 2049 participants in this cross-sectional study. A comprehensive eye 
examination was conducted before cycloplegia. Cycloplegia was implemented with 
the application of atropine or tropicamide. Ocular biological parameters were 
evaluated after cycloplegia, including axial length (AL), mean keratometry (K), 
flat keratometry (K1), steep keratometry (K2), central corneal thickness (CCT), 
anterior chamber depth (ACD) and white-to-white (WTW) distance. All the 
participants were categorized based on dioptre, age and sex. Statistical 
analysis was performed with paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. 
Regarding dioptre, AL was found to be increased significantly in the Fs, Ast and 
FA (p < 0.05) postcycloplegia groups. We observed significant increases in K, 
K1, K2 and ACD in the Fs group (p < 0.05) after cycloplegia. Regarding age, we 
found significant increases in AL, CCT and ACD in group 1 (p < 0.05), but AL 
decreased significantly in groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.05) postcycloplegia. There were 
no significant changes found in K, K1 and K2 in the three groups after 
cycloplegia (p > 0.05). Regarding sex, AL and WTW were found to decrease 
significantly among males and increase significantly among females (p < 0.05) 
postcycloplegia, while K, K1 and K2 showed the opposite trends. This study 
showed that there were differences in some ocular biological parameters after 
cycloplegia across different groups; in particular, there were significant 
differences in AL, CCT and ACD. Attention should be devoted to the influence of 
cycloplegia in clinical work."
599,"Plants deposit photosynthetically-fixed carbon in the rhizosphere, the thin soil 
layer directly around the root, thereby creating a hospitable environment for 
microbes. To manage the inhabitants of this nutrient-rich environment, plant 
roots exude and dynamically adjust microbe-attracting and -repelling compounds 
to stimulate specific members of the microbiome. Previously, we demonstrated 
that foliar infection of Arabidopsis thaliana by the biotrophic downy mildew 
pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) leads to a disease-induced 
modification of the rhizosphere microbiome. Soil conditioned with Hpa-infected 
plants provided enhanced protection against foliar downy mildew infection in a 
subsequent population of plants, a phenomenon dubbed the soil-borne legacy 
(SBL). Here, we show that for the creation of the SBL, plant-produced coumarins 
play a prominent role as coumarin-deficient myb72 and f6'h1 mutants were 
defective in creating a Hpa-induced SBL. Root exudation profiles changed 
significantly in Col-0 upon foliar Hpa infection, and this was accompanied by a 
compositional shift in the root microbiome that was significantly different from 
microbial shifts occurring on roots of Hpa-infected coumarin-deficient mutants. 
Our data further show that the Hpa-induced SBL primes Col-0 plants growing in 
SBL-conditioned soil for salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defenses. The 
SA-signaling mutants sid2 and npr1 were unresponsive to the Hpa-induced SBL, 
suggesting that the protective effect of the Hpa-induced shift in the root 
microbiome results from an induced systemic resistance that requires 
SA-signaling in the plant."
600,"Dampened immunity and impaired wound healing in diabetic patients may lead to 
diabetic foot ulcer disease, which is the leading cause of limb amputations and 
hospitalization. On the other hand, cancer is the most significant cause of 
mortality globally, accounting for over 10 million fatalities in 2020, or nearly 
one in every six deaths. Plants and herbs have been used to treat chronic 
diseases due to their essential pharmaceutical attributes, such as mitigating 
drug resistance, ameliorating systemic toxicities, reducing the need for 
synthetic chemotherapeutic agents,and strengthening the immune system. The 
present study has been designed to evaluate the effects of Tribulus terrestris 
on wound healing, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory responses against HepG-2 liver 
cancer cell line. Two solvents (methanol and ethanol) were used for root 
extraction of T. terrestris. The wound healing potential of the extracts was 
studied on diabetic cell culture line by scratch assay. The anti-oxidant and 
cytotoxic potentials were evaluated by in vitro assays against HepG2 cell line. 
The methanolic root extract resulted in the coverage of robust radical 
scavenging or maximum inhibition of 66.72%,potent cytotoxic activity or reduced 
cell viability of 40.98%, and anti-diabetic activity having mighty α-glucosidase 
inhibition of 50.16% at a concentration of 80 μg/ml. Significant reduction in 
the levels of LDH leakage (56.38%), substantial ROS (48.45%) and SOD (72.13%) 
activities were recorededMoreover, gene expression analysis demonstrated the 
down-regulation of inflammatory markers (TNF-α, MMP-9, Bcl-2, and AFP) in HepG-2 
cells when treated with T. terresteris methanolic extract as compared to stress. 
Furthermore, the down-regulation of inflammatory markers was validated through 
ELISA-mediated protein estimation of IL-1β and TNF-α. It is expected that this 
study will lay a foundation and lead to the development of efficient but 
low-cost, natural herbs extract-based dressing/ointment for diabetic patients 
and identify potential drug metabolites to treat out-of-whack inflammatory 
responses involved in cancer onset, progression, and metastasis."
601,"Metabolic reprogramming is involved in the pathogenesis of not only cancers but 
also neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious 
diseases. With the progress of metabonomics and proteomics, metabolites have 
been found to affect protein acylations through providing acyl groups or 
changing the activities of acyltransferases or deacylases. Reciprocally, protein 
acylation is involved in key cellular processes relevant to physiology and 
diseases, such as protein stability, protein subcellular localization, enzyme 
activity, transcriptional activity, protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA 
interactions. Herein, we summarize the functional diversity and mechanisms of 
eight kinds of nonhistone protein acylations in the physiological processes and 
progression of several diseases. We also highlight the recent progress in the 
development of inhibitors for acyltransferase, deacylase, and acylation reader 
proteins for their potential applications in drug discovery."
602,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is emerging in genetic diagnoses as it provides 
functional support for the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance. 
However, the use of amniotic fluid (AF) cells for RNA-seq has not yet been 
explored. Here, we examined the expression of clinically relevant genes in AF 
cells (n = 48) compared with whole blood and fibroblasts. The number of 
well-expressed genes in AF cells was comparable to that in fibroblasts and much 
higher than that in blood across different disease categories. We found AF cells 
RNA-seq feasible and beneficial in prenatal diagnosis (n = 4) as transcriptomic 
data elucidated the molecular consequence leading to the pathogenicity upgrade 
of variants in CHD7 and COL1A2 and revising the in silico prediction of a 
variant in MYRF. AF cells RNA-seq could become a reasonable choice for postnatal 
patients with advantages over fibroblasts and blood as it prevents invasive 
procedures."
603,"BACKGROUND: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend Dynamic 
Risk Stratification (DRS) for predicting long-term outcomes and personalizing 
management in adult differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs). However, its 
applicability in pediatric DTCs needs to be validated. Here, we attempted a 
validation study concerning the use of DRS in pediatric DTCs.
METHODS: Data of children (age ≤18 years) with DTCs and follow-up of ≥5 years 
were extracted. All patients were classified according to DRS (excellent, 
biochemical-, or structural-incomplete responses). Univariate and multivariate 
analyses were done to identify factor(s) affecting disease-free survival (DFS).
RESULTS: We included 176 pediatric DTC patients (median age at diagnosis: 15 
years). All patients underwent thyroidectomy and received radioiodine as part of 
initial management. On the basis of clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings 
acquired during the first two years of follow-up, the DRS system divided 
patients into three response categories: excellent response in 82/176 (46.6%), 
biochemical-incomplete in 56/176 (31.8%), and structural-incomplete response in 
38/176 (21.6%) patients. The median follow-up was 10.6 years (interquartile 
range: 7.7-15.5). Ten-year overall survival and DFS rates were 100% and 88.7%, 
respectively. In univariate analysis, DFS was significantly affected by 
extra-thyroidal extension (p = 0.002), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.018), ATA 
initial risk stratification (p = 0.033), and DRS (p = 0.004). However, in 
multivariate analysis, DRS alone showed a significant association with DFS 
(p = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: Like adults, DRS correctly predicts long-term outcomes in pediatric 
DTC. In addition to ATA initial risk stratification, DRS could further refine 
risk in pediatric DTCs and help in planning more personalised treatment and 
follow-up strategies."
604,"Since Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was linked as the predominant etiology of 
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in 2008, three additional human polyomaviruses 
(HPyV) have been definitively linked to cutaneous diseases-trichodysplasia 
spinulosa virus (TSPyV) and human polyomavirus 6 and 7 (HPyV6, HPyV7). TSPyV 
contributes to the development of trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS), and HPyV6/7 is 
associated closely with the eruption of pruritic and dyskeratotic dermatoses 
(PDD). Clinically, MCC is treated with surgical excision and radiation with 
adjuvant chemotherapy, although newer treatment options include immune 
checkpoint inhibition. These novel immunotherapies hold promise for the 
treatment of metastatic MCC, but resistance and side effects prevent a 
significant proportion of patients from realizing their benefits. Based on 
previous case reports, the standard of care for the less deadly but disfiguring 
cutaneous disease TS include immunosuppressant (IS) reduction, the use of 
antivirals such as cidofovir (CDV) or valganciclovir (VGCV), or a combination of 
these treatments. Similar treatments were attempted for PDD, but oral acitretin 
was found to be most effective. As MCC, TS, and PDD are rare diseases, further 
research is required for effective treatments. In this review, we summarize 
clinical trials, preclinical studies, and case reports that present outcomes and 
side effects of current and emerging treatments for HPyV-associated cutaneous 
diseases, offering a comprehensive resource for clinical application and 
prospective clinical trials."
605,"Gene expression studies offer promising opportunities to better understand the 
processes underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD). As cell types differ in their 
function, gene expression profiles will typically vary across cell types. When 
studying bulk tissue, failure to account for this cellular diversity has a 
detrimental impact on the ability to detect disease associations. We therefore 
assayed the transcriptomes of 32,531 individual nuclei extracted from the 
nucleus accumbens (NAc) of nine donors with AUD and nine controls (72% male). 
Our study identified 17 clearly delineated cell types. We detected 26 
transcriptome-wide significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that mainly 
involved medium spiny neurons with both D1-type and D2-type dopamine receptors, 
microglia (MGL) and oligodendrocytes. A higher than expected number of DEGs 
replicated in an existing single nucleus gene expression study of alcohol 
dependence in the prefrontal cortex (enrichment ratio 1.91, p value 0.019) with 
two genes remaining significant after a Bonferroni correction. Our most 
compelling result involved CD53 in MGL that replicated in the same cell type in 
the prefrontal cortex and was previously implicated in studies of DNA 
methylation, bulk gene expression and genetic variants. Several DEGs were 
previously reported to be associated with AUD (e.g., PER1 and MGAT5). The DEGs 
for MSN.3 seemed involved in neurodegeneration, disruption of circadian rhythms, 
alterations in glucose metabolism and changes in synaptic plasticity. For MGL, 
the DEGs implicated neuroinflammation and immune-related processes and for OLI, 
disruptions in myelination. This identification of the specific cell-types from 
which the association signals originate will be key for designing proper 
follow-up experiments and, eventually, novel clinical interventions."
606,"BACKGROUND: Hox genes encode transcription factors that are important for 
establishing the body plan. Hoxa5 is a member of the mammalian Hox5 paralogous 
group that regulates the patterning and morphology of the cervical-thoracic 
region of the axial skeleton. Hoxa5 also plays crucial functions in lung 
morphogenesis.
RESULTS: We generated a Hoxa5eGFP reporter mouse line using CRISPR technology, 
allowing real-time visualization of Hoxa5 expression. Hoxa5eGFP recapitulates 
reported embryonic Hoxa5 mRNA expression patterns. Specifically, Hoxa5eGFP can 
be visualized in the developing mouse neural tube, somites, lung, diaphragm, 
foregut, midgut, among other organs. In the stomach, posteriorly biased 
Hoxa5eGFP expression correlates with a drastic morphological reduction of the 
corpus in Hox5 paralogous mutants. Expression of Hoxa5eGFP in the lung continues 
in all lung fibroblast populations through postnatal and adult stages.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified cell types that express Hoxa5 in postnatal and adult 
mouse lungs, including various fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. This 
reporter line will be a powerful tool for studies of the function of Hoxa5 
during mouse development, homeostasis, and disease processes. This article is

607,"INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress known as a predictive marker for cardiovascular 
and metabolic diseases could be measured through pro-oxidant antioxidant balance 
(PAB). The present study aimed to evaluate PAB and its association with 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the serum of postmenopausal 
women with diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: In this case-control study, 99 diabetic and 100 healthy postmenopausal 
women without diabetes mellitus were recruited. Serum PAB values, hs-CRP, lipid 
profile, insulin, and vitamin D levels were measured. Moreover, insulin 
resistance (HOMA-IR, HOMA-β and QUICKI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip 
ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and body mass index (BMI) were 
calculated.
RESULTS: Serum PAB, hs-CRP, insulin resistance, HOMA-β, QUICKI, low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 
and triglycerides (TG) levels were significantly higher in the postmenopausal 
women with diabetes mellitus, while there was no significant difference in the 
total cholesterol (TC), serum insulin, WC, WHR, WHtR and vitamin D levels 
between the groups. Pearson correlation coefficient showed that HDL-C and 
insulin levels were directly correlated with serum PAB. Also, there was a 
significant direct relationship between LDL-C and insulin levels and hs-CRP. 
There was no meaningful relationship between serum insulin and vitamin D levels 
and other assessed parameters. Backward logistic regression showed a positive 
relationship between diabetes mellitus and serum PAB and an inverse relationship 
with serum HDL levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum PAB, hs-CRP concentration, and lipid profile were 
significantly different between postmenopausal women with and without diabetes 
mellitus. These differences may contribute to the development of coronary 
complications."
608,"Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are cell envelope spanning protein complexes 
that Gram-negative bacteria use to inject a diverse arsenal of antibacterial 
toxins into competitor cells. Recently, Wang et al. reported that the H2-T6SS of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa delivers the peptidoglycan recycling amidase, AmpDh3, 
into the periplasm of recipient cells where it is proposed to act as a 
peptidoglycan degrading toxin (Wang et al., 2020). They further reported that 
PA0808, the open reading frame downstream of AmpDh3, encodes an immunity protein 
that localizes to the periplasm where it binds to and inactivates 
intercellularly delivered AmpDh3, thus protecting against its toxic activity. 
Given that AmpDh3 has an established role in cell wall homeostasis and that no 
precedent exists for cytosolic enzymes moonlighting as T6SS effectors, we 
attempted to replicate these findings. We found that cells lacking PA0808 are 
not susceptible to bacterial killing by AmpDh3 and that PA0808 and AmpDh3 do not 
physically interact in vitro or in vivo. Additionally, we found no evidence that 
AmpDh3 is exported from cells, including by strains with a constitutively active 
H2-T6SS. Finally, subcellular fractionation experiments and a 1.97 Å crystal 
structure reveals that PA0808 does not contain a canonical signal peptide or 
localize to the correct cellular compartment to confer protection against a cell 
wall targeting toxin. Taken together, these results cast doubt on the assertion 
that AmpDh3-PA0808 constitute an H2-T6SS effector-immunity pair."
609,"This narrative review briefly describes the mammalian circadian timing system, 
the specific features of the liver clock, also by comparison with other 
peripheral clocks, the role of the liver clock in the preparation to food 
intake, and its relationship with energy metabolism. It then goes on to provide 
a chronobiological perspective of the pathophysiology and management of several 
types of liver disease, with particular focus on metabolic-associated fatty 
liver disease (MAFLD), decompensated cirrhosis and liver transplantation. 
Finally, it provides some insight into the potential contribution of circadian 
principles and circadian hygiene practices in preventing MAFLD, improving the 
prognosis of advanced liver disease and modulating liver transplantation 
outcomes."
610,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Different approaches are available after progression of 
disease (PD) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), including continuation of ICI, treatment switching to tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) and cessation of anticancer therapy. We sought to characterise 
the relationship between radiologic patterns of progression and survival 
post-ICI, also appraising treatment strategies.
METHODS: We screened 604 HCC patients treated with ICIs, including only those 
who experienced PD by data cut-off. We evaluated post-progression survival (PPS) 
according to treatment strategy at PD and verified its relationship with 
radiologic patterns of progression: intrahepatic growth (IHG), new intrahepatic 
lesion (NIH), extrahepatic growth (EHG), new extrahepatic lesion (NEH) and new 
vascular invasion (nVI).
RESULTS: Of 604 patients, 364 (60.3%) experienced PD during observation. Median 
PPS was 5.3 months (95%CI: 4.4-6.9; 271 events). At data cut-off, 165 patients 
(45%) received no post-progression anticancer therapy; 64 patients (17.6%) 
continued ICI beyond PD. IHG (HR 1.64 [95%CI:1.21-2.22]; p=0.0013) and nVI (HR 
2.15 [95%CI:1.38-3.35]; p=0.0007) were associated with shorter PPS. Multivariate 
models adjusted for progression patterns, treatment line, and ALBI grade and 
ECOG-PS at PD confirmed receipt of ICI beyond PD with (HR 0.17, 95%CI 0.09-0.32; 
p<0.0001), or without subsequent TKI (HR 0.39, 95%CI 0.26-0.58; p<0.0001) as 
predictors of prolonged PPS versus no anticancer therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: ICI-TKI sequencing is a consolidated option in advanced HCC. nVI 
and IHG predict poorer prognosis. Despite lack of recommendation, continuation 
of ICI beyond progression in HCC is adopted clinically: future efforts should 
appraise which patients benefit from this approach."
611,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare indication (<5%) for 
liver transplantation (LT). The aim of this study was to describe the early 
outcome after LT for AIH.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective nationwide study including all patients 
aged ≥16 transplanted for AIH in France was conducted. Occurrence of biliary and 
vascular complications, rejection, sepsis, retransplantation and death was 
collected during the first year after LT.
RESULTS: A total of 344 patients (78.8% of women; 17.0% of (sub)fulminant 
hepatitis, and 19.2% of chronic liver diseases transplanted in the context of 
acute-on-chronic liver failure) were included, with a median age at LT of 
43.6 years. Acute rejection, sepsis, biliary and vascular complications occurred 
in respectively 23.5%, 44.2%, 25.3% and 17.4% of patients during the first year 
after LT. One-year graft and patient survivals were 84.3% and 88.0%, 
respectively. The main cause of early deaths was sepsis. Pre-LT 
immunosuppression was not associated with an increased risk for early infections 
or surgical complications. Significant risk factors for septic events were LT in 
the context of (sub)fulminant hepatitis or ACLF, acute kidney injury at time of 
LT (AKI) and occurrence of biliary complications after LT. AKI was the only 
independent factor associated with graft (HR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1-5.4; p = 0.02) 
and patient survivals (HR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.0-6.5; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Early prognosis is good after LT for AIH and is not impacted by 
pre-LT immunosuppression but by the presence of AKI at the time of LT."
612,"Bordetella species cause lower respiratory tract infections in mammals. B. 
pertussis and B. bronchiseptica are the causative agents of whooping cough and 
kennel cough, respectively. The current acellular vaccine for B. pertussis 
protects against disease but does not prevent transmission or colonization. 
Cases of pertussis are on the rise even in areas of high vaccination. The PlrSR 
two-component system, is required for persistence in the mouse lung. A partial 
plrS deletion strain and a plrS H521Q strain cannot survive past three days in 
the lung, suggesting PlrSR works in a phosphorylation dependent mechanism. We 
characterized the biochemistry of B. bronchiseptica PlrSR and found that both 
proteins function as a canonical two-component system. His521 was essential and 
Glu522 was critical for PlrS autophosphorylation. Asn525 was essential for 
phosphatase activity. The PAS domain was critical for both PlrS 
autophosphorylation and phosphatase activities. PlrS could both phosphotransfer 
to and exert phosphatase activity towards PlrR. Unexpectedly, PlrR formed a 
tetramer when unphosphorylated and a dimer upon phosphorylation. Finally, we 
demonstrated the importance of PlrS phosphatase activity for persistence within 
the murine lung. By characterizing PlrSR we hope to guide future in vivo 
investigation for development of new vaccines and therapeutics."
613,"BACKGROUND: Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is characterized by persisting burning 
pain of the oral mucosa, and its etiopathogenesis remains poorly understood. Our 
study aimed to detect the expression of miRNA-206 in the blood and clarify the 
relationship among miRNA-206, pain, anxiety and depression of BMS patients.
METHODS: Thirty patients with BMS and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in 
the experimental and control groups, respectively. Data on medical history and 
clinical oral examination for all participants were collected. Simultaneously, 
scores of Visual Analogous Scale (VAS), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and 
Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were administered. The expression level of 
miRNA-206 in plasma were determined by RT-(q)PCR. Finally, and the relationship 
of miRNA-206 expression with the VAS score, SAS score, and SDS score was 
analyzed. χ2 test, t-test were used for statistical analysis of the data, and P 
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The majority of the patients with BMS identified the tongue as the main 
pain area, and showed dry mouth and poor sleep quality. The SAS and SDS scores 
of patients with BMS were higher than those of healthy controls (P <0.05) and 
were positively correlated with VAS pain score. In addition, miRNA-206 
expression was higher in patients with BMS than in healthy individuals (P 
<0.05), and was positively correlated with the VAS and SDS scores (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BMS suffer from pain and tend to be more anxious and 
depressed than healthy controls. miRNA-206 expression in the peripheral blood of 
patients with BMS is positively correlated with pain and depression, which may 
be involved in the pathogenesis of BMS."
614,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the differences in dentoskeletal morphology in males with 
and without temporomandibular joint osteoarthrosis (TMJOA).
METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-one male participants seeking orthodontic 
treatment were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Each participant's 
osseous status was evaluated using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and 
classified into normal (N=104), indeterminate for TMJOA (N=110), and TMJOA 
(N=157) groups. The dentoskeletal characteristics were evaluated using 
cephalograms. Stratified analysis was performed based on age and skeletal 
pattern. Descriptive statistics and one-way analysis of variance were performed 
to investigate dentoskeletal differences among groups. P < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: The differences in posterior cranial base length, FMA, MP-OP, anterior 
facial height, articular angle, ramus height, and L1-MP were statistically 
significant. After stratification by age, the differences in FMA, 
maxillomandibular angle, posterior facial height, facial height ratio, gonial 
angle, and mandibular body length were statistically significant in adults. No 
statistical difference except for articular angle was observed in adolescents. 
After stratification by skeletal pattern, statistical differences were mainly 
apparent in skeletal Class II adults.
CONCLUSION: Males with TMJOA showed a posteriorly positioned and 
backward-rotated mandible, especially in skeletal Class II adults. The 
craniofacial morphology of men is less affected by TMJOA. The association 
between TMJOA and craniofacial morphology also varied across different age 
groups and skeletal patterns. Prospective studies are required to clarify the 
cause-effect relationship between TMJOA and craniofacial morphology in males."
615,"Introduction&#160;: The aim of tuberculosis treatment is to ensure a recovery 
without relapse and forestall the emergence of drug resistance, however, today, 
the tuberculosis prevention and control program is defied by TB/VIH coinfection 
and multidrug resistance.Purpose of research&#160;: To identify the risk factors 
of the tuberculosis recurrence at Kisangani is the aim of this 
paper.Results&#160;: The risk factors identified are&#160;: age of 65+ years (OR 
= 25.70 [2.9569&#160;; 223.4762], p = 0.003)&#160;; New contact with a 
tubercular known in the family or at the service (OR=6.00 [2.3815&#160;; 
15.1205], p=0.001)&#160;; crowding with a tubercular unknown in the family or at 
the service (OR=11.18 [5.6012&#160;; 22,3257], p=0.001)&#160;; working in mines 
(OR=4.07 [1.6149&#160;; 10.2850], p=0.003)&#160;; alcoholism (OR=3.91 
[1.9385&#160;; 7.9055], p=0.001). The bacteriological reconversion is high (99%) 
but not associated to the groups and rho=1.2e-07.Conclusion&#160;: The 
recurrence of tuberculosis is a problem at Kisangani due to the risk factors. It 
implies the reinforcement of prevention measures to stall the transmission of 
the disease."
616,"Introduction&#160;: The case of Ebola in Guinea (2013-2016) revealed weaknesses 
in the resilience of the health system and highlighted the challenge of 
coordinating all actors in the response. After the epidemic, national 
authorities and their international partners began to strengthen the health 
system. In 2021, Guinea faced COVID-19 simultaneously with the resurgence of 
Ebola and other diseases with epidemic potential.Purpose of research&#160;: The 
objective of this article is to analyze the evolution of the five 
characteristics of health resilience of Kruk et al. (2015) in the Guinean 
context. To do this, data triangulation was carried out through a literature 
review, 41 semi-structured interviews with international, national and local 
stakeholders, and 37 events observed in the post-Ebola period.Results&#160;: Our 
results show that the characteristic of integration was the most important in 
our study. This is because of the importance of coordination, communication and 
information sharing among stakeholders during crises. Then, diversity exposes 
the need to be able to face several health challenges simultaneously. Efforts 
were focused on Ebola during the first outbreak, but since the COVID-19 
pandemic, Guinea has been able to cope with several health challenges. Raising 
awareness, on the other hand, necessitates an understanding of the context, its 
strengths, and weaknesses. Guinea learned lessons from Ebola and implemented a 
program to strengthen the emergency response system. On self-regulation, the 
speed of the response relies on mechanisms for early detection, notification, 
and response. The country is now well resourced and has proven information and 
response mechanisms. Finally, constant adaptability by taking into account 
lessons learned allows us to set course and prepare for other potential crises 
and this is what is being done constantly.Conclusions&#160;: Given 
Guinea&#8217;s ubiquitous fragility before Ebola, the health system is still not 
fully resilient. However, gains in each of the characteristics of resilience 
improve the response to COVID-19."
617,"Objective&#160;: Faced with the uncertainty about the acceptability of COVID-19 
vaccination, we conducted this study to better guide communication strategies 
for health worker adherence to vaccination.Methods&#160;: We conducted a 
cross-sectional study for analytical purposes, from 15 to 26 February 2021 among 
health workers in health facilities in the Gb&#234;k&#234; health 
region.Results&#160;: Health workers were predominantly female (53.5&#160;%) and 
the 30-39 age group was the most represented (52&#160;%). Television was the 
main source of information (74.4&#160;%). The respondents knew that they were at 
risk of contracting COVID-19 (82.5&#160;%) and that people with co-morbidities 
were the most victim of severe forms (70.4&#160;%). The majority of respondents 
systematically wear a mask in hospital (91%). They said that 51.1&#160;% of them 
would get vaccinated. The majority of respondents would systematically wear a 
mask in hospital (91&#160;%). Multivariate analysis shows that vaccine 
acceptability was statistically associated with fear of dying from the disease 
(p=0.046) and case management (p=0.026).Conclusion&#160;: In order to achieve 
better adherence to COVID-19 vaccination, it would be necessary to strengthen 
the capacity of these agents."
618,"BACKGROUND: In Burkina Faso, the prevalence of HIV in serodifferent couples is 
comparable to that of some key populations. Our aim was to show the influence of 
HIV representation on the disclosure of HIV information in serodifferent 
couples.
METHODS: A cross-sectional qualitative study was carried out from January to 
September 2019 in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso. In-depth 
individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with each partner of the 
couple using interview guides. The data was subject to thematic content 
analysis.
RESULTS: The results show that more than three-quarters of the respondents did 
not share their HIV status. Those who had a negative attitude towards PLWHIV 
were less keen to share the information, considering that that HIV would 
transform the infected person negatively in the eyes of others. Also, sharing 
information was seen as a risk to the couple&#8217;s peace and stability. Others 
found the suffering of HIV so personal that it was difficult to share with 
others.
CONCLUSION: People living with HIV, who see AIDS as a bad disease, fear the 
social effects of HIV and are therefore less favorable to disclose their HIV 
status. On the other hand, those who equated HIV with an illness like any other 
were keen to share information about their status."
619,"INTRODUCTION: With the rarefaction of home medical visits, prehospital 
emergencies are ensured by the Mobile Emergency and Resuscitation Structures 
(SMUR) and the Firemen accompanied by Firefighters Nurses (FfNs).
PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: The main objective of this work is to describe the 
pathologies managed by the FfNs of the Loire district according to their 
International Classification of Primary Care version 2 and the Clinical 
Classification of Diseases of the initial SMUR during all interventions 
performed in 2019. The secondary objective will be to determine the associated 
Emergency Care Nursing Protocols (PISU).
RESULTS: Among the 2969 interventions and 5036 PISU performed, trauma and 
polytrauma are the most common pathologies treated. Outside of trauma, the most 
frequent conditions are chest pain, carbon monoxide poisoning, and 
cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Analgesic protocols are the most used PISU and in 
second place comes the absence of PISU application, chest pain protocols, adult 
CPA and glucose administration.
CONCLUSIONS: FfNs occupy an increasingly important place in the French rescue 
chain. Thanks to a wide range of interventions and a great autonomy of action, 
they make it possible to greatly limit the number of SMUR medical teams leaving 
the hospital, especially in situations that do not require a doctor immediately."
620,"INTRODUCTION: With the increase in life expectancy of the population, the 
progression of chronic diseases, in particular cardiovascular diseases, 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) and their complications, health and 
medico-social care represents a major public health issue.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to present an overview of the situation of 
the elderly and the current organization of the healthcare system for their care 
in French Guiana.
METHOD: A review of the literature and analysis of the most recent data related 
to demographics, socioeconomics, morbidity and mortality, supply and use of 
care, were carried out. For comparative purposes, these data were compared with 
those for mainland France and the other French overseas departments and regions 
when available.
RESULTS: With an average annual growth rate of +6.7% among people aged 65 and 
over, the highest in France (excluding Mayotte), the aging phenomenon has begun 
in French Guiana, although its population is still young. The health status of 
the elderly in French Guiana, characterized by an early onset of dependency and 
a greater prevalence of silent diseases (arterial hypertension, diabetes, 
hypercholesterolemia), is less favorable than in mainland France. In addition, 
the health and medico-social provision for the elderly remain incomplete or even 
embryonic, with little adapted support for elderly people with NND.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the situation of elderly people and the 
challenges for the health system."
621,"INTRODUCTION: After contracting COVID-19, many people have continued to 
experience various symptoms for several weeks and months, even after a mild 
acute phase. These people with &#8216;long COVID&#8217; faced difficulties when 
confronted with the healthcare system.
PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: In order to better understand their experience, we 
supplemented the information obtained in an online survey with a mixed 
qualitative approach based on 33 individual interviews and discussions with 101 
participants in a forum in March 2021.
RESULTS: Several shortcomings were identified in the contacts of 
&#8216;long&#8217; COVID patients with the health care system, such as the lack 
of listening or empathy of some health care professionals, the lack of a 
systematic or proactive approach during the diagnostic assessment, or the lack 
of interdisciplinary coordination. Patients feel misunderstood and are forced to 
develop their own strategies, whether for diagnosis or treatment. 
Patients&#8217; discomfort has led them to question the value of medicine and to 
resort to unconventional therapies to alleviate their symptoms, sometimes at 
great cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Better informing the medical profession about the manifestation of 
the disease and the possible treatments, including the possibilities of 
reimbursement, would raise awareness and give them the tools to respond to the 
needs of &#8216; long&#8217; COVID patients. A comprehensive assessment of the 
patient through an &#8220;interdisciplinary assessment&#8221; seems necessary."
622,"INTRODUCTION: This qualitative study based on focus group study aims to identify 
experiences, expectations, and representations of people with long-term mental 
illness and their caregivers regarding cardiovascular disease and its risk 
factors. The aim of this work is to build a cardiovascular risk reduction 
program for people affected by long-term mental illness.
RESULTS: Four major themes were identified in the corpus: (1) knowledge 
concerning physical health, (2) barriers to the implementation of better 
practices, (3) levers towards a healthier life and (4) expectations and needs 
for a better lifestyle.
CONCLUSIONS: This work has provided us with concrete elements for the creation 
of a cardiovascular risk reduction program for people living with long-term 
mental illness. The challenges of this program will be to adapt to the needs and 
expectations of people living with long-term mental illness while facilitating 
the role of caregivers."
623,"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases represent one of the major causes of 
mortality in France and are the main cause of excess mortality in people 
suffering from long-term mental disorders (LTMD), apart from causes related to 
suicide.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this article is to identify, from the point of view 
of primary care and psychiatric professionals, psychiatric users&#8217; 
expectations and needs in order to help them improve their medical and 
paramedical management of cardiovascular risk (CVR).
METHOD: This is a prospective, multi-centered qualitative study carried out in 
two phases: An exploratory phase, with individual interviews at the beginning of 
the study to enable the creation of ad hoc collective interview grids, followed 
by a proper qualitative study, which is in line with medical anthropology and 
the sociology of health systems.
RESULTS: The 30 psychiatric professionals interviewed agreed on the need for 
better coordination with out-of-hospital care providers. Even if openness is 
advocated, there is a reminder of the specificities of psychiatry and the 
importance of taking these specificities into account in general. The 26 primary 
care professionals show a desire to learn more about psychiatric disorders, 
pathologies, and treatments in order to facilitate the management of these 
patients with specific needs.
CONCLUSION: The cross-referencing of these results will allow to propose an 
appropriate intervention in order to induce convincing effects on the reduction 
of the CVR in people suffering from LTMD."
624,"OBJECTIVE: Endothelial cell (EC) coupling occurs through gap junctions and 
underlies cerebral blood flow regulation governed by inward-rectifying (KIR ) 
channels. This study addressed effects of KIR channel activity on EC coupling 
before and during Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Intact EC tubes (width: ~90-100 μm; length: ~0.5 mm) were freshly 
isolated from posterior cerebral arteries of young Pre-AD (1-3 months) and aged 
AD (13-18 months) male and female 3xTg-AD mice. Dual intracellular 
microelectrodes applied simultaneous current injections (±0.5-3 nA) and membrane 
potential (Vm ) recordings in ECs at distance ~400 μm. Elevated extracellular 
potassium ([K+ ]E ; 8-15 mmol L-1 ; reference, 5 mmol L-1 ) activated KIR 
channels.
RESULTS: Conducted Vm (∆Vm ) responses ranged from ~-30 to 30 mV in response to 
-3 to +3 nA (linear regression, R2 ≥0.99) while lacking rectification for charge 
polarity or axial direction of spread. Conduction slope decreased ~10-20% during 
15 mmol L-1 [K+ ]E in Pre-AD males and AD females. 15 mmol L-1 [K+ ]E decreased 
conduction at lower thresholds in AD animals (~±20 mV) versus Pre-AD (~±25 mV). 
AD increased (~10-15%) conducted hyperpolarization during 8-12 mmol L-1 [K+ ]E .
CONCLUSIONS: Brain endothelial KIR channel activity modulates bidirectional 
spread of vasoreactive signals with enhanced regulation of EC coupling during AD 
pathology."
625,"The coronavirus disease-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus has faced the transplant community with unprecedented 
clinical challenges in a highly vulnerable patient category. These were 
associated with many uncertainties for patients and health care professionals 
and prompted many ethical debates regarding the safe delivery of kidney 
transplantation. In this article, we highlight some of the most important 
ethical questions that were raised during the pandemic and attempt to analyze 
ethical arguments in light of core principles of medical ethics to either 
suspend or continue kidney transplantation, and to mandate vaccination in 
transplant patients, transplant candidates, and, finally, health care providers. 
We have come up with frameworks to deal responsibly with these ethical 
challenges, and formulated recommendations to cope with the issues imposed on 
patients and transplant professionals."
626,"BACKGROUND: We investigated if the occurrence of preoperative right ventricular 
dysfunction is capable of influencing heart transplant results in terms of 
in-hospital mortality, incidence of primary graft dysfunction, and follow-up 
mortality.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 517 patients who underwent heart transplant 
between January 2000 and December 2020. We defined right ventricular dysfunction 
(RVD), as central venous pressure (CVP) > 15 mm Hg and CVP/pulmonary capillary 
wedge pressure ratio > 0.63. We identified 2 subgroups in our population: 33 
patients with preoperative RVD and 484 patients without RVD.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 7.9%. Severe early graft failure occurred in 
6.6% of patients, with 26 patients (5.1%) needing intra-aortic balloon pump and 
17 patients (3.3%) needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Clinical 
variables that significantly influenced in-hospital mortality were age, 
peripheral artery disease, and bilirubin > 1.5 mg/dL, while hemodynamic 
variables influencing in-hospital mortality were CVP (odds ratio [OR], 1.09 
[confidence interval {CI}, 1.03-1.15], P = .004], pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure (OR, 1.02 [CI, 1.00-1.04], P = .05), CVP/pulmonary capillary wedge 
pressure ratio (OR, 2.78 [CI, 1.14-6.80], P = .025), pulmonary vascular 
resistance (OR, 1.15 [CI, 1.01-1.32], P = .042), transpulmonary gradient (TPG) 
(OR, 1.11 [CI, 1.03-1.18], P = .003) , diastolic transpulmonary gradient (OR, 
1.10 [CI, 1.02-1.20], P = .015], together with right ventricular dysfunction 
(OR, 3.56 [CI, 1.44-8.80], P = .011). On the other hand, clinical variables 
influencing the incidence of early graft failure were body mass index 
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) > 30, 
peripheral artery disease, bilirubin > 1.5 mg/dL, Model for End-Stage Liver 
Disease score excluding international normalized ratio before transplant, and 
preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, while hemodynamic 
variables were pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (OR, 1.03 [CI, 1.00-1.05], 
P = .016), TPG (OR, 1.08 [1.01-1.17], P = .03), and right ventricular 
dysfunction (OR, 3.00 [CI, 1.07-8.40] P = .046). On the multivariable analysis, 
RVD and TPG were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality, while only TPG 
was a predictor of early graft failure. Follow-up mortality was 38.7% and was 
influenced by recipient age, recipient body mass index, and preoperative 
diabetes. Moreover, 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival of patients with preoperative 
RVD was significantly worse than patients without RVD (log-rank = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In our population, RVD influenced both in-hospital and long-term 
results after heart transplant. For these reasons, it appears crucially 
important to optimize preoperative right ventricular function to improve these 
patients' outcomes."
627,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most prevalent type of 
kidney transplant (KT) recipients. We aimed to investigate the incidence, 
causes, and clinical impact of early recurrent UTI post-living donor KT and to 
examine the role of behavioral education program in management.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort chart-review study included all KT recipients 
with recurrent UTI necessitating hospital admission between September 2017 and 
August 2021. All patients with recurrent UTI were subjected to behavioral 
education for a month.
RESULTS: UTI was found in 14 of 145 patients (9.6%), with recurrent UTI in 11 
(7.6%). A total of 93% of UTIs occurred during the first 6 months 
post-transplant and represented 52% of KT readmissions during the same period. A 
total of 64.3% of patients were older than 50 years. The mean (SD) length of 
hospital stay was 5 (2.5) days, with an equal incidence in both sexes. The most 
common bacterial isolates in early recurrent UTI were Escherichia coli in 80.9%. 
Both Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and multidrug-resistant organisms 
(resistance in ≥3 drugs) were seen in 82.4% of isolates. Furthermore, the most 
effective antibiotic was meropenem, with 86.7% effectiveness. A total of 65% of 
UTIs were managed with a single antibacterial course. A total of 64.3% of 
patients were older than 50 years. In patients who developed UTI, the mean (SD) 
serum creatinine was 1.31 (0.52) mg/dL, with a mean increase in serum creatinine 
of 0.19 mg/dL on having the episodes; at 1 year post-transplant, serum 
creatinine declined to 1.23 (0.43) mg/dL. Four patients (36%) had no recurrence 
of UTI after behavioral education.
CONCLUSIONS: The multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates account for 82.4% of the 
UTIs. Therefore, antibiotic prescription should follow the antimicrobial 
stewardship guidelines. Behavioral education significantly reduced the incidence 
of recurrent UTI."
628,"Psychiatric illnesses are heterogeneous in nature. No illness manifests in the 
same way across individuals, and no two patients with a shared diagnosis exhibit 
identical symptom profiles. Over the last several decades, group-level analyses 
of in vivo neuroimaging data have led to fundamental advances in our 
understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric illnesses. More recently, 
access to computational resources and large, publicly available datasets 
alongside the rise of predictive modeling and precision medicine approaches have 
facilitated the study of psychiatric illnesses at an individual level. 
Data-driven machine learning analyses can be applied to identify 
disease-relevant biological subtypes, predict individual symptom profiles, and 
recommend personalized therapeutic interventions. However, when developing these 
predictive models, methodological choices must be carefully considered to ensure 
accurate, robust, and interpretable results. Choices pertaining to algorithms, 
neuroimaging modalities and states, data transformation, phenotypes, 
parcellations, sample sizes, and populations we are specifically studying can 
influence model performance. Here, we review applications of neuroimaging-based 
machine learning models to study psychiatric illnesses and discuss the effects 
of different methodological choices on model performance. An understanding of 
these effects is crucial for the proper implementation of predictive models in 
psychiatry and will facilitate more accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and 
therapeutics."
629,"CONTEXT: In health care, monitoring of quality indicators (QIs) in general 
urology remains underdeveloped in comparison to other clinical specialties.
OBJECTIVE: To identify, synthesise, and appraise QIs that monitor in-hospital 
care for urology patients.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This systematic review included peer-reviewed articles 
identified via Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Global Health, Google 
Scholar, and grey literature from 2000 to February 19, 2021. The review was 
carried out under the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and used the Appraisal of Indicators through 
Research and Evaluation (AIRE) tool for quality assessment.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 5111 articles and 62 government agencies were 
screened for QI sets. There were a total of 57 QI sets included for analysis. 
Most QIs focused on uro-oncology, with prostate, bladder, and testicular cancers 
the most represented. The most common QIs were surgical QIs in uro-oncology 
(positive surgical margin, surgical volume), whereas in non-oncology the QIs 
most frequently reported were for treatment and diagnosis. Out of 61 articles, 
only four scored a total of ≥50% on the AIRE tool across four domains. Aside 
from QIs developed in uro-oncology, general urological QIs are underdeveloped 
and of poor methodological quality and most lack testing for both content 
validity and reliability.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need for the development of methodologically 
robust QIs in the clinical specialty of general urology for patients to enable 
standardised quality of care monitoring and to improve patient outcomes.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated a range of quality indicators (QIs) that 
provide health care professionals with feedback on the quality of their care for 
patients with general urological diseases. We found that aside from urological 
cancers, there is a lack of QIs for general urology. Hence, there is an urgent 
need for the development of robust and disease-specific QIs in general urology."
630,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the bone mineral density (BMD) of the 
lumbar spine derived from dual-energy CT (DECT)-based volumetric material 
decomposition and its association with acute insufficiency fractures of the 
thoracolumbar spine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: L1 of 160 patients (77 men, 83 women; mean age 64.3 
years, range, 22-94 years) who underwent third-generation dual-source DECT 
between January 2016 and December 2021 due to suspected insufficiency fractures 
was retrospectively analyzed. All depicted vertebrae were examined for signs of 
recent fractures. A dedicated DECT postprocessing software using material 
decomposition was applied for phantomless BMD assessment. Receiver-operating 
characteristic (ROC) analysis identified optimal BMD thresholds. Associations of 
BMD, sex, and age with the occurrence of insufficiency fractures were examined 
with logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A DECT-derived BMD threshold of 120.40 mg/cm³ yielded 90.1% specificity 
and 59.32% sensitivity to differentiate patients with at least one insufficiency 
fracture from patients without fracture. No patient without fracture had a 
DECT-derived BMD below 85 mg/cm3. Lower DECT-derived bone mineral density was 
associated with an increased risk of insufficiency fractures (Odds ratio of 
0.93, 95% CI, 0.91-0.96, p < 0.001). Overall ROC-derived AUC was 0.82 (p < 
0.0001) for the differentiation of patients that sustained an insufficiency 
fracture from the control group.
CONCLUSION: Dual-Energy CT-based BMD assessment can accurately differentiate 
patients with acute insufficiency fractures of the thoracolumbar spine from 
patients without fracture. This algorithm can be used for phantomless risk 
stratification of patients undergoing routine CT to sustain insufficiency 
fractures of the thoracolumbar spine The identified cut-off value of 120.4 
mg/cm³ is in line with current American College of Radiology (ACR) 
recommendations to differentiate healthy individuals from those with reduced 
bone mineral density."
631,"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a complex treatment used in 
malignancies and some non-malignant diseases. The informed consent process for 
HCT can also be complex due to patient- and process-related barriers. The 
informed consent process needs to be a dynamic and ongoing process, not simply a 
checklist. As a result of the realities of HCT, we highlight some potential 
pitfalls to the informed consent process including uncertainty, sociocultural 
and communication barriers, and decisional regret. The purpose of this 
comprehensive review is to highlight unique situations which can result in 
failure of the informed consent process. We also offer potential solutions to 
these pitfalls, primarily making the informed consent more patient focused 
through dynamic and continuous processes to mitigate decisional regret."
632,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive disease, with a growing incidence, and a 
poor prognosis. Neoadjuvant treatments in PC are highly recommended in 
borderline resectable and recently in upfront resectable PC. PC is characterized 
by exocrine insufficiency and nutritional imbalance, leading to 
malnutrition/sarcopenia. The concept of malnutrition in PC is multifaceted, as 
the cancer-related alterations create an interplay with adverse effects of 
anticancer treatments. All these critical factors have a negative impact on the 
postoperative and oncological outcomes. A series of actions and programs can be 
implemented to improve resectable and borderline resectable PC in terms of 
postoperative complications, oncological outcomes and patients' quality of life. 
A timely nutritional evaluation and the implementation of appropriate 
evidence-based nutritional interventions in onco-surgical patients should be 
considered of importance to improve preoperative physical fitness. 
Unfortunately, nutritional care and its optimization are often neglected in 
real-world clinical practice. Currently available studies and ERAS® guidelines 
mostly support the use of pre- or perioperative medical nutrition, including 
immunonutrition, in order to decrease the rate of postoperative infections and 
length of hospital stay. Further data also suggest that medical nutrition should 
be considered proactively in PC patients, to possibly prevent severe 
malnutrition and its consequences on disease and treatment outcomes. This 
narrative review summarizes the most recent data related to the role of 
prehabilitation, ERAS® program, medical nutrition, and the timing of 
intervention on clinical outcomes of upfront resectable and borderline PC, and 
their potential implementation within the timeframe of neoadjuvant treatments."
633,"AIMS: Synovial sarcomas are a rare subgroup of soft-tissue sarcoma arising in 
adolescents and young adults (AYA) and in adult patients. The objective of our 
analysis was to investigate the outcomes and potential differences of AYA versus 
adult patients with initially localised disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 51 patients (25 AYA and 26 adult) were 
identified and evaluated in this retrospective single centre analysis. Baseline 
characteristics, treatment and outcome were assessed.
RESULTS: The predominant subtype in both groups was monophasic synovial sarcoma 
(17 AYA and 21 adult) and the most common site was the extremities (14 and 19 
patients) with deep tumour location in both groups (33 and 24 patients). More 
AYA patients had tumours >5 cm (13/25 patients) when compared with adults (10/26 
patients, P = n.s.). Primary wide resection was carried out in 15 AYAs and in 18 
adults. Postoperative radiation therapy was the only statistical difference 
between AYA (n = 19) and adult patients (n = 12; P = 0.029). Nineteen and 17 
patients, respectively, received adjuvant chemotherapy with no evidence of 
disease after six cycles. Nine and 11 patients relapsed after initial therapy 
and the most common metastatic site was the lung (eight versus nine patients). 
Five-year overall survival rates were 85% and 75%. Female gender, tumour size ≤5 
cm and absence of progressive disease showed a significant association with 
overall survival in AYA patients (P = 0.013, P = 0.04 and P < 0.001), whereas 
non-extremity tumours and progression after initial therapy were significant for 
worse overall survival in adult patients (P = 0.012 and P < 0.001). No 
difference in overall survival between AYA and adult patients was observed (P = 
0.899).
CONCLUSIONS: AYA and adult patients showed no significant difference in terms of 
overall survival. Male gender, tumour size >5 cm and progressive disease were 
prognostic markers for worse outcome, whereas tumour location (non-extremity) 
and progression after initial therapy were markers for worse outcome in adult 
patients."
634,"AIM: Organ saving treatment for early-stage rectal cancer can reduce patient 
reported side effects compared to standard total mesorectal excision (TME) and 
preserve quality of life (QOL). An optimal strategy for achieving organ 
preservation and longer-term oncological outcomes are unknown, thus there is a 
need for high quality trials.
METHOD: Can we Save the rectum by watchful waiting or TransAnal surgery 
following (chemo)Radiotherapy versus Total mesorectal excision for early REctal 
Cancer (STAR-TREC) is an international 3-arm multi-centre, partially randomised 
controlled trial incorporating an external pilot. In phase III, patients with 
cT1-3b N0 tumours, ≤40mm in diameter, who prefer organ preservation are 
randomised 1:1 between mesorectal long course chemoradiation versus mesorectal 
short course radiotherapy, with selective transanal microsurgery. Patients 
preferring radical surgery receive TME. STAR-TREC aims to recruit 380 patients 
to organ preservation and 120 to TME surgery. The primary outcome is the rate of 
organ preservation at 30 months. Secondary clinician reported outcomes include 
acute treatment-related toxicity, rate of non-operative management, non-regrowth 
pelvic tumour control at 36 months, non-regrowth disease free survival at 36 
months, and overall survival at 60 months and patient reported toxicity, health 
related QOL at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Exploratory biomarker research uses 
circulating tumour DNA to predict response and relapse.
DISCUSSION: STAR-TREC will prospectively evaluate contrasting therapeutic 
strategies and implement new measures including a smaller mesorectal target 
volume, 2-step response assessment and non-operative management for complete 
response. The trial will yield important information to guide routine management 
of patients with early-stage rectal cancer."
635,"The role of endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of chronic

of cirrhotic portal hypertension and potential complications hereof, such as 
ascites and gastrooesophageal varices. More specifically, EUS-guided 
Porto-systemic Pressure Gradient (EUS-PPG) measurement, EUS-guided coil and glue

636,"Myoepithelial carcinomas (MECs) of soft tissue are rare and aggressive tumors 
affecting young adults and children, but their molecular landscape has not been 
comprehensively explored through genome sequencing. Here, we present the 
whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and RNA sequencing 
findings of two MECs. Patients 1 and 2 (P1, P2), both male, were diagnosed at 27 
and 37 yr of age, respectively, with shoulder (P1) and inguinal (P2) soft tissue 
tumors. Both patients developed metastatic disease, and P2 died of disease. P1 
tumor showed a rhabdoid cytomorphology and a complete loss of INI1 (SMARCB1) 
expression, associated with a homozygous SMARCB1 deletion. The tumor from P2 
showed a clear cell/small cell morphology, retained INI1 expression and strong 
S100 positivity. By WES and WGS, tumors from both patients displayed low tumor 
mutation burdens, and no targetable alterations in cancer genes were detected. 
P2's tumor harbored an EWSR1::KLF15 rearrangement, whereas the tumor from P1 
showed a novel ASCC2::GGNBP2 fusion. WGS evidenced a complex genomic event 
involving mainly Chromosomes 17 and 22 in the tumor from P1, which was 
consistent with chromoplexy. These findings are consistent with previous reports 
of EWSR1 rearrangements (50% of cases) in MECs and provide a genetic basis for 
the loss of SMARCB1 protein expression observed through immunohistochemistry in 
10% of 40% of MEC cases. The lack of additional driver mutations in these tumors 
supports the hypothesis that these alterations are the key molecular events in 
MEC evolution. Furthermore, the presence of complex structural variant patterns, 
invisible to WES, highlights the novel biological insights that can be gained 
through the application of WGS to rare cancers."
637,"We present the case of a 53-yr-old woman with an inherited bone marrow failure 
coexisting with uncommon extrahematological symptoms, such as cirrhosis and skin 
abnormalities. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond 
syndrome (SDS) with an atypical presentation. Unexpected was the age of disease 
expression, normally around the pediatric age, with a predominantly median 
survival age of 36 yr. To our knowledge, she was the first adult patient with a 
molecular diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond in Uruguay. The patient was referred to 
our service when she was 43-yr-old with a history of bone marrow failure with 
anemia and thrombocytopenia. All secondary causes of pancytopenia were excluded. 
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens were hypocellular for the patient's 
age. Numerous dysplastic features were observed in the three lineages. She had a 
normal karyotype and normal chromosomal fragility. A diagnosis of low-risk 
hypoplastic MDS was made. Dermatological examination revealed reticulate skin 
pigmentation with hypopigmented macules involving the face, neck, and 
extremities; nail dystrophy; premature graying; and thin hair. 
Extrahematological manifestations were present (e.g., learning difficulties, 
short stature). Last, she was diagnosed with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis CHILD 
C. This rules out all other possible causes of chronic liver disease. This 
clinical presentation initially oriented the diagnosis toward telomeropathy, so 
we did a telomeropathy NGS panel that came up negative. Finally, we did an exome 
sequencing that confirmed the diagnosis of SDS. Using whole-exome sequencing, we 
were able to find two compound heterozygous mutations in the SBDS gene that were 
responsible for the phenotype of a patient that was undiagnosed for 10 years. An 
earlier genetic diagnosis could have influenced our patient's outcome."
638,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been approved in 
malignancies associated with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants, such 
as breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. In malignancies not 
associated with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants, the therapeutic 
relevance of PARP inhibitors is less clear. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
is known to demonstrate somatic alterations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. The current 
report is on a gentleman with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with a somatic 
BRCA2 pathogenic variant, who was effectively treated with olaparib. 
Furthermore, we discuss the existing data for use of PARP inhibitors in NSCLC. 
This study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing in identifying 
gene mutations and demonstrates how such information can be used to select 
targeted therapies in patients with actionable molecular alterations."
639,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) contribute significantly to genetic diversity in 
humans, including disease-causing variation. While the effect of STR variation 
on gene expression has been extensively assessed, their impact on epigenetics 
has been poorly studied and limited to specific genomic regions. Here, we 
investigated the hypothesis that some STRs act as independent regulators of 
local DNA methylation in the human genome, and modify risk of common human 
traits. To address these questions, we first analyzed two independent datasets 
comprising PCR-free whole genome sequencing (WGS) and genome-wide DNA 
methylation levels derived from whole blood samples in 245 (discovery cohort) 
and 484 individuals (replication cohort). Utilizing genotypes for 131,635 
polymorphic STRs derived from WGS using HipSTR, we identified 11,870 STRs that 
associated with DNA methylation levels (mSTRs) of 11,774 CpGs (Bonferroni 
p<0.001) in our discovery cohort, with 90% successfully replicating in our 
second cohort. Subsequently, through fine-mapping using CAVIAR we defined 585 of 
these mSTRs as the likely causal variants underlying the observed associations 
(fm-mSTRs), and linked a fraction of these to previously reported genome-wide 
association study signals, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying 
complex human traits. Furthermore, by integrating gene expression data, we 
observed that 12.5% of the tested fm-mSTRs also modulate expression levels of 
nearby genes, reinforcing their regulatory potential. Overall, our findings 
expand the catalog of functional sequence variants that affect genome 
regulation, highlighting the importance of incorporating STRs in future genetic 
association analysis and epigenetics data for the interpretation of 
trait-associated variants."
640,"AIM: To evaluate the safety and operability of the GM142 (TENALEAF®, Medical 
Division, Gunze Limited, Tokyo, Japan) adhesion barrier applied in patients 
undergoing surgery for benign gynecologic disease.
METHODS: This multicenter open study enrolled 34 patients from November 2018 to 
October 2019.
RESULTS: The primary outcome was the incidence of adverse events (AE) within 
12 weeks postoperatively. None of the 30 patients completing the study 
experienced a life-threatening AE. Thirteen patients (43.3%) suffered 30 mild or 
moderate AE in total. No intestinal obstruction (0/30) was observed, with the 
sample size justified by the AdSpray® trial (8/61 patients with AE). No 
gelatin-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies were induced in the patients. 
The adhesion barrier could be easily inserted (even via trocar) and positioned. 
After malfunctions were reported in six patients, the instructions for use were 
updated for trocar use.
CONCLUSION: This study showed the safety and clinical feasibility GM142 as an 
adhesion barrier."
641,"BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues are important body 
components, but their effects on the mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis 
remain controversial based on the current evidence.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 372 eligible patients in whom 
subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI) and visceral adipose tissue index 
(VATI) could be measured by computed tomography images at the third lumbar 
vertebra. The association of SATI and VATI with the risk of death was evaluated 
on a continuous scale with restricted cubic spline curves based on Cox 
proportional hazards models. Cumulative probability of mortality was estimated 
by Nelson-Aalen cumulative risk curve analyses. Independent predictors of death 
were evaluated by competing risk analyses after adjusting for age, sex, and 
model for end-stage liver disease score.
RESULTS: Majority of patients were male (69.4%) with a mean age of 
55.40 ± 10.68 years. SATI had a U-shaped association with mortality (P for 
non-linearity <0.001). Cutoff values of SATI were 19.7 and 51.8 cm2 /m2 at the 
points where hazard ratios were just <1.2. SATI was categorized as low 
(<19.7 cm2 /m2 ), moderate (19.7-51.8 cm2 /m2 ), and high (>51.8 cm2 /m2 ) 
level. There was no significant difference in the cumulative probability of 
mortality between low versus moderate SATI groups (Gray's test, P = 0.052) and 
high versus moderate SATI groups (Gray's test, P = 0.054). Competing risk 
analyses demonstrated that low SATI could increase the mortality compared with 
moderate SATI (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] = 1.66, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.992-2.78, P = 0.054) and was an independent predictor of death 
(sHR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.059-3.28, P = 0.031). Competing risk analyses also 
demonstrated that high SATI could significantly increase the mortality compared 
with moderate SATI (sHR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1-2.54, P = 0.049), and was an 
independent predictor of death (sHR = 2.007, 95% CI: 1.195-3.37, P = 0.0085). 
VATI had an irregularly shaped association with mortality (P for non-linearity 
<0.001). Cutoff values of VATI were 9.8 and 40.2 cm2 /m2 at the points where 
hazard ratios were just <1.2. VATI was categorized as low (<9.8 cm2 /m2 ), 
moderate (9.8-40.2 cm2 /m2 ), and high (>40.2 cm2 /m2 ) level. There was no 
significant difference in the cumulative probability of mortality between low 
versus moderate VATI groups (Gray's test, P = 0.381) and high versus moderate 
VATI groups (Gray's test, P = 0.787). Competing risk analyses demonstrated that 
neither low (sHR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.599-2.7, P = 0.53) nor high VATI 
(sHR = 0.848, 95% CI: 0.539-1.34, P = 0.48) was an independent predictor of 
death compared with moderate VATI.
CONCLUSIONS: Both excessive deficiency and accumulation of subcutaneous adipose 
tissues negatively influence the outcomes of cirrhotic patients."
642,"OBJECTIVES: Antioxidant property like radical scavenging is a primary target to 
elucidate the efficacy mechanism of a drug against diseases linked to oxidative 
stress such as cancer, metabolic disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. In 
alternative therapies, homeopathy is one of the preferred choices by patients 
and clinicians due to its potential to cure chronic and complex illnesses. 
However, the efficacy of homeopathic preparations at high diluted potencies 
attracts rational criticism due to insufficient scientific knowledge supporting 
the mechanism of action. Therefore, an attempt was made to estimate the total 
phenolic content (TPC) and radical scavenging activity of clinically prescribed 
homeopathic drugs.
METHODS: With gallic acid as a reference control, mother tinctures (MTs) and 
different potencies of Eucalyptus globulus (EG), Syzygium jambolanum (SJ), Ruta 
graveolens (RG), and Thuja occidentalis (TO) were used to perform 
Folin-Ciocalteu test, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) 
(ABTS), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays.
RESULTS: The results showed TPC of MTs equivalent to µg/mL of gallic acid viz; 
EG (4,872.5 ± 133.2), SJ (8,840.5 ± 14.8), RG (985.6 ± 39.1), and TO 
(341.5 ± 19.5) with significant ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging potential. 
Whereas 30C and 200C potencies of each homeopathic drug showed undetectable 
phenolic content and insignificant radical scavenging potential compared to 
vehicle control, i.e., alcohol 90% (2.0 ± 1.5).
CONCLUSIONS: The reported efficacy of 30C and 200C potencies of homeopathic 
medicines against oxidative stress-related illnesses might be due to mechanisms 
other than radical scavenging. Furthermore, the assays studied can be helpful in 
drug standardization and quality control of MTs that are used as starting 
material in homeopathic preparations."
643,"PURPOSE: There is no consensus on the ideal treatment of odontogenic keratocysts 
(OKCs). Certain risk factors may modify the disease recurrence rate. The purpose 
of this study was: 1) to estimate the incidence of OKC recurrence in a 
statistically rigorous manner; and 2) to identify risk factors associated with 
OKC recurrence.
METHODS: The investigators designed and implemented a retrospective cohort study 
and enrolled a sample derived from the population of patients presenting to the 
Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery outpatient clinics at the 
University of Washington School of Dentistry and Harborview Medical Center for 
evaluation and management of OKCs between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 
2020. Predictor variables included demographics (age, gender), radiographic 
characteristics (location of lesion, locularity, size, and cortical 
perforation), and type of operation performed (decompression + cystectomy, 
enucleation ± adjuvant therapy, or resection). The primary outcome variable was 
time to recurrent disease, defined as the time from treatment to radiographic or 
clinical evidence of a new lesion (recorded in months). Kaplan-Meier analysis 
was used to estimate median time to recurrence, and Cox proportional hazards 
models were used to identify covariates statistically associated with recurrent 
disease (P ≤ .05).
RESULTS: The sample was composed of 60 subjects with 63 previously untreated 
lesions. Eight subjects (13%) developed a recurrent lesion during the study 
interval with a median time to recurrence of 31 (interquartile range, 24 to 48) 
months. One of the 8 recurrences occurred within 12 months of treatment and 7 of 
the 8 recurrences occurred more than 21 months after treatment. Based on using 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 5-year incidence of disease recurrence was estimated 
to be 34%. Lesions with cortical perforation were 8.3 times more likely to recur 
(95% confidence interval [1.7, 41.3]; P-value = .01), and multilocular lesions 
were 10.6 times more likely to recur (95% confidence interval [1.3, 86.9]; 
P-value = .03). The sample size was the limiting factor to performing regression 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Virtually every publication on OKCs to date reports frequencies of 
disease recurrence rather than applying appropriate survival analyses commonly 
used to estimate outcomes in cancer research. Failure to use the appropriate 
statistical analyses underestimates the risk of disease recurrence. Our study is 
no exception. The estimated frequency of disease recurrence during the study 
interval was 13% (8/60). When survival analyses are applied that account for 
varying months of follow-up, the incidence of disease recurrence is 34 per 100 
per 5 years. We recommend the application of time-to-event analyses in the study 
of disease entities with the potential for recurrence."
644,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possibility of gene therapy in patients with 
inherited ocular conditions and established genetic diagnosis. The secondary 
objectives were to determine the genetic diagnostic rate and to update the list 
of genes for which there are ongoing clinical trials or preclinical studies that 
could allow for gene therapy.
METHODS: Observational, retrospective, multicentric study of 177 patients with 
inherited ocular conditions that underwent genetic testing.
RESULTS: Of 177 patients with genetic testing, 146 were enrolled for this study. 
Disease-causing variants were identified in 117 patients (variant detection rate 
of 80.1%). Pathogenic variants were found in 47 genes, with ABCA4 being the most 
common gene (17.9%), followed by CRB1 (11.9%). 64.1% of patients with a genetic 
diagnosis have a variant in genes for which gene therapy has been studied and 
only 40.1% have a variant in genes with studies for gene therapy in clinical 
phase.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing has opened new horizons in the management of 
patients with hereditary ocular diseases. About two-thirds of the patients had 
pathogenic variants in genes for which gene therapy has been evaluated. However, 
many studies are in the pre-clinical phase. The expectations of patients 
undergoing genetic study and their families should be managed accordingly."
645,"In the COVID-19 period, face masks increased exponentially. Several studies 
suggest that the rise in ocular discomfort symptoms during the pandemic is 
mostly part of dry eye disease and that these are due to the effect of face 
masks, resulting in the newly described term MADE, for ""mask-associated dry 
eye"". The most commonly proposed mechanism states that wearing a face mask 
creates an unnatural upward airflow towards the ocular surface during 
expiration, although the increased temperature, humidity and levels of carbon 
dioxide of the exhaled air, stress, increased use of video display terminals, as 
well as changes in the ocular microbiota may contribute. Evidence supports that 
the use of face masks causes an increase in dry eye disease symptoms, a 
decreased tear break-up time, corneal epithelial trauma, periocular temperature 
changes and inflammatory markers secretion. Given that the use of masks may be 
frequent in some settings in the near future, it is important to establish its 
effects and consequences on the ocular surface."
646,"With the improvement of single-cell measurement techniques, there is a growing 
awareness that individual differences exist among cells, and protein expression 
distribution can vary across cells in the same tissue or cell line. Pinpointing 
the protein subcellular locations in single cells is crucial for mapping 
functional specificity of proteins and studying related diseases. Currently, 
research about single-cell protein location is still in its infancy, and most 
studies and databases do not annotate proteins at the cell level. For example, 
in the human protein atlas database, an immunofluorescence image stained for a 
particular protein shows multiple cells, but the subcellular location annotation 
is for the whole image, ignoring intercellular difference. In this study, we 
used large-scale immunofluorescence images and image-level subcellular locations 
to develop a deep-learning-based pipeline that could accurately recognize 
protein localizations in single cells. The pipeline consisted of two deep 
learning models, i.e. an image-based model and a cell-based model. The former 
used a multi-instance learning framework to comprehensively model protein 
distribution in multiple cells in each image, and could give both image-level 
and cell-level predictions. The latter firstly used clustering and heuristics 
algorithms to assign pseudo-labels of subcellular locations to the segmented 
cell images, and then used the pseudo-labels to train a classification model. 
Finally, the image-based model was fused with the cell-based model at the 
decision level to obtain the final ensemble model for single-cell prediction. 
Our experimental results showed that the ensemble model could achieve higher 
accuracy and robustness on independent test sets than state-of-the-art methods."
647,"OBJECTIVE: We undertook this study to examine the functional basis for epistasis 
between endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) and HLA-B27 in 
experimental spondyloarthritis (SpA).
METHODS: ERAP1-knockout rats were created using genome editing and bred with 
HLA-B27/human β2 -microglobulin-transgenic (HLA-B27-Tg) rats and HLA-B7-Tg rats. 
The effects of ERAP1 deficiency on HLA allotypes were determined using 
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, flow cytometry, allogeneic T cell 
proliferation assays, and gene expression analyses. Animals were examined for 
clinical features of disease, and tissue was assessed by histology.
RESULTS: ERAP1 deficiency increased the ratio of folded to unfolded (β2 m-free) 
HLA-B27 heavy chains, while having the opposite effect on HLA-B7. Furthermore, 
in rats with ERAP1 deficiency, HLA-B27 misfolding was reduced, while free 
HLA-B27 heavy chain dimers on the cell surface and monomers were increased. The 
effects of ERAP1 deficiency persisted during up-regulation of HLA-B27 and led to 
a reduction in endoplasmic reticulum stress. ERAP1 deficiency reduced the 
prevalence of arthritis in HLA-B27-Tg rats by two-thirds without reducing 
gastrointestinal inflammation. Dendritic cell abnormalities attributed to the 
presence of HLA-B27, including reduced allogeneic T cell stimulation and loss of 
CD103-positive/major histocompatibility complex class II-positive cells, were 
not rescued by ERAP1 deficiency, while excess Il23a up-regulation was mitigated.
CONCLUSION: ERAP1 deficiency reduced HLA-B27 misfolding and improved folding 
while having opposing effects on HLA-B7. The finding that HLA-B27-Tg rats had 
partial protection against SpA in this study is consistent with genetic evidence 
that loss-of-function and/or reduced expression of ERAP1 reduces the risk of 
ankylosing spondylitis. Functional studies support the concept that the effects 
of ERAP1 on HLA-B27 and SpA may be a consequence of how peptides affect the 
biology of this allotype rather than their role as antigenic determinants."
648,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver 
diseases worldwide, with a global prevalence of approximately 30%. However, the 
prevalence of NAFLD has been variously reported depending on the comorbidities. 
The rising prevalence of obesity in both the adult and pediatric populations is 
projected to consequently continue increasing NAFLD prevalence. It is a major 
cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD has a variety of clinical phenotypes and heterogeneity 
due to the complexity of pathogenesis and clinical conditions of its occurrence, 
resulting in various clinical prognoses. In this article, we briefly described 
the basic definition of NAFLD and classified the subtypes based on current 
knowledge in this field."
649,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the fastest growing 
indication to liver transplantation (LT) in Western Counties, both for end stage 
liver disease (ESLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD/NASH is often 
expression of a systemic metabolic syndrome; therefore, NAFLD/NASH patients 
require a multidisciplinary approach for a proper pre-surgical evaluation, which 
is important to achieve a post-transplant outcome comparable to that of other 
indications to LT. NAFLD/NASH patients are also at higher risk of 
post-transplant cardiovascular (CV) events, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, 
renal impairment and recurrent NASH. Lifestyle modifications, included diet and 
physical activity, are key to improve survival and quality of life after 
transplantation. A tailored immunosuppressive regimen may be proposed in 
selected patients. Development of new drugs for the treatment of recurrent NASH 
is awaited."
650,"Sialic acids are key mediators of cell function, particularly with regard to 
cellular interactions with the surrounding environment. Reagents that modulate 
the display of specific sialyl glycoforms at the cell surface would be useful 
biochemical tools and potentially allow for therapeutic intervention in numerous 
challenging chronic diseases. While multiple strategies are being explored for 
the control of cell surface sialosides, none that shows high selectivity between 
sialyltransferases or that targets a specific sialyl glycoform has yet to 
emerge. Here, we describe a strategy to block the formation of α2,8-linked 
sialic acid chains (oligo- and polysialic acid) through the use of 8-keto-sialic 
acid as a chain-terminating metabolic inhibitor that, if incorporated, cannot be 
elongated. 8-Keto-sialic acid is nontoxic at effective concentrations and serves 
to block polysialic acid synthesis in cancer cell lines and primary immune 
cells, with minimal effects on other sialyl glycoforms."
651,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in numerous common diseases as 
well as aging and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sensorineural 
hearing loss (SNHL). In the current study, we showed that supplementation with 
germanium dioxide (GeO2) in CBA/J mice resulted in SNHL due to the degeneration 
of the stria vascularis and spiral ganglion, which were associated with 
down-regulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain associated genes and 
up-regulation in apoptosis associated genes in the cochlea. Supplementation with 
taurine, coenzyme Q10, or hydrogen-rich water, attenuated the cochlear 
degeneration and associated SNHL induced by GeO2. These results suggest that 
daily supplements or consumption of antioxidants, such as taurine, coenzyme Q10, 
and hydrogen-rich water, may be a promising intervention to slow SNHL associated 
with mitochondrial dysfunction."
652,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a fatal emerging 
tick-borne zoonotic disease caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV). SFTSV infection in 
humans and companion animals is a matter of concern in endemic areas. Various 
wild animals are involved in the transmission cycle of SFTSV with vector ticks. 
Because the home range of medium-sized wild mammals commonly overlaps with 
humans' living spheres, this study aimed to reveal the endemicity of SFTSV in 
such mammals. This study investigated the prevalence of antibodies against SFTSV 
and viral RNA in medium-sized wild mammals in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan where 
human cases have been most frequently reported in Japan and performed a 
phylogenetic analysis to compare the detected SFTSV with those previously 
reported. Forty-three of 63 (68%) Japanese badgers (Meles anakuma) and 12 of 53 
(23%) Japanese raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus) had antibodies 
against SFTSV. Japanese marten (n = 1), weasels (n = 4), and Japanese red fox (n 
= 1) were negative. Two of 63 (3%) badgers tested positive for SFTSV RNA, 
whereas the other species were negative. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial 
nucleotide sequence of SFTSV revealed that viral RNA detected from badgers 
exhibited 99.8% to 100% similarity to SFTSV, as previously reported in humans, 
cat, and ticks in the study area. This study demonstrated high seropositivity of 
antibodies in medium-sized wild mammals and suggested that SFTSV could be shared 
among these mammals, humans, and companion animals in endemic areas."
653,"BACKGROUND: We designed this study to investigate the effects of the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine on epileptic seizures, as well as its adverse 
effects, in children with epilepsy (<18 years).
METHODS: This anonymous questionnaire study involved a multicenter prospective 
survey of outpatients and inpatients with epilepsy (＜18 years) registered in 
epilepsy clinics in eight hospitals in six cities of Shandong Province.
RESULTS: A total of 224 children with epilepsy were included in the study. Fifty 
of them experienced general adverse events after vaccination. The most common 
local adverse events were pain or tenderness at the injection site. The most 
common systemic adverse effects were muscle soreness and headache. No severe 
adverse events were reported. There were no significant differences in the 
number of antiseizure medications (P = 0.459), gender (P = 0.336), etiology 
(P = 0.449), age (P = 0.499), duration of disease (P = 0.546), or seizure type 
(P = 0.475) between the patients with and without general adverse events. We 
found that the risk of seizure after vaccination was decreased in children who 
were seizure free for more than six months before vaccination. There was no 
significant difference in the number of seizures during the first month before 
vaccination, the first month after the first dose, and the first month after the 
second dose (P = 0.091).
CONCLUSION: The benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 outweighed the risks of 
seizures/relapses and severe adverse events after vaccination for children with 
epilepsy."
654,"OBJECTIVES: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized 
by microvascular damage and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Among SSc 
complications, changes in nutritional status have a negative effect on quality 
of life and predispose patients to malnutrition. The aim of this exploratory 
pilot study was to examine whether bioelectrical impedance analysis-derived 
phase angle (PhA) is a parameter of nutritional status and a marker of mortality 
in patients with SSc.
METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with SSc were included in the study. 
Biochemical analyses, anthropometric data, and bioelectrical impedance analysis 
assessments were recorded at the time of enrollment. The Malnutrition Universal 
Screening Tool (MUST) and Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) 
were applied to assess nutritional status.
RESULTS: A total of 104 patients with SSc (88 women; median age: 55 y 
[interquartile range (IQR), 45.5- 66 y]) were enrolled. In patients with SSc and 
high malnutrition risk according to MUST, mean values of PhA were significantly 
lower than those of patients with SSc and low malnutrition risk (4° [IQR, 
3.7°-4.4°] vs 4.6° [IQR, 4.2°-5.1°]; P = 0.004). Patients with SSc and 
malnutrition according to the GLIM criteria showed significantly lower PhA than 
patients with SSc but without malnutrition (3.8° [IQR, 3.5°-4.3°] vs 4.6° [IQR, 
4.2°-5.1°]; P < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that overall survival 
was significantly shorter (34.57 mo [±13.35] vs 48 mo [±0]; P = 0.001) in 
patients with SSc and PhA <3.75°. In the multivariate analysis, only PhA was a 
predictive factor for death (hazard ratio: 0.283; 95% confidence interval, 
0.083-0.965; P = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained suggest that lower PhA values in patients with 
SSc are associated with an increased malnutrition risk with MUST, malnutrition 
with GLIM, and increased mortality. Additional studies are necessary to confirm 
these preliminary results."
655,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic.
OBJECTIVE: To assess global sex differences in HF epidemiology across country 
income levels.
METHODS: Using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data from 204 countries and 
territories 1990-2019, we assessed sex differences in HF prevalence, etiology, 
morbidity, and temporal trends across country sociodemographic index or gross 
national income. We derived age-standardized rates.
RESULTS: Of 56.2 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 46.4-67.8 million) 
people with HF in 2019, 50.3% were females and 69.2% lived in low- and 
middle-income countries; age-standardized prevalence was greater in males and in 
high-income countries. Ischemic and hypertensive heart disease were top causes 
of HF in males and females, respectively. There were 5.1 million (95% UI 3.3-7.3 
million) years lived with disability, distributed equally between sexes. Between 
1990-2019, there was an increase in HF cases, but a decrease in age-standardized 
rates/100,000 in males (9.1%, from 864.2 to 785.7) and females (5.8%, from 686.0 
to 646.1). High-income regions experienced a 16.0% decrease in age-standardized 
rates (from 877.5 to 736.8), while low-income regions experienced a 3.9% 
increase (from 612.1 to 636.0), largely consistent across sexes. There was a 
temporal increase in age-standardized HF from hypertensive, rheumatic and 
calcific aortic valvular heart disease, and a decrease from ischemic heart 
disease, with regional and sex differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Age-standardized HF rates have decreased over time, with larger 
decreases in males than females; and with large decreases in high-income and 
small increases in low-income regions. Sex and regional differences offer 
targets for intervention."
656,"OBJECTIVE: Histopathology image segmentation can assist medical professionals in 
identifying and diagnosing diseased tissue more efficiently. Although fully 
supervised segmentation models have excellent performance, the annotation cost 
is extremely expensive. Weakly supervised models are widely used in medical 
image segmentation due to their low annotation cost. Nevertheless, these weakly 
supervised models have difficulty in accurately locating the boundaries between 
different classes of regions in pathological images, resulting in a high rate of 
false alarms. Our objective is to design a weakly supervised segmentation model 
to resolve the above problems.
APPROACH: The segmentation model is divided into two main stages, the generation 
of pseudo labels based on Class Residual Attention Accumulation Network 
(CRAANet) and the semantic segmentation based on Pixel Feature Space 
Construction Network (PFSCNet). CRAANet provides attention scores for each class 
through the Class Residual Attention (CRA) module, while the Attention 
Accumulation (AA) module overlays the attention feature maps generated in each 
training epoch. PFSCNet employs a network model containing an inflated 
convolutional residual neural network and a multi-scale feature-aware module as 
the segmentation backbone, and proposes Dense Energy Loss (DE Loss) and Pixel 
Clustering (PCL) are modules based on contrast learning to solve the 
pseudo-labeling-inaccuracy problem.
MAIN RESULTS: We validate our method using the lung adenocarcinoma 
(LUAD-HistoSeg) dataset and the breast cancer (BCSS) dataset. The results of the 
experiments show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art 
methods on both datasets in several metrics. This suggests that it is capable of 
performing well in a wide variety of histopathological image segmentation tasks.
SIGNIFICANCE: We propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation network that 
achieves approximate fully supervised segmentation performance even in the case 
of incomplete labels. The proposed attention accumulation and pixel-level 
contrast learning also make the edges more accurate and can well assist 
pathologists in their research."
657,"OBJECTIVE: Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) image analysis is a non-invasive in 
vivo clinical technique that can quantify corneal nerve fiber damage. However, 
the acquired CCM images are often accompanied by speckle noise and non-uniform 
illumination, which seriously affects the analysis and diagnosis of the 
diseases.
APPROACH: In this paper, first we propose a variational Retinex model for the 
inhomogeneity correction and noise removal of CCM images. In this model, the 
Beppo-Levi (BL) space is introduced to constrain the smoothness of the 
illumination layer for the first time, and the fractional order differential is 
adopted as the regularization term to constrain reflectance layer. Then, a 
denoising regularization term is also constructed with Block Matching 3D (BM3D) 
to suppress noise. Finally, by adjusting the uneven illumination layer, we 
obtain the final results. Second, an image quality evaluation metric is proposed 
to evaluate the illumination uniformity of images objectively.
MAIN RESULTS: To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, the proposed 
method is tested on 628 low-quality CCM images from the CORN-2 dataset. 
Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms the other four 
related methods in terms of noise removal and uneven illumination suppression. 
Significance This demonstrates that the proposed method may be helpful for the 
diagnostics and analysis of eye diseases."
658,"HOXA9 is commonly upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it confers 
poor prognosis. Characterising the protein interactome of endogenous HOXA9 in 
human AML, we identified a chromatin complex of HOXA9 with the nuclear matrix 
attachment protein-SAFB. SAFB perturbation phenocopied HOXA9 knockout to 
decrease AML proliferation, increase differentiation and apoptosis in vitro and 
prolonged survival in vivo. Integrated genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic 
analyses further demonstrated that the HOXA9-SAFB-chromatin complex associates 
with NuRD and HP1g to repress the expression of factors associated with 
differentiation and apoptosis, including NOTCH1, CEBPd, S100A8, and CDKN1A. 
Chemical or genetic perturbation of NuRD and HP1g -associated catalytic activity 
also triggered differentiation, apoptosis and the induction of these 
tumor-suppressive genes. Importantly, this mechanism is operative in other 
HOXA9-dependent AML genotypes. This mechanistic insight demonstrates active 
HOXA9-dependent differentiation block as a potent mechanism of disease 
maintenance in AML, that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention via 
therapies targeting the HOXA9/SAFB interface and/or NuRD and HP1g activity."
659,"The safety of 9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) has been established with regard to 
common and uncommon adverse events. However, investigation of rare and severe 
adverse events requires extended study periods to capture rare outcomes. This 
observational cohort study investigated the occurrence of three rare and serious 
adverse events following 9-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV) vaccination 
compared to other vaccinations, in US individuals 9-26 years old, using 
electronic health record data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). We 
searched for occurrences of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory 
demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and stroke following 9vHPV vaccination from 
October 4, 2015, through January 2, 2021. We compared the risks of GBS, CIDP, 
and stroke following 9vHPV vaccination to risks of those outcomes following 
comparator vaccines commonly given to this age group (Td, Tdap, MenACWY, 
hepatitis A, and varicella vaccines) from January 1, 2007, through January 2, 
2021. We observed 1.2 cases of stroke, 0.3 cases of GBS, and 0.1 cases of CIDP 
per 100,000 doses of 9vHPV vaccine. After observing more than 1.8 million doses 
of 9vHPV, we identified no statistically significant increase in risks 
associated with 9vHPV vaccination for any of these adverse events, either 
combined or stratified by age (9-17 years of age vs. 18-26 years of age) and sex 
(males vs. females). Our findings provide additional evidence supporting 9vHPV 
vaccine safety, over longer time frames and for more serious and rare adverse 
events."
660,"Both cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share some 
common risk factors (e.g., age, obesity, oxidative stress, inflammation, 
hypertension) that contribute to their overlapping pathogenesis, indicating a 
""head-to-heart"" pathological connection between CVDs and AD. To explore this 
potential connection at the protein level, we study the potential cross-seeding 
(heterotypic interactions) between CVD-associated atrial natriuretic peptide 
(ANP) and AD-associated β-amyloid (Aβ). Collective aggregation and cell assays 
demonstrate the cross-seeding of ANP with different Aβ species including 
monomers, oligomers, and fibrils with high binding affinity (KD = 1.234-1.797 
μM) in a dose-dependent manner. Such ANP-induced cross-seeding also modifies the 
Aβ aggregation pathway, fibril morphology, and cell deposition pattern by 
inhibiting Aβ fibrillization from small aggregates, disassembling preformed Aβ 
fibrils, and alleviating Aβ-associated cytotoxicity. Finally, using transgenic 
C. elegans worms that express the human muscle-specific Aβ1-42, ANP can also 
effectively delay Aβ-induced worm paralysis, decrease Aβ plaques in worm brains, 
and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, confirming its in vivo 
inhibition ability to prevent neurodevelopmental toxicity in worms. This work 
discovers not only a new cross-seeding system between the two disease-related 
proteins but also a new finding that ANP possesses a new biological function as 
an Aβ inhibitor in the nonaggregated state."
661,"Background: Conventional newborn screening (NBS) is usually based on biochemical 
methods to predict the risk of inborn errors of metabolism. Recent studies have 
applied next-generation sequencing in NBS and revealed much more information, 
including carrier status. Whether these carriers of variants differ from other 
individuals was not fully determined. Objective: This research investigated the 
effect of heterozygous carrier status of pathogenic variants on biochemical 
indicators during NBS. Methods: We enrolled newborns participating in both 
conventional NBS and our previous Newborn Screening with Targeted Sequencing 
(NESTS) program from January 2021 to December 2021 in the Shunyi Maternal and 
Children's Hospital of Beijing Children's Hospital. Newborn levels of 
phenylalanine (Phe), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and 
17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) were measured to be analyzed together with 
associated sequencing results. Results: A total of 2351 newborns in the NESTS 
program was examined in the study. None had biallelic variants in genes related 
to congenital hypothyroidism (CH), hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) or congenital 
adrenal hyperplasia. Forty-nine heterozygous carriers with phenylalanine 
hydroxylase (PAH) variants had significantly higher levels of Phe (p < 0.0001), 
and 11 heterozygous carriers of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) 
variants had significantly higher levels of TSH (p < 0.05). Although 
heterozygous carriers had higher biochemical levels, they were below the 
diagnostic threshold of HPA and CH. Conclusions: Carriers of heterozygous 
variants in PAH or TSHR had significantly increased biochemical levels of 
associated factors in NBS. For individuals with higher Phe or TSH levels within 
the normal reference intervals, attention should be paid to the possibility of 
heterozygous carrier status."
662,"Purpose: To explore the genetic defects in two Chinese families with X-linked 
Norrie disease (ND). Methods: We analyzed two Chinese families with ND at 
molecular level through clinical exome sequencing and the variations were 
identified by Sanger sequencing. Results: Two genetic variations were found in 
the NDP gene by clinical exome sequencing, a partial deletion of 801 bp 
contained the whole exon 2 and a missense variant (164G>A) within codon 55 that 
resulted in the interchange of cysteine by phenylalanine. Clinical findings were 
more severe in the patients who presented the missense variant. Conclusion: We 
report two genetic variations in the NDP gene in Chinese that extend the 
mutational and phenotypic spectra of NDP gene, and also demonstrate the 
feasibility of clinical exome sequencing in application of molecular diagnosis."
663,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the relationship between atherosclerotic plaque 
characteristics (APCs) and angiographic stenosis severity in patients with and 
without diabetes. Whether APCs differ based on lesion severity and diabetes 
status is unknown.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 303 subjects from the 
Computed TomogRaphic Evaluation of Atherosclerotic Determinants of Myocardial 
IsChEmia (CREDENCE) trial referred for invasive coronary angiography with 
coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and classified lesions as 
obstructive (≥50% stenosed) or nonobstructive using blinded core laboratory 
analysis of quantitative coronary angiography. CCTA quantified APCs, including 
plaque volume (PV), calcified plaque (CP), noncalcified plaque (NCP), 
low-density NCP (LD-NCP), lesion length, positive remodeling (PR), high-risk 
plaque (HRP), and percentage of atheroma volume (PAV; PV normalized for vessel 
volume). The relationship between APCs, stenosis severity, and diabetes status 
was assessed.
RESULTS: Among the 303 patients, 95 (31.4%) had diabetes. There were 117 lesions 
in the cohort with diabetes, 58.1% of which were obstructive. Patients with 
diabetes had greater plaque burden (P = 0.004). Patients with diabetes and 
nonobstructive disease had greater PV (P = 0.02), PAV (P = 0.02), NCP (P = 
0.03), PAV NCP (P = 0.02), diseased vessels (P = 0.03), and maximum stenosis (P 
= 0.02) than patients without diabetes with nonobstructive disease. APCs were 
similar between patients with diabetes with nonobstructive disease and patients 
without diabetes with obstructive disease. Diabetes status did not affect HRP or 
PR. Patients with diabetes had similar APCs in obstructive and nonobstructive 
lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes and nonobstructive stenosis had an 
association to similar APCs as patients without diabetes who had obstructive 
stenosis. Among patients with nonobstructive disease, patients with diabetes had 
more total PV and NCP."

667,"BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has been authorized for emergency use by many 
countries for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). However, the 
supply falls short of the global demand, which creates a need for more options. 
VV116 is an oral antiviral agent with potent activity against severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, noninferiority, observer-blinded, randomized 
trial during the outbreak caused by the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of 
SARS-CoV-2. Symptomatic adults with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 with a high risk 
of progression were assigned to receive a 5-day course of either VV116 or 
nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. The primary end point was the time to sustained clinical 
recovery through day 28. Sustained clinical recovery was defined as 
the alleviation of all Covid-19-related target symptoms to a total score of 0 or 
1 for the sum of each symptom (on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores 
indicating greater severity; total scores on the 11-item scale range from 0 to 
33) for 2 consecutive days. A lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the hazard ratio of more than 0.8 was considered to indicate 
noninferiority (with a hazard ratio of >1 indicating a shorter time to sustained 
clinical recovery with VV116 than with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir).
RESULTS: A total of 822 participants underwent randomization, and 771 received 
VV116 (384 participants) or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (387 participants). The 
noninferiority of VV116 to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with respect to the time to 
sustained clinical recovery was established in the primary analysis (hazard 
ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.35) and was maintained in 
the final analysis (median, 4 days with VV116 and 5 days with 
nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.36). In the final 
analysis, the time to sustained symptom resolution (score of 0 for each of the 
11 Covid-19-related target symptoms for 2 consecutive days) and to a first 
negative SARS-CoV-2 test did not differ substantially between the two groups. No 
participants in either group had died or had had progression to severe Covid-19 
by day 28. The incidence of adverse events was lower in the VV116 group than in 
the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group (67.4% vs. 77.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 who were at risk for 
progression, VV116 was noninferior to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with respect to the 
time to sustained clinical recovery, with fewer safety concerns. (Funded by

668,"Chemical immunotherapeutic strategies including Antibody Recruiting Molecules 
(ARMs) direct immune-mediated clearance of diseased cells or pathogens. ARMs are 
bivalent small molecules containing an antibody-binding domain (ABD) and a 
target-binding domain (TBD) to recruit endogenous serum antibodies to highly 
overexpressed tumour antigens for immune mediated clearance. ARM function relies 
on a high tumour antigen valency, limiting function against lower antigen 
expressing tumours. To address this limitation, we report a tuneable multivalent 
immune recruitment platform (MIR) to amplify/stabilize antibody recruitment to 
cells with lower antigen valencies. An initial set of polymeric ARMs (pARMs) 
were synthesized and screened to evaluate ABD/TBD copy number, ratio, and steric 
occlusion on specific immune induction. Most pARMs demonstrate simultaneous high 
avidity binding to anti-dinitrophenyl antibodies and prostate specific membrane

669,"An aptamer-based field-effect transistor (Apta-FET) is a well-developed assay 
method with high selectivity and sensitivity. Due to the limited information 
density that natural nucleotide library holds, the Apta-FET faces fundamental 
restriction in universality to detect various types of analytes. Herein, we 
demonstrate a type of Apta-FET sensors based on an artificial nucleotide aptamer 
(AN-Apta-FET). The introduction of an artificial nucleotide increases the 
diversity of the potential aptamer structure and expands the analyte category of 
the Apta-FET. The AN-Apta-FET specifically detects hepatoma exosomes, which 
traditional Apta-FET fails to discriminate from other tumor-derived exosomes, 
with a limit of detection down to 242 particles mL-1. The AN-Apta-FET 
distinguishes serum samples of hepatocellular carcinoma patients within 9 min 
from those of healthy people, showing the potential as a comprehensive assay 
tool in future disease diagnosis."
670,"We used a transgenic parasite in which Plasmodium falciparum parasites were 
genetically modified to express Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen 1 
(PvAMA1) protein in place of PfAMA1 to study PvAMA1-mediated invasion. In P. 
falciparum, AMA1 interaction with rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2) is known to be 
crucial for invasion, and PfRON2 peptides (PfRON2p) blocked the invasion of 
PfAMA1 wild-type parasites. However, PfRON2p has no effect on the invasion of 
transgenic parasites expressing PvAMA1 indicating that PfRON2 had no role in the 
invasion of PvAMA1 transgenic parasites. Interestingly, PvRON2p blocked the 
invasion of PvAMA1 transgenic parasites in a dose-dependent manner. We found 
that recombinant PvAMA1 domains 1 and 2 (rPvAMA1) bound to reticulocytes and 
normocytes indicating that PvAMA1 directly interacts with erythrocytes during 
the invasion, and invasion blocking of PvRON2p may result from it interfering 
with PvAMA1 binding to erythrocytes. It was previously shown that the peptide 
containing Loop1a of PvAMA1 (PvAMA1 Loop1a) is also bound to reticulocytes. We 
found that the Loop1a peptide blocked the binding of PvAMA1 to erythrocytes. 
PvAMA1 Loop1a has no polymorphisms in contrast to other PvAMA1 loops and may be 
an attractive vaccine target. We thus present the evidence that PvAMA1 binds to 
erythrocytes in addition to interacting with PvRON2 suggesting that the P. vivax 
merozoites may exploit complex pathways during the invasion process."
671,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) is a key regulator of tissue growth and 
development in response to growth hormone stimulation. In the skeletal system, 
IGF-1 derived from osteoblasts and chondrocytes are essential for normal bone 
development; however, whether bone marrow (BM)-resident cells provide distinct 
sources of IGF-1 in the adult skeleton remains elusive. Here, we show that BM 
stromal cells (BMSCs) and megakaryocytes/platelets (MKs/PLTs) express the 
highest levels of IGF-1 in adult long bones. Deletion of Igf1 from BMSCs by 
Lepr-Cre leads to decreased bone formation, impaired bone regeneration, and 
increased BM adipogenesis. Importantly, reduction of BMSC-derived IGF-1 
contributes to fasting-induced marrow fat accumulation. In contrast, deletion of 
Igf1 from MKs/PLTs by Pf4-Cre leads to reduced bone formation and regeneration 
without affecting BM adipogenesis. To our surprise, MKs/PLTs are also an 
important source of systemic IGF-1. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from Pf4-Cre; 
Igf1f/fmice showed compromised osteogenic potential both in vivo and in vitro, 
suggesting that MK/PLT-derived IGF-1 underlies the therapeutic effects of PRP. 
Taken together, this study identifies BMSCs and MKs/PLTs as two important 
sources of IGF-1 that coordinate to maintain and regenerate the adult skeleton, 
highlighting reciprocal regulation between the hematopoietic and skeletal 
systems."
672,"The nuclear long non-coding RNA LUCAT1 has previously been identified as a 
negative feedback regulator of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine 
expression in human myeloid cells. Here, we define the mechanistic basis for the 
suppression of inflammatory gene expression by LUCAT1. Using comprehensive 
identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry as well as RNA 
immunoprecipitation, we identified proteins important in processing and 
alternative splicing of mRNAs as LUCAT1-binding proteins. These included 
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C, M, and A2B1. Consistent with this 
finding, cells lacking LUCAT1 have altered splicing of selected immune genes. In 
particular, upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, the splicing of the nuclear 
receptor 4A2 (NR4A2) gene was particularly affected. As a consequence, 
expression of NR4A2 was reduced and delayed in cells lacking LUCAT1. 
NR4A2-deficient cells had elevated expression of immune genes. These 
observations suggest that LUCAT1 is induced to control the splicing and 
stability of NR4A2, which is in part responsible for the anti-inflammatory 
effect of LUCAT1. Furthermore, we analyzed a large cohort of patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease as well as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. In these patients, LUCAT1 levels were elevated and in both diseases, 
positively correlated with disease severity. Collectively, these studies define 
a key molecular mechanism of LUCAT1-dependent immune regulation through 
post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs highlighting its role in the regulation 
of inflammatory disease."
673,"Decline in mitochondrial function underlies aging and age-related diseases, but 
the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in these processes remains 
elusive. To investigate patterns of mtDNA mutations, it is particularly 
important to quantify mtDNA mutations and their associated pathogenic effects at 
the single-cell level. However, existing single-cell mtDNA sequencing approaches 
remain inefficient due to high cost and low mtDNA on-target rates. In this 
study, we developed a cost-effective mtDNA targeted-sequencing protocol called 
single-cell sequencing by targeted amplification of multiplex probes (scSTAMP) 
and experimentally validated its reliability. We then applied our method to 
assess single-cell mtDNA mutations in 768 B lymphocytes and 768 monocytes from a 
76-y-old female. Across 632 B lymphocyte and 617 monocytes with medium mtDNA 
coverage over >100×, our results indicated that over 50% of cells carried at 
least one mtDNA mutation with variant allele frequencies (VAFs) over 20%, and 
that cells carried an average of 0.658 and 0.712 such mutation for B lymphocytes 
and monocytes, respectively. Surprisingly, more than 20% of the observed 
mutations had VAFs of over 90% in either cell population. In addition, over 60% 
of the mutations were in protein-coding genes, of which over 70% were 
nonsynonymous, and more than 50% of the nonsynonymous mutations were predicted 
to be highly pathogenic. Interestingly, about 80% of the observed mutations were 
singletons in the respective cell populations. Our results revealed mtDNA 
mutations with functional significance might be prevalent at advanced age, 
calling further investigation on age-related mtDNA mutation dynamics at the 
single-cell level."
674,"De novo viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) utilize their priming 
element (PE) to facilitate accurate initiation. Upon transition to elongation, 
the PE has to retreat from the active site to give room to the template-product 
RNA duplex. However, PE conformational change upon this transition and the role 
of PE at elongation both remain elusive. Here, we report crystal structures of 
RdRP elongation complex (EC) from dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), demonstrating 
a dramatic refolding of PE that allows establishment of interactions with the 
RNA duplex backbone approved to be essential for EC stability. Enzymology data 
from both DENV2 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRPs suggest that critical 
transition of the refolding likely occurs after synthesis of a 4- to 
5-nucleotide (nt) product together providing a key basis in understanding viral 
RdRP transition from initiation to elongation."
675,"Rationale: Inhalation of the correct dose of a short-acting beta 2 agonist 
(SABA) from a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) is essential for the 
relief of symptoms in patients with asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and factors 
associated with the incorrect use of a pMDI. Methods: This study retrospectively 
assessed the electronic medical records of 161 patients with various respiratory 
diseases. The patients had never used a pMDI and underwent training by 
pharmacists educated in the use of a pMDI followed by bronchodilator 
reversibility testing at our hospital. The patients' characteristics and various 
lung capacity parameters were evaluated for association with the incorrect use 
of a pMDI. Results: Thirty-nine of the 161 (24.2%) patients, including 46% of 28 
patients older than 80 years, used the pMDI incorrectly, mainly because of 
incoordination between activation of the device and inhalation (n = 11), 
inadequate strength to manipulate the device (n = 9), too short duration of 
inhalation (n = 6), and difficulty in breath holding (n = 3). Advanced age; 
lower height; and decreased lung volumes, including vital capacity (VC), 
inspiratory capacity, inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), forced vital capacity 
(FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow 
rate, were associated with the incorrect use of a pMDI. Neither the body weight, 
tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, %FVC predicted, %FEV1 predicted, nor 
FEV1% was associated with the incorrect use of a pMDI. Multivariate binomial 
logistic regression analysis identified decreased IRV as the only independent 
predictor associated with the incorrect use of a pMDI. Conclusions: Physicians 
should be aware that elderly patients or patients with decreased IRV might be 
unable to obtain the correct SABA dose from a pMDI. A large-scale prospective 
study is required to confirm these findings from our retrospective study with a 
small group of patients."
676,"Methionine (MET) contributes to brain function and is required for proper 
functioning of the central nervous system. However, exceptionally high levels of 
MET and its metabolites in plasma have been found to be toxic and can lead to 
cell alterations. Long-term exposure to MET has been shown to mimic psychotic 
symptoms in schizophrenic patients and rodents. The present study evaluated 
behavioral and neurochemical effects of long-term exposure to MET in zebrafish. 
Five groups of zebrafish were exposed to MET at a concentration of 4.5 mM for 7 
days, along with acute exposure to 25 μM of clozapine and 750, 1000, and 1250 μM 
of metoclopramide. In contrast, the normal group was exposed to only water and 
dimethyl sulfoxide. After the treatment, social interaction, anxiety, memory, 
and locomotion of zebrafish and serotonin levels in zebrafish brains were 
evaluated. Our results showed that metoclopramide was not only beneficial in 
improving MET-induced cognitive impairment but it also prevented social 
withdrawal in zebrafish exposed to MET. In addition, metoclopramide reversed 
anxiety-like behavior, as indicated by significant changes in locomotion 
activity. Despite slight changes in serotonin levels in the zebrafish brain, an 
in vitro serotonin assay failed to demonstrate significant differences between 
the disease control, normal, and two treatment groups. Finally, results from the 
study showed that repeated administration of MET induced schizophrenia-like 
symptoms, although metoclopramide ameliorated the MET-mediated negative symptoms 
and cognitive deficits in zebrafish. Overall, our findings suggest a new 
perspective to further explore the antipsychotic properties of metoclopramide."
677,"Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolated from food animals pose a major health 
threat to the public on this planet. This study aimed to determine the 
susceptibility profiles of Escherichia coli isolated from cattle and pig fecal 
samples and investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli using gene identification, conjugation, and 
Southern blot approach. Overall 293 E. coli were recovered from cattle (120 
isolates) and pigs (173 isolates) in 7 provinces of Korea during 2017-2018. 
Ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and sulfisoxazole resistance rates 
were the highest in pigs' isolates (>60%, p ≤ 0.001) compared to that in cattle 
(3-39%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was higher in pig isolates (73%) than in 
cattle (31%), and the MDR profile usually includes streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, 
and tetracycline. Resistance to critically important antimicrobials such as 
ceftiofur, colistin, and ciprofloxacin was higher in weaners than those from 
finishers in pigs. The qnrS gene was detected in 13% of the pig isolates. Eight 
isolates from pigs and one isolate from cattle were identified as ESBL-producers 
and ESBL genes belonged to blaCTX-M-55 (n = 4), blaCTX-M-14 (n = 3), and 
blaCTX-M-65 (n = 2). Notably, the blaCTX-M-65 and qnrS1 genes were found to be 
carried together in an identical plasmid (IncHI2) in two isolates from finisher 
pigs. The blaCTX-M-carrying isolates belonged to phylogenetic groups B1 (n = 4), 
B2 (n = 2), A (n = 2), and D (n = 1). The blaCTX-M genes and non-β-lactam 
resistance traits were transferred to the E. coli J53 recipient from seven 
blaCTX-M-positive strains isolated from pigs. The blaCTX-M genes belonged to the 
IncI1α, IncFII, and IncHI2 plasmids and are also associated with the ISEcp1, 
IS26, IS903, and orf477 elements. These findings suggested the possibility of 
blaCTX-M-carrying E. coli transmission to humans through direct contact with 
cattle and pigs or contamination of food products."
678,"Propionic acidemia (PA) is an ultrarare disorder caused by deficiency of the 
mitochondrial enzyme, propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), composed of PCCA and PCCB 
subunits. An enzyme replacement therapy is being developed using dual messenger 
RNA (mRNA) therapy composed of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating mRNAs 
encoding PCCA and PCCB subunits of the PCC enzyme. We herein report on 
development of a translational semimechanistic pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) model to quantify the relationship between the mRNA 
components of mRNA-3927 (an LNP encapsulating PCCA and PCCB mRNAs) and dose 
levels; PCCA/B mRNA PK and PD responses were assessed as circulating levels of 
primary disease markers 2-methyl citrate, 3-hydroxypropionate, and propionyl 
carnitine normalized to acetyl carnitine (C3/C2 ratio) to inform the 
first-in-human dose range and regimen selection. The translational PK/PD model 
was developed using preclinical data available in mice with PA, Sprague Dawley 
rats, and cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels ranging from 0.2 to 9 mg/kg. PCCA/B 
mRNA PK in mice, rats, and monkeys was adequately described using allometric 
scaling of volume and clearance parameters. The interspecies preclinical model 
was scaled allometrically to humans to predict the dose-response relationship in 
adult and pediatric patients with PA to guide selection of dose range and 
regimen for the Phase 1 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier 
NCT04159103)."
679,"Background: End-stage liver disease (ESLD) patients carry heavy symptom burdens 
and risk receiving aggressive and sometimes unwanted care at end of life. 
Palliative care (PC), which aims to alleviate symptoms and facilitate 
goal-concordant care in serious illness, may offer substantial benefits for ESLD 
patients but is not widely provided. Objectives: To assess the impact of PC 
integrated within hepatology (PCIH) services on health care utilization, advance 
care planning (ACP), and hospice enrollment. Design: We compared patients who 
received PCIH (n = 55) to a retrospective cohort (n = 57) receiving usual care 
in an outpatient hepatology clinic. Setting/Subjects: From June 2016 to November 
2017, we enrolled patients receiving care in a U.S. public hospital clinic who 
met the following inclusion criteria: (1) ESLD with a Model for End-Stage Liver 
Disease score ≥20, (2) hepatology approval for PC referral, and (3) at least one 
advanced complication of ESLD. Measurements: We assessed patient demographics, 
clinical information, health care insurance status, health care utilization, 
completion of psychosocial assessments, and ACP using two-sided Fisher's exact 
test and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: Patients receiving PCIH more frequently 
had goals of care discussions (87.3% vs. 21.2% p ≤ 0.01), completed ACP 
documentation (56.4% vs. 7.0%, p ≤ 0.01), psychosocial assessments (98.2% vs. 
35.1%, p ≤ 0.01), and hospice enrollment (25.5% vs. 7.0%, p = 0.01). Patients 
receiving PCIH who were hospitalized also had fewer mean hospitalization days 
(13 vs. 19.7 days, p ≤ 0.01). Conclusions: Embedding PC services in a hepatology 
clinic is a promising strategy to improve care for ESLD patients in public 
hospitals."
680,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for most deaths in patients 
with type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, the determinants of plaque composition are 
unknown. miRNAs regulate gene expression, participate in the development of 
atherosclerosis, and represent promising CVD biomarkers. This study analyzed the 
circulating miRNA expression profile in T1D with either carotid calcified (CCP) 
or fibrous plaque (CFP).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Circulating small noncoding RNAs were sequenced and 
quantified using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis in an 
exploratory set of 26 subjects with T1D with CCP and in 25 with CFP. Then, in a 
validation set of 40 subjects with CCP, 40 with CFP, and 24 control subjects 
with T1D, selected miRNA expression was measured by digital droplet PCR. 
Putative gene targets enriched for pathways implicated in 
atherosclerosis/vascular calcification/diabetes were analyzed. The patients' 
main clinical characteristics were also recorded.
RESULTS: miR-503-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-106b-3p, and miR-93-5p were significantly 
upregulated, while miR-10a-5p was downregulated in patients with CCP compared 
with CFP (all fold change >±1.5; P < 0.05). All candidate miRNAs showed a 
significant correlation with LDL-cholesterol, direct for the upregulated and 
inverse for the downregulated miRNA, in CCP. Many target genes of upregulated 
miRNAs in CCP participate in osteogenic differentiation, apoptosis, 
inflammation, cholesterol metabolism, and extracellular matrix organization.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings characterize miRNAs and their signature in the 
regulatory network of carotid plaque phenotype in T1D, providing new insights 
into plaque pathophysiology and possibly novel biomarkers of plaque composition."
681,"Linezolid has been reported to restore erythromycin susceptibility in 
erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This phenomenon has not been 
reported in enterococci and the mechanisms involved therein are still unknown. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved and the 
effect of combining linezolid with erythromycin on erythromycin-resistant 
enterococci. Checkerboard techniques were used to determine drug interactions, 
and 12 of 14 isolates showed a synergistic effect between erythromycin and 
linezolid (fractional inhibitory concentration <0.5). We observed that the 
erm(B) gene, which encodes a dimethyltransferase responsible for erythromycin 
resistance, was expressed from transposon Tn1545 in the tested 
erythromycin-resistant enterococci. After exposure to linezolid, erm(B)-mediated 
rRNA dimethylation at A2071 could not be detected, and the erm(B) gene was lost 
following acquisition of erythromycin susceptibility. Thus, in conclusion, 
linezolid combined with erythromycin exerts a synergistic effect against 
erythromycin-resistant enterococci. Linezolid treatment suppressed 
erm(B)-mediated rRNA dimethylation at A2071, which could lead to loss of the 
erm(B) gene."
682,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases without a 
care standard and show variability in treatment outcomes. This Spanish, 
observational, prospective study ERASME (CEL-SMD-2012-01) assessed the evolution 
of newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve high-risk MDS patients (according to 
IPPS-R). 204 patients were included: median age 73.0 years, 54.4% males, 69.6% 
0-1 ECOG, and 94.6% with comorbidities. Active treatment was the most common 
strategy (52.0%) vs. stem cell transplantation (25.5%) and supportive 
care/watchful-waiting (22.5%). Overall (median) event-free survival was 
7.9 months (9.1, 8.3, and 5.3); progression-free survival: 10.1 months (12.9, 
12.8, and 4.3); and overall survival: 13.8 months (15.4, 14.9; 8.4), 
respectively, with significant differences among groups. Adverse events (AEs) of 
≥3 grade were reported in 72.6% of patients; serious AEs reported in 60.6%. 
33.1% of patients died due to AEs. Three patients developed second primary 
malignant neoplasms (median: 8.2 months). Our study showed better outcomes in 
patients receiving active therapy early after diagnosis."
683,"BACKGROUND: This study used machine learning to develop a 3-year lung cancer 
risk prediction model with large real-world data in a mostly younger population.
METHODS: Over 4.7 million individuals, aged 45-65 years with no history of any 
cancer or lung cancer screening, diagnostic, or treatment procedures, with an 
outpatient visit in 2013 were identified in the Optum® De-identified Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) Dataset. A Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator 
model was fit using all available data in the 365 days prior. Temporal 
validation was assessed with recent data. External validation was assessed with 
data from Mercy Health Systems EHR and Optum® De-Identified Clinformatics Data 
Mart. Racial inequities in model discrimination were assessed with xAUCs.
RESULTS: The model AUC was 0.76. Top predictors included age, smoking, race, 
ethnicity, and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The model 
identified a high-risk group with lung cancer incidence 9 times the average 
cohort incidence, representing 10% of lung cancer patients. Model performed well 
temporally and externally, while performance was reduced for Asians and 
Hispanics.
CONCLUSIONS: A high-dimensional model trained using big data identified a subset 
of patients with high lung cancer risk. The model demonstrated transportability 
to EHR and claims data, while underscoring the need to assess racial disparities 
when using machine learning methods.
IMPACT: This internally and externally validated real-world data-based lung 
cancer prediction model is available on an open-source platform for broad 
sharing and application. Model integration into an EHR system could minimize 
physician burden by automating identification of high-risk patients."
684,"Background: Remote physiological monitoring (RPM) is a form of telehealth that 
measures vital signs at home and automatically reports the results to providers, 
thereby possibly improving chronic disease management. Medicare payment for RPM 
began in 2019. Two potential obstacles to RPM growth are the paucity of 
published clinical outcomes data and the Medicare requirement that monitoring be 
done at least 16 days per month to bill for the service. To help address these 
issues, we report the following uncontrolled observational study. Methods: A 
total of 1,102 consecutive patients enrolled in RPM were divided into four 
groups based on initial average mean arterial pressure (MAP) and into six groups 
based on the number of days per month MAP was measured. We report changes in MAP 
after 6 months of RPM as a function of initial MAP, and number of days per month 
MAP was monitored. Results: After 6 months of RPM, average MAP dropped from 97 
to 93 (p < 0.01). This drop was greatest in the 50% of patients initially 
hypertensive. These patients saw average MAP reductions from 106 to 97 (p < 
0.001) and became normotensive. Although MAP reduction was greatest the more 
frequently patients measured, significant reduction occurred in the hypertensive 
patients whether they measured more or less than 16 days per month (p < 0.001). 
No minimum threshold of measurements was found that predicted failure of RPM to 
lower MAP. Conclusions: RPM is associated with clinically and statistically 
significant reductions in average MAP in patients who were initially 
hypertensive. This benefit occurred irrespective of the number of days per month 
patients measured MAP."
685,"People with sickle cell disease (pwSCD) are at risk of developing lung 
conditions that complicate their sickle cell disease (SCD) but often face 
healthcare access barriers. An interdisciplinary SCD-pulmonary clinic was 
created in 2014 at Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) to address access 
barriers that may prevent optimized treatment. We hypothesize that pwSCD and 
pulmonary disease would have fewer hospitalizations for acute chest syndrome 
(ACS), asthma, and vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) in the two years after their 
initial SCD-pulmonary clinic visit compared to the two years prior. From 
2014-2020,119 pwSCD were evaluated in the SCD-pulmonary clinic and followed at 
NCH for at least two years before and after this visit. Acute care outcomes, 
pulmonary function, polysomnography, echocardiogram, laboratory, and medication 
prescribing data were collected and analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed ranked 
and McNemar's tests. The median number of acute care visits for ACS (p<0.001) 
and asthma (p=0.006) were significantly lower during the two years after pwSCD's 
initial SCD-pulmonary clinic evaluation compared to the two years prior. Asthma 
and allergic rhinitis were more frequently diagnosed and prescriptions for 
hydroxyurea (p=0.005) and inhaled corticosteroids (p=0.005) were more common in 
the post SCD-pulmonary clinic period. The median number of prescribed systemic 
corticosteroids was lower in the two years following SCD-pulmonary clinic 
evaluation (p<0.0001). Lactate dehydrogenase and white blood cell counts also 
significantly decreased. Implementing a multidisciplinary SCD-pulmonary clinic 
is feasible and may allow improved management of pulmonary problems and lead to 
improvements in health and acute care utilization."
686,"OBJECTIVE: The T1GER (A Study of SIMPONI to Arrest β-cell Loss in Type 1 
Diabetes) study showed many metabolic benefits of the tumor necrosis factor-α 
blocker golimumab in children and young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). 
Off-therapy effects are reported.
RESEARCH DESIGNS AND METHODS: T1GER was a phase 2, placebo-controlled, 
randomized trial in which golimumab or placebo was administered for 52 weeks to 
participants 6-21 years old diagnosed with T1D within 100 days of randomization. 
Assessments occurred during the 52-week on-therapy and 52-week off-therapy 
periods.
RESULTS: After treatment was stopped, C-peptide area under the curve (AUCs) 
remained greater in the treatment versus control group. At weeks 78 and 104, the 
golimumab group had lower reductions in the 4-h C-peptide AUC baseline than the 
placebo group, where specifically the golimumab group had reductions of 0.31 and 
0.41 nmol/L, and the placebo group had reductions of 0.64 and 0.74 nmol/L. There 
were also trends in less insulin use, higher peak C-peptide levels and those in 
partial remission, and higher peak C-peptide levels in the golimumab group. 
Golimumab responders, defined as having an increase or minimal loss of C-peptide 
AUC and/or being in partial remission at week 52, showed even greater 
improvements in most metabolic parameters on and off therapy and had less 
hypoglycemia during the off-therapy period versus placebo. Adverse events, 
including infections, were similar between the groups during all time periods of 
the study.
CONCLUSIONS: In children and young adults with new-onset T1D, golimumab 
preserved endogenous β-cell function and resulted in other favorable metabolic 
parameters on and off therapy. A subpopulation had disease stabilization while 
on therapy, with improved metabolic parameters off therapy."
687,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells found in a variety of 
tissues in the body, including but not limited to bone marrow, adipose tissue, 
umbilical cord, and umbilical cord blood. Given their immunomodulatory effect

potential to be used as a therapeutic agent in a variety of immune-mediated 
disorders. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a persistent and relapsing immune skin 
condition that has recently become more common in several species such as 
humans, canines, equines, and felines. The use of MSCs to treat AD has piqued 
the great interest of researchers in recent years. In this article, we review 
the recent understanding of AD pathology and advances in preclinical and

688,"Giardia duodenum (G. duodenalis) can cause giardiasis and infect a variety of 
hosts. So far, there have been no detailed data regarding the positive rate of 
G. duodenalis in cattle in China. Here, a systematic literature review was 
carried out to investigate the epidemiology of bovine G. duodenalis in China. To 
perform the meta-analysis, the databases China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure, VIP Chinese Journal Databases, WanFang Databases, PubMed, and 
ScienceDirect were employed for screening studies related to the prevalence of 
G. duodenalis in cattle in China. The total prevalence of G. duodenalis in 
cattle was estimated to be 8.00% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.51-11.62). In 
the age subgroup, the prevalence of G. duodenalis in calves (11.72%; 95% CI: 
7.75-17.73) was significantly higher than that in cattle of other age groups. An 
analysis based on seasons showed that the prevalence of G. duodenalis in cattle 
was higher in summer (9.69%; 95% CI: 2.66-35.30) than that in other seasons. The 
prevalence of G. duodenalis in cattle in 2016 or later was 11.62% (95% CI: 
6.49-20.79), which was significantly higher than that before 2016 (3.65%; 95% 
CI: 2.17-6.12). The highest prevalence of G. duodenalis in cattle was 74.23% 
(95% CI: 69.76-78.45) recorded in South China. The NOAA's National Center for 
Environmental Information (https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/maps/ncei/cdo/monthly) was 
used to extract relevant geoclimatic data (latitude, longitude, elevation, 
temperature, precipitation, humidity, and climate). By analyzing the data of 
each subgroup, it was shown that age of cattle, sampling year, province, region, 
temperature, and climate were potential risk factors for giardiasis prevalence 
in cattle. Based on the analysis of common factors and geographical factors, it 
is recommended to strengthen effective management measures (e.g., ventilation 
and disinfection in warm and humid areas) and formulate relevant policies 
according to local conditions. Breeders should pay more attention to the 
detection of G. duodenalis in calves, to prevent giardiasis prevalence in cattle 
of different ages, thereby reducing the economic losses of animal husbandry in 
China."
689,"The goal for the present study was to investigate whether previous infection 
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may compromise 
embryo morphokinetics and implantation. For that, a historical cohort study was 
performed in a private university-affiliated in vitro fertilization center. The 
study included 1628 embryos from 88 patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection (ICSI) cycles. Patients were age-matched in a 1:3 ratio to either a 
coronavirus disease (COVID) group, including patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 
immunoglobulin test (n = 22 patients, 386 embryos), or a control group, 
including patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin test (n = 66, 1242 
embryos). The effect of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 on morphokinetic 
events and ICSI outcomes was evaluated. Embryos derived from patients in the 
COVID group presented longer time to pronuclei appearance and fading, time to 
form two, three, four and five cells, and time to blastulation. The durations of 
the third cell cycle and to time to complete synchronous divisions were also 
significantly increased in the COVID group compared with the control group, 
whereas known implantation diagnosis score Day 5 ranked significantly lower in 
the COVID group. No differences were observed between the COVID and control 
groups on clinical outcomes. In conclusion, patients planning parenthood, who 
have recovered from COVID-19 infection, must be aware of a possible effect of 
the infection on embryo development potential."
690,"Palliative care teams are often consulted to assist in treating persistent 
dementia-related behavioral issues. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) offers an 
alternative to traditional antipsychotic drugs in the long-term management of 
dementia with behavioral change. We present the case of an 85-year-old man with 
dementia with Lewy bodies with worsening aggression refractory to antipsychotic 
management. Multiple regimens of antipsychotics failed both in the outpatient 
and inpatient settings. After exhausting other options and in the setting of 
worsening agitation, a tincture of THC was prescribed. After starting THC 
tincture, the patient's behavior rapidly improved, and he was discharged home to 
the care of his spouse. The challenges of prescribing and obtaining THC are 
discussed."
691,"Background: Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) represent a significant threat to human 
health in the United States. Based on reported cases of notifiable TBDs to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the state of Alabama is no 
exception, yet previously there has been no active surveillance program in place 
to comprehensively assess the presence and prevalence of tick vectors and their 
associated TBD pathogens in Alabama. Here we summarize initial findings from a 
4-year survey to address this unmet need. Methods: Beginning in 2018 and 
proceeding through 2021, ticks were collected throughout the state of Alabama 
and pooled before being screened for a panel of TBD pathogens known to circulate 
in the United States. Results: Consistent with previously reported cases, TBD 
pathogens associated with anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, and spotted 
fever rickettsiosis were detected in ticks of Alabama. Causative agents for 
tularemia and Lyme disease were not detected despite previously reported human 
disease cases. There was also no evidence of Heartland virus despite recent 
reports of the virus being detected in ticks in Northwestern counties. 
Conclusions: While these results serve to provide some insights into TBD 
pathogens associated with ticks in Alabama, they also raise many questions that 
highlight the need for additional studies and continued surveillance to fully 
understand the TBD threat to human health in Alabama."
692,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with familial early-onset dementia (EOD) pose a unique 
opportunity for gene identification studies.
METHODS: We present the phenotype and whole-exome sequencing (WES) study of an 
autosomal dominant EOD family. Candidate genes were examined in a set of 
dementia cases and controls (n = 3712). Western blotting was conducted of the 
wild-type and mutant protein of the final candidate.
RESULTS: Age at disease onset was 60 years (range 56 to 63). The phenotype 
comprised mixed amnestic and behavioral features, and parkinsonism. 
Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers, and a positron emission tomography 
amyloid study suggested Alzheimer's disease. WES and the segregation pattern 
pointed to a nonsense mutation in the TRIM25 gene (p.C168*), coding for an E3 
ubiquitin ligase, which was absent in the cohorts studied. Protein studies 
supported a loss-of-function mechanism.
DISCUSSION: This study supports a new physiopathological mechanism for brain 
amyloidosis. Furthermore, it extends the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases 
dysfunction in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
HIGHLIGHTS: A TRIM25 nonsense mutation (p.C168*) is associated with autosomal 
dominant early-onset dementia and parkinsonism with biomarkers suggestive of 
Alzheimer's disease. TRIM25 protein studies support that the mutation exerts its 
effect through loss of function. TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is known for 
its role in the innate immune response but this is the first report of 
association with neurodegeneration. The role of TRIM25 dysfunction in 
development of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration merits a new line of research."
693,"Widespread use of contemporary antiretroviral therapy globally has transformed 
HIV disease into a chronic illness associated with excess risk for disorders of 
the heart and circulatory system. Current clinical care and research has focused 
on improving HIV-related cardiovascular disease outcomes, survival, and quality 
of life. In high-income countries, emphasis on prevention of atherosclerotic 
coronary artery disease over the past decade, including aggressive management of 
traditional risk factors and earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy, has 
reduced risk for myocardial infarction among persons living with human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 infection. Still, across the globe, persons living with 
human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection on effective antiretroviral therapy 
treatment remain at increased risk for ischemic outcomes such as myocardial 
infarction and stroke relative to the persons without HIV. Unique features of 
HIV-related cardiovascular disease, in part, include the pathogenesis of 
coronary disease characterized by remodeling ectasia and unusual plaque 
morphology, the relative high proportion of type 2 myocardial infarction events, 
abnormalities of the aorta such as aneurysms and diffuse aortic inflammation, 
and HIV cerebrovasculopathy as a contributor to stroke risk. Literature over the 
past decade has also reflected a shift in the profile and prevalence of 
HIV-associated heart failure, with a reduced but persistent risk of heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction and a growing risk of heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and autopsy data 
have emphasized the central importance of intramyocardial fibrosis for the 
pathogenesis of both heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the 
increase in risk of sudden cardiac death. Still, more research is needed to 
better characterize the underlying mechanisms and clinical phenotype of 
HIV-associated myocardial disease in the current era. Across the different 
cardiovascular disease manifestations, a common pathogenic feature is that 
HIV-associated inflammation working through different mechanisms may amplify 
underlying pathology because of traditional risk and other host factors. The 
prevalence and phenotype of individual cardiovascular disease manifestations is 
ultimately influenced by the degree of injury from HIV disease combined with the 
profile of underlying cardiometabolic factors, both of which may differ 
substantially by region globally."
694,"BACKGROUND: Cytopathologic analysis is feasible and provides detailed 
morphological characterisation of head and neck lesions.
AIMS: To integrate the available data published on fine-needle aspiration 
cytology (FNAC) used for the diagnosis of plasma cell neoplasms (PCN) of the 
head and neck region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Searches on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus 
were performed to compile data from case reports/case series published in 
English. The Joanna Briggs Institute tool was used for the critical appraisal of 
studies.
RESULTS: A total of 82 studies comprising 102 patients were included in this 
review. There was a predilection for men (68.6%) (male/female ratio: 2.1:1). 
Individuals in their 50s (29.4%), 60s (22.5%), and 70s (22.5%) were more often 
affected. The thyroid gland (26.2%) was the main anatomical location, followed 
by scalp (15.5%), neck/cervical region (15.5%), jaws (13.6%), and major salivary 
glands (13.6%). For FNAC analysis, a smear was employed in 41 (40.6%) cases and 
a cell block was used in four (3.9%). In 56 (55.4%) reports, no cytological 
methods were available. Morphologically, 34 (56.7%) cases had a diagnosis of PCN 
with agreement between cytopathology and histopathology. The rate of wrong 
diagnoses when using cytology was 27.5%. Immunophenotyping was performed in 49 
(48%) of the cases. The 69-month disease-free survival rate was 60.2%, while the 
27-month overall survival rate was 64.1%.
CONCLUSION: This study reinforces that FNAC can be an ancillary tool in the 
first step towards the diagnosis of PCN of the head and neck region, especially 
when applying a cell block for cytological analysis."
695,"Current guidelines recommend screening people with HIV (PWH) for bone disease 
using predictive tools developed for the general population, although data on 
PWH are scarce. In this study, we assessed the performance of FRAX and QFracture 
scoring systems to predict the occurrence of fragility fractures in a 
prospective cohort of 17,671 adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
included in the HIV/AIDS research network (CoRIS) in Spain. The survival 
estimates of fragility fractures during follow-up were calculated and FRAX and 
QFracture scores were computed at cohort inclusion. For both tools, 
discriminatory measures and the observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios were assessed. 
During a follow-up time of 42,411.55 person-years, 113 fragility fractures were 
recorded. Areas under the curve were 0.66 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
0.61-0.71] for FRAX and 0.67 (95% CI 0.62-0.73) for QFracture for major 
osteoporotic fractures, and 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.88) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.68-0.95) 
for hip fracture, respectively. The O/E was 1.67 for FRAX and 5.49 for QFracture 
for major osteoporotic fractures, and 11.23 for FRAX and 4.87 for QFracture for 
hip fractures. Moreover, O/E raised as the risk increased for both tools and in 
almost all age groups. When using the recommended assessment thresholds, <6% and 
10% of major osteoporotic and hip fractures would have been identified, 
respectively. In conclusion, FRAX and QFracture displayed acceptable 
discrimination, although both tools significantly underestimated the risk of 
fragility fractures in PWH. The recommended assessment thresholds may not be 
appropriate for this population as they were unable to identify individuals with 
fragility fractures during follow-up."
696,"Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a challenging clinical entity that 
can be frustrating for patient and physician alike. Repeated rounds of 
antibiotics can select for multidrug-resistant organisms, further complicating 
care. We describe the successful use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) 
for the treatment of recurrent extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing 
Klebsiella pneumoniae UTIs in a patient with an ileal conduit and urostomy. In 
the 18 months after FMT, the patient had not experienced new infections with 
ESBL-producing organisms. The urine and stool microbiomes of the patient were 
tracked before and post-FMT using 16s RNA sequencing with measurement of 
α-diversity. Sequencing of the recipient microbiota did not mirror the donor 
stool taxa at either site, but an increase in the relative proportion of the 
genus Bacteroides as compared with Prevotella was noted in the stool 
post-transplant. FMTs may be a promising treatment option for recurrent 
multidrug-resistant infections."
697,"Background: Anaplasma ovis are obligate intracellular bacteria that can endanger 
human and animal health, and they can be transmitted by arthropod vectors, such 
as Melophagus ovinus and ticks. Materials and Methods: In this study, 433 
specimens, including 370 M. ovinus and 63 sheep blood samples, were collected 
from nine districts of South Xinjiang to investigate the distribution and 
molecular epidemiology of A. ovis in M. ovinus and small ruminant. Results: DNA 
of A. ovis was detected in 109 (25.2%, 109/433) of the 433 samples using PCR and 
sequencing. The analysis of A. ovis msp4 sequences revealed four different 
genotypes, including genotype III (47.7%; 52/109), GB3 (34.0%; 37/109), AoGOv3 
(15.6%; 17/109), and XJ9 (2.8%; 3/109). Conclusions: To the best of our 
knowledge, A. ovis genotypes GB3, AoGOv3, and XJ9 detected in this study are the 
first to be reported in M. ovinus, and our data indicate that XJ9 is a novel A. 
ovis genotype presented herein for the first time. These findings provide 
important references for the new understanding and prevention of A. ovis in 
border counties in China."
698,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of 
dopaminergic neurons leading to reduced locomotion. Mutations of parkin gene in 
Drosophila produce the same phenotypes as vertebrate models, but the effect of 
parkin knockdown on dopamine release is not known. Here, we report 
age-dependent, spatial variation of dopamine release in the brain of parkin-RNAi 
adult Drosophila. Dopamine was repetitively stimulated by local application of 
acetylcholine and quantified by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in the central 
complex or mushroom body heel. In the central complex, the main area controlling 
locomotor function, dopamine release is maintained for repeated stimulations in 
aged control flies, but lower concentrations of dopamine are released in the 
central complex of aged parkin-RNAi flies. In the mushroom body heel, the 
dopamine release decrease in older parkin-RNAi flies is similar to controls. 
There is not significant dopaminergic neuronal loss even in older parkin 
knockdown flies, which indicates that the changes in stimulated dopamine release 
are due to alterations of neuronal function. In young parkin-RNAi flies, 
locomotion is inhibited by 30%, while in older parkin-RNAi flies it is inhibited 
by 85%. Overall, stimulated dopamine release is modulated by parkin in an age 
and brain region dependent manner. Correlating the functional state of the 
dopaminergic system with behavioral phenotypes provides unique insights into the 
PD mechanism. Drosophila can be used to study dopamine functionality in PD, 
elucidate how genetics influence dopamine, and test potential therapies to 
maintain dopamine release."
699,"Broadhead Geoffrey K., Henry E. Wiley, David Peprah, Kenneth Olumba, and Alisa 
T. Thavikulwat. Proliferative retinopathy associated with repeated high-altitude 
exposure in a patient with sickle cell trait. High Alt Med Biol. 23:369-371, 
2022.-Sickle cell trait (SCT), a carrier state characterized by one normal copy 
of the beta-globin gene (producing hemoglobin A) and one abnormal variant 
(producing hemoglobin S), is typically asymptomatic and very low risk for 
manifestations of hemoglobinopathy, including development of retinopathy. 
Reported cases of proliferative retinopathy in patients with SCT have occurred 
in the context of concurrent ocular or systemic disease. We report a case of an 
otherwise healthy patient with SCT who developed proliferative retinopathy 
requiring surgical intervention in the setting of significant exposure to high 
altitude through increased work hours as a flight attendant in the month leading 
to her presentation. Significant high-altitude exposure may contribute to 
development of retinopathy in patients with sickle trait. Practitioners should 
consider the possibility of sickle cell retinopathy in patients with sickle 
trait in these circumstances."
700,"Chitinase-like proteins (CLPs) are members of the family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, 
which include chitinases and the enzymatically inactive CLPs. A mutation in the 
enzyme's catalytic site, conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, allowed 
CLPs to evolve independently with functions that do not require chitinase 
activity. CLPs normally function during inflammatory responses, wound healing, 
and host defense, but when they persist at excessive levels at sites of chronic 
inflammation and in tissue-remodeling disorders, they correlate positively with 
disease progression and poor prognosis. Little is known, however, about their 
physiological function. Drosophila melanogaster has six CLPS, termed Imaginal 
disc growth factors (Idgfs), encoded by Idgf1, Idgf2, Idgf3, Idgf4, Idgf5, and 
Idgf6. In this study we developed tools to facilitate characterization of the 
physiological roles of the Idgfs by deleting each of the Idgf genes using the 
CRISPR/Cas9 system and assessing loss-of-function phenotypes. Using null lines, 
we showed that loss-of-function for all six Idgf proteins significantly lowers 
viability and fertility. We also showed that Idgfs play roles in epithelial 
morphogenesis, maintaining proper epithelial architecture and cell shape, 
regulating E-cadherin and cortical Actin, and remarkably, protecting these 
tissues against CO2 exposure. Defining the normal molecular mechanisms of CLPS 
is key to understanding how deviations tip the balance from a physiological to a 
pathological state."
701,"BACKGROUND: The hyperglycemia condition disrupts the metabolism of 
nitrate/nitrite and nitric oxide, and dietary nitrate intake can restore nitric 
oxide homeostasis. This study aims to examine whether urinary nitrate is 
associated with diabetes complications and long-term survival among people with 
hyperglycemia.
METHODS: A total of 6208 people with hyperglycemia who participated in the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2005 to 2014 were 
enrolled. Diabetes complications included congestive heart failure, coronary 
heart disease, angina, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetic retinopathy, and 
nephropathy. Mortality wasobtained from the National Death Index until 2015. 
Urinary nitrate was measured by ion chromatography coupled with electrospray 
tandem mass spectrometry, which was log-transformed and categized into tertiles. 
Logistic regression models and cox proportional hazards models were respectively 
performed to assess the association of urinary nitrate with the risk of diabetes 
complications and disease-specific mortalities.
RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders including urinary 
perchlorate and thiocyanate, compared with the participants in the lowest 
tertile of nitrate, the participants in the highest tertile had lower risks of 
congestive heart failure(odd-ratio[OR] = 0.41, 95%CI:0.27-0.60) and diabetic 
nephropathy(OR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.41-0.62). Meanwhile, during a total follow-up of 
41,463 person-year, the participants in the highest tertile had lower mortality 
risk of all-cause(hazard-ratio[HR] = 0.78, 95%CI:0.62-0.97), cardiovascular 
disease(CVD)(HR = 0.56, 95%CI:0.37-0.84) and diabetes(HR = 0.47, 
95%CI:0.24-0.90), which showed dose-dependent linear relationships(P for 
non-linearity > 0.05). Moreover, no association between nitrate and cancer 
mortality was observed(HR = 1.13, 95%CI:0.71-1.80).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher urinary nitrate is associated with lower risk of congestive 
heart failure and diabetic nephropathy, and lower risk of all-cause, CVD, and 
diabetes mortalities. These findings indicated that inorganic nitrate 
supplementation can be considered as a supplementary treatment for people with 
hyperglycemia."
702,"Encyclometra japonica Yoshida and Ozaki, 1929 is a fluke that parasitizes the 
digestive tract of snakes. When the species was first reported, it was 
originally characterized on the basis of morphologic features, namely, the 
characteristics of the 2 testes located obliquely in the anterior-posterior 
direction, and the position of the ventral sucker one-fourth to one-third from 
the anterior extremity. Thereafter, more specimens with other morphologic 
variations were reported, and a new morphologic feature for species 
discrimination was proposed. However, the proposal is uncertain, and the 
criteria for morphologic discrimination between E. japonica and other 
Encyclometra species remain debatable. Thus, morphologically discriminable 
characteristics on the basis of a sufficient number of specimens are required, 
and molecular methods for species identification that allow for a more objective 
assessment need to be established. Therefore, in the present study, nucleotide 
sequences of 18S, 28S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and cytochrome c oxidase 
subunit I (COI) of E. japonica were determined along with detailed morphologic 
observations for the first time. Key characteristics were observed in all 
specimens, whereas some morphologic variations were observed in the symmetry of 
the cecum. The COI sequences, which are known to be variable genetic regions, 
were identical among all specimens; therefore, all of them were considered the 
same species. This result clarifies the high morphologic variation in E. 
japonica. The 18S and 28S sequences were 99.78% and 99.11-99.19% similar to 
those of Encylometra colubrimurorum. The high degree of homology between these 
genes indicates that E. japonica and E. colubrimurorum are closely related but 
independent species. The present data will be used for the identification of E. 
japonica and to evaluate the relationships within the genus Encyclometra."
703,"Drug absorption is improved by the intranasal route's wide surface area and 
avoidance of first-pass metabolism. For the treatment of central nervous system 
diseases such as migraine, intranasal administration delivers the medication to 
the brain. The study's purpose was to develop an in situ nasal hydrogel that 
contained liposomes that were loaded with sumatriptan succinate (SS). A 
thin-film hydration approach was used to create liposomes, and a 32 factorial 
design was used to optimize them. The optimized liposomes had a spherical shape, 
a 171.31 nm particle size, a high drug encapsulation efficiency of 83.54%, and 
an 8-h drug release of 86.11%. To achieve in situ gel formation, SS-loaded 
liposomes were added to the liquid gelling system of poloxamer-407, 
poloxamer-188, and sodium alginate. The final product was tested for 
mucoadhesive strength, viscosity, drug content, gelation temperature, and 
gelation time. Following intranasal delivery, in vivo pharmacokinetic 
investigations showed a significant therapeutic concentration of the medication 
in the brain with a Cmax value of 167 ± 78 ng/mL and an area under the curve 
value of 502 ± 63 ng/min·mL. For SS-loaded liposomal thermosensitive nasal 
hydrogel, significantly higher values of the nose-to-brain targeting parameters, 
that is, drug targeting index (2.61) and nose-to-brain drug direct transport 
(57.01%), confirmed drug targeting to the brain through the nasal route. 
Liposomes containing thermosensitive in situ hydrogel demonstrated potential for 
intranasal administration of SS."
704,"Background: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causes a highly 
contagious tick-borne disease with high case-fatality rates in humans. It is 
circulating not only in many Asian and African countries, but also spreading to 
and within Europe. To cope better with future outbreaks of Crimean-Congo 
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), the WHO has prioritized the need for the development 
and validation of CCHF diagnostics, including serological assays. In this study, 
we evaluated the performance of the new EUROIMMUN anti-CCHFV IgM and IgG 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Materials and Methods: Both ELISAs 
were compared to the Vector-Best VectoCrimean-CHF-IgM and -IgG ELISAs using the 
EUROIMMUN CCHFV Mosaic 2 IgM and IgG indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) as 
reference. Forty-nine acute-phase serum samples from patients with CCHFV 
infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
and/or anti-CCHFV IgM IFA positivity were used to determine assay sensitivity. 
The assessment of specificity was based on sera from 30 control patients, 30 
healthy blood donors, and 29 patients with hantavirus or sandfly fever virus 
infections. All samples originated from Turkey. Results: Sensitivity of the 
EUROIMMUN ELISAs (IgM 98.0%, IgG 47.1%) exceeded that of the Vector-Best ELISAs 
(IgM 95.9%, IgG 35.3%). Specificity of the EUROIMMUN ELISA IgM (86.4%) was 
slightly higher compared with the Vector-Best ELISA IgM (84.7%), while 
specificity for IgG was 100% for both assays. Qualitative agreement between the 
EUROIMMUN and Vector-Best ELISAs was substantial for detecting anti-CCHFV IgM 
(84.1%, ĸ = 0.673) and IgG (94.9%, ĸ = 0.791), whereas the quantitative results 
indicated a very strong positive correlation (IgM: r = 0.868, IgG: r = 0.913). 
Conclusion: The new EUROIMMUN anti-CCHFV ELISAs are standardized and easy-to-use 
tools that reliably support the identification of acute CCHF cases, and thus 
suitable for laboratories involved in on-site outbreak support."
705,"Introduction: The internet is emerging as a source of information for patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, it is not always reliable and 
may cause anxiety. We aim to assess patients' information habits and patients' 
and professionals' perceptions of a national website integrated as an 
educational resource for the IBD unit. Methods: Patients aged 18-65 years, 
comfortable with the internet, and attending follow-ups at participating IBD 
units (March-June 2019) and their professionals were invited to evaluate a 
recommended website through an online survey. Results: Three hundred eighty-nine 
patients and 95 professionals completed the survey. The internet (n = 109; 
27.4%) was the second preferred source of information after the health care team 
(n = 229; 57.5%). Eighty percent of patients searched the internet for 
information on their disease and 28.6% did so at least once a week (n = 114), 
especially newly diagnosed ones (<2 years). Patients valued a website 
recommended by their professional (n = 379; 95.2%) and endorsed by the National 
Working Group (n = 377; 94.7%). They would attend online educational initiatives 
on the website (n = 279; 70.1%) and complete periodical surveys to improve its 
usefulness (n = 338; 84.9%). According to IBD professionals, this type of 
website is the best patient source of supplementary information (n = 76; 80%) 
and they ""prescribe"" it to most patients (67.0 ± 25.2%), especially the newly 
diagnosed patients (52.7 ± 26.5%). It effectively integrates routine 
face-to-face education (n = 95; 100%). Conclusions: Patients of IBD units, 
especially newly diagnosed ones, appreciate a trusted e-Health resource to back 
up professional information. The favorable opinion of patients and professionals 
will allow its use in training interventions."
706,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated racial disparities in breast 
cancer treatment and secondary lymphedema. However, no studies have yet examined 
the effects of race and socioeconomic status on physiological surgical treatment 
for lymphedema. The authors aimed to evaluate whether disparities exist within 
patients seeking physiological surgical lymphedema treatment.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients presenting for 
physiological surgical treatment of lymphedema from 2013 to 2019. Data on 
demographics, medical history, socioeconomic factors, lymphedema, and treatments 
were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 789 patients (712 women and 77 men) seeking physiological 
surgical treatment of lymphedema were selected. Their mean age was 54.4 ± 13.4 
years. A total of 620 patients (78.5%) self-reported as White, 120 (15.2%) as 
Black, 17 (2.2%) as Asian, five (0.6%) as Hispanic, and eight (2.4%) as 
multiracial. A total of 566 patients (71.7%) met criteria for surgical 
candidacy. White race was associated with increased rates of surgical candidacy 
compared with Black race (46.6% versus 77.2%; P < 0.0001). Compared with White 
patients, Black patients presented with a longer symptom duration (11.07 versus 
6.99 years; P < 0.001), had a higher body mass index (mean, 34.5 versus 28.1; P 
< 1 × 10 -10 ), had a higher International Society of Lymphology stage ( P < 
0.05), and were less likely to have maximized medical treatment for lymphedema 
(30.8% versus 55.4%; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates racial disparities in patients seeking 
physiological surgical treatment for lymphedema. Black patients present later 
with more severe disease, receive less nonsurgical treatment before 
consultation, and are less likely to meet criteria for physiological surgery. 
Improved patient and provider education on lymphedema and appropriate diagnosis 
and nonsurgical treatment is of primary importance to address this disparity."
707,"IMPORTANCE: Treatment at high-volume centers (HVCs) has been associated with 
improved overall survival (OS) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC); however, it is unclear how patterns of referral affect these findings.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the relative contributions of treatment site and 
selection bias in driving differences in outcomes in patients with PDAC and to 
characterize socioeconomic factors associated with referral to HVCs.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: A population-based retrospective review of the 
Oregon State Cancer Registry was performed from 1997 to 2019 with a median 4.3 
months of follow-up. Study participants were all patients diagnosed with PDAC in 
Oregon from 1997 to 2018 (n = 8026).
EXPOSURES: The primary exposures studied were diagnosis and treatment at HVCs 
(20 or more pancreatectomies for PDAC per year), low-volume centers ([LVCs] less 
than 20 per year), or both.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: OS and treatment patterns (eg, receipt of 
chemotherapy and primary site surgery) were evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis 
and logistic regression, respectively.
RESULTS: Eight thousand twenty-six patients (male, 4142 [52%]; mean age, 71 
years) were identified (n = 3419 locoregional, n = 4607 metastatic). Patients 
receiving first-course treatment at a combination of HVCs and LVCs demonstrated 
improved median OS for locoregional and metastatic disease (16.6 [95% CI, 
15.3-17.9] and 6.1 [95% CI, 4.9-7.3] months, respectively) vs patients receiving 
HVC only (11.5 [95% CI, 10.7-12.3] and 3.9 [95% CI, 3.5-4.3] months, 
respectively) or LVC-only treatment (8.2 [95% CI, 7.7-8.7] and 2.1 [95% CI, 
1.9-2.3] months, respectively; all P < .001). No differences existed in disease 
burden by volume status of diagnosing institution. When stratifying by site of 
diagnosis, HVC-associated improvements in median OS were smaller (locoregional: 
10.4 [95% CI, 9.5-11.2] vs 9.9 [95% CI, 9.4-10.4] months; P = .03; metastatic: 
3.6 vs 2.7 months, P < .001) than when stratifying by the volume status of 
treating centers, indicating selection bias during referral. A total of 94% 
(n = 1103) of patients diagnosed at an HVC received HVC treatment vs 18% 
(n = 985) of LVC diagnoses. Among patients diagnosed at LVCs, later year of 
diagnosis and higher estimated income were independently associated with higher 
odds of subsequent HVC treatment, while older age, metastatic disease, and 
farther distance from HVC were independently associated with lower odds.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: LVC-to-HVC referrals for PDAC experienced improved OS 
vs HVC- or LVC-only care. While disease-related features prompting referral may 
partially account for this finding, socioeconomic and geographic disparities in 
referral worsen OS for disadvantaged patients. Measures to improve access to 
HVCs are encouraged."

709,"IMPORTANCE: Extant data on the performance of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
score models in people living with HIV have not been synthesized.
OBJECTIVE: To synthesize available data on the performance of the various CVD 
risk scores in people living with HIV.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase were searched from inception through January 31, 
2021.
STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies (1) were chosen based on cohort design, (2) 
included adults with a diagnosis of HIV, (3) assessed CVD outcomes, and (4) had 
available data on a minimum of 1 CVD risk score.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Relevant data related to study characteristics, 
CVD outcome, and risk prediction models were extracted in duplicate. Measures of 
calibration and discrimination are presented in tables and qualitatively 
summarized. Additionally, where possible, estimates of discrimination and 
calibration measures were combined and stratified by type of risk model.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Measures of calibration and discrimination.
RESULTS: Nine unique observational studies involving 75 304 people (weighted 
average age, 42 years; 59 490 male individuals [79%]) living with HIV were 
included. In the studies reporting these data, 86% were receiving antiretroviral 
therapy and had a weighted average CD4+ count of 449 cells/μL. Included in the 
study were current smokers (50%), patients with diabetes (5%), and patients with 
hypertension (25%). Ten risk prediction scores (6 in the general population and 
4 in the HIV-specific population) were analyzed. Most risk scores had a moderate 
performance in discrimination (C statistic: 0.7-0.8), without a significant 
difference in performance between the risk scores of the general and 
HIV-specific populations. One of the HIV-specific risk models (Data Collection 
on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs Cohort 2016) and 2 of the general 
population risk models (Framingham Risk Score [FRS] and Pooled Cohort Equation 
[PCE] 10 year) had the highest performance in discrimination. In general, models 
tended to underpredict CVD risk, except for FRS and PCE 10-year scores, which 
were better calibrated. There was substantial heterogeneity across the studies, 
with only a few studies contributing data for each risk score.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis 
suggest that general population and HIV-specific CVD risk models had comparable, 
moderate discrimination ability in people living with HIV, with a general 
tendency to underpredict risk. These results reinforce the current 
recommendations provided by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association guidelines to consider HIV as a risk-enhancing factor when 
estimating CVD risk."
710,"IMPORTANCE: The clinical utility of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for coronary 
artery disease (CAD) has not yet been established.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of a CAD PRS to potentially guide statin 
initiation in primary prevention after accounting for age and clinical risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a longitudinal cohort study with 
enrollment starting on January 1, 2006, and ending on December 31, 2010, with 
data updated to mid-2021, using data from the UK Biobank, a long-term population 
study of UK citizens. A replication analysis was performed in Biobank Japan. The 
analysis included all patients without a history of CAD and who were not taking 
lipid-lowering therapy. Data were analyzed from January 1 to June 30, 2022.
EXPOSURES: Polygenic risk for CAD was defined as low (bottom 20%), intermediate, 
and high (top 20%) using a CAD PRS including 241 genome-wide significant 
single-nucleotide variations (SNVs). The pooled cohort equations were used to 
estimate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and 
classify individuals as low (<5%), borderline (5-<7.5%), intermediate 
(7.5-<20%), or high risk (≥20%).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Myocardial infarction (MI) and ASCVD events (defined 
as incident clinical CAD [including MI], stroke, or CV death).
RESULTS: A total of 330 201 patients (median [IQR] age, 57 [40-74] years; 
189 107 female individuals [57%]) were included from the UK Biobank. Over the 
10-year follow-up, 4454 individuals had an MI. The CAD PRS was significantly 
associated with the risk of MI in all age groups but had significantly stronger 
risk prediction at younger ages (age <50 years: hazard ratio [HR] per 1 SD of 
PRS, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.56-1.89; age 50-60 years: HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.38-1.53; age 
>60 years: HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.37-1.48; P for interaction <.001). In patients 
younger than 50 years, those with high PRS had a 3- to 4-fold increased 
associated risk of MI compared with those in the low PRS category. A significant 
interaction between CAD PRS and age was replicated in Biobank Japan. When CAD 
PRS testing was added to the clinical ASCVD risk score in individuals younger 
than 50 years, 591 of 4373 patients (20%) with borderline risk were risk 
stratified into intermediate risk, warranting initiation of statin therapy and 
3198 of 7477 patients (20%) with both borderline or intermediate risk were 
stratified as low risk, thus not warranting therapy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this cohort study suggest that the 
predictive ability of a CAD PRS was greater in younger individuals and can be 
used to better identify patients with borderline and intermediate clinical risk 
who should initiate statin therapy."
711,"Bacteria rely on protein systems for regulation in response to external 
environmental signals. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging and tracking has 
elucidated the complex mechanism of these protein systems in a variety of 
bacteria. We recently investigated Vibrio cholerae, the Gram-negative bacterium 
responsible for the human cholera disease, and its regulation of the production 
of toxins and virulence factors through the membrane-localized transcription 
factors TcpP and ToxR. These experiments determined that TcpP and ToxR work 
cooperatively under steady-state conditions, but measurements of how these 
dynamical interactions change over the course of environmental perturbations 
were precluded by the traditional preparation of bacterial cells confined on 
agarose pads. Here, we address this gap in technology and access single-molecule 
dynamics during real-time changes by implementing two alternative sample 
preparations: microfluidic devices and chitosan-coated coverslips. We report the 
first demonstration of single-molecule tracking within live bacterial cells in a 
microfluidic device. Additionally, using the chitosan-coated coverslips, we show 
that real-time environmental changes impact TcpP-PAmCherry dynamics, activating 
a virulence condition in the bacteria about 45 min after dropping to pH 6 and 
about 20 min after inducing ToxR expression. These new technology advances open 
our ability for new experiments studying a variety of bacteria with 
single-molecule imaging and tracking during real-time environmental 
perturbations."
712,"BACKGROUND: Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 aims to reform health care across the 
Kingdom, with health technology assessment being adopted as one tool promising 
to improve the efficiency with which resources are used. An understanding of the 
opportunity costs of reimbursement decisions is key to fulfilling this promise 
and can be used to inform a cost-effectiveness threshold. This paper is the 
first to provide a range of estimates of this using existing evidence 
extrapolated to the context of Saudi Arabia.Methods and Materials: We use four 
approaches to estimate the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the 
healthcare system; drawing from existing evidence provided by a cross-country 
analysis, two alternative estimates from the UK context, and based on 
extrapolating a UK estimate using evidence on the income elasticity of the value 
of health. Consequences of estimation error are explored.
RESULTS: Based on the four approaches, we find a range of SAR 42,046 per QALY 
gained (48% of GDP per capita) to SAR 215,120 per QALY gained (246% of GDP per 
capita). Calculated potential central estimates from the average of estimated 
health gains based on each source gives a range of SAR 50,000 to 75,000. The 
results are in line with estimates from the emerging literature from across the 
world.
CONCLUSION: A cost-effectiveness threshold reflecting health opportunity costs 
can aid decision-making. Applying a cost-effectiveness threshold based on the 
range SAR 50,000 to 75,000 per QALY gained would ensure that resource allocation 
decisions in healthcare can in be informed in a way that accounts for health 
opportunity costs.
LIMITATIONS: A limitation is that it is not based on a within-country study for 
Saudi Arabia, which represents a promising line of future work."
713,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to quantitatively characterize the passive kinematics 
of the healthy, soft tissue-intact equine stifle to establish an objective 
foundation for providing insights into the etiology of stifle disorders and 
developing a possible surgical treatment for stifle degenerative disease.
ANIMALS: 5 whole-horse specimens.
PROCEDURES: Reflective markers with intracortical bone pins and a motion capture 
system were used to investigate the stifle joint kinematics. Kinematics of 5 
whole-horse specimens euthanized within 2 hours were calculated for 
internal/external rotation, adduction/abduction, and cranial/caudal translation 
of the medial and lateral femoral condyles and estimated joint contact centroids 
as functions of joint extension angle.
RESULTS: From 41.7° to 121.6° (mean ± SD, range of motion: 107.5° ± 7.2°) of 
joint extension, 13° ± 3.7° of tibial external rotation and 6° ± 2.7° of 
adduction were observed. The lateral femoral condyle demonstrated significantly 
greater cranial translation than the medial during extension (23.7 mm ± 9.3 mm 
vs. 14.3 mm ± 7.0 mm, P = .01). No significant difference was found between the 
cranial/caudal translation of estimated joint contact centroids in the medial 
and lateral compartment (13.3 mm ± 7.7 mm vs. 16.4 mm ± 5.8 mm, P = .16).
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings share similarities with kinematics for human 
knees and sheep and dog stifles, suggesting it may be possible to translate what 
has been learned in human arthroplasty to treatment for equine stifles."
714,"Background: Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is a common peripheral 
neuropathy subtype. We aimed to determine the association between breastfeeding 
and DSP among postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years, and the effect modification 
of obesity on this association. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted 
using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. 
Postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years were included. Women with diabetes, 
stroke, cancer, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease, liver disease, 
weak/failing kidneys, or amputation were excluded. Binary logistic regression 
was used to analyze the association between breastfeeding and DSP. Results: 
Among 798 participants, 386 (44.30%) reported breastfeeding history and 51 
(5.29%) were defined as having DSP using the monofilament test. A significant 
inverse association was observed between breastfeeding and DSP (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11-0.79; p = 0.017) after adjusting 
for other confounding variables. In subgroup analysis, this adjusted association 
was observed only in the obese group (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.06-0.73, p = 0.013). 
Conclusions: Breastfeeding was found to have potential benefits in the presence 
of DSP in postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years, and obesity modified the 
association between breastfeeding and DSP. Promoting breastfeeding may reduce 
the burden of peripheral neuropathy in middle-aged postmenopausal women."
715,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Post radiation mucosal ulcers (PRMU) after treatment for 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) can have a huge negative impact on 
patients' quality of life, but little is known concerning risk factors and the 
impact of fraction size. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the 
pattern of PRMU development and to identify risk factors after a 
hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy boost (SBRT) compared to 
conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for OPSCC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study (N = 332) of 
OPSCC patients with ≥ 1-year disease-free survival, treated with 46 Gy Intensity 
Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) (2 Gy fractions) followed by either an SBRT boost 
of 16.5 Gy (5.5 Gy fractions) (N = 180), or 24 Gy IMRT (2 Gy fractions) 
(N = 152). PRMU (grade ≥ 2) was scored when observed > three months after the 
last radiotherapy (RT) fraction (CTCAE v5.0). Potential risk factors were 
analyzed with Cox regression models using death as competing risk. Dose at the 
PRMU site was calculated by projecting delineated PRMU on the planning CT.
RESULTS: All cases of PRMU (N = 64) occurred within 24 months; all were grade 2. 
The cumulative incidence at 2 years in the SBRT boost group was 26% (N = 46) vs. 
12% (N = 18) for conventional fractionation (p = 0.003). Most PRMU developed 
within nine months (N = 48). PRMU occurring > nine months (N = 16) were mainly 
observed in the SBRT boost group (N = 15). Sex (p = 0.048), acute tube feeding 
(p = < 0.001), tumor subsite tonsil (p = 0.001), and N stage (p = 0.017) were 
associated with PRMU risk at multivariable regression in the hypofractionated 
SBRT boost group. All 25 delineated PRMU were located within the high dose 
regions.
CONCLUSION: The risk of PRMU should be included in the cost benefit analysis 
when considering future research using a hypofractionated SBRT boost for OPSCC 
patients."
716,"PURPOSE: Standardized end-of-clerkship examinations typically occur on the last 
day of the clerkship. However, recent trends toward time-varying 
competency-based medical education have offered students more test scheduling 
flexibility, creating an opportunity to study the impact of student-selected 
examination timing.
METHOD: Starting with the graduating class of 2018, students took the required 
standardized end-of-core clerkship examinations at any available time they chose 
during their clinical years. Before this change, these examinations were 
administered to all students on the last day of the clerkship. Students' 
examination dates relative to clerkship completion were analyzed between 2017 
and 2020 (inclusive of before and after flexible exam timing) to assess the 
impact that student-selected exam timing had on test performance on National 
Board of Medical Examiners shelf clinical science examinations for required core 
clerkships.
RESULTS: Data on 146 medical students in 2017 (fixed exam timing) and 466 
medical students between 2018 and 2020 (flexible exam timing) were included. 
Among students offered flexible exam timing, between 2.7% (internal medicine) 
and 14.6% (psychiatry) took their exam before actually taking clerkship, while 
between 22.7% (psychiatry) and 40.0% (surgery) took their exam more than 90 days 
after the clerkship ended. Exam scores were statistically higher for those who 
took the exam at a time of their choosing compared with those who were required 
to take it at the end of individual rotations and when the exam scores were 
combined (fixed exam timing mean = 73.9, standard deviation [SD] = 7.8; flexible 
exam timing mean = 77.4, SD = 6.0, P < .001). The percent of students with 
passing scores was statistically higher in internal medicine, pediatrics, and 
psychiatry.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-selection of shelf exam timing appears to increase shelf exam 
scores. As more medical schools transition to competency-based medical 
education, providing scheduling flexibility appears not to negatively affect 
student achievement."
717,"Plain Language Summary: This case report describes a patient in her 30s who was 
born with ichthyosis who presented with plate-like scale that covered her whole 
body as well as ectropion."
718,"IMPORTANCE: Rituximab and other B-cell-depleting therapies blunt humoral 
responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, particularly when the vaccine is administered 
within 6 months of an infusion. Whether this translates into an increased risk 
of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether rituximab treatment is associated with an 
increased risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 among SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated 
persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether delaying vaccination more than 
6 months after rituximab treatment is associated with decreased risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used Kaiser 
Permanente Southern California's electronic health record to identify 
individuals from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2022, who had MS and who had 
been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.
EXPOSURES: Rituximab treatment compared with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) 
that do not interfere with vaccine efficacy or being untreated (no or other DMT 
group). Among rituximab-treated patients, the exposure was receiving at least 1 
vaccine dose more than 6 months after their last infusion compared with 
receiving all vaccine doses 6 months or less since their last infusion.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was hospitalization due to COVID-19 
infection. The odds of infection resulting in hospitalization following 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were adjusted for race and ethnicity, advanced MS-related 
disability; vaccine type; booster dose; and, among rituximab-treated only 
analyses, cumulative rituximab dose and dose at last infusion. Exposures, 
outcomes, and covariates were collected from the electronic health record.
RESULTS: Among 3974 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated people with MS (mean [SD] age, 55.3 
[15] years; 2982 [75.0%] female; 103 [2.6%] Asian or Pacific Islander; 634 
[16.0%] Black; 953 [24.0%] Hispanic; 2269 [57.1%] White; and 15 [0.3%] other 
race or ethnicity), rituximab-treated patients (n = 1516) were more likely to be 
hospitalized (n = 27) but not die (n = 0) compared with the 2458 individuals 
with MS receiving no or other DMTs (n = 7 and n = 0, respectively; adjusted odds 
ratio [aOR] for hospitalization, 7.33; 95% CI, 3.05-17.63). Receiving messenger 
RNA (mRNA) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.90; P = .03) and 
receiving a booster vaccination (aOR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.64; P = .002) were 
independently associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. 
Among vaccinated rituximab-treated individuals with MS, receiving any 
vaccination dose more than 6 months after the last rituximab infusion was 
associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (aOR, 0.22; 95% CI, 
0.10-0.49).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study's findings suggest that 
rituximab-treated people with MS should be strongly encouraged to receive mRNA 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and boosters more than 6 months after their last rituximab 
infusion whenever possible. The low absolute risk of hospitalization for 
COVID-19 among mRNA-vaccinated individuals with MS should not preclude use of 
rituximab, which has marked efficacy, cost, and convenience advantages over 
other DMTs."
719,"IMPORTANCE: Minoritized groups are less likely to receive COVID-19 therapeutics, 
but few studies have identified potential methods to reduce disparities.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether screening plus outreach, when compared with 
referral alone, increases identification of vulnerable pediatric patients at 
high risk for severe disease eligible for COVID-19 therapeutics from 
low-resourced communities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 
medication allocation between January 1, 2022, and February 15, 2022, at Lurie 
Children's Hospital, a quaternary care children's hospital, in Chicago, 
Illinois. The cohorts were pediatric patients referred for COVID-19 therapeutics 
or with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction within the hospital 
system followed by outreach. Screening involved daily review of positive cases 
of SARS-CoV-2, followed by medical record review for high-risk conditions, and 
communication with clinicians and/or patients and families to offer therapy.
EXPOSURES: Diagnosis of COVID-19.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary measure was difference in child 
opportunity index (COI) scores between the 2 cohorts. Secondary measures 
included presence and duration of symptoms at diagnosis, medication uptake, race 
and ethnicity, insurance type, qualifying medical condition, sex, primary 
language, and age.
RESULTS: Of 145 total patients, the median (IQR) age was 15 (13-17) years, and 
most were male (87 participants [60.0%]), enrolled in public insurance (83 
participants [57.2%]), and members of minoritized racial and ethnic groups (103 
participants [71.0%]). The most common qualifying conditions were asthma and/or 
obesity (71 participants [49.0%]). From 9869 SARS-CoV-2 tests performed, 94 
eligible patients were identified via screening for COVID-19 therapeutics. 
Fifty-one patients were identified via referral. Thirty-two patients received 
medication, of whom 8 (25%) were identified by screening plus outreach alone. 
Compared with referred patients, patients in the screening plus outreach group 
were more likely to have moderate, low, or very low COI composite scores (70 
patients [74.5%] vs 27 patients [52.9%]); public insurance (65 patients [69.1%] 
vs 18 patients [35.3%]); and asthma or obesity (60 patients [63.8%] vs 11 
patients [21.6%]). Patients in the referral group were more likely to be 
non-Hispanic White (23 patients [45.1%] vs 19 patients [20.2%]) and receive 
medication (24 patients [47.1%] vs 8 patients [8.5%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with referral patients, screening plus 
outreach patients for COVID-19 medications were more socially vulnerable, with 
lower COI scores, and more likely to have asthma or obesity. Future studies 
should investigate communication strategies to improve uptake of these 
medications after outreach."
720,"IMPORTANCE: Lung cancer screening with chest computed tomography (CT) prevents 
lung cancer death; however, fewer than 5% of eligible Americans are screened. 
CXR-LC, an open-source deep learning tool that estimates lung cancer risk from 
existing chest radiograph images and commonly available electronic medical 
record (EMR) data, may enable automated identification of high-risk patients as 
a step toward improving lung cancer screening participation.
OBJECTIVE: To validate CXR-LC using EMR data to identify individuals at 
high-risk for lung cancer to complement 2022 US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS) lung cancer screening eligibility guidelines.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study compared CXR-LC 
estimates with CMS screening guidelines using patient data from a large US 
hospital system. Included participants were persons who currently or formerly 
smoked cigarettes with an outpatient posterior-anterior chest radiograph between 
January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014, with no history of lung cancer or 
screening CT. Data analysis was performed between May 2021 and June 2022.
EXPOSURES: CXR-LC lung cancer screening eligibility (previously defined as 
having a 3.297% or greater 12-year risk) based on inputs (chest radiograph 
image, age, sex, and whether currently smoking) extracted from the EMR.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 6-year incident lung cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 14 737 persons were included in the study population (mean 
[SD] age, 62.6 [6.8] years; 7154 [48.5%] male; 204 [1.4%] Asian, 1051 [7.3%] 
Black, 432 [2.9%] Hispanic, 12 330 [85.2%] White) with a 2.4% rate of incident 
lung cancer over 6 years (361 patients with cancer). CMS eligibility could be 
determined in 6277 patients (42.6%) using smoking pack-year and quit-date from 
the EMR. Patients eligible by both CXR-LC and 2022 CMS criteria had a high rate 
of lung cancer (83 of 974 patients [8.5%]), higher than those eligible by 2022 
CMS criteria alone (5 of 177 patients [2.8%]; P < .001). Patients eligible by 
CXR-LC but not 2022 CMS criteria also had a high 6-year incidence of lung cancer 
(121 of 3703 [3.3%]). In the 8460 cases (57.4%) where CMS eligibility was 
unknown, CXR-LC eligible patients had a 5-fold higher rate of lung cancer than 
ineligible (127 of 5177 [2.5%] vs 18 of 2283 [0.5%]; P < .001). Similar results 
were found in subgroups, including female patients and Black persons.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using routine chest radiographs and other data 
automatically extracted from the EMR, CXR-LC identified high-risk individuals 
who may benefit from lung cancer screening CT."
721,"IMPORTANCE: Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is usually curable; 
however, a subset of patients develops poor outcomes, including local 
recurrence, nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, and disease-specific death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate all evidence-based reports of patient risk factors and 
tumor characteristics associated with poor outcomes in primary cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma and to identify treatment modalities that minimize poor 
outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS databases were searched for studies of 
the topic in humans, published in the English language, from database inception 
through February 8, 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Two authors independently screened the identified articles and 
included those that were original research with a sample size of 10 patients or 
more and that assessed risk factors and/or treatment modalities associated with 
poor outcomes among patients with primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction was performed by a single author, 
per international guidelines. The search terms, study objectives, and protocol 
methods were defined before study initiation. A total of 310 studies were 
included for full-text assessment. Owing to heterogeneity of the included 
studies, a random-effects model was used. Data analyses were performed from May 
25 to September 15, 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For studies of risk factors, risk ratios and 
incidence proportions; and for treatment studies, incidence proportions.
RESULTS: In all, 129 studies and a total of 137 449 patients with primary 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and 126 553 tumors were included in the 
meta-analysis. Several patient risk factors and tumor characteristics were 
associated with local recurrence, nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, 
disease-specific death, and all-cause death were identified. Among all factors 
reported by more than 1 study, the highest risks for local recurrence and 
disease-specific death were associated with tumor invasion beyond subcutaneous 
fat (risk ratio, 9.1 [95% CI, 2.8-29.2] and 10.4 [95% CI, 3.0- 36.3], 
respectively), and the highest risk of any metastasis was associated with 
perineural invasion (risk ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.3-11.1). Patients who received 
Mohs micrographic surgery had the lowest incidence of nearly all poor outcomes; 
however, in some results, the 95% CIs overlapped with those of other treatment 
modalities.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis identified the prognostic value of 
several risk factors and the effectiveness of the available treatment 
modalities. These findings carry important implications for the prognostication, 
workup, treatment, and follow-up of patients with primary cutaneous squamous 
cell carcinoma.

723,"BACKGROUND: Transcription factor LEF1 is a downstream mediator of the 
Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. It is expressed in dermal papilla and 
surrounding cells in the hair follicle, promoting cell proliferation and 
differentiation.
RESULTS: Here we report that LEF1 is also expressed all through the hair cycle 
in the terminal Schwann cells (TSCs), a component of the lanceolate complex 
located at the isthmus. The timing of LEF1 appearance at the isthmus coincides 
with that of hair follicle innervation. LEF1 is not found at the isthmus in the 
aberrant hair follicles in nude mice. Instead, LEF1 in TSCs is found in the de 
novo hair follicles reconstituted on nude mice by stem cells chamber graft 
assay. Cutaneous denervation experiment demonstrates that the LEF1 expression in 
TSCs is independent of nerve endings. At last, LEF1 expression in the 
interfollicular epidermis during the early stage of skin development is 
significantly suppressed in transgenic mice with TCF3 overexpression.
CONCLUSION: We reveal the expression dynamics of LEF1 in skin during development 
and hair cycle. LEF1 expression in TSCs indicates that the LEF1/Wnt signal might 
help to establish a niche at the isthmus region for the lanceolate complex, the 
bulge stem cells and other neighboring cells. This article is protected by

724,"Hepatoblastoma is the most common type of hepatic tumors occurring in children 
between 0 and 5 years. And the exact pathophysiology of the disease is still 
mysterious. Accumulating studies on LncRNA have shown its pivotal role in the 
development and progression of distinct human cancers. However, the role of 
LINC01023 in hepatoblastoma is unknown. The relative expression of LINC01023, 
miR-378a-5p, and Wnt3 on hepatoblastoma tissue and cell lines was determined by 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The effect of LINC01023 
downregulation and upregulation on cell proliferation, colony formation and 
apoptosis activities in HUH6 and HepG2 Cells was assessed by CKK8, clonogenic 
and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Dual luciferase, RNA 
immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down were performed to confirm the 
interaction between LINC01023 and miR-378a-5p. Similarly, Dual luciferase assay 
was performed to confirmed the interaction between Wnt3 and miR-378a-5p. The 
xenograft tumorgenicity test was performed to elucidate the tumorgenicity 
potential of LINC01023. LINC01023 was significantly upregulated in 
hepatoblastoma tissue and cell lines rather than in adjacent normal hepatic 
tissue and QSG7701 cell lines. LINC01023 silencing attenuated cell 
proliferation, colony formation and increased cell apoptosis. Conversely, 
LINC01023 upregulation results in significant increase in cell proliferation, 
and colony formation activities however, a significant reduction in apoptosis 
activity was reported. Interaction between the LINC01023 and WNT3 was confirmed 
by dual luciferase assay. Xenograft animal tumorgenicity test confirmed the 
in-vivo tumorigenesis potential of LINC01203. To the best of our knowledge, this 
study is the first study demonstrating the role of LINC01023 in hepatoblastoma 
tumorigenesis through the LINC01023/miR-378a-5p/Wnt3 axis. It could be a 
potential therapeutic target and a prognostic biomarker in hepatoblastoma."
725,"Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency is a rare autosomal 
recessive disorder that leads to the accumulation of poorly soluble 
2,8-dihydroxyadenine (DHA) in the kidneys, resulting in a variety of renal 
presentations including nephrolithiasis, acute kidney injury, and chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) caused by crystal nephropathy. Here, we report a case of a 
43-year-old man with 2,8-DHA crystalline nephropathy caused by APRT deficiency 
strongly suspected by renal biopsy results and definitively diagnosed by a urine 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based plasma metabolomic 
assessment. This case represents the importance of awareness and recognition of 
the signs and symptoms of this rare condition and its progression to CKD, which 
can be prevented by the early administration of xanthine oxidoreductase 
inhibitors."
726,"Fibrillary glomerulonephritis (FGN), a rare disease is pathologically 
characterized by glomerular fibril accumulation ranging from 12 to 24 nm in 
diameter with negative Congo red staining. Recently, the identification of DnaJ 
homolog subfamily B member 9 (DNAJB9) as a highly sensitive and specific marker 
for FGN has revolutionized diagnosis of this disease. However, few recent 
studies have reported DNAJB9-negative glomerulonephritis with fibrillar 
deposits. As such, it remains unclear whether DNAJB9-negative cases can be 
considered equivalent to FGN. Here, we report the case of a 70-year-old woman 
who developed renal impairment and nephrotic-range proteinuria. Renal biopsy and 
pathological examination revealed focal glomerulonephritis with fibrocellular 
crescents. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed IgA-dominant deposition of 
polytypic IgG in the glomerulus. Electron microscopy revealed hump-like 
subepithelial electron dense deposits with fibrils of 15-25 nm in diameter. 
These findings were consistent with FGN; thus, Congo red and direct fast scarlet 
(DFS) staining, and immunohistochemistry for DNAJB9 were performed. In addition 
to negative Congo red/DFS/DNAJB9 staining, laser microdissection (LMD) and 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) resulted negative for 
DNAJB9, which is a highly sensitive and specific marker for FGN. The patient's 
renal function further declined, prompting administration of rituximab weekly 
for 2 weeks, similar to the treatment for FGN. This is a unique case of 
IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis with DNAJB9-negative fibrillar polytypic 
immunoglobulin deposits in the subepithelium, unlike previous DNAJB9-negative 
cases. Thus, DNAJB9-negative cases diagnosed based on accurate electron 
microscopic evaluation must be gathered, and LMD and LC-MS/MS must be used to 
analyze the organized fibrillar deposits to reveal the disease entity."
727,"The crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is one of the most important 
processes involved in the cell program death, and several mechanisms including 
oligodendrocyte apoptosis and autophagy play significant roles in activating 
macrophages, microglial cells, and finally demyelination in neurodegenerative 
disease. The antidepressants and anti-apoptotic mechanisms of fluoxetine (FLX) 
and cannabidiol (CBD) commence an autophagic event that can effectively repair 
myelin. This study aimed to investigate the effect of those reagents on the rate 
of demyelination in the cerebellum, an important site for white matter in a 
mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE was induced 
in twenty four adult female C57Bl/6 mice were inducted the EAE model; FLX 
treatment which was performed (10 mg/kg/IP) and CBD; were treated (5 mg/kg/IP); 
and their cerebellum was used for Western blotting, real-time PCR to autophagic 
markers of LC3II, Beclin-1, and apoptotic markers Bax and Bcl2 evaluation and 
Luxol Fast Blue staining to the assessment of demyelination. The level of 
autophagic markers was expressively elevated (P < 0.01) but the pro-apoptotic 
markers and Bax/Bcl2 ratio were reduced (P < 0.05). Luxol Fast Blue staining 
confirmed the noteworthy diminution of demyelination in treatment groups 
(P < 0.001). This finding clarified that FLX and CBD ameliorate the severity of 
the EAE model. Combinatory treatments of these two agents are suggested for 
future investigations."
728,"Alteration of neuronal protein processing is often associated with neurological 
disorders and is highly dependent on cellular protein trafficking. A prime 
example is the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in 
intracellular vesicles, which plays a key role in age-related cognitive 
impairment. Most approaches to correct this altered processing aim to limit 
enzymatic activities that lead to toxic products, such as protein cleavage by 
β-secretase and the resulting amyloid β production. A viable alternative is to 
direct APP to cellular compartments where non-amyloidogenic mechanisms are 
favored. To this end, we exploited the molecular properties of the herpes 
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) transport protein US9 to guide APP interaction with 
preferred endogenous targets. Specifically, we generated a US9 chimeric 
construct that facilitates APP processing through the non-amyloidogenic pathway 
and tested it in primary cortical neurons. In addition to reducing amyloid β 
production, our approach controls other APP-dependent biochemical steps that 
lead to neuronal deficits, including phosphorylation of APP and tau proteins. 
Notably, it also promotes the release of neuroprotective soluble αAPP. In 
contrast to other neuroprotective strategies, these US9-driven effects rely on 
the activity of endogenous neuronal proteins, which lends itself well to the 
study of fundamental mechanisms of APP processing/trafficking. Overall, this 
work introduces a new method to limit APP misprocessing and its cellular 
consequences without directly targeting secretase activity, offering a novel 
tool to reduce cognitive decline in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and 
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders."
729,"BACKGROUND: Although studies have proven that liver cirrhosis affects cardiac 
hemodynamics by means of circulatory overload, they present with definite 
cardiac functional alteration mostly with end-stage disease. There is limited 
data on relationship between progression of cirrhosis, cardiac mechanics and 
sub-clinical dysfunction. This study was done to assess ventricular myocardial 
mechanics using speckle tracking and deformation imaging among 
Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification A and B cirrhosis.
METHOD: Seventy patients with cirrhosis of Child-Pugh A/B class and sixty-two 
healthy subjects were prospectively evaluated by standard conventional 
echocardiography and deformation imaging with rotational echocardiography. 
Clinical stage of liver cirrhosis was assessed by model for end-stage liver 
disease (MELD) scores and CTP classification.
RESULTS: Mean ages of patients with cirrhosis and controls were 55.64±14 years 
and 52.24±12 years, respectively. Though left ventricular (LV) dimensions (end 
diastolic dimension: 47.27±4.6 mm vs. 45.03±3.8 mm, p = 0.003; end systolic 
dimension: 30.33±4.9 mm vs. 28.40±2.91 mm, p = 0.006) and volumes (end diastolic 
volume: 82.08±22.53 mL vs. 68.18±15.75 mL, p = 0.001; end systolic volume: 
28.60±8.42 mL vs. 22.18±7.48 mL, p = 0.001) were significantly higher in 
patients with cirrhosis, mean ejection fraction (EF) by Simpsons method was 
higher among controls (65.83±5.79% vs. 68.35±5.79%, p = 0.009). Left atrial 
volume was higher in cirrhosis group indicating presence of diastolic 
dysfunction (41.24±14.10 mL vs. 26.08±6.4 mL, p = 0.001). Global longitudinal 
strain as assessed by speckle tracking echocardiography did not show statistical 
significant difference between two groups (-22.35±4.08% vs. -21.80±2.54%, p = 
0.348). Median value of torsion parameters in patients with cirrhosis did not 
differ compared to controls (torsion in degrees: 2.46 vs. 2.79, p = 0.268).
CONCLUSION: Patients with Child-Pugh A and B stages of cirrhosis present with 
preserved longitudinal strain, normal torsion but with subtle diastolic 
dysfunction. Higher MELD score may correlate with increased longitudinal strain 
possibly due to hyperdynamic state."
730,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analyses to examine 
the therapeutic effect of garlic on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases for 
retrieving articles investigating the impact of garlic on NAFLD patients. The 
comprehensive meta-analysis software version 2.0 was used for statistical 
analysis. The standardized mean difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI) 
was reported and the effect size was calculated.
RESULTS: A preliminary search yielded a total of 293 articles. After screening 
articles based on inclusion criteria, four articles were included in the final 
analyses. This systematic review included 186 patients with NAFLD. The result of 
the meta-analysis showed significant differences between the garlic and placebo 
groups regarding changes in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, 
triglyceride, and fasting blood sugar. Moreover, the probability of a decrease 
in hepatic steatosis was 2.75 times lower in the garlic group compared with the 
placebo group (RR [95% CI]: 2.75 [1.79, 4.23], p-value<0.001).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that garlic supplementation had a 
positive effect on hepatic steatosis, liver enzyme levels, and metabolic profile 
of patients with NAFLD. However, considering the potential limitation of the 
included studies, more high-quality clinical trials are needed."
731,"BACKGROUND: High educational attainment may protect individuals, particularly 
middle-aged and older adults, against a wide range of health risks, including 
memory decline with age; however, this protection is less clear in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, this effect may differ across racial 
groups. According to the Marginalized-Related Diminished Return (MDR) theory, 
for example, the protective effect of high educational attainment on mental and 
physical health shows a weaker protective effect for racial minority groups, 
particularly Black people compared to White individuals.
OBJECTIVES: This longitudinal study used data of middle-aged and older adults 
with AD with two aims: first, to test the association between educational 
attainment and memory, and second, to explore racial differences in this 
association in the USA.
METHODS: Data came from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
study. The total sample was 1673 American middle-aged and older adults. The 
independent variable was educational attainment measured as years of education. 
The main outcome was memory operationalized as Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
(RAVLT) Verbal Forgetting percentage (VF%). Age, gender, and follow-up duration 
were covariates. Race was the effect modifier. Linear regression model was 
utilized to analyze the data.
RESULTS: Of all participants, 68 (4.1%) were Black, and the remaining were 
White, with a mean age of 75 years old. In the pooled sample, educational 
attainment did not show a significant association with memory, independent of 
confounders. Educational attainment showed a significant interaction with race 
on memory, with higher educational attainment having a different effect on 
memory in White patients compared to Black patients.
CONCLUSION: The effect of higher educational attainment on memory differs for 
Black patients with AD compared to White patients. To prevent cognitive 
disparities by race, we need to go beyond racial inequality in access to 
resources (e.g., education) and minimize diminished returns of educational 
attainment for racial minorities. To tackle health inequalities, social policies 
should not be limited to equalizing socioeconomic status but also help minority 
groups leverage their available resources, such as educational attainment, and 
secure tangible outcomes."
732,"Ceroid lipofuscinosis type 3 (CLN3) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative 
metabolic disease. Typical clinical symptoms include progressive visual loss, 
epilepsy of unknown etiology and dementia. Presence of lipofuscin deposits with 
typical pattern of 'fingerprints' and vacuolized lymphocytes suggest the 
diagnosis of CLN3. Cause of CLN3 are mutations in the CLN3 gene, among which the 
most frequently found is the large deletion 1.02 kb spreading on exons 7 and 8. 
We present 4 patients from 2 families, in whom the deterioration of visual 
quality and acuity was observed as first clinical sign, when they were a few 
years old and it was successively accompanied by symptoms of neurologic 
deterioration (like generalized convulsions with consciousness impairment). In 
all patients the 1.02 kb deletion in the CLN3 gene was detected in homo- or 
heterozygosity with other CLN3 pathogenic variant. Ultrastructural studies 
revealed abnormal structures corresponding to 'fingerprint' profiles (FPPs) in 
conjunctival endothelial cells. It should be emphasized that in patients with 
blindness of unknown cause the diagnosis of ceroid lipofuscinosis should be 
considered and in older children-especially CLN3. The facility of the analysis 
for the presence of 1.02 kb deletion and economic costs are a solid argument for 
intensive use of this test in the diagnostic procedure of CLN3."
733,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the 
pathological loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, which causes an 
insufficient release of dopamine (DA) and then induces motor and nonmotor 
symptoms. Hyperoside (HYP) is a lignan component with anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. In this study, 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its active neurotoxic 
metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) were used to induce 
dopaminergic neurodegeneration. The results showed that HYP (100 µg/mL) reduced 
MPTP-mediated cytotoxicity of SH-SY5Y cells in vitro, and HYP [25 mg/(kg d)] 
alleviated MPTP-induced motor symptoms in vivo. HYP treatment reduced the 
contents of nitric oxide (NO), H2O2, and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as the 
mitochondrial damage of dopaminergic neurons, both in vitro and in vivo. 
Meanwhile, HYP treatment elevated the levels of neurotrophic factors such as 
glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 
and recombinant cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor in vivo, but not in vitro. 
Finally, Akt signaling was activated after the administration of HYP in 
MPP+/MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, the blockage of the 
Akt pathway with Akt inhibitor did not abolish the neuroprotective effect of HYP 
on DA neurons. These results showed that HYP protected the dopaminergic neurons 
from the MPP+- and MPTP-induced injuries, which did not rely on the Akt pathway."
734,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a devastating disease foisting a significantly high 
morbidity, prepotent in low- and middle-income developing countries. Evolution 
of drug resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent 
of tuberculosis, has made the TB treatment more complicated. The protracted 
nature of present TB treatment, persistent and tolerant Mtb populations, 
interaction with antiretroviral therapy and existing toxicity concerned with 
conventional anti-TB drugs are the four major challenges inflicted with 
emergence of drug-resistant mycobacterial strains, and the standard medications 
are unable to combat these strains. These factors emphasize an exigency to 
develop new drugs to overcome these barriers in current TB therapy. With this 
regard, antimycobacterial peptides derived from various sources such as human 
cells, bacterial sources, mycobacteriophages, fungal, plant and animal sources 
could be considered as antituberculosis leads as most of these peptides are 
associated with dual advantages of having both bactericidal activity towards Mtb 
as well as immuno-regulatory property. Some of the peptides possess the 
additional advantage of interacting synergistically with antituberculosis 
medications too, thereby increasing their efficiency, underscoring the vigour of 
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as best possible alternative therapeutic 
candidates or adjuvants in TB treatment. Albeit the beneficiary features of 
these peptides, few obstacles allied with them like cytotoxicity and proteolytic 
degradation are matter of concerns too. In this review, we have focused on 
structural hallmarks, targeting mechanisms and specific structural aspects 
contributing to antimycobacterial activity and discovered natural and synthetic 
antimycobacterial peptides along with their sources, anti-TB, immuno-regulatory 
properties, merits and demerits and possible delivery methods of AMPs."
735,"Gut microbiota has been identified as a unique endocrine organ linked to the 
development of cardiovascular disease and other illnesses, especially 
deteriorated in overweight and obese postmenopausal women. The object of this 
systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of oral 
supplementation with probiotics for overweight and obese postmenopausal women. 
We performed a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 
inception to April 2022 in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, 
and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also performed a hand search by reviewing reference 
lists to identify trials. The risk of bias in individual studies was assessed 
with the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB). Two reviewers 
independently selected studies and collected data. There were 6 studies from 5 
RCTs with 281 participants in this systematic review. Compared with the placebo, 
the probiotics supplementation group had reductions in insulin (MD - 4.20 IU/L 
(95% CI - 8.11 to - 0.30 IU/L), I2 = 54%), HOMA-IR (MD - 1.25 (95% CI - 2.49 
to - 0.01), I2 = 50%), and TNF-α (MD - 0.12 pg/mL (95% CI - 0.22 
to - 0.01 pg/mL), I2 = 44%). Improvements were also shown in body adiposity and 
lipid profile, but these effects were nonsignificant. In addition to body 
adiposity and cardiovascular risk markers, one trial showed the administration 
of probiotics also had an effect on iron metabolism. In conclusion, probiotics 
have a potential benefit on glucose metabolism and inflammatory process in 
overweight and obese postmenopausal women, but this effect is mild. It 
demonstrates that oral probiotics supplementation can be a complementary 
treatment for improving the fitness of postmenopausal women with overweight and 
obesity."
736,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The prevalence of CVD in women is increasing and is due to 
the increased prevalence of CV risk factors. Traditional CV risk assessment 
tools for prevention have failed to accurately determine CVD risk in women. CAC 
has shown to more precisely determine CV risk and is a better predictor of CV 
outcomes. Coronary CTA provides an opportunity to determine the presence of CAD 
and initiate prevention in women presenting with angina. Identifying women with 
INOCA due to CMD with use of cPET or cMRI with MBFR is vital in managing these 
patients. This review article outlines the role of imaging in preventive 
cardiology for women and will include the latest evidence supporting the use of 
these imaging tests for this purpose.
RECENT FINDINGS: CV mortality is higher in women who have more extensive CAC 
burden. Women have a greater prevalence of INOCA which is associated with higher 
MACE. INOCA is due to CMD in most cases which is associated with traditional CVD 
risk factors. Over half of these women are untreated or undertreated. Recent 
study showed that stratified medical therapy, tailored to the specific INOCA 
endotype, is feasible and improves angina in women. Coronary CTA is useful in 
the setting of women presenting with acute chest pain to identify CAD and 
initiate preventive therapy. CAC confers greater relative risk for CV mortality 
in women versus (vs.) men. cMRI or cPET is useful to assess MBFR to diagnose CMD 
and is another useful imaging tool in women for CV prevention."
737,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of chemotherapy on 
invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) and overall survival (OS) in a nationwide 
cohort of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative/human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, T1abN0 breast cancer.
METHODS: Patients with ER-negative/HER2-negative, T1abN0 breast cancer 
registered in the Danish Breast Cancer Group database between 2007 and 2016 were 
identified. The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on iDFS and OS was analyzed with 
Cox proportional hazards analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 296 patients were included in the statistical analyses. Of 
these, 235 (79.4%) received chemotherapy and 61 patients (20.6%) did not. 
Patients treated with chemotherapy were significantly younger, had a 
significantly higher proportion of grade 3 tumors, T1b tumors, and tumors of 
ductal subtype. With 7.7 years of median follow-up, treatment with chemotherapy 
was associated with a significant improvement in OS in the adjusted analysis, 
Hazard Ratio 0.35 (95% Confidence Interval (0.15-0.81), p = 0.02), chemotherapy 
vs. no chemotherapy. In the unadjusted analyses, patients with both T1a and T1b 
tumors had significantly improved OS with chemotherapy. At 5 years, OS was 100% 
vs. 94.4% and 93.8% vs. 81.3% for patients with T1a and T1b tumors, 
respectively, chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy. With 4.9 years of median 
follow-up, iDFS was not significantly improved with chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Patients with ER-negative/HER2-negative, T1abN0 breast cancer had 
significantly improved OS when treated with chemotherapy. This improvement was 
significant in patients with both T1a and T1b tumors, respectively. The effect 
was, however, limited in patients with T1a tumors."
738,"INTRODUCTION: Obesity and breast cancer are two major pathologies closely 
associated with increasing incidence and mortality rates, especially amongst 
women. The association between both diseases have been thoroughly discussed but 
much is still to uncover.
AIM: The aim of this study is to analyse tumour characteristics and clinical 
outcomes of overweight and obese women to disclosure potential associations and 
better understand the impact of obesity in breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinicopathological information of 2246 women were 
extracted from the institutional database of comprehensive cancer centre in 
Portugal diagnosed between 2012 and 2016. Women were stratified according to 
body mass index as normal, overweight, and obese. Patients' demographic 
information and tumour features (age, family history, topographic localization, 
laterality, histological type, and receptor status) were taken as independent 
variables and overall survival, tumour stage, differentiation grade and 
bilaterality were considered clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The main results reveal that overweight and obesity are predominantly 
associated with worse outcomes in breast cancer patients. Obese patients present 
larger (p-value: 0.002; OR 1.422; 95% CI 1.134-1.783) and more poorly 
differentiated tumours (p-value: 0.002; OR 1.480; 95% CI 1.154-1.898) and tend 
to have lower overall survival although without statistical significance 
(p-value: 0.117; OR 1.309; 95% CI 0.934-1.833). Overweighted women are more 
likely to have bilateral breast cancer (p-value: 0.017; OR 3.076; 95% CI 
1.225-7.722) than obese women. The results also reveal that overweight women 
present less distant metastasis (p-value: 0.024; OR 0.525; 95%CI 0.299-0.920). 
Topographic localization and laterality did not achieve statistical 
significance."
739,"BACKGROUND: Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) is one of the most significant 
aromatic plants in Turkiye. Recently, a new pathogen induced symptoms were 
discovered and identified as basil downy mildew caused by Peronospora belbahrii 
Thines. The pathogen has been introduced into the country and it has quickly 
become the most damaging disease in basil cultivation. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate the molecular and morphological properties of the causal 
organism of downy mildew observed on sweet basil and determine the disease 
incidence and prevalence in Antalya province.
METHODS AND RESULTS: According to morphological characteristics (conidia, 
conidiophores) disease was determined as downy mildew caused by P. belbahrii. 
Pathogenicity tests were performed by spraying with a sporangial suspension of 
P. belbahrii (1 × 105 sporangia/mL). After 1 week, all inoculated plants 
exhibited characteristic downy mildew symptoms on their leaves, whereas 
non-inoculated control plants remained disease-free. All molecular analyses 
involving the internal transcribed spacer region were amplified using Nested PCR 
with primer pairs ITS4 and ITS6 for the first round and ITS4 and DC6 for the 
second round. Resulting sequences of all the nested PCR products had 99% 
similarity with P. belbahrii isolates. Disease incidence was 22.4-70.2% of sweet 
basil cultivation area in Antalya province.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the molecular analysis, morphological characteristics and 
pathogenicity tests the pathogen was identified as P. belbahrii. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of downy mildew caused by P. belbahrii on 
sweet basil in Turkiye."
740,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Acanthopanax 
senticosus, also known as Ciwujia or Siberian ginseng in Chinese, has a wide 
range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The study aims to explore 
the action mechanism of A. senticosus against Alzheimer's disease using network 
pharmacology and molecular docking. The active ingredients and targets of A. 
senticosus were searched through the ETCM database, and Alzheimer's 
disease-related targets were obtained through the OMIM and GeneCards databases. 
The Cytoscape 3.7.2 software was used to construct a ""drug-component-target"" 
relationship network, and the target genes of A. senticosus against Alzheimer's 
disease were imported into the String database to establish a protein 
interaction (PPI) network. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes gene enrichment analyses were performed through the Metascape database 
to obtain potential pathways of action of A. senticosus for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease, and the ability of these active ingredients to bind to core 
targets was then verified by molecular docking. 51 active ingredients were 
screened from A. senticosus, and 88 effective targets for Alzheimer's disease 
were screened. Topological and pathway-enrichment analyses revealed that A. 
senticosus could play a beneficial role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease 
by regulating apoptosis and inflammation. Molecular docking results showed that 
Ciwujianoside B, Chiisanoside, and Ciwujianoside D1 had strong binding abilities 
to key target proteins (TNFα, IL1β, and CASP3). Collectively, A. senticosus is 
feasible in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."
741,"After more than 60 years of intense research in allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT), this therapy has progressed from one that was fraught 
with seemingly insurmountable complications to a standard treatment of patients 
with aplastic anemia. During the 1970s and 1980s, HCT donors were almost 
exclusively HLA-identical siblings. Subsequent advances in the understanding of 
the complexity of the HLA region along with the development of molecular HLA 
typing and the establishment of unrelated volunteer donor registries have 
resulted in an ever-increasing use of such donors. Most recent breakthroughs 
have enabled HLA-haploidentical HCT and, thereby, finding donors for nearly 
every patient. The outstanding outcomes reported with any of the donor options 
have made allogeneic HCT the preferred treatment over immunosuppressive therapy."
742,"BACKGROUND: The most prevalent illness among the elderly is coronary artery 
disease (CAD), and most of this population present with multi-vessel CAD which 
constitutes a common management difficulty among elderly people. This study 
aimed to compare long-term consequences of percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) versus coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) revascularization in elderly 
patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease.
RESULTS: This retrospective study evaluated 100 elderly patients with 
multi-vessel CAD divided into two groups, group 1 the PCI group and group 2 the 
CABG group. The main findings of the study showed that CABG group had a longer 
hospital stay than the PCI group (8.16 vs. 2.02 days; P < 0.001). A considerably 
higher mean residual SYNTAX score was observed in the PCI group than CABG group 
which was 1.15 and 0.2, respectively (p-value < 0.001). The in-hospital major 
adverse cardiac events rate (MACE) in both groups was not statistically 
significant. Regarding the in-hospital mortality rate, although it was higher in 
the CABG group (6%) versus 2% in the PCI group, yet it was not statistically 
significant. The long-term MACE in this study revealed that 12.2% of PCI 
patients had heart failure compared to 6.4% in the CABG group, which was 
statistically insignificant. In the long-term follow-up, the revascularization 
rate of CABG group was higher than the PCI group; however, it was statistically 
insignificant. CABG group had a higher rate of stroke than PCI group being 4.3% 
and 2%, respectively; yet this difference was not statistically considerable. 
The long-term mortality rate among the PCI and CABG group was 10.2% and 4.3%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with multi-vessel CAD, PCI with stenting, and CABG 
were statistically equivalent in long-term death and MI rates, stroke, repeat 
revascularization. A non-statistically notable distinction between the two 
groups as regards MACE, composite of death or MI, and all-cause mortality was 
found. This may have implication on choice of management strategy among elderly 
patients with multi-vessel CAD."
743,"Worldwide ever-augmenting urbanization, modernization, and industrialization 
have contributed to the release of pernicious compounds and a variety of 
pollutants into the environment. The pollutants discharged due to 
industrialization are of global concern. Industrial waste and effluent are 
comprised of hazardous organic and inorganic chemicals including heavy metals 
which pose a significant threat to the environment and may bring about numerous 
diseases or abnormalities in human beings. This brings on greater urgency for 
remediation of these polluted soil and water using sustainable approaches and 
mechanisms. In the present research, a multi-metal-resistant, gram-positive, 
non-virulent bacterial strain Bacillus sp. GH-s29 was isolated from contaminated 
groundwater of Bhojpur district, Bihar, India. The strain had the potential to 
develop a biofilm that was able to remediate different heavy metals [arsenic, 
cadmium, and chromium] from individual and multi-heavy metal solutions. Maximum 
removal for As (V), Cd (II), and Cr (VI) from individual-metal and the 
multi-metal solution was observed to be 73.65%, 57.37%, 61.62%, and 48.92%, 
28.7%, and 35.46%, respectively. SEM-EDX analysis revealed the sequestration of 
multi-heavy metals by bacterial biofilm. Further characterization by FTIR 
analysis ensured that the presence of negatively charged functional groups on 
the biofilm-EPS such as hydroxyl, phosphate, sulfate, and carboxyl helps in 
binding to the positively charged metal ions. Thus, Bacillus sp. GH-s29 proved 
to be an effective and economical alternative for different heavy metal 
remediation from contaminated sites."
744,"The predictive value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) in severely 
burned patients remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential 
association between admission RDW and outcomes in patients with severe burns. 
Data of severely burned patients in the burn center of Changhai Hospital were 
retrospectively evaluated. The relationship between admission RDW and mortality 
was analyzed and displayed using the receiver operating characteristic curve, 
Kaplan-Meier curve, Cox proportional hazards regression, and the nomogram 
method. A total of 342 patients were identified according to the filter 
criteria. The 30-day mortality was 12.9%, and the mortality rates in 7 days and 
90 days were 2.9% and 16.7%, respectively. Patients with high admission RDW 
value were more likely to die than those with low RDW value. Multivariate 
analysis revealed that higher admission RDW, age, full-thickness burned area, 
and inhalation injury were independent risk factors with 30-day mortality. The 
nomogram based on these risk factors was established to predict survival 
probability in severe burn patients. The C-index of different follow-up times 
was computed between 0.867 and 0.904, and the nomogram model list fits the data 
well. Admission RDW played a valuable role in predicting short-term mortality in 
patients with severe burns. The nomogram containing admission RDW was 
established to predict mortality, which helps burn care providers identify the 
patients at higher risk of short-term mortality after severe burns. More 
attention should be paid to the application of these easy and inexpensive 
biochemical indicators in the early prediction of disease progression."
745,"In the present study, we investigated the effects of urolithin A (UA), a 
metabolite generated from ellagic acid via its metabolism by gut bacteria, as an 
autophagy activator with potential neuroprotective activity. WT and 3xTg-AD mice 
were administered long-term intermittent dietary supplementation with UA. UA was 
found to prevent deficits in spatial memory, cued fear response, and exploratory 
behavior in this model. It also decreased the Aβ plaque burden in areas of the 
hippocampus where these protein deposits are prominent in the model. 
Interestingly, correlation analyses demonstrate that Aβ plaque burden positively 
correlates with enhanced spatial memory in 3xTg-AD mice on a control diet but 
not in those supplemented with UA. In contrast, Aβ42 abundance in cortical and 
hippocampal homogenates negatively correlate with spatial memory in UA-fed mice. 
Our data suggest that plaque formation may be a protective mechanism against 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline and that targeting the generation of 
proteotoxic Aβ species might be a more successful approach in halting disease 
progression. UA was also found to extend lifespan in normal aging mice. 
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that UA is able to induce autophagy and to 
increase Aβ clearance in neuronal cell lines. In summary, our studies reveal UA, 
likely via its actions as a autophagy inducer, is capable of removing Aβ from 
neurons and its dietary administration prevents the onset of cognitive deficits 
associated with pathological Aβ deposition in the 3xTg-AD mouse model as well as 
extending lifespan in normal aging mice."
746,"Combination therapy as an important treatment option for lung cancer has been 
attracting attention due to the primary and acquired resistance of 
chemotherapeutic drugs in the clinical application. In the present study, as a 
new therapy strategy, concomitant treatment with time-restricted feeding (TRF) 
plus cisplatin (DDP) on lung cancer growth was investigated in DDP-resistant and 
DDP-sensitive lung cancer cells. We first found that TRF significantly enhanced 
the drug susceptibility of DDP in DDP-resistant A549 (A549/DDP) cell line, 
illustrated by reversing the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values of 
A549/DDP cells to normal level of parental A549 cells. We also found that TRF 
markedly enhanced DDP inhibition on cell proliferation, migration, as well as 
promoted apoptosis compared to the DDP alone group in A549, H460 and A549/DDP 
cells lines. We further revealed that the synergistic anti-tumor effect of 
combined DDP and TRF was greater than that of combined DDP and simulated fasting 
condition (STS), a known anti-tumor cellular medium. Moreover, mRNA sequence 
analysis from A549/DDP cell line demonstrated the synergistic anti-tumor effect 
involved in upregulated pathways in p53 signaling pathway and apoptosis. 
Notably, compared with the DDP alone group, combination of TRF and DDP robustly 
upregulated the P53 protein expression without mRNA level change by regulating 
its stability via promoting protein synthesis and inhibiting degradation, 
revealed by cycloheximide and MG132 experiments. Collectively, our results 
suggested that TRF in combination with cisplatin might be an additional novel 
therapeutic strategy for patients with lung cancer."
747,"Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused 
by SOX10, PAX3, MITF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SNAI2. A large burden of pathogenic de 
novo variants is present in patients with WS, which may be derived from parental 
mosaicism. Previously, we retrospectively analyzed 90 WS probands with family 
information. And the frequency of de novo events and parental mosaicism was 
preliminary investigated in our previous study. In this study, we further 
explored the occurrence of low-level parental mosaicism in 33 WS families with 
de novo variants and introduced our procedure of quantifying low-level 
mosaicism. Mosaic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were validated by 
amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS); copy-number variants (CNVs) 
were validated by droplet-digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Molecular 
validation of low-level mosaicism of WS-causing variants was performed in four 
families (12.1%, 4/33). These four mosaic variants, comprising three SNVs and 
one CNV, were identified in SOX10. The rate of parental mosaicism was 25% (4/16) 
in WS families with de novo SOX10 variants. The lowest allele ratio of a mosaic 
variant was 2.0% in parental saliva. These de novo WS cases were explained by 
parental mosaicism conferring an elevated recurrence risk in subsequent 
pregnancies of parents. Considering its importance in genetic counseling, 
low-level parental mosaicism should be systematically investigated by 
personalized sensitive testing. Amplicon-based NGS and ddPCR are recommended to 
detect and precisely quantify the mosaicism for SNPs and CNVs."
748,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether gut microbiota (GM) affects the risk of optic 
neuritis (ON) through the ""gut-brain"" axis and the ""gut-retina"" axis. To examine 
the causal relationship between GM and ON, we conducted Mendelian randomization 
(MR) study.
METHODS: Up to 18,340 samples of 24 population-based cohorts were included in 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 196 GM taxa. ON outcomes were selected 
from the FinnGen GWAS (951 ON cases and 307,092 controls). In addition, the GWAS 
based on UK Biobank (UKB) (105 ON cases and 456,243 controls) was used for 
further exploration. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was carried out to estimate 
their effects on ON risk and the MR assumptions were evaluated in sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Among the 196 GM taxa, the IVW results confirmed that Family 
-Peptococcaceae (P = 2.17 × 10-3), Genus- Hungatella (P = 4.57 × 10-3) and 
genus-Eubacterium_rectale_group (P = 0.02) were correlated with the risk of ON 
based on Finngen GWAS. Based on data from UKB, Genus- Eubacterium_hallii_group 
(P = 1.50 × 10-3) and Genus- Ruminococcaceae_UCG_002 (P = 0.02) were correlated 
with the risk of ON. At the phylum, class and order levels, no GM taxa were 
causally related to ON (P > 0.05). Heterogeneity (P > 0.05) and pleiotropy 
(P > 0.05) analysis confirmed the robustness of the MR results.
CONCLUSION: Our MR findings support the causal effect of specific GM taxa on ON. 
GM may affect the risk of ON through the ""gut-brain"" axis and the ""gut-retina"" 
axis. However, further research is needed to confirm the relevant mechanism of 
the relationship between GM and ON."
749,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is has been rising over the past few 
years, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent comorbidity in this 
population.
AIM: To determine the prevalence of OSA in patients with chronic kidney disease 
stages I-V and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
METHODS: Patients with CKD of varying grades and ESRD routinely visiting 
outpatient nephrology clinic or admitted in department of nephrology were 
included in the study. Stages I-III were categorized as early stages of CKD and 
stages IV-V and ESRD as late stages of CKD. Patients were categorized into a 
high risk group based on STOP-BANG and Berlin questionnaires. Patients who were 
high risk were subjected to in-hospital overnight level III polysomnography. 
Student's independent t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed for 
the comparison of continuous variables. Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test, 
as appropriate, were used for the comparison of categorical variables.
RESULTS: Of 111 patients, 46 (41%) were found to have OSA. Of these patients, 15 
(33%) had mild OSA (AHI 5-14/h), 13 (28%) had moderate OSA (15-29/h), and 18 
(39%) had severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30/h). Overall, 31% of patients in the early stage 
of CKD and 45% in the late stage were found to have OSA.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a high prevalence of OSA in patients 
with CKD when compared to the general population affecting both genders equally. 
The risk of OSA was higher in the advanced stages of CKD compared to the early 
stages, and dialysis had no effect on prevalence. Since OSA increases the 
cardiovascular morbidity in CKD the leading cause of death in these patients, 
early diagnosis and treatment of OSA may have promise to affect the mortality."
750,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small and noncoding RNA molecules (18-25 nt) 
that can regulate expression of their target genes post-transcriptionally. 
Previously, using high-throughput sequencing data obtained on a Solexa platform, 
we found that Bos taurus bta-miR-2904 (miR-2904) was significantly upregulated 
in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells infected with bovine viral diarrhea 
virus (BVDV) strain NADL at 2, 6, and 18 h postinfection (hpi) compared to 
uninfected MDBK cells. Moreover, miR-2904 overexpression significantly reduced 
BVDV replication. However, the mechanism by which miR-2904 inhibits viral 
replication remains unclear. In this study, we used electron microscopy, laser 
confocal microscopy, dual-luciferase reporter analysis, real-time PCR, and 
Western blot assays to investigate the effect of the miR-2904 expression on BVDV 
NADL replication and virus-infection-induced autophagy. The results indicate 
that miR-2904 inhibits autophagy of MDBK cells by targeting autophagy-related 
gene 13 (ATG13), and overexpression of miR-2904 inhibited the replication of 
BVDV NADL."
751,"Numerous mechanisms involved in promoting cancer cell survival under nutrient 
starvation have been described. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as 
critical players in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, but the role of lncRNAs 
in the progression of CRC under nutrient starvation has not been well clarified. 
Here, we identified a lncRNA, LINC01615, that was significantly upregulated in 
response to serum starvation. LINC01615 can contribute to the adaptation of CRC 
cells to serum-deprived conditions and enhance cell survival under similar 
conditions. LINC01615 activated the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) under serum 
starvation, manifested as decreased ROS production and enhanced nucleotide and 
lipid synthesis. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a key rate-limiting 
enzyme of the PPP, and LINC01615 promoted G6PD expression by competitively 
binding with hnRNPA1 and facilitating G6PD pre-mRNA splicing. Moreover, we also 
found that serum starvation led to METTL3 degradation by inducing autophagy, 
which further increased the stability and level of LINC01615 in a m6A-dependent 
manner. LINC01615 knockdown combined with oxaliplatin achieved remarkable 
antitumor effects in PDO and PDX models. Collectively, our results demonstrated 
a novel adaptive survival mechanism permitting tumor cells to survive under 
limiting nutrient supplies and provided a potential therapeutic target for CRC."
752,"Common scab (CS) caused by pathogenic Streptomyces spp. plays a decisive role in 
the qualitative and quantitative production of potatoes worldwide. Although the 
CS pathogen is present in Assam's soil, disease signs and symptoms are less 
obvious in the landrace Rongpuria potatoes that indicate an interesting 
interaction between the plant and the geocaulosphere microbial population. 
Toward this, a comparative metagenomics study was performed to elucidate the 
geocaulosphere microbiome assemblages and functions of low CS-severe (LSG) and 
moderately severe (MSG) potato plants. Alpha diversity indices showed that CS 
occurrence modulated microbiome composition and decreased overall microbial 
abundances. Functional analysis involving cluster of orthologous groups (COG) 
too confirmed reduced microbial metabolism under disease incidence. The 
top-three most dominant genera were Pseudomonas (relative abundance: 2.79% in 
LSG; 12.31% in MSG), Streptomyces (2.55% in LSG; 5.28% in MSG), and Pantoea 
(2.30% in LSG; 3.51% in MSG). As shown by the high Pielou's J evenness index, 
the potato geocaulosphere core microbiome was adaptive and resilient to CS 
infection. The plant growth-promoting traits and potential antagonistic activity 
of major taxa (Pseudomonads, non-pathogenic Streptomyces spp., and others) 
against the CS pathogen, i.e., Streptomyces scabiei, point toward selective 
microbial recruitment and colonization strategy by the plants to its own 
advantage. KEGG Orthology analysis showed that the CS infection resulted in high 
abundances of ATP-binding cassette transporters and a two-component system, 
ubiquitous to the transportation and regulation of metabolites. As compared to 
the LSG metagenome, the MSG counterpart had a higher representation of important 
PGPTs related to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, IAA production, 
betaine utilization, and siderophore production."
753,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of rituximab treatment on innate immune cell 
activation in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS).
METHODS: A 48-year-old woman with PPMS was started on rituximab shortly after 
diagnosis. [11C]PK11195 PET imaging was employed to assess innate immune cell 
activation with special interest in the white matter around chronic lesions. 
PET, MRI, and disability measurements were performed at baseline and after 
18 months of rituximab treatment. Specific binding of [11C]PK11195 was 
quantified using mean distribution volume ratios (DVRs), and at voxel-level 
based on proportions of active voxels.
RESULTS: The PPMS patient had higher PK11195 DVRs and higher proportions of 
active voxels in the thalamus and the normal appearing white matter compared to 
the healthy control group. The thalamic and perilesional white matter DVRs and 
the proportions of active voxels decreased after rituximab treatment. The 
patient remained clinically stable during the 5-years follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that while a degree of smoldering activity 
persists, high efficacy B-cell-targeting therapy may contribute to reduced 
innate immune cell activation in PPMS brain areas relevant for disease 
progression. This case supports the therapeutic concept that controlling 
smoldering brain inflammation is beneficial for slowing down progression 
independent of relapses."
754,"African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most devastating infectious diseases 
affecting domestic pigs and wild boar. The grave socio-economic impact of 
African swine fever infection at a global level makes large-scale rapid and 
robust diagnosis a critical step towards effective control. Here, we describe 
multiple-probe-assisted DNA capture and amplification technology (MADCAT) - a 
novel, sensitive, simple, and high-throughput method for detecting ASFV directly 
from whole blood or other complex matrices. Through a unique DNA capture 
approach which specifically captures the target DNA onto 96-well plate for 
subsequent amplification, MADCAT abandons the complicated extraction protocol 
and achieves ultrafast and high-throughput detection. The sample-to-result time 
for 96 samples is about 90 min, as compared with the 3-4 h time of the 
conventional real-time qPCR method. The limit of detection (LOD) of MADCAT is 
0.5 copies/μL blood and is 5 times more sensitive than an extraction-based qPCR 
assay when testing serially diluted whole blood samples. The assay is 100% 
specific against other common swine pathogens. In the clinical diagnosis of 96 
field samples, all 22 positive samples were correctly identified with lower Ct 
values than extraction-based qPCR, confirming its high diagnostic sensitivity 
(100%). Owing to its high-throughput, specific high sensitivity, and direct 
detection features, MADCAT shows great potential for use in large-scale ASFV 
surveillance and monitoring for effective disease control. KEY POINTS: • No 
nucleic acid extraction, 100% capture efficiency, and high-throughput • 
Ultra-high sensitivity of 0.5 DNA copies/μL or 6 DNA copies/reaction • The 
sample-to-answer time for 96 samples is about 90 min."
755,"Synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) are a well-investigated and standard drug 
therapy for disorders associated with CNS inflammation. Less is known about 
treating psychiatric disorders associated with neural autoantibodies. Our aim is 
to elucidate the repositioning of sGCs in psychiatric diseases that co-exist 
with neural autoantibodies. We used PubMed to identify articles for this 
narrative review. To our knowledge, no randomized, placebo-controlled trials 
have yet been conducted on applying sGC to treat neural autoantibody-associated 
psychiatric disorders. We describe initial results of cohort studies and single 
cases or case series often associated with autoantibodies against 
membrane-surface antigens demonstrating a largely beneficial response to sGCs 
either as monotherapy or polytherapy together with other immunosuppressive 
agents. However, sGCs may be less efficient in patients with psychiatric 
diseases associated with autoantibodies directed against intracellular antigens. 
These results reveal potential benefits of the novel usage of sGCs for the 
indication of neural autoantibody-associated psychiatric disease. Further 
large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to discover whether 
sGCs are safe, well tolerated, and beneficial in subgroups of neural 
autoantibody-associated psychiatric diseases."
756,"PURPOSE: There is reason to believe that the favorable measurement properties of 
the 6‑minute walk test (6MWT) reported for retest reliability and its capability 
to detect a true change in healthy individuals or persons with chronic 
respiratory disease may not apply to lung transplant recipients (LuTXr). We 
therefore investigated retest reliability of the 6MWT and, in addition, made an 
attempt to explore whether the 6MWT was sensitive enough to detect important 
changes that occur with postacute rehabilitation in LuTXr after first time LuTX.
METHODS: Immediately before postacute rehabilitation, 50 LuTXr completed 6MWT 
testing twice, separated by 1-2 workdays (retest reliability), and were 
reassessed after completion of rehabilitation 2 months later (sensitivity to 
changes). Body function measures and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
assessments were collected at baseline.
RESULTS: Baseline retest 6‑minute walk distance (6MWD) and the age-related 
predicted walking distance (6MWD%pred) scores significantly increased before 
postacute rehabilitation. The intraclass coefficient of correlation ICC of the 
6MWD was 0.93 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.88-0.96) and its smallest real 
difference (SRD) 79 m (95% CI: 52;107). Receiver operating curve analyses 
revealed the rehabilitation associated changes in 6MWD/6MWD%pred to exceed the 
SRD/SRD% values in a highly accurate way.
CONCLUSION: The 6MWT overall represents a reliable functional performance tool 
in LuTXr that is sensitive to detect changes in physical performance as a result 
of medical postacute rehabilitation."
757,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is frequent in people 
living with HIV (PLWH) and may be aggravated by metabolic comorbidities and 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-associated adverse effects.
METHODS: We retrospectively assessed epidemiological, clinical and laboratory 
parameters and ART regimens at HIV diagnosis (BL) and at last follow-up (FU) in 
1458 PLWH without viral hepatitis coinfection attending our HIV clinic in 
2014-2016. Fibrosis was non-invasively assessed by the NAFLD fibrosis score 
(NFS).
RESULTS: The median age of subjects was 37.8 years, 77.4% were male and 67.2% on 
ART, median CD4+ count was 356.0 cells/µL. At BL, 503 (34.5%) and 20 (1.4%) PLWH 
had dyslipidemia and diabetes, respectively. According to the NFS 16 (1.3%) 
showed advanced fibrosis (NFS ≥ 0.676), among which 1 (6.3%) had diabetes, 7 
(43.8%) had dyslipidemia, and 5 (31.3%) were on HIV-protease inhibitors (PI). In 
addition, 191(15.1%) had intermediate NFS results, while fibrosis was ruled out 
(NFS ≤ 1.455) in 1065 (83.7%) PLWH. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, 590 
(42.8%) had dyslipidemia and 61 (4.4%) had diabetes. Also, 21 (1.6%) showed 
advanced fibrosis, of which 10 (47.6%) had diabetes, 4 (19.0%) had dyslipidemia, 
and 9 (42.9%) were on PI-based ART, 223 (17.4%) had intermediate NFS results, 
while 1039 (81.0%) showed no fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: During FU, advanced NAFLD fibrosis occurred in 1.3-1.6% of PLWH. 
Dyslipidemia, diabetes, and PI-based ART were associated with advanced NAFLD 
fibrosis. Prospective investigations of NAFLD severity and risk factors in PLWH 
are warranted."
758,"Novel function and mechanism of a PNP molecule VaEG45 from adzuki bean involved 
in plant immunity. Plant natriuretic peptides (PNPs) can affect a broad spectrum 
of physiological responses in plants acting as peptidic signaling molecules. 
However, PNPs may play additional roles in plant immunity. Our previous 
transcriptome data of adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) in response to Uromyces 
vignae infection revealed association of PNP-encoding gene VaEG45 with U. vignae 
resistance. To determine the function of VaEG45 in disease resistance, we cloned 
the 589 bp nucleotide sequence of VaEG45 containing 2 introns, encoding a 
putative 13.68 kDa protein that is 131 amino acids in length. We analyzed 
expression in different resistant cultivars of V. angularis and found 
significant induction of VaEG45 expression after U. vignae infection. Transient 
expression of VaEG45 improved tobacco resistance against Botrytis cinerea. We 
next analyzed the mechanism by which VaEG45 protects plants from fungal 
infection by determination of the biological activity of the prokaryotic 
expressed VaEG45. The results showed that the fusion protein VaEG45 can 
significantly inhibit urediospores germination of U. vignae, mycelial growth, 
and the infection of tobacco by B. cinerea. Further analysis revealed that 
VaEG45 exhibits β-1, 3-glucanase activity. These findings uncover the function 
of a novel PNP molecule VaEG45 and provide new evidence about the mechanism of 
PNPs in plant immunity."
759,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictive value of CT-derived fractional flow 
reserve (FFRCT) in anastomosis occlusion after coronary artery bypass graft 
(CABG) surgery.
METHODS: Patients undergoing CABG with both pre- and post-operative coronary 
computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) were retrospectively included. 
Preoperative CCTA studies were used to evaluate anatomical and FFRCT information 
of target vessels. A diameter stenosis (DS) ≥ 70% or left main > 50% was 
considered to be anatomically severe, while FFRCT value ≤ 0.80 be functionally 
significant. The primary endpoint was anastomosis occlusion evaluated on 
post-operative CCTA during follow-up. Predictors of anastomosis occlusion were 
assessed by the multivariate binary logistic regression with generalized 
estimating equations.
RESULTS: A total of 270 anastomoses were identified in 88 enrolled patients. 
Forty-one anastomoses from 30 patients exhibited occlusion during a follow-up of 
15.3 months after CABG. The occluded group had significantly increased 
prevalence of non-severe DS (58.5% vs. 40.2%; p = 0.023) and non-significant 
FFRCT (48.8% vs. 10.0%; p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis indicated FFRCT ≤ 
0.80 (odds ratio [OR]: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03-0.33; p < 0.001) and older age (OR: 
0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.97; p = 0.001) were predictors for bypass patency during 
follow-up, while myocardial infarction history and anastomosis to a local lesion 
or bifurcation (all p value < 0.05) were predictors of occlusion. Adding FFRCT 
into the model based on the clinical and anatomical predictors had an improved 
AUC of 0.848 (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: FFRCT ≤ 0.80 was associated with a significant risk reduction of 
anastomosis occlusion after CABG. Preoperative judgment of the hemodynamic 
significance may improve the CABG surgery strategy and reduce graft failure.
KEY POINTS: • FFRCT ≤ 0.80 was associated with a significant risk reduction of 
anastomosis occlusion after CABG. • The addition of FFRCT into the integrated 
model including clinical (age and history of myocardial infarction) and 
anatomical CCTA indicators (local lesion and bifurcation) significantly improved 
the model performance with an AUC of 0.848 (p = 0.005). • Preoperative judgment 
of the hemodynamic significance may help improve the decision-making and surgery 
planning in patients indicated for CABG and significantly reduce graft failure, 
without an extra radiation exposure and risk of invasive procedure."
760,"OBJECTIVES: Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) is a predictor of poor survival in 
cirrhosis patients. However, whether HH increases the mortality risk of 
cirrhosis patients treated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt 
(TIPS) is unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of HH on the 
survival of cirrhosis patients after TIPS.
METHODS: Cirrhosis patients with portal hypertension complications were selected 
from a prospective database of consecutive patients treated with TIPS in Xijing 
Hospital from January 2015 to June 2021. Cirrhosis patients with HH were treated 
as the experimental group. A control group of cirrhosis patients without HH was 
created using propensity score matching. Survival after TIPS and the related 
risk factors were analysed.
RESULTS: There were 1292 cirrhosis patients with portal hypertension 
complications treated with TIPS, among whom 255 patients had HH. Compared with 
patients without HH, patients with HH had worse liver function (MELD, 12 vs. 10, 
p < 0.001), but no difference in survival after TIPS was observed. After 
propensity score matching, 243 patients with HH and 243 patients without HH were 
enrolled. There was no difference in cumulative survival between patients with 
and without HH. Cox regression analysis showed that HH was not associated with 
survival after TIPS, and main portal vein thrombosis (> 50%) was a prognostic 
factor of long-term survival after TIPS in cirrhosis patients (hazard ratio, 
1.386; 95% CI, 1.030-1.865, p = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: Hepatic hydrothorax does not increase the risk of death after TIPS 
in cirrhosis patients.
KEY POINTS: • Hepatic hydrothorax is a decompensated event of cirrhosis and 
increases the risk of death. • Hepatic hydrothorax is associated with worse 
liver function. • Hepatic hydrothorax does not increase the mortality of 
cirrhosis treated with TIPS."
761,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate microvascular alterations in the Glisson system of 
biliary atresia (BA) patients after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) using 
three-dimensional (3D) virtual histopathology based on X-ray phase-contrast CT 
(PCCT).
METHODS: Liver explants from BA patients were imaged using PCCT, and 32 subjects 
were included and divided into two groups: KP (n = 16) and non-KP (n = 16). 
Combined with histological analysis and 3D visualization technology, 3D virtual 
histopathological assessment of the biliary, arterial, and portal venous systems 
was performed. According to loop volume ratio, 3D spatial density, relative 
surface area, tortuosity, and other parameters, pathological changes of 
microvasculature in the Glisson system were investigated.
RESULTS: In the non-KP group, bile ducts mostly manifested as radial 
multifurcated hyperplasia and twisted into loops. In the KP group, the bile duct 
hyperplasia was less, and the loop volume ratio of bile ducts decreased by 
13.89%. Simultaneously, the arterial and portal venous systems presented 
adaptive alterations in response to degrees of bile duct hyperplasia. Compared 
with the non-KP group, the 3D spatial density of arteries in the KP group 
decreased by 3.53%, and the relative surface area decreased from 0.088 ± 0.035 
to 0.039 ± 0.015 (p < .01). Deformed portal branches gradually recovered after 
KP, with a 2.93% increase in 3D spatial density and a decrease in tortuosity 
from 1.17 ± 0.06 to 1.14 ± 0.04 (p < .01) compared to the non-KP group.
CONCLUSION: 3D virtual histopathology via PCCT clearly reveals the microvascular 
structures in the Glisson system of BA patients and provides key insights into 
the morphological mechanism of microvascular adaptation induced by biliary tract 
dredging after KP in BA disease.
KEY POINTS: • 3D virtual histopathology via X-ray phase-contrast computed 
tomography clearly presented the morphological structures and pathological 
changes of microvasculature in the Glisson system of biliary atresia patients. • 
The morphological alterations of microvasculature in the Glisson system followed 
the competitive occupancy mechanism in the process of biliary atresia."
762,"Relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is common and is 
associated with a dismal prognosis. Treatment options are limited and the 
understanding of molecular response patterns is still challenging. We analyzed 
the clonal response patterns of 15 patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated 
with selinexor in a phase II trial (SAIL). DNA was analyzed at three time points 
and showed a decline of mutated alleles in FLT3, SF3B1, and TP53 under SAIL 
treatment. Overall survival (OS) was similar between patients with declining 
versus persisting clones. We show an interesting long-term course of a patient 
who relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) with SF3B1- 
and SRSF2-mutated AML and received selinexor as maintenance treatment for 
4 years. Measurable residual disease (MRD) remained detectable for 2 weeks after 
donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in this patient and then remained negative under 
selinexor maintenance treatment. Selinexor was tolerated well and was stopped 
after 4 years of SAIL treatment. We present an exploratory study and identify 
subclonal patterns of patients treated with selinexor."
763,"Pediatric idiopathic pericardial effusions are common and often have a prolonged 
clinical course. We hypothesized that these effusions have no standardized 
diagnostic workup, and ultimately have a final etiology not initially 
appreciated. To test these hypotheses, a hospital system-wide retrospective 
(1/1/1990-10/1/2019) cohort study of pericardial effusions in children 
(< 18 years) was conducted. Effusions were grouped by etiology and patients 
receiving an initial idiopathic diagnosis were further analyzed. Effusion size, 
diagnostic workup, final diagnosis, and time to resolution were abstracted. In 
total, 42/366 effusions were initially diagnosed as idiopathic. Workup was not 
standardized and included up to six laboratory tests including pericardial fluid 
analysis and infectious, metabolic, rheumatologic and thyroid workups. Treatment 
course involved 1 readmission in 24%, and > 1 readmission in 12%. Resolution of 
effusion occurred in 83% of patients within a median of 1 admission (range 1-4). 
Of those effusions initially deemed idiopathic, 12/42 (29%) were later found to 
have an underlying etiologic diagnosis including: autoimmune (7, 58%), 
neoplastic (2, 16%), infectious (2, 16%), and renal (1, 8%). Children initially 
diagnosed with idiopathic pericardial effusions have an underlying etiologic 
diagnosis 29% of the time, and a standardized workup may prevent delays in 
definitive diagnosis and treatment."
764,"Among insects, symbionts such as bacteria and fungi can be linked to their 
physiology and immature development, and in some cases are part of a defense 
system against parasites and diseases. Current bacterial and fungal symbiont 
associations in solitary bees are understudied, especially in the Pacific 
Northwest region of the USA. We collected pollen provisions from the native 
spring-foraging solitary bee, Osmia lignaria Say, across two distinct foraging 
periods over 2 years at 22 sites along an urban-to-rural gradient in western 
Washington. We then used next-generation sequencing to identify bacterial and 
fungi within pollen provisions and assessed the effect of their richness and 
diversity on O. lignaria larval development success and adult emergence. We 
detected a significantly positive relationship between bacterial diversity in 
pollen with O. lignaria larval developmental success, and higher bacterial 
richness and diversity during the later foraging period. Fungal generic richness 
and diversity decreased with increasing plant richness. Although neither was 
associated with O. lignaria developmental success, we did detect Ascosphaera 
spp. known to be pathogenic to O. lignaria and other bee species. Neither 
bacterial or fungal richness or diversity was affected by site type when 
classified as urban or rural. This study provides new information on bacterial 
and fungal symbionts present in pollen provisions of a native solitary bee when 
foraging across urban and rural areas of the Pacific Northwest."
765,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to systematically determine the inter-reader 
reliability of the functional liver imaging score (FLIS) and explore the factors 
affecting it.
METHODS: Original articles reporting the inter-reader reliability of FLIS 
derived from gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were 
systematically searched in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from January 2013 to 
June 2022. Data synthesis was performed to calculate the meta-analytic pooled 
estimates of the FLIS and its three subcategories, including enhancement quality 
score (EnQS), excretion quality score (ExQS), and portal vein sign quality score 
(PVsQS) using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model. To explore any cause 
of study heterogeneity, we conducted a meta-regression analysis.
RESULTS: Six studies with data from 1419 patients were included. The 
meta-analytic pooled inter-reader reliability of FLIS was 0.93 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.88-0.98). That of the three FLIS subcategories were 0.93 (95% 
CI, 0.85-1.00), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-1.00), and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.81-0.99) for EnQS, 
ExQS, and PVsQS, respectively. The pooled FLIS data was moderately heterogenous, 
but heterogeneity was not associated with the study methodology, MRI-related 
factors, and reader experience.
CONCLUSION: The FLIS and its three subcategories showed almost perfect 
inter-reader reliability. Therefore, FLIS may be a reliable imaging parameter 
that reflects liver function and outcomes in patients with chronic liver 
disease. Further studies should be conducted to confirm any factors affecting 
the inter-reader reliability of FLIS."
766,"BACKGROUND: The applicability and accuracy of artificial intelligence 
(AI)-assisted bone age assessment and adult height prediction methods in girls 
with early puberty are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the performance of AI-assisted bone age assessment methods 
by comparing the corresponding methods for predicted adult height with actual 
adult height.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective review included 726 girls with early 
puberty, 87 of whom had reached adult height at last follow-up. Bone age was 
evaluated using the Greulich-Pyle (GP), Tanner-Whitehouse (TW3-RUS) and China 05 
RUS-CHN (RUS-CHN) methods. Predicted adult height was calculated using the China 
05 (CH05), TW3 and Bayley-Pinneau (BP) methods.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1,663 left-hand radiographs, including 155 from girls who 
had reached adult height. In the 6-8- and 9-11-years age groups, bone age 
differences were smaller than those in the 12-14-years group; however, the 
differences between predicted adult height and actual adult height were larger 
than those in the 12-14-years group. TW3 overestimated adult height by 
0.4±2.8 cm, while CH05 and BP significantly underestimated adult height by 
2.9±3.6 cm and 1.3±3.8 cm, respectively. TW3 yielded the highest proportion of 
predicted adult height within ±5 cm of actual adult height (92.9%), with the 
highest correlation between predicted and actual adult heights.
CONCLUSION: The differences in measured bone ages increased with increasing bone 
age. However, the corresponding method for predicting adult height was more 
accurate when the bone age was older. TW3 might be more suitable than CH05 and 
BP for predicting adult height in girls with early puberty. Methods for 
predicting adult height should be optimized for populations of the same 
ethnicity and disease."
767,"The role of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) on physical health-related quality 
of life (P-HRQoL) and quality of sleep was examined among 261 PLWH ≥40 years, 
recruited from a university-affiliated HIV clinic in the Deep U.S. South. Using 
a cross-sectional study design, participants completed the Medical Outcomes 
Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV; P-HRQoL) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. 
The overall prevalence of self-reporting ≥1 CMD was 64.4%. P-HRQoL scores were 
lower in PLWH with ≥1 CMD compared with those with no CMDs (45.53 ± 11.54 vs. 
49.67 ± 10.77, p <.01). Poor sleep quality was higher among participants with ≥1 
CMD compared with those with no CMDs (9.28 ± 4.42 vs. 7.26 ± 4.17, p<.01). Each 
additional CMD resulted in a 1.83-point decrease in P-HRQoL and 0.74-point 
increase in poor sleep quality scores. Interventions that focus on targeting 
these quality-of-life domains in PLWH with CMDs are needed."
768,"Environmental or occupational exposure of humans to trichloroethylene (TCE) has 
been associated with different extrahepatic toxic effects, including 
nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Bioactivation of TCE via the glutathione (GSH) 
conjugation pathway has been proposed as underlying mechanism, although only few 
mechanistic studies have used cell models of human origin. In this study, six 
human derived cell models were evaluated as in vitro models representing 
potential target tissues of TCE-conjugates: RPTEC/TERT1 (kidney), HepaRG 
(liver), HUVEC/TERT2 (vascular endothelial), LUHMES (neuronal, dopaminergic), 
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) derived peripheral neurons (UKN5) 
and hiPSC-derived differentiated brain cortical cultures containing all subtypes 
of neurons and astrocytes (BCC42). A high throughput transcriptomic screening, 
utilizing mRNA templated oligo-sequencing (TempO-Seq), was used to study 
transcriptomic effects after exposure to TCE-conjugates. Cells were exposed to a 
wide range of concentrations of S-(1,2-trans-dichlorovinyl)glutathione 
(1,2-DCVG), S-(1,2-trans-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (1,2-DCVC), 
S-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione (2,2-DCVG), and 
S-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (2,2-DCVC). 1,2-DCVC caused stress responses 
belonging to the Nrf2 pathway and Unfolded protein response in all the tested 
models but to different extents. The renal model was the most sensitive model to 
both 1,2-DCVC and 1,2-DCVG, with an early Nrf2-response at 3 µM and hundreds of 
differentially expressed genes at higher concentrations. Exposure to 2,2-DCVG 
and 2,2-DCVC also resulted in the upregulation of Nrf2 pathway genes in 
RPTEC/TERT1 although at higher concentrations. Of the three neuronal models, 
both the LUHMES and BCC42 showed significant Nrf2-responses and at higher 
concentration UPR-responses, supporting recent hypotheses that 1,2-DCVC may be 
involved in neurotoxic effects of TCE. The cell models with the highest 
expression of γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) enzymes, showed cellular responses to 
both 1,2-DCVG and 1,2-DCVC. Little to no effects were found in the neuronal 
models from 1,2-DCVG exposure due to their low GGT-expression. This study 
expands our knowledge on tissue specificity of TCE S-conjugates and emphasizes 
the value of human cell models together with transcriptomics for such 
mechanistic studies."
769,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess prognosis of patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma (NDMM) by combining [18F]-FDG positron emission tomography 
(PET)/CT parameters and clinical indices.
METHODS: Clinical data and PET/CT parameters of 133 NDMM patients were 
retrospectively analyzed for associations between clinical indices and PET/CT 
parameters. Independent predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) were determined. A new prognostic prediction system (NPPS) 
was constructed based on our findings. Prediction effectiveness was compared 
among the NPPS, International Staging System (ISS), Revised ISS (R-ISS), and 
R2-ISS.
RESULTS: Prevalence of elevated β2-microglobulin, serum creatinine (sCr), serum 
calcium (sCa), and C-reactive protein concentrations was higher in patients with 
higher SUVmax (≥ 5.3). Prevalence of elevated sCa, sCr, and extramedullary 
disease (EMD) was higher in patients with a higher number of focal lesions 
(≥ 10). SUVmax, serum free-light chain (sFLC) ratio, and EMD were independent 
predictors of PFS and OS. The NPPS used SUVmax, sFLC ratio, and EMD could 
effectively predict OS and was more effective at prognostication than the ISS, 
R-ISS, and R2-ISS.
CONCLUSIONS: [18F]-FDG PET/CT parameters play a significant role in predicting 
prognosis in NDMM patients. The NPPS based on SUVmax, sFLC ratio, and EMD 
outperformed the ISS, R-ISS, and R2-ISS in prognostication."
770,"The two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study revealed a causal association 
of plasma proteins with osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA). Bone mineral 
density (BMD) is the gold standard for the clinical assessment of OP. Recent 
studies have shown that plasma proteins play an essential role in the regulation 
of bone development. However, the causal association of plasma proteins with BMD 
and OA remains unclear. We estimated the effects of 2889 plasma proteins on 2 
BMD phenotypes and 6 OA phenotypes using two-sample MR analysis based on the 
genome-wide association study summary statistics. Then, we performed sensitivity 
analysis and reverse-direction MR analysis to evaluate the robustness of the MR 
analysis results, followed by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and KEGG 
pathway analysis to explore the functional relevance of the identified plasma 
proteins. Overall, we observed a total of 257 protein-estimated heel BMD 
associations, 17 protein-total-body BMD associations, 2 protein-all-OA 
associations, and 2 protein-knee-OA associations at PFDR < 0.05. 
Reverse-direction MR analysis demonstrated that there was little evidence of the 
causal association of BMD and OA with plasma proteins. GO enrichment analysis 
and KEGG pathway analysis identified multiple pathways, which may be involved in 
the development of OP and OA. Our findings recognized plasma proteins that could 
be used to regulate changes in OP and OA, thus, providing new insights into 
protein-mediated mechanisms of bone development."
771,"Plague meningitis is a serious and often fatal manifestation of Yersinia pestis 
infection. In the aftermath of a bioweapon attack with Y pestis, this typically 
rare manifestation may develop in a substantial number of patients, particularly 
if treatment delays occur. Risk factors, clinical evolution, and optimal 
treatment strategies for plague meningitis are not well understood. We searched 
PubMed Central and other databases for reports of plague meningitis in any 
language. Articles containing descriptions of patients with plague meningitis 
and outcome were included. Among 1,496 articles identified in our search, 56 
articles describing 84 cases from 1898 to 2015 met inclusion criteria. The 
median age of patients was 16 years (range 6 weeks to 64 years); 68% were male. 
Most patients (n = 50, 60%) developed meningitis following primary bubonic 
plague. Common signs and symptoms included fever (n = 56, 66%), nuchal rigidity 
(n = 38, 45%), and headache (n = 33, 36%); 29% (n = 24) of patients had focal 
neurologic deficits such as cranial nerve abnormalities. Almost all (n = 23, 
96%) of the 24 patients who did not receive antimicrobials died, and 42% 
(n = 25) of the 59 patients treated with antimicrobials died. The case fatality 
rate of patients grouped by antimicrobial received was 50% (1 out of 2) for 
fluoroquinolones, 19% (4 out of 21) for aminoglycosides, 14% (2 out of 14) for 
sulfonamides, 11% (2 out of 18) for chloramphenicol, and 0% (0 out of 13) for 
tetracyclines. Plague meningitis most often occurs as a complication of bubonic 
plague and can cause focal neurologic deficits. Survival is more likely in 
patients who receive antimicrobials; tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, and 
chloramphenicol had the lowest associated case fatality rates."
772,"Purpose: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic 
hepatic disease worldwide, with functional impairment of the mitochondria 
occurring from early stages. Technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile 
(99mTc-MIBI) is a lipophilic agent trapped in the mitochondria. This study aims 
to evaluate the utility of 99mTc-MIBI heart/liver uptake ratio in screening for 
NAFLD during myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Methods: Seventy eligible 
patients underwent a 2-d rest/stress 99mTc-MIBI scan with a 2-min planar image 
acquired in rest phase, at 30, 60, and 120 min postradiotracer administration. 
Heart/liver uptake ratio was calculated by placing identical regions of interest 
on the heart and liver dome. All patients underwent liver ultrasound and were 
allocated into groups A, having NAFLD; and B, healthy individuals without NAFLD. 
Results: Mean count per pixel heart/liver ratios gradually increased over time 
in either group; nonetheless the values were significantly higher in group A, 
regardless of acquisition timing; with the p-value equal to 0.007, 0.014, and 
0.010 at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively. Conclusion: Determining 99mTc-MIBI 
heart/liver uptake ratio during rest phase in patients undergoing MPI may be a 
useful, noninvasive screening method for NAFLD; with no additional cost, 
radiation burden, or adverse effects in these patients. Trial registration

773,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated community health volunteer (CHV) strategies to prevent 
non-communicable disease (NCD) care disruption and promote coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) detection among Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians, as 
the pandemic started.
METHODS: Alongside medication delivery, CHVs called patients monthly to assess 
stockouts and adherence, provide self-management and psychosocial support, and 
screen and refer for complications and COVID-19 testing. Cohort analysis was 
undertaken of stockouts, adherence, complications and suspected COVID-19. 
Multivariable models of disease control assessed predictors and non-inferiority 
of the strategy pre-/post-initiation. Cost-efficiency and patient/staff 
interviews assessed implementation.
RESULTS: Overall, 1119 patients were monitored over 8 mo. The mean monthly 
proportion of stockouts was 4.9%. The monthly proportion non-adherent (past 5/30 
d) remained below 5%; 204 (18.1%) patients had complications, with 63 requiring 
secondary care. Mean systolic blood pressure and random blood glucose remained 
stable. For hypertensive disease control, age 41-65 y (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.2 to 
0.78) and with diabetes (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98) had decreased odds, and 
with baseline control had increased odds (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2.31 to 4.13). 
Cumulative suspected COVID-19 incidence (2.3/1000 population) was suggestive of 
ongoing transmission. While cost-efficient (108 US${\$}$/patient/year), funding 
secondary care was challenging.
CONCLUSIONS: During multiple crises, CHVs prevented care disruption and 
reinforced COVID-19 detection."
774,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk for exposure to upper 
respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and influenza-like illnesses (ILIs). The 
present study aimed to surveil URTIs and ILIs and their impact among the 
Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases in Wroclaw employees and evaluate 
their humoral response to influenza.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-six HCWs participated in the first season and 32 
HCWs in the second season during years of the study. The authors carried out a 
URTI/ILI surveillance, and all HCWs were asked to complete a weekly report 
during 2 influenza seasons: 2016/2017 (S1) and 2017/2018 (S2). In S1 both IgG 
and IgM antibodies against influenza A and B were assessed. The HCWs with 
symptoms of ILI were encouraged to undergo PCR tests for influenza.
RESULTS: No significant differences in reporting URTI were found among 
vaccinated and non-vaccinated HCWs and HCWs and the control group. Depending on 
the year 5.5-17.2% of HCWs were treated with antibiotics because of URTI. In the 
study 58.7% of participants in S1 and 66.7% in S2 decide to work despite the 
URTI symptoms. There was no statistical relationship between the concentration 
of anti-influenza IgG and the number of URTIs and ILIs reported. Only vaccinated 
were willing to undergo voluntary influenza testing.
CONCLUSIONS: The URTI and ILI occur commonly in HCWs, and HCWs contract URTIs as 
often as the control group. Despite their medical education, HCWs work with the 
symptoms of infection and overuse antibiotics to treat the URTI. Serology 
testing is not able to follow the infection's dynamics or identify the people 
immune to the influenza-like illness. The diagnostic value of IgM antibodies in 
acute influenza infection is negligible. Vaccinated HCWs are more focused on 
their health and are more willing to undergo influenza tests. Med Pr.

775,"OBJECTIVE: Management of patients with penile cancer (PeC) with palpable 
inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) relies on radical ILN dissection (RILND). Low burden 
of nodal metastatic disease may lead to long-lasting survival with surgical 
management. Nevertheless, RILND involves significant postoperative morbidity. We 
compared the complications of patients undergoing RILND with (RILND-T) and 
without (RILND-0T) placement of a collagen-fibrin sealant patch on the resection 
bed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational retrospective study. Data 
from men submitted to RILND-T and RILND-0T from Jan/2001 to Feb/2022, in a 
tertiary care centre were compared. The primary endpoint was the overall 
incidence of complications until 1 month after the procedure and their 
respective severity in both cohorts (Clavien-Dindo classification system). 
Secondarily, length of hospital stay (LOHS) was analysed. The placement of a 
collagen-fibrin sealant patch was left at the surgeon's discretion.
RESULTS: Seven patients underwent RILND-T and 20 underwent RILND-0T, 
respectively. There were no differences in pathologic TNM stage nor in the total 
number of ILNs removed (17 ± 4 vs. 20 ± 8, p = 0.37). Overall, 23 (85.2%) 
patients had complications. The complication rate was similar in both cohorts 
(85.7% vs 85%, p = 0.73). Surgical wound infection (3/7 vs. 11/20) and 
lymphocele (4/7 vs. 11/20) were the most reported complications. Patients 
undergoing RILND-T were discharged faster (mean length of hospital stay 9 ± 3 vs 
19 ± 20 days, p = 0.22).
CONCLUSIONS: The application of a collagen-fibrin sealant patch on the resection 
bed does not seem to reduce the postoperative complication rate in patients 
undergoing RILND. Nevertheless, a trend towards a shorter LOHS in patients with 
RILND-T cannot be excluded and should be validated by further studies with a 
higher number of patients."
776,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients 
suffering prostate cancer (PCa) treated conservatively using 1064 nm laser 
energy for focal laser ablation (FLA). The patients included in the study were 
unsuitable for surgery or unwilling to receive external beam radiotherapy 
because they were afraid of the possible side effects of whole-gland therapies.
METHODS: This study included patients with a diagnosis of nonmetastatic PCa who 
underwent FLA using SoracteLiteTM system. Tissue ablation was performed at a 
fixed power of 5 W by the diode multichannel laser system EchoLaser X4 that uses 
laser light transmitted through optical fibres causing the target tissue to 
undergo irreversible thermal damage. Functional outcomes were evaluated with the 
International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) and 5-item version of the 
International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) before the treatment and one 
year later.
RESULTS: Ten patients suffering non-metastatic PCa were included. Four decided 
upon a conservative treatment because of reduced performance status and for six 
patients the procedure was chosen electively. All patients underwent 
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging at 3 and 12 months and eight out of 
ten patients underwent prostate biopsy at 6 months. Persistent disease was 
detected in 3 patients who underwent a second ablation. In these patients at the 
biopsy following the second ablation none harbored residual disease. At 
follow-up, no patient suffered urinary incontinence requiring the use of pads. 
No significant worsening in sexual potency measured with IIEF-5 (p = 0.356) or 
prostatic symptoms measured at IPSS (p = 0.462) were recorded comparing 
pre-treatment condition vs one-year follow-up. Compared with baseline, 
prostate-specific antigen was significantly reduced at one-year follow-up (3.7 ± 
1.1 vs 7.9 ± 4.1 ng/mL; p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Although whole gland therapies remain the gold standard treatment 
for PCa, our results indicate that the SoracteLiteTM system for focal laser 
ablation, as a very preliminary step, appears to offer a short-term oncologic 
control of PCa with negligible side effects."
777,"OBJECTIVES: Focal therapies (FTs) are promising techniques for the treatment of 
localized prostate cancer. We assessed the medium-term oncological outcomes of 
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) treated with HIFU or cryotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred and fifty consecutive patients with 
intermediate-risk PCa, treated between 2009 and 2018 at a single center were 
included. Primary study outcome was failure-free survival (FFS), defined as 
absence of additional treatment, systemic progression or prostate cancer related 
death.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven (25%) patients underwent cryotherapy and 113 (75%) HIFU. 
Median age was 69 (IQR 62-72) years, with 36 (24%) presenting palpable disease 
on rectal examination, and median total PSA of 7.85 (IQR 5.75-10.62) ng/mL. 
Patients were followed for a median of 61 (IQR 48-82) months. FFS at 2 and 4 
years was of 75.6% and 53.6%, respectively. Survival from whole gland or 
systematic treatment at 2 and 4 years was of 78.9% and 53.9%, respectively. 
Patients with FFS presented lower total PSA nadir (1.89 vs 3.25 ng/mL, p < 
0.001), higher % PSA reduction at 3 months (66.1% vs 49.3%, p < 0.001), and at 
nadir (75.5% vs 55.8%, p < 0.001). Other characteristics such has the treatment 
modality, age, prostate size, initial total PSA, cT stage, International Society 
of Urological Pathology (ISUP), tumor location and biopsy results by region did 
not differ between patients failing and not failing FT. Complications were 
uncommon (13%), with only onr (1%) patient having Clavien-Dindo grade > II. No 
deaths due to treatment were registered.
CONCLUSIONS: At medium-term, FTs for intermediate-risk PCa presented good 
oncological results, with an excellent safety profile."
778,"OBJECTIVES: Localized very high-risk prostate cancer (VHR PCa) has long suffered 
from the inex-istence of good lymph node staging methods other than invasive 
surgery, as computed tomogra-phy has low sensitivity for nodal disease. With the 
rising use of positron emission tomography (PET), it is clinically meaningful to 
know its value for these patients. Our goal was to evaluate the real-life 
diagnostic accuracy of PET Choline in nodal staging, comparing it with the gold 
standard of extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from a high-volume center, including 
patients with VHR PCa according to current NCCN guidelines who underwent 
community 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT; followed by ro-botic assisted laparoscopic 
prostatectomy (RALP) and ePLND between 2010 and 2021.
RESULTS: We included 44 patients and 88 lymph node regions. Among those, 14/44 
(31.8%) patients and 20/88 (22.7%) regions had nodal disease present on 
definitive pathology. In comparison with ePLND, we found a sensitivity of 64.3% 
(95% CI, 39.2-89.4%), specificity of 83.3% (95% CI, 70.0- 96.7%), PPV of 64.3% 
(95% CI, 39.2-89.4%), and NPV of 83.3% (95% CI, 70.0-96.7%) for nodal disease on 
a patient-based analysis; and sensitivity of 35.0% (95% CI, 14.1-60.0%), 
specificity of 88.2% (95% CI, 80.6-95.9%), PPV of 46.7% (95% CI, 21.4-71.9%), 
and NPV of 82.2% (95% CI, 73.4-91.0%) on a region-based analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In our view 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT doesn't meet the criteria to 
be a standard exam for pre-operative staging for patients with VHR PCa, mostly 
due to its low sensitivity. However, other radiotracers should continue to be 
investigated in this setting."
779,"To the Editor, Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common cause of lower 
urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in elderly males. The current guidelines recommend 
the use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI) to treat males with 
moderate-to-severe LUTS and an enlarged prostate. Combination therapy with an 
alpha blocker and a 5ARI has proven effective at ameliorating LUTS and reducing 
the total prostate volume (TPV) and the risk of the disease progression."
780,"BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms of frequency, urgency and urge 
incontinence are frequently associated with known neurological diseases like 
multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury (SCI), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
stroke.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to review the efficacy of pharmacological 
and non-pharmacological treatments for neurogenic overactive bladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched two electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) 
for randomized controlled trials focusing on pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological medical treatments for overactive bladder symptoms 
associated with neurological diseases published up to 30 April 2022.
RESULTS: A total of 157 articles were retrieved; 94 were selected by title and 
abstract screening; after removal of 17 duplicates, 77 records were evaluated by 
full-text examination. Sixty-two studies were finally selected. The articles 
selected for review focused on the following interventions: anticholinergics (n 
= 9), mirabegron (n = 5), comparison of different drugs (n = 3), cannabinoids (n 
= 2), intravesical instillations (n = 3), botulinum toxin (n = 16), 
transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS) (n = 6), acupuncture (n = 2), 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS (n = 4), pelvic floor muscle 
training (PFMT) (n = 10), others (n = 2). Anticholinergics were more effective 
than placebo in decreasing the number of daily voids in patients with PD (mean 
difference [MD]- 1.16, 95 % CI - 1.80 to - 0.52, 2 trials, 86 patients, p < 
0.004), but no significant difference from baseline was found for incontinence 
episodes and nocturia. Mirabegron was more effective than placebo in increasing 
the cystometric capacity in patients with MS (mean difference [MD] 89.89 mL, 95 
% CI 29.76 to 150.01, 2 trials, 98 patients, p < 0.003) but no significant 
difference was observed for symptom scores and bladder diary parameters. TTNS 
was more effective than its sham-control in decreasing the number of nocturia 
episodes (MD -1.40, 95 % CI -2.39 to -0.42, 2 trials, 53 patients, p < 0.005) 
but no significant changes of OAB symptom scores were reported. PFMT was more 
effective than conservative advice in decreasing the ICIQ symptom score (MD, 
-1.12, 95 % CI -2.13 to -0.11, 2 trials, 91 patients, p = 0.03), although the 
number of incontinence episodes was not significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the meta-analysis demonstrate a moderate efficacy of 
all considered treatments without proving the superiority of one therapy over 
the others. Combination treatment using different pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological therapies could achieve the best clinical efficacy due to 
the favorable combination of the different mechanisms of action. This could be 
associated with fewer side effects due to drug dosage reduction. These data are 
only provisional and should be considered with caution, due to the few studies 
included in metaanalysis and to the small number of patients."
781,"Pathogen transmission mode is a key determinant of epidemiological outcomes. 
Theory shows that host density can influence the spread of pathogens 
differentially depending on their mode of transmission. Host density could 
therefore play an important role in selecting for pathogen transmission mode. We 
test theoretical expectations using floral arrays of the alpine carnation 
Dianthus pavonius in field experiments of spore dispersal of the anther-smut 
fungus, Microbotryum, by vector (pollinator)-based floral transmission and 
passive aerial transmission at a range of host densities. Pollinators deposited 
fewer spores per plant at high host density than at lower density (ranging from 
0.2 to 2m spacing between plants), and vector-based spore deposition declined 
more steeply with distance from diseased plant sources at higher densities. In 
contrast, while aerial spore deposition declined with distance from the diseased 
source, the steepness of this decline was independent of host density. Our study 
indicates that the amount and distance of vector-based transmission are likely 
to be a non-monotonic function of host density as a result of vector behavior, 
which is not readily encapsulated by fixed dispersal functions. We conclude that 
the spatial spread of pathogens by vectors is likely to be greater at lower and 
intermediate densities, whereas spatial spread of aerially transmitted pathogens 
would be greater at high densities. These contrasting patterns could lead to a 
differential importance of each transmission mode in terms of its contribution 
to subsequent infections across host densities. This article is protected by

782,"BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with a 2 per 100 000 
incidence rate in the world. Overall survival (OS) of patients in stage I-II 
disease is around 80%, whereas OS of patients in stage III-IVB disease drops to 
60%, implying the importance of diagnosis to reduce NPC mortality. However, more 
than 70% patients of NPC were diagnosed at advanced stages (stage III and IV) in 
clinics, and it definitely contributes to little substantial improvement in the 
5-year survival rates although NPC is sensitive to radio-and chemotherapy. 
Hence, development of novel biomarkers and targetable genes in NPC is eagerly 
awaited.
METHODS: We had analyzed the dataset GSE12452 and found hundreds of genes 
trans-activated in NPC. Among them, this study focused on PARP-1 binding protein 
(PARPBP) whose overexpression was also validated in GSE13597 and GSE53819 
datasets.
RESULTS: Knockdown of PARPBP significantly reduced cell viability in NPC and 
also identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes including 377 
downregulated and 518 upregulated genes in HONE-1 cells with stably knockdown 
PARPBP. Furthermore, PARPBP might promote cell migration and invasion in NPC 
through positive regulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2C (UBE2C).
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the aberrant expression of PARPBP in NPC, 
and imply its importance in nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis which further opens up 
the possibility of PARPBP as a novel diagnostic biomarker for NPC therapy."
783,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous and complex disease with limited 
treatment options. Targeting transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and programmed 
death ligand 1 pathways may enhance antitumor efficacy. Bintrafusp alfa is a 
first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain 
of TGF-β receptor II (a TGF-β ""trap"") fused to a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody 
blocking programmed cell death ligand 1. We report results from an expansion 
cohort of a phase I study (NCT02517398) in patients with heavily pretreated 
advanced CRC treated with bintrafusp alfa. As of May 15, 2020, 32 patients with 
advanced CRC had received bintrafusp alfa for a median duration of 7.1 weeks. 
The objective response rate was 3.1% and the disease control rate was 6.3% (1 
partial response, 1 stable disease); 2 patients were not evaluable. The safety 
profile was consistent with previously reported data."
784,"BACKGROUND: Pathogenic variants in human MAB21L2 result in microphthalmia, 
anophthalmia and coloboma. The exact molecular function of MAB21L2 is currently 
unknown. We conducted a series of yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) experiments to 
determine protein interactomes of normal human and zebrafish MAB21L2/mab21l2 as 
well as human disease-associated variant MAB21L2-p.(Arg51Gly) using human adult 
retina and zebrafish embryo libraries.
RESULTS: These screens identified klhl31, tnpo1, TNPO2/tnpo2, KLC2/klc2, and 
SPTBN1/sptbn1 as co-factors of MAB21L2/mab21l2. Several factors, including hspa8 
and hspa5, were found to interact with MAB21L2-p.Arg51Gly but not wild-type 
MAB21L2/mab21l2 in Y2H screens. Further analyses via 1-by-1 Y2H assays, 
co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry revealed that both normal and 
variant MAB21L2 interact with HSPA5 and HSPA8. In situ hybridization detected 
co-expression of hspa5 and hspa8 with mab21l2 during eye development in 
zebrafish. Examination of zebrafish mutant hspa8hi138Tg identified reduced hspa8 
expression associated with severe ocular developmental defects, including small 
eye, coloboma, and anterior segment dysgenesis. To investigate the effects of 
hspa8 deficiency on the mab21l2Arg51_Phe52del allele, corresponding zebrafish 
double mutants were generated and found to be more severely affected than single 
mutant lines.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies heat shock proteins as interacting partners of 
MAB21L2/mab21l2 and suggest a role for this interaction in vertebrate eye 
development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
785,"Unsuppressed HIV viremia damages immunity and increases the risk for secondary 
HIV transmission. Successful engagement of persons with HIV (PWH) into care 
resulting in viral suppression is vital. PWH already engaged in care, who, after 
achieving viral suppression, experience viral breakthrough episodes (VBEs) with 
a sequence of suppressed/unsuppressed/suppressed viral loads remain problematic. 
We examined the frequency and outcomes of PWH experiencing VBE. HIV care is 
provided at no cost to all patients under Alberta's universal health program. 
All PWH followed at Southern Alberta Clinic, Canada, with two or more viral load 
tests between January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2020, were evaluated. 
Sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables were determined along with 
health outcomes (CD4 levels, HIV-related hospitalizations, and HIV/AIDS-related 
mortality). Descriptive and multi-variable analyses were performed comparing PWH 
with and without VBEs. Of 2096 PWH, 386 (18%) experienced one or more VBEs. A 
higher risk of VBEs was seen in adjusted analyses in those diagnosed age ≤40 
years. Increased risk of VBE was seen with injection drug use (46%) and in 
heterosexuals (56%) compared with MSM. Experience of intimate partner violence, 
unstable housing, homelessness, and past incarceration also increased risks by 
36%, 44% 79%, and 51%, respectively. PWH with VBEs experienced lower CD4 counts 
(median -417/mm3 vs. 576/mm3), higher rates of HIV-related hospitalizations (16% 
vs. 5%), and a 67% increased risk of death (95% confidence interval 1.17-2.39) 
over the study period. Nearly 20% of all PWH, after achieving viral suppression, 
experienced VBEs. Distinct clinical, lifestyle, and life experiences predict PWH 
at greatest risk for more than one VBEs. Serious negative health outcomes of 
VBEs were identified, suggesting that novel customized care programming is 
required for PWH at greatest risk."
786,"Proteins can aggregate into disordered aggregates or ordered assemblies such as 
amyloid fibrils. These two distinct phases serve differing roles in function and 
disease. How protein sequence determines the preferred phase is unknown. Here we 
establish a statistical mechanical disorder-to-order transition condition for 
compact polymer aggregates, including proteins. The theory produces a simple 
universal equation determining the favored phase as a function of temperature, 
polymer length, and interaction energy variance. We show that the 
sequence-dependent energy variance is efficiently calculated using atomistic 
simulations, so that the theory has no adjustable parameters. The equation 
accurately predicts experimental length-dependent crystallization temperatures 
of synthetic polymers. The equation also predicts that all protein sequences 
that aggregate will also favor ordering. Consequently, energy must be expended 
to maintain the steady-state disordered phase if it is not kinetically 
metastable on physiological timescales. More broadly, the theory suggests that 
aggregates of organic polymers will generally tend to order on habitable 
planets. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
787,"High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is a biomolecule that acts as an 
alerting signal of late sepsis by accelerating the production of proinflammatory 
cytokines, and eventually leads to various inflammation-related symptoms. When 
released into plasma at high concentration, it disrupts precise diagnosis and 
prognosis and worsens the survival of patients with systemic inflammatory 
conditions. Jujuboside B (JB) is a natural compound pressed from the seed of 
Zizyphi Spinosi Semen, which is known for its medical efficacies in treating 
various conditions such as hyperlipidemia, hypoxia, and platelet aggregation. 
Nevertheless, the medicinal activity of JB on HMGB1-involved inflammatory 
response in vascular cells in the human body is still ambiguous. Therefore, we 
hypothesized that JB could regulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
dynamics of HMGB1 and its mediated cascade in inflammatory responses in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In this experiment, JB and HMGB1 were 
administered in that order. In vitro and in vivo permeability, and cell 
viability, adhesion, and excavation of leukocytes, development of cell adhesion 
molecules, and lastly production of proinflammatory substances were investigated 
on human endothelial cells and mouse disease models to investigate the efficacy 
of JB in inflammatory condition. JB substantially blocked the translocation of 
HMGB1 from HUVECs and controlled HMGB1-induced adhesion and extravasation of the 
neutrophils through LPS-treated HUVECs. Moreover, JB decreased the formation of 
HMGB1 receptors and continually prevented HMGB1-induced proinflammatory 
mechanisms by blocking transcription of nuclear factor-κB and synthesis of tumor 
necrosis factor-α. In conclusion, JB demonstrated preventive effects against 
inflammatory pathologies and showed the potential to be a candidate substance 
for various inflammatory diseases by regulating HMGB1-mediated cellular 
signaling."
788,"Colletotrichum fungi could cause anthracnose, a destructive disease in tea-oil 
trees. The sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) tebuconazole has been widely 
used in controlling plant diseases for many years. However, the baseline 
sensitivity of Colletotrichum isolates on tea-oil trees to tebuconazole has not 
been determined. In this study, the sensitivity of 117 Colletotrichum isolates 
from tea-oil tree of 7 provinces in southern China to tebuconazole was tested. 
The mean effective concentration resulted in 50% mycelial growth inhibition 
(EC50) was 0.7625 μg/mL. The EC50 of 100 isolates (83%) were lower than 1 μg/mL, 
20 isolates (17%) were higher than 1 μg/mL, which implied the resistance has 
already occurred in Colletotrichum isolates on tea-oil trees. The EC50 values of 
the most resistant and sensitive isolates (named Ca-R and Cc-S1 respectively) 
were 1.8848 and 0.1561 μg/mL respectively. The resistance mechanism was also 
investigated in this study. Gene replacement experiment indicated that CYP51A/B 
gene of resistant isolates Ca-R and Cf-R1 cannot confer Cc-S1 fully resistance 
to DMI fungicides, though three point mutants, Cc-S1CYP51A-T306A and 
Cc-S1CYP51A-R478K exhibited decreased sensitivity to DMI fungicides. This result 
suggested that resistance of Colletotrichum isolates was partly caused by 
mutations in CYP51A. Moreover, expression level of CYP51A/B was almost identical 
among Ca-R, Cf-R1, Cc-S1 and Cc-S1CYP51A point mutants, which indicated that the 
resistance was irrelevant to the expression level of CYP51A, and other 
non-target-based resistance mechanism may exist. Our results could help to guide 
the application of DMI fungicide and be useful for investigating the mechanism 
of resistance."
789,"The plant pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a major threat to 
agriculture and the environment worldwide. Recent devastating outbreaks in 
Europe highlight the potential of this pathogen to cause emergent diseases. Xf 
subsp. multiplex ESVL and IVIA5901 strains that belong to sequence type (ST) 6 
were isolated from almond orchards within the outbreak area in Alicante province 
(Spain). Both strains share more than 99% of the chromosomal sequences), but the 
ESVL strain harbours two plasmids (pXF64-Hb_ESVL and pUCLA-ESVL). Here, 
virulence phenotypes and genome content were compared between both strains, 
using three strains from USA as a reference for the phenotypic analyses. 
Experiments in microfluidic chambers, used as simulation of xylem vessels, 
showed that twitching motility was absent in the IVIA5901 strain, while the ESVL 
strain had reduced twitching motility. Both Spanish strains had less biofilm 
formation, cell aggregation and lower virulence in tobacco compared with USA 
reference strains. Genome analysis of the two plasmids from ESVL revealed 51 
unique coding sequences (CDS) that were absent in the chromosome of IVIA5901. 
Comparison of the chromosomes of both strains showed some unique CDS and SNPs in 
each strain with potential deleterious mutations. Genomic differences found in 
genes previously associated with adhesion and motility might explain the 
differences in the phenotypic traits studied. Although additional studies are 
necessary to infer the potential role of Xf plasmids, our results indicate that 
the presence of plasmids should be considered in the study of the mechanisms of 
pathogenicity and adaptation in Xf to new environments."
790,"BACKGROUND: It is known that the microenvironmental cytokine IFN-γ provides a 
survival advantage for CLL cells. However, the mechanisms involved in this 
effect have not been properly investigated.
METHODS: Herein, we conducted a comprehensive screening of the effects of IFN-γ 
on signaling pathways and gene expression profile in CLL cells by using western 
blotting, RT-qPCR and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).
RESULTS: We found that IFN-γ not only activated the pro-survival STAT3, but also 
activated the AKT and ERK signaling pathways. RNA-seq analysis showed that IFN-γ 
stimulation changed the expression profiles of more than 500 genes, with 391 
being up-regulated and 123 down-regulated. These genes are involved in numerous 
biological processes, including anti-apoptosis, cell migration and 
proliferation. IFN-γ significantly up-regulated the expression of CD38, BCL6, 
CXCL9, BCL2A1, SCOS3, IL-10, HGF, EGFR, THBS-1, FN1 and MUC1, which encode 
proteins potentially associated with disease progression, worse prognosis or 
poor response to treatment. Blocking JAK1/2 or STAT3 signal by specific 
inhibitors affected the expression of most genes, suggesting a pivotal role of 
the JAK1/2-STAT3 pathway in IFN-γ pro-survival effects in CLL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that IFN-γ regulates a complex pro-survival 
signal network in CLL through JAK1/2-STAT3, which provides a rational 
explanation for IFN-γ promoting CLL cells survival and drug resistance. This

791,"Three-dimensional nondestructive, nanoresolution, and in situ visualization of 
protein spatial localization in a large, thick single cell remains challenging. 
In this study, we designed a multifunctional iron oxide (Fe@BFK) nanoprobe that 
possesses fluorescence and hard X-ray imaging signals. This probe can 
specifically target the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein 
and help optimize the label condition and selection of suitable samples for 
X-ray imaging. Combining 30 nm resolution synchrotron radiation hard X-ray 
nanocomputed tomography and the X-ray-sensitive Fe@BFK nanoprobe, a 3D 
localization of HER2 on SK-BR-3 cells was obtained for the first time. HER2 was 
mainly localized and cluster-distributed on the cell membrane with a 
heterogeneous pattern. This study provides a novel method for the in situ and 
nondestructive synchrotron radiation imaging of the desired protein localization 
in large, thick cells and evaluation of the true cellular distribution of a 
nanoprobe with high resolution."
792,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well-known as a kind of autoimmune disease, which 
brings unbearable pain to the patients by multiple organ complications besides 
arthritis. To date, RA can be hardly cured, but early diagnosis and standard 
treatment can relieve symptoms and pain. Therefore, an effective tool to assist 
the early diagnosis of RA deserves considerable attention. On account of the 
overexpressed ONOO- during the early stage of RA, a near-infrared (NIR) 
receptor, Lyso-Cy, is proposed in this work by linker chemistry to expand the 
conjugated rhodamine framework by cyanine groups. Contributed by the 
pH-sensitive spiral ring in rhodamine, receptor Lyso-Cy has been found to be 
workable in lysosomes specifically, which was confirmed by the pH-dependent 
spectra with a narrow responding region and a well-calculated pKa value of 5.81. 
We presented an excellent ratiometric sensing protocol for ONOO- in an acidic 
environment, which was also available for targeting ONOO- in lysosomes 
selectively. This innovative dual-targeting responsive design is expected to be 
promising for assisting RA diagnosis at an early stage with respect to the joint 
inflammatory model established in this work at the organism level."
793,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Currently, there are still no definitive consensus in the 
treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). This study aimed to build a 
clinical decision support tool based on machine learning using the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and the data from the Fifth 
Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital in China.
METHODS: 4,398 eligible patients from the SEER database and 504 eligible 
patients from the hospital data, who presented with histologically proven iCCA, 
were enrolled for modeling by cross-validation based on machine learning. All 
the models were trained using the open-source Python library scikit-survival 
version 0.16.0. Shapley additive explanations method was used to help clinicians 
better understand the obtained results. Permutation importance was calculated 
using library ELI5.
RESULTS: All involved treatment modalities could contribute to a better 
prognosis. Three models were derived and tested using different data sources, 
with concordance indices of 0.67, 0.69, and 0.73, respectively. The prediction 
results were consistent with those under actual situations involving randomly 
selected patients. Model 2, trained using the hospital data, was selected to 
develop an online tool, due to its advantage in predicting short-term prognosis.
CONCLUSION: The prediction model and tool established in this study can be 
applied to predict the prognosis of iCCA after treatment by inputting the 
patient's clinical parameters or TNM stages and treatment options, thus 
contributing to optimal clinical decisions.KEY MESSAGESA prognostic model 
related to disease staging and treatment mode was conducted using the method of 
machine learning, based on the big data of multi centers.The online calculator 
can predict the short-term survival prognosis of intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma, thus, help to make the best clinical decision.The online 
calculator built to calculate the mortality risk and overall survival can be 
easily obtained and applied."
794,"In June 2021, bacterial stem rot-like symptoms were observed on the stems and 
leaves of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus cv. 'Zaojia') in Pingyu County, 
Zhumadian City, Henan Province, China (32.44N 114.24E), which showed brown to 
dark brown lesions on the stems (Fig. 1A). The stems then became scorched, and 
the leaves showed necrotic lesions with small water-soaked spots (Fig. 1B). 
Watermelon is a very important economic plant in this small county, where the 
watermelon planting area accounts for about 15% of the arable land area. 
Approximately 2 hectares of 'Zaojia' have been investigated, and the disease 
incidence rates were almost 20~30%, thus, causing severe economic losses. Ten 
symptomatic watermelon stems and leaves were randomly collected based on the 
typical symptoms, brought into the Lab and used to isolate the pathogen. Each 
infected tissue was excised and cut into small pieces (about 5 mm×5 mm) and 
surface disinfected with 1% NaClO for 3 min. The pieces were then rinsed three 
times in sterile distilled water (SDW) and dried by airing. These pieces (4-5 
pieces per sample) were macerated in 200 μL SDW for 60 s in a sterile mortar and 
pestle. A volume of 5 μL suspensions of each sample were streaked onto two LB 
agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 28 °C in the dark. After incubation, the 
colonies on LB agar plate were small, round, raised, white to cream-colored, and 
had smooth margins (Fig. 2). Two strains from each plate were selected. The 
genomic DNA of all 40 strains was extracted using a Bacterial Genomic DNA 
Extraction Kit D1600 (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, 
China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene 
(27F:5'-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3', /1492R: 5'-CTA CGG CTA CCT TGT TAC 
GA-3'), and the three housekeeping genes, including gyrB (Trantas et al., 2013), 
icdA and proA (Ma et al., 2007), were amplified. Sequence analysis showed that 
40 strains shared the same sequence, so only one sequence was submitted into 
GenBanK.The 16s rDNA partial sequences (SUB12134746) shared 100% similarity with 
E.mori (CP084692.1), and the gyrB (OP676246), icdA (OP676248) and proA 
(OP676247) genes shared 98.67%, 99.39% and 97.99% homology with those of E. mori 
(CP084692.1), respectively. Besides, the phylogenetic tree analysis based on 
multi-housekeeping gene joint gryB-icdA-proA showed that 
E.mori（OP676246-OP676248- OP676247）from watermelon was culsterd with the E.mori 
(CP084692.1) from South Korea and E.mori (CP055276.1) from kiwifruit (Fig. 3). 
Thus, E.mori was confirmed to be the pathogen responsible for bacterial soft rot 
of watermelon in this study. To confirm the pathogenicity, 15-day-old healthy 
cv. 'Zaojia' watermelon seedlings were inoculated by spraying all the seedlings 
with a bacterial suspension (1×10 8 CFU mL-1) at an incubation temperature of 28 
°C and 70% relative humidity, and sterile distilled liquid LB medium was applied 
as a negative control treatment. Three times were conducted for the isolate, and 
each time included nine watermelon plants. After 10 days, only the inoculated 
cotyledons and leaves with the bacterial suspension showed bacterial leaf spots 
that resembled those observed on naturally infected watermelon cotyledons and 
leaves (Fig. 4A-C), whereas the control plants remained asymptomatic (Fig. 4D). 
Simultaneously, the watermelon stems were inoculated with the bacterium in 
vitro. Each stem was slightly wounded with a metal sponge and then sprayed with 
the bacterial suspension (108 CFU mL-1) of each isolate, and the experiment was 
repeated three times. Water-soaked symptoms were visible on the stems (Fig. 4E), 
while the control plants remained asymptomatic (Fig. 4F). The strains were then 
successfully re-isolated and identified by sequence analyses of their 16S 
ribosomal RNA gene and gyrB, icdA and proA genes. Therefore, the inoculation 
experiment of the isolatedbacterium fulfilled Koch's postulates. Previously, E. 
mori has been reported to cause bacterial wilt on white mulberry (Morus alba L.) 
(Zhu et al. 2022), peach fruit (Prunus persica) (Ahmad et al. 2021) and 
kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa [A. Chev.] CF Liang et AR Ferguson) (Zhang et al. 
2021). To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. mori causing bacterial 
soft rot on watermelon in world."
795,"The United States has one of the highest cumulative mortalities of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has reached 1 million deaths as of May 19th, 2022. 
Understanding which community and hospital factors contributed to disparities in 
COVID-19 mortality is important to inform public health strategies. This study 
aimed to explore the potential relationship between hospital service area (1) 
community (ie, health professional shortage areas, market competition, and 
uninsured percentage) and (2) hospital (ie, teaching, system, and ownership 
status) characteristics (2013-2018) on publicly available COVD-19 (February to 
October 2020) mortality data. The study included 2514 health service areas and 
used multilevel mixed-effects linear model to account for the multilevel data 
structure. The outcome measure was the number of COVID-19 deaths. This study 
found that public health, as opposed to acute care provision, was associated 
with community health and, ultimately, COVID-19 mortality. The study found that 
population characteristics including more uninsured greater proportion of those 
over 65 years, more diverse populations, and larger populations were all 
associated with a higher rate of death. In addition, communities with fewer 
hospitals were associated with a lower rate of death. When considering region in 
the United States, the west region showed a higher rate of death than all other 
regions. The association between some community characteristics and higher 
COVID-19 deaths demonstrated that access to health care, either for COVID-19 
infection or worse health from higher disease burden, is strongly associated 
with COVID-19 deaths. Thus, to be better prepared for potential future 
pandemics, a greater emphasis on public health infrastructure is needed."
796,"Increasing female age is accompanied by a corresponding fall in her fertility. 
This decline is influenced by a variety of factors over an individual's life 
course including background genetics, local environment and diet. Studying both 
coding and non-coding RNAs of the embryo could aid our understanding of the 
causes and/or effects of the physiological processes accompanying the decline 
including the differential expression of sub-cellular biomarkers indicative of 
various diseases. The current study is a post-hoc analysis of the expression of 
trophectoderm RNA data derived from a previous high throughput study. Its main 
aim is to determine the characteristics and potential functionalities that 
characterize long non-coding RNAs. As reported previously, a maternal 
age-related component is potentially implicated in implantation success. 
Trophectoderm samples representing the full range of maternal reproductive ages 
were considered in relation to embryonic implantation potential, trophectoderm 
transcriptome dynamics and reproductive maternal age. The long non-coding RNA 
(lncRNA) biomarkers identified here are consistent with the activities of 
embryo-endometrial crosstalk, developmental competency and implantation and 
share common characteristics with markers of neoplasia/cancer invasion. 
Corresponding genes for expressed lncRNAs were more active in the blastocysts of 
younger women are associated with metabolic pathways including cholesterol 
biosynthesis and steroidogenesis."
797,"Identifying patients at risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
Alzheimer disease (AD) remains challenging in clinical practice, even as 
scientific understanding of dementia advances generally. That said, successfully 
navigating the associated differential diagnosis in AD is essential, as various 
causes of cognitive impairment require different treatment strategies. In recent 
years, the armamentarium in AD has expanded with regulatory approval of a 
disease-modifying therapy-aducanumab-and may be shifting away from symptomatic 
treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Concurrently, the 
role of biomarkers in AD is increasing, and these entities may soon play a 
greater role in determining patient eligibility for prophylactic interventions 
and the likelihood of disease progression. As the standard of care progresses, 
clinicians should educate patients and their care providers on the implications 
of these advances and reinforce lifestyle changes that can delay or prevent the 
onset of disease in those at risk of AD. In doing so, care providers can deliver 
the best care possible."
798,"In recent years, scientific understanding of the pathophysiology underlying 
Alzheimer disease (AD) has advanced substantially. Among the most transformative 
of discoveries is the existence of biomarkers, such as Aβ42, which can manifest 
in the central nervous system decades before the onset of disease-associated 
dementia. By detecting these biological entities early, clinicians can close 
diagnostic delays and substantially improve outcomes for patients with AD. With 
prompt news of a diagnosis, patients can initiate long-term planning and devise 
goals for treatment while their cognition is relatively intact. To differentiate 
among different forms of dementia, neurologists and supporting clinicians should 
additionally capitalize on the availability of validated screening tools. 
Increasingly adopted, tests such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment yield 
highly sensitive, specific findings that can improve the standard of care. These 
results, when paired with insights gleaned from patient histories and clinical 
examinations, can further inform treatment-decision making and help ensure that 
patients receive care tailored to their unique circumstances and needs."
799,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can progress over time and cause renal 
replacement therapy. Studies showed an association between metabolic syndrome 
(MetS) and CKD. Current evidence is from cross sectional studies. There is a 
need for robust data from big prospective cohort studies with long-term 
follow-up. This study investigated the association between CKD and MetS after 
18 years of follow-up.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Among 15,255 participants aged ≥20 years at baseline 
(1999-2005), after exclusion of CKD, cancer, use of corticosteroid, 8987 
participants entered the study and followed at a three-year cycle up to 2018. 
All participants were divided into five subgroups: (1) MetS free, (2) MetS+ 
(DM+, HTN-) (3) MetS+ (DM-, HTN+) (4) MetS+ (DM+, HTN+) (5) MetS+ (DM-, HTN-).
RESULT: At baseline the mean age of the participants was 39.8±13.3 y; 4996 
(55.6%) were females. CKD was developed in 2,038 (22.7 %) subjects during 
18 years of follow-up, of whom 1,107 had Mets. After adjusting for the 
confounding variables, MetS (DM+, HTN+) subgroup had the highest risk of CKD 
(HR=1.51, 95 % CI=1.32-1.71). MetS subjects with five components had higher 
incidence rate of CKD (HR=1.43, 95% CI= 1.22-1.68). There was no association 
between high waist circumference (WC) (HR=1.08, 95% CI=0.99-1.19) and 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (HR=1.07, 95% CI=0.98-1.18) with CKD.
CONCLUSION: CKD significantly develops in patients with MetS. Metabolic syndrome 
was associated with chronic kidney disease incidence at long term follow-up. 
Hypertension, diabetes and age were strong indicators, while abdominal obesity 
and reduced HDL were not associated with the incidence of CKD."
800,"While brown fat is strongly associated with a constellation of cardiometabolic 
benefits in animal models and humans, it has also been tied to cancer cachexia. 
In humans, cancer-associated cachexia increases mortality, raising the 
possibility that brown fat in this context may be associated with increased 
cancer death. However, the effect of brown fat on cancer-associated cachexia and 
survival in humans remains unclear. Here, we retrospectively identify patients 
with and without brown fat on fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission 
tomography (PET) scans obtained as part of routine cancer care and assemble a 
cohort to address these questions. We did not find an association between brown 
fat status and cachexia. Furthermore, we did not observe an association between 
brown fat and increased mortality in patients with cachexia. Our analyses 
controlled for confounding factors including age at cancer diagnosis, sex, body 
mass index, cancer site, cancer stage, outdoor temperature, comorbid conditions 
(heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular disease), and beta-blocker use. Taken together, 
our results suggest that brown fat is not linked to cancer-associated cachexia 
and does not worsen overall survival in patients with cachexia."
801,"Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by loss of tear 
film homeostasis with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 5% to 50%. In DED, 
dysfunction of the ocular structures that create and regulate the tear film 
components-including the lacrimal glands, meibomian glands, cornea, and 
conjunctiva-causes a qualitative and/or quantitative tear deficiency with 
resultant tear film instability and hyperosmolarity. This initiates a vicious 
cycle of ocular surface inflammation and damage that may ultimately impair the 
quality of life and vision of affected patients. Many factors can contribute to 
the development of DED, including ocular and systemic diseases, topical and 
systemic medications, and environmental conditions. Because DED is a chronic 
disorder, treatment is most often long term and may utilize both pharmacologic 
and nonpharmacologic interventions to address all etiologic components. The 
long-term management of DED can be challenging and most often should involve eye 
care specialist referral. However, primary care clinicians (PCCs) are often the 
first points of contact for patients with DED and importantly provide initial 
diagnosis and preliminary patient education about the disease process. 
Consideration of DED is also vital for the practice of various specialties due 
to the large number of comorbidities and medications that can contribute to DED 
pathogenesis and progression. Therefore, it is important that PCCs and clinical 
specialists be aware of the etiology of DED and its available therapeutic 
options. This manuscript provides an overview of DED pathophysiology and 
treatment and discusses specific considerations regarding DED management for 
PCCs and clinical specialists.Key messagesSuccessful management of dry eye 
disease often requires the use of various pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic 
therapies, as well as environmental and lifestyle modifications, to mitigate the 
underlying etiologies and restore tear film homeostasis.Primary care clinicians 
play an essential role in dry eye disease management by establishing a 
diagnosis, educating patients about the disorder, and providing referrals to eye 
care specialists for initiation of specialized treatment and long-term 
follow-up.Primary care clinicians and clinical specialists should consider 
prescribing medications with fewer ocular surface effects whenever possible in 
patients at risk for or with existing dry eye disease."
802,"INTRODUCTION: Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory 
condition characterized by sicca syndrome, musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue. 
Extra-glandular manifestations are common and there is a markedly increased risk 
of lymphoma development. SS is associated with high health-economic burden 
driven largely by the symptom burden on patients. Currently, there is no 
approved disease-modifying treatment and management is based on empirical 
evidence. Progress in the understanding of SS pathogenesis has led to an 
expanding portfolio of more targeted therapies under development.
AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the key development in targeted biological 
therapies in SS including emerging targets. It also highlights the challenges in 
therapeutic development in SS such as disease heterogeneity and defining 
appropriate disease assessment tools to evaluate therapeutic efficacy.
EXPERT OPINION: Early trials in SS failed to meet their primary outcomes which 
may in part due to the use of inappropriate or insensitive study endpoints. 
Recent trials targeting B-cells, B-T cell co-stimulation and IFN signaling have 
shown promising results. Development of composite endpoints including patient 
reported outcomes and objective disease measure may provide a more holistic 
approach to disease assessment. The impact of these new tools on therapeutic 
development that benefit patients remains to be fully evaluated."
803,"OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is rare heterogeneous disorder 
characterized by red blood cell (RBC) destruction via auto-antibodies, and after 
RBC is destroyed, proinflammatory danger-associated molecular patterns including 
extracellular hemoglobin, heme, and iron which causing cell injury. And 
oxidative stress represents one of the most significant effects of chronic 
hemolysis. Jianpishengxue keli can improve the symptoms of anemia patients with 
kidney disease and tumors and are beneficial in promoting recovery from chronic 
inflammation. Therefore, it is presumed that Jianpishengxue keli can improve the 
symptoms of AIHA. We aimed to investigate iron metabolism in AIHA and effects of 
Jianpishengxue keli on AIHA murine model.
METHODS: Nineteen hemolytic episode AIHA patients, 10 remission patients and 10 
healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Serum hepcidin, ferritin and 
other related indicators of iron metabolism were measured. Mouse models of AIHA 
were established and received high, medium, or low doses of Jianpishengxue keli 
by gavage daily for 14 and 28 days respectively. The level of RBCs, Hb, 
bilirubin, LDH, hepcidin, and the expression level of hepcidin mRNA, and hepatic 
ferroportin 1(FPN1) protein were evaluated.
RESULTS: Serum hepcidin in hemolytic episode AIHA patients and remission 
patients were significantly higher than that in HCs (p = 0.0083 and p = 0.0473, 
respectively). Serum ferritin in hemolytic AIHA patients was significantly 
higher than that in HCs (p = 0.008). Serum transferrin saturation levels are 
increased in patients with AIHA[ (57.21 ± 8.96) %]. EPO in hemolytic group was 
higher than that in healthy control (p＜0.05). In AIHA mouse models, IBIL 
decreased after 14 days of high dose drug intervention. After 28 days, TBIL and 
IBIL both significantly decreased in all dose groups and LDH significantly 
decreased in the medium-and high-dose groups. Body weight improved, and the 
level of RBCs, Hb and hepcidin in the high-dose group returned to normal. After 
14 and 28 days of intervention, hepatic hepcidin mRNA in all dose group 
significantly decreased. Hepatic FPN1 protein which were significantly lower in 
the AIHA mouse models, increased in all dose groups after drug intervention for 
28 days.
CONCLUSION: Iron metabolism abnormalities exists in AIHA patients and 
Jianpishengxue keli can ameliorate hemolysis and improve iron metabolism in AIHA 
mouse models.KEY MESSAGESIron metabolism abnormalities exists in hemolytic 
episode AIHA patients. Hepcidin and ferritin levels significantly elevated and 
also correlated with the severity of AIHA patients. Jianpishengxue keli can 
ameliorate hemolysis and prompt the recovery of AIHA."
804,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
cognitive impairment so widespread that it interferes with a person's ability to 
complete daily activities. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming increasingly 
common and it is estimated that the number of patients will reach 152 million by 
2050. Current treatment options for AD are symptomatic and have modest benefits. 
Therefore, considering the human, social and economic burden of the disease, the 
development of drugs with the potential to alter disease progression has become 
a global priority. In this review, the molecular mechanisms involved in the 
pathology of AD were evaluated as therapeutic targets. The main aim of the 
review is to focus on new knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative 
stress, and neuronal transmission in AD, as well as a range of cellular 
signaling mechanisms and associated treatments. Important molecular interactions 
leading to AD were described in amyloid cascade and in tau protein function, 
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholinergic and glutamatergic 
neurotransmission, cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein (CREB), the silent 
mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT-1), neuroinflammation 
(glial cells), and synaptic alterations. This review summarizes recent 
experimental and clinical research in AD pathology and analyzes the potential of 
therapeutic applications based on molecular disease mechanisms."
805,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).
METHODS: This retrospective study assessed adherence to prescribed enoxaparin 
for VTE prophylaxis in adults with SCD while hospitalized. A total of 172 
encounters of 72 unique patients were evaluated between 1 January and 31 
December 2019. Patients were grouped based on adherence to prescribed 
enoxaparin. Group 1 received 100% of doses ordered. Group 2 received between 99% 
and 1% of doses ordered. Group 3 received 0% of doses ordered.
RESULTS: Only 45 encounters (32.3%) received 100% of ordered doses and 81 
encounters (47%) did not receive any of the ordered enoxaparin doses. In total, 
only 37% of all prescribed enoxaparin doses were administered to patients.
CONCLUSION: This low level of administered enoxaparin is concerning in a patient 
population at an increased risk for VTE. VTE prophylaxis adherence needs to be 
addressed with each admission and, if appropriate, alterative options to 
enoxaparin should be considered."
806,"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare the quantity, type of glaucoma 
surgeries, and the disease stage before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre consecutive case series that 
included medical records of patients who underwent glaucoma surgery at the 
University Hospital in Białystok between 4 September, 2018, and 3 March, 2020 
(pre-pandemic group) and compared it with patients treated between 4 March, 
2020, and 4 September, 2021 (pandemic group). Adult patients with primary or 
secondary open-angle or closed-angle glaucoma who underwent surgery were 
included in this study. Finally, 534 operated eyes (362 and 172 eyes operated on 
before and during the pandemic, respectively) were examined.
RESULTS: The number of glaucoma surgeries dropped by 50% during the pandemic 
compared to a similar pre-pandemic period, with a significant difference in the 
kind of procedure between the two groups (p < 0.001). The most common procedures 
in the pre-pandemic group were Ex-Press implantation (33.7%) and trabeculectomy 
(31.5%). Within the pandemic group, half of the eyes underwent trabeculectomy 
(50.0%), followed by Preserflo microshunt (11.6%), iStent (8.7%), and 
transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCP) (8.7%). A significant difference in 
the average intraocular pressure was revealed among patients who qualified for 
surgery.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a decrease in the number of 
extended antiglaucoma procedures and an increase in the number of short 
procedures performed, such as TSCP and minimally invasive glaucoma surgery.Key 
MessagesOur study has shown the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 
reducing the number of antiglaucoma procedures.The number of glaucoma surgeries 
dropped by 50% during the pandemic compared to those in a similar pre-pandemic 
period, and the type of performed procedures has changed.The COVID-19 pandemic 
is associated with a decrease in the number of combined antiglaucoma procedures, 
in opposite: the number of minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries increased due 
to safety reasons."
807,"Nucleic acid detection is undoubtedly one of the most important research fields 
to meet the medical needs of genetic disease diagnosis, cancer treatment, and 
infectious disease prevention. However, the practical detection methods based on 
biological amplification are complex and time-consuming and require highly 
trained operators. Herein, we report a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for 
the nucleic acid assay by fluorescence or naked eye using chemical cyclic 
amplification. The addition of hydroxylamine (HA) during the Fenton reaction can 
continuously generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) via Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle, termed as 
""hydroxylamine boosts the Fenton reaction (Fenton-HA system)"". Meanwhile, the 
reducing substances, such as terephthalic acid or o-phenylenediamine, react with 
•OH to generate oxidized substances that can be recognized by the naked eye or 
detected by fluorescence so as to realize the detection of Fe3+. The 
concentration of Fe3+ has a good linear relationship with fluorescence intensity 
in the range of 0.1 to 100 nM, and the limit of detection is calculated to be 
0.03 nM (S/N = 3). Subsequently, Fe was introduced into the nucleic acid 
hybridization system after the Fe source was transformed into Fe3+, and the 
nucleic acids were indirectly determined by this method. This Fenton-HA system 
was used for sensing HIV-DNA and miRNA-21 to verify the validity of this method 
in nucleic acid detection. The detection limits were as low as 2.5 pM for 
HIV-DNA and 3 pM for miRNA-21. We believe that our work has unlocked an 
efficient signal amplification strategy, which is expected to develop a new 
generation of highly sensitive chemical biosensors."
808,"Enteric bacterial infections contribute substantially to global disease burden 
and mortality, particularly in the developing world. In vitro 2D monolayer 
cultures have provided critical insights into the fundamental virulence 
mechanisms of a multitude of pathogens, including Salmonella enterica serovars 
Typhimurium and Typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella spp., Escherichia coli and 
Campylobacter jejuni, which have led to the identification of novel targets for 
antimicrobial therapy and vaccines. In recent years, the arsenal of experimental 
systems to study intestinal infections has been expanded by a multitude of more 
complex models, which have allowed to evaluate the effects of additional 
physiological and biological parameters on infectivity. Organoids recapitulate 
the cellular complexity of the human intestinal epithelium while 3D 
bioengineered scaffolds and microphysiological devices allow to emulate oxygen 
gradients, flow and peristalsis, as well as the formation and maintenance of 
stable and physiologically relevant microbial diversity. Additionally, 
advancements in ex vivo cultures and intravital imaging have opened new 
possibilities to study the effects of enteric pathogens on fluid secretion, 
barrier integrity and immune cell surveillance in the intact intestine. This 
review aims to present a balanced and updated overview of current intestinal in

809,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the iatrogenic risk factors for 
hypophosphatemia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A total of 120 patients were enrolled and further 
divided into 4 groups, namely normal, mild, moderate or severe, according to the 
degree of hypophosphatemia. A number of related factors were analyzed and 
compared among the 4 groups, including the treatment method and outcomes. 
Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were employed to identify and 
confirm the risk factors associated with the occurrence of hypophosphatemia.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the acute physiology and chronic health 
evaluation II (APACHEII), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), modified 
NUTrition Risk in Critically ill (NUTRIC) scores as well as the length of 
patient stays in ICUs exhibited a gradually increasing trend of aggravation of 
hypophosphatemia. Univariate regression analysis identified the use of 
dehydrating drugs to be closely associated with the occurrence of 
hypophosphatemia, which was further confirmed by a multivariate regression 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of dehydrating drugs led to hypophosphatemia; therefore 
blood phosphorus concentrations should be closely monitored during treatment of 
ICU patients."
810,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a 
multidimensional concept that indicated an individual's holistic health, whereby 
the urban-poor community are susceptible to low HRQoL due to their high 
vulnerability. This study aimed to determine factors that predicted the HRQoL 
among the urban-poor school-aged children.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study and a total of 408 
primary school-aged children (male: 72.3%; female: 27.7%), with a mean age of 
9.68±1.48 years, were recruited from 10 urban-poor flats through cluster 
sampling at the central region of Malaysia. Their anthropometry, nutrition 
knowledge, attitude and practice, physical activity, dietary practices, and 
HRQoL were assessed.
RESULTS: A quarter (24.5%) of the urban-poor children were either overweight or 
obese in the present study. The HRQoL total score among the urban-poor children 
was 65.0±18.5. The result of multiple linear regression analysis shown that 
higher nutrition attitude (B=0.34, p=0.001) and practices (B=0.39, p=0.001), 
higher physical activity (B=3.73, p=0.004), higher lunch intake (B=1.35, 
p<0.001), lower supper intake (B=-1.35, p<0.001), and lower fast-food intake 
(B=-1.61, -1.17, p<0.001) are the significant predictors of better HRQoL among 
the urban-poor children (R2=0.32, F(8,399)=23.72, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should focus on these predictors to formulate 
interventions that could enhance the HRQoL among the Malaysian urban-poor 
children."
811,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To identify the main dietary patterns of adults and 
investigate the cross-sectional associations of these dietary patterns with 
prediabetes and undiagnosed or diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) in Qingdao, 
China.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This study included 4,457 participants who were 
administered the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Dietary 
patterns were identified through principal component analysis (PCA). Logistic 
regression analysis was performed to determine the associations of each pattern 
with the risks of prediabetes and undiagnosed or diagnosed DM.
RESULTS: PCA revealed two major dietary patterns. The Fruits-Vegetables and 
Poultry-Seafood patterns were not significantly associated with the risk of 
prediabetes in either crude or adjusted models (all p>0.05). The highest 
quartile of the Fruits-Vegetables pattern was significantly associated with 
decreased risks of undiagnosed DM (crude: OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.41-0.72; Model 1:

3: OR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.91) compared with the lowest quartile in crude and 
adjusted models. The Poultry-Seafood pattern was not significantly associated 
with the risk of undiagnosed or diagnosed DM in crude or adjusted models (all 
p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The Fruits-Vegetables pattern was associated with a decreased risk 
of undiagnosed or diagnosed DM."
812,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bioelectrical-impedance analysis (BIA) is frequently 
used to estimate dry weight in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, the clinical 
prognostic significance of BIA indicators is unclear. As a nutritional index, 
low phase angle (PA) might be an independent risk factor for predicting death in 
multiple chronic diseases. We performed this study to find relative influence 
factors of PA and other clinical prognostic significance.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: The study involved 87 HD patients, 33 of whom were 
diabetic and 54 of whom were not. We measured body composition index, body water 
index and nutritional indicators and collected biochemical criteria. Then, we 
statistically analyzed the associations of these indices. After 1 year of 
follow- up, we recorded death, heart failure, hospitalization, cerebrovascular 
and cardiovascular events and other clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We found a significant difference between the two groups in 
visceral-fat area, extracellular water/total body water (ECW/TBW) ratio and PA 
value. Two factors were negatively associated with PA: ECW/TBW ratio and HCO3- 
before HD. At 1 year, we noted that PA was associated with events such as heart 
failure or hospitalization. By further stratification and multivariate analysis 
adjusting for age, sex and months of dialysis, we found that low PA was an 
independent predictor of heart failure for diabetic HD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: PA value was lower in Diabetic nephropathy (DN) HD patients, than 
that in non-DN HD patients. PA was mainly negatively associated with ECW/TBW 
ratio. It is a useful index for predicting heart failure in diabetic HD 
patients."

risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The estimated dietary 
intake of CGA is 5 to 1000 mg/d. Based on the data from population intervention 
studies, daily oral doses of CGA at 13.5mg to 1200 mg can reduce fasting blood 
glucose (FBG), improve glucose tolerance, enable weight loss /prevent weight 
gain, and improve blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Daily intake of 200 
mg or more may reduce FBG, with a dose-effect relationship in the range 13.5-500 
mg/d. Therefore, a specific proposed level (SPL) of CGA to improve FBG could be 
≥200 mg/d. Data insufficiency does not allow formulation of a tolerable upper 
intake level (TUIL) for CGA."
814,"Amyloid-β peptide with predominant presence in the senile plaques is the most 
common agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence. Assembly of the 
amyloid-β(1-42) (Aβ1-42) isoform is known as the main reason for the AD 
appearance. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and 
1,4-naphthoquinone-2-yl-L-tryptophan (NQTrp) are two small molecules that 
inhibit the formation of the Aβ1-42 fibrils. The present study provides 
molecular insight to clarify the inhibitory mechanisms of the EGCG and NQTrp 
ligands on the Aβ1-42 assemblies by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. 
Hence, nine different Aβ1-42-containing systems including the monomer, dimer, 
and hexamer of Aβ1-42 considering each of them in a media with no ligands, in 
the presence of one EGCG ligand, and in the presence of one EGCG ligand were 
studied with a simulation time of 1 µs for each system. The precise 
investigation of the peptide-ligand distance, conformational factor (Pi), 
solvent accessible surface area (SASA), dictionary of secondary structure 
(DSSP), and Lys28-Ala42 salt bridge analyses confirmed that the hydroxyl-rich 
structure of the EGCG ligand applied its inhibitory effect on the aggregation of 
the peptides indirectly by involving water molecules. While the hydroxyl-free 
structure of the NQTrp ligand exposed its inhibitory effect through a direct 
interaction with the Aβ1-42 peptides. Besides, reduced density gradient (RDG) 
analysis clarified the hydrogen bonding interactions as the dominant ones for 
the peptide-EGCG systems, and also, steric and van der Waals interactions for 
the peptide-NQTrp systems.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
815,"PURPOSE: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be transferred from one 
person to another through sexual contact. STIs lead to substantial morbidity and 
mortality and affect many different aspects of human life, including quality of 
life, sexual health, reproductive health and even the health of newborns and 
children. Despite of high rates of STIs in prisons, there are not sufficient 
screening, prevention and treatment programs to control STIs transmission among 
prisoners in Iran. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of STIs among 
incarcerated women in Iran for the first time, using the active case finding 
strategy.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This is a cross-sectional study conducted on 438 
incarcerated women in a prison in Tehran, Iran, from 2017 to 2018. A total of 
438 prisoners were screened by active case findings for STI symptoms, then 
evaluated by complete genital and anal examination, followed by molecular 
testing.
FINDINGS: A total of 189 (43.2%) prisoners announced vaginal discharge, while 
194 (44.3%) individuals had vaginal discharge in the genital examination. In the 
cervical examination, 137 individuals (31.3%) had abnormal findings, of which 83 
(18.9%) individuals had cervicitis, 40 (9.1%) individuals had cervical erosion, 
38 (8.7%) individuals had cervical prolapse and 17 (3.9%) individuals had 
bleeding originated from the cervix.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This study showed that it is possible to set up a system in 
which the diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of prisoners with STIs can be 
actively performed. Educating prisoners about signs and symptoms, risk behaviors 
and prevention routes of STIs, as much as regular screening of prisoners, and 
adequate treatment can help control the STIs prevalence among prisoners and in 
the general population."
816,"Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), the key enzyme involved in prostaglandin (PGs) 
production, is known to take part in inflammatory and immune responses. Though 
COX-2 inhibitors are therapeutically effective anti-inflammatory drugs, they 
deficit anti-thrombotic activity thus leading to increased cardiovascular 
diseases. Therefore, COX-2 inhibitors with improved therapeutic efficacy and 
tolerance are still needed. In recent years, traditional medicine systems have 
paid attention to the essential oil of genus Zingiber, particularly for the 
treatment of various inflammatory illnesses, with lesser side effects. Thus, the 
present study aims to explore the anti-inflammatory activity of Zingiber 
essential oil through computational-biology approaches. In this regard, virtual 
screening, molecular docking, and simulations were carried out on 53 compounds 
derived from the essential oil of Zingiber species in order to provide 
mechanistic insights into COX-2 inhibition and identify the most actively potent 
anti-inflammatory compounds. Among all the docked ligands, epi-cubenol, 
δ-cadinene, γ-eudesmol, cubenol, and α-terpineol were found to be powerful 
bioactive compounds with an increased binding affinity towards COX-2 along with 
favorable physiochemical properties. Additionally, MD simulation in DPPC lipid 
bilayers was studied to examine the intrinsic dynamics and adaptability of the 
chosen ligands and COX-2-complexes. The findings showed that the selected five 
components interacted steadily with the COX-2 active site residues throughout 
the simulation via different bondings. The integrative-computational approach 
showed that the identified natural compounds may be taken into further 
consideration for potential in vitro and in vivo evaluation as COX-2 inhibitors, 
which would lead to the development of more potent and efficient 
anti-inflammatory drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
817,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder causing demyelination and 
neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. MS is characterized by 
disturbed motor performance and cognitive impairment. Current MS treatments 
delay disease progression and reduce relapse rates with general 
immunomodulation, yet curative therapies are still lacking. Regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) are able to suppress autoreactive immune cells, which drive MS 
pathology. However, Tregs are functionally impaired in people with MS. 
Interestingly, Tregs were recently reported to also have regenerative capacity. 
Therefore, experts agree that Treg cell therapy has the potential to ameliorate 
the disease. However, to perform their local anti-inflammatory and regenerative 
functions in the brain, they must first migrate across the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB). This review summarizes the reported results concerning the migration of 
Tregs across the BBB and the influence of Tregs on migration of other immune 
subsets. Finally, their therapeutic potential is discussed in the context of MS."
818,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic endocrine disease that occurs mostly in the state 
of hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose level). In the recent times, diabetes 
is listed under world's utmost critical health issues. Wound treatment 
procedures are complicated in diabetic individuals all over the world. Diabetic 
wound care not only involves high-cost, but also the primary cause of 
hospitalization, which can lead to amputation thereby reducing diabetic patient 
life expectancy. To lower the risk of amputation, wound healing requires the 
development of effective treatments. Traditional management systems for Diabetes 
are frequently chastised due to their high costs, difficulties in maintaining a 
sustainable supply chain and limited disposal alternatives. The worrisome rise 
in diabetes prevalence has sparked a surge of interest in the discovery of 
viable remedies to supplement existing treatments. Nanomaterials wound healing 
has a lot of potential for treating and preventing wound infections and it has 
recently gained popularity owing to its ability to transport drugs to the wound 
area in a regulated fashion, potentially overpowering the limits of traditional 
approaches. This research assessed several nanosystems, such as nanocarriers and 
nanotherapeutics, to explore how they can benefit in diabetic wound healing, 
with a focus on current obstacles and future prospects."
819,"OBJECTIVE: Pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 1 (PHLDA1) is 
involved in the progression of intestine-related diseases, but its role and 
related mechanisms in Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are unclear. The aim of 
this study was to better understand the function of PHLDA1 in NEC and the 
underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: A neonatal mouse model of NEC was established by hypoxic hypothermia, 
and sh-PHLDA1 was transfected into mice to observe the mortality of each group 
within 4 days. The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-α were measured by PCR 
and ELISA. ROS, MDA, SOD, and GSH-Px levels were detected by Dihydroethidium 
(DHE) method and kit; expression of pyroptosis-related factors including NLRP3, 
ASC, cleaved-caspase1, GSDMD-N, IL-1β, IL-18, and Nrf2 were detected by 
western-blot; mechanistically, the effects of transfection of sh-PHLDA1 and 
ML385 (Nrf2 inhibitor) were investigated, and the expression of 
pyroptosis-related factors was detected again.
RESULTS: PHLDA1 was highly expressed in the intestinal tissues of NEC mice, and 
transfection of sh-PHLDA1 improved the survival rate, alleviated intestinal 
lesions, improved intestinal inflammation, oxidative stress and cellular 
scorching in NEC. In addition, sh-PHLDA1 was able to inhibit NLRP3 activation 
and pyroptosis by activating Nrf2.
CONCLUSION: Knockdown of PHLDA1 attenuated necrotizing small intestinal colitis 
by enhancing Nrf2 expression to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and 
pyroptosis."
820,"Disruption of the intestinal mucus barrier and intestinal epithelial endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress contribute to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Previously, 
we observed intestinal goblet cell loss and increased intestinal epithelial ER 
stress following chorioamnionitis. Here, we investigated how chorioamnionitis 
affects goblet cells by assessing their cellular characteristics. Importantly, 
goblet cell features are compared with those in clinical NEC biopsies. Mucus 
thickness was assessed as read-out of goblet cell function. Fetal lambs were 
intra-amniotically (IA) infected for 7d at 122 gestational age with Ureaplasma 
parvum serovar-3, the main microorganism clinically associated with 
chorioamnionitis. After preterm delivery, mucus thickness, goblet cell numbers, 
gut inflammation, epithelial proliferation and apoptosis and intestinal 
epithelial ER stress were investigated in the terminal ileum. Next, goblet cell 
morphological alterations (TEM) were studied and compared to human NEC samples. 
Ileal mucus thickness and goblet cell numbers were elevated following IA UP 
exposure. Increased pro-apoptotic ER stress, detected by elevated CHOP-positive 
cell counts and disrupted organelle morphology of secretory cells in the 
intestinal epithelium, was observed in IA UP exposed animals. Importantly, 
comparable cellular morphological alterations were observed in the ileum from 
NEC patients. In conclusion, UP-driven chorioamnionitis leads to a thickened 
ileal mucus layer and mucus hypersecretion from goblet cells. Since this was 
associated with pro-apoptotic ER stress and organelle disruption, mucus barrier 
alterations seem to occur at the expense of goblet cell resilience and may 
therefore predispose to detrimental intestinal outcomes. The remarkable overlap 
of these in utero findings with observations in NEC patients underscores their 
clinical relevance."
821,"CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) enables programmable, reversible, and titratable 
repression of gene expression (knockdown) in mammalian cells. Initial 
CRISPRi-mediated genetic screens have showcased the potential to address basic 
questions in cell biology, genetics, and biotechnology, but wider deployment of 
CRISPRi screening has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA 
(sgRNA) libraries and challenges in generating cell models with consistent 
CRISPRi-mediated knockdown. Here, we present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA 
libraries and effector expression constructs that enable strong and consistent 
knockdown across mammalian cell models. First, we combine empirical sgRNA 
selection with a dual-sgRNA library design to generate an ultra-compact (1-3 
elements per gene), highly active CRISPRi sgRNA library. Next, we compare 
CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides an 
excellent balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal nonspecific 
effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally, we engineer a suite of 
cell lines with stable expression of Zim3-dCas9 and robust on-target knockdown.

genetic screening."
822,"To evaluate the clinical features, molecular subtypes, therapeutic strategies, 
and prognostic factors of occult breast cancer (OBC). Patients with T0-3/N1-3/M0 
breast cancer diagnosed in 2010-2018 (n = 114,303, including 691 with OBC) were 
retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) database. 
The endpoints were overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival 
(BCSS). Compared with non-OBC, OBC presented significantly more adverse 
clinicopathological prognostic features. More patients with OBC underwent 
breast-conserving treatment (BCT) and less had axillary lymphadenectomy (ALD). 
Outcomes were more favorable in OBC cases compared with non-OBC cases (p = .002 
for OS, p = .002 for BCSS). Triple-negative (TNBC) and HER2-enriched were the 
subtypes with the worst prognosis in OBC (p < .05). Prognosis was better for 
triple-negative OBC compared with the same subtype of non-OBC. N-stage was not a 
strong prognostic indicator of OBC (p > .05 for OS). Cases who underwent 
systemic chemotherapy alone without surgery had the worst prognosis among OBC 
patients. For locoregional therapy, mastectomy and radiotherapy could confer 
survival advantage; standard axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and positive 
lymph node dissection (PLND) contributed notably to OS in OBC patients. Both OS 
and BCSS were better in OBC cases compared with non-OBC. Systemic chemotherapy 
alone without surgery is not appropriate for OBC treatment, and mastectomy plus 
standard axillary surgery is recommended. Patients with hormone 
receptor-positive and low burden of axillary lymph node metastasis may be spared 
from radiotherapy after undergoing standard axillary lymphadenectomy."
823,"Objectives: The high-salt diet (HSD) has been associated with cognitive 
dysfunction by attacking the cerebral microvasculature, through an adaptive 
response, initiated in the intestine and mediated by Th17 cells. In the animal 
model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 
(EAE), it has been described that NaCl causes an increase in T cell infiltration 
in the central nervous system. NaCl also promotes macrophage response and Th17 
cell differentiation, worsening the course of the disease. HSD may trigger an 
activation of the immune system and enhance inflammation. However, certain 
studies not only do not support this possibility, but support the opposite, as 
the effect of salt on immune cells may not necessarily be pathogenic. Therefore, 
this study aimed to evaluate the effect of an over intake of salt in rats with 
EAE, based on the clinical course, oxidative stress, markers of inflammation and 
the gut dysbiosis.Methods: 15 Dark Agouti rats were used, which were divided 
into control group, EAE group and EAE + NaCl group. Daily 0.027 g of NaCl 
dissolved in 300 μl of H2O was administered through a nasogastric tube for 51 
days.Results: NaCl administration produced an improvement in clinical status and 
a decrease in biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
dysbiosis.Conclusion: The underlying mechanism by which NaCl causes these 
effects could involve the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is 
blocked by high doses of salt."
824,"Capsule endoscopy (CE) and balloon-assisted enteroscopy (BAE) have become 
indispensable techniques for the diagnosis and management of small bowel disease 
in both adult and pediatric cases. However, relevant differences exist in the 
indications between these cohorts, with body weight and age having particular 
relevance in decisions for the latter. Both CE and BAE are designed for adult 
physique and they were not widely used among children. In addition, the types of 
small intestinal diseases differ between adults and children, and consequently, 
the indications also differ between them. This review focuses on the issues 
relevant to pediatric cases and describes the practical application of endoscopy 
in clinical practice. In conclusion, although there are age and weight 
restrictions, both CE and BAE are safe and useful devices for use in children, 
and their indications for use in children are likely to expand in the future."
825,"The association between cholesterol metabolism and cancer development and 
progression has been recently highlighted. However, the role and function of 
many cholesterol transporters remain largely unknown. Herein, we focused on 
ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 9 (ABCA9) transporter given that its 
expression is significantly downregulated in both canine mammary tumors and 
human breast cancers, which in breast cancer patients correlates with poor 
prognosis. We found that ABCA9 is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) and is responsible for promoting cholesterol accumulation in this 
structure. Accordingly, ABCA9 inhibited sterol-regulatory element binding 
protein-2 (SREBP-2) translocation from the ER to the nucleus, a crucial step for 
cholesterol synthesis, resulting in the downregulation of cholesterol synthesis 
gene expression. ABCA9 expression in breast cancer cells attenuated cell 
proliferation and reduced their colony-forming abilities. We identified ABCA9 
expression to be regulated by Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). Inhibition of PI3K 
induced enhanced ABCA9 expression through the activation of PI3K-Akt-FOXO1 
pathway in breast cancer cells. Altogether, our study suggests that ABCA9 
functions as an ER cholesterol transporter that suppresses cholesterol synthesis 
via the inhibition of SREBP-2 signaling and that its restoration halts breast 
cancer cell proliferation. Our findings provide novel insight into a vital role 
of ABCA9 in breast cancer progression."
826,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists are potent 
insulin sensitizers in treating type 2 diabetes. Despite being very effective in 
the fight against diabetes-mediated complications, PPARγ agonists are 
accompanied by severe side effects leading to complicated health problems, 
making the discovery of novel safe ligands highly pertinent. A significant 
intense research effort is in progress to explore the PPARγ activating potential 
of a wide range of natural compounds. Lemon (Citrus limon) contains various 
bioactive flavonoids, and eriocitrin is the major flavonoid. It possesses 
substantial antioxidant and anticancer, lipid-lowering activities and prevents 
obesity-associated metabolic diseases. Eriocitrin is metabolized to eriodictyol 
in the intestine, and the absorbed eriodictyol undergoes conversion to numerous 
metabolites in vivo. It is unclear if eriocitrin or its metabolites are 
responsible for their beneficial effects. We have used molecular docking, ADMET 
properties, drug-likeness score and molecular dynamics simulation study to find 
if eriocitrin and its metabolites are potent binders for PPARγ. Docking studies 
revealed that eriocitrin binds to PPARγ with the highest binding energy, but 
ADMET properties and in vivo studies show that the bioavailability of eriocitrin 
is very poor. Molecular dynamics studies were carried out to validate the 
docking results, and multiple parameters like RMSD, RMSF, Radius of gyration, 
SASA, hydrogen bond analysis, interaction energy, principal component analysis, 
Gibbs free energy and MM-PBSA were calculated. Based on our studies, 
eriodictyol, eriodictyol 7-O-glucuronide, eriodictyol 3'-O-glucuronide, 
homoeriodictyol and homoeriodictyol 7-O-glucuronide which are metabolites of 
eriocitrin appear to be potent partial agonists of PPARγ under physiological 
conditions.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."

828,"BACKGROUND: Hyperkalemia is associated with increased healthcare resource 
utilization (HRU). This study evaluated the impact of sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate (SZC) use on HRU in outpatients with hyperkalemia.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective noncomparative study using claims 
data from the HealthVerity warehouse, which included outpatients in the United 
States who initiated SZC between January and December 2019 (index date) with 
≥6 months' continuous coverage before (baseline) and after (follow-up) the index 
date (total coverage of 12 months). The study aimed to describe HRU with 
long-term and short-term SZC (defined as >90 and ≤90 days' supply, respectively, 
during 180 days' follow-up) and identify characteristics associated with 
long-term versus short-term therapy.
RESULTS: Of 1153 patients, 748 (64.9%) received short-term and 405 (35.1%) 
received long-term therapy. During follow-up, lower proportions of patients on 
long-term versus short-term therapy had hyperkalemia-related hospitalizations 
(10.1% vs 15.1%; P < 0.05) and all-cause hospitalizations (22.5% vs 29.3%; P 
< 0.05). Hyperkalemia-related and all-cause hospitalization proportions were 
33.0% and 23.3% lower, respectively. Predictors of long-term therapy included 
stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of patients with hyperkalemia received 
long-term SZC therapy. Hyperkalemia-related and all-cause hospitalization 
proportions were lower with long-term therapy, although further confirmatory 
studies are needed."
829,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the intra- and interscan 
repeatability of free-breathing phase-resolved functional lung (PREFUL) MRI in 
stable pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease in comparison to static 
breath-hold hyperpolarized 129-xenon MRI (Xe-MRI) and pulmonary function tests.
METHODS: Free-breathing 1-hydrogen MRI and Xe-MRI were acquired from 15 stable 
pediatric CF patients and seven healthy age-matched participants on two visits, 
1 month apart. Same-visit MRI scans were also performed on a subgroup of the CF 
patients. Following the PREFUL algorithm, regional ventilation (RVent) and 
regional flow volume loop cross-correlation maps were determined from the 
free-breathing data. Ventilation defect percentage (VDP) was determined from 
RVent maps (VDPRVent ), regional flow volume loop cross-correlation maps (VDPCC 
), VDPRVent ∪ VDPCC , and multi-slice Xe-MRI. Repeatability was evaluated using 
Bland-Altman analysis, coefficient of repeatability (CR), and intraclass 
correlation.
RESULTS: Minimal bias and no significant differences were reported for all 
PREFUL MRI and Xe-MRI VDP parameters between intra- and intervisits (all 
P > 0.05). Repeatability of VDPRVent , VDPCC , VDPRVent ∪ VDPCC , and 
multi-slice Xe-MRI were lower between the two-visit scans (CR = 14.81%, 15.36%, 
16.19%, and 9.32%, respectively) in comparison to the same-day scans 
(CR = 3.38%, 2.90%, 1.90%, and 3.92%, respectively). pulmonary function tests 
showed high interscan repeatability relative to PREFUL MRI and Xe-MRI.
CONCLUSION: PREFUL MRI, similar to Xe-MRI, showed high intravisit repeatability 
but moderate intervisit repeatability in CF, which may be due to inherent 
disease instability, even in stable patients. Thus, PREFUL MRI may be considered 
a suitable outcome measure for future treatment response studies."
830,"Resistance to anti-cancer therapy is a major challenge for cancer treatment. 
Many studies revealed that macroautophagy/autophagy inhibition can overcome

autophagy signature to estimate the autophagy status of approximately 10,000 
tumor samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and 
muti-omics characterization reveals that autophagy induction may also sensitize 
cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. These findings provide a comprehensive

832,"Introduction/Aims. Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is exceedingly rare and has 
been an enigmatic disease. Recent progress has drastically changed this 
perception, with early biomarkers being investigated and potential medications 
for PLS emerging at the preclinical stage. The aim of this paper is to describe 
a study of PLS natural history and discuss the limitations and proposed 
solutions to the study of a rare and slowly progressive disease. Methods. The 
PLS Natural History Study is a 30-site, 24-month, prospective study that is 
supported by multiple funding sources. The study aims to enroll 50 early PLS 
(disease duration ≤4 years) and 50 definite PLS (disease duration 4 to 15 years) 
participants using modified PLS Diagnostic Criteria. Smartphone-based 
assessments including semi-quantitative and quantitative measures and 
patient-reported outcomes are utilized. In-person quantitative measures are also 
completed during site visits. The change in the PLS Functional Rating Scale 
score is the primary outcome. The study utilizes the NeuroBANK® patient-centric 
data capture and management platform. The biostatistical analysis plan has been 
developed. Results. In one year, 28 participants have been recruited. Enrollment 
has been much slower than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rarity 
of PLS, and potential study competition for internal resources from ALS clinical

835,"The SARS-CoV-2 'Omicron' strain, with 15 mutations in the receptor binding 
domain (RBD), was detected in South Africa and rapidly spread worldwide. 
SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein by binding to the TOM70 receptor and ORF8 protein by 
binding to MHC-I, IF3 receptors inhibit the host's immune response. In this 
study, genomics variations were evaluated for 96 samples isolated from Iran from 
March to July 2022 using the Nextclade web server and informatics tools. We 
identified the mutations occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We also evaluated 
the effect of mutations on spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor, 
ORF9b protein interaction with the TOM70 receptor, and structural stability of 
ORF8 and nucleocapsid proteins using docking and molecular dynamics. Results 
indicated that during March and April 2022, the BA.2 strain was dominant in the 
south of Iran, while during June 2022, the BA.5 strain was dominant. BF.5 strain 
had the most divergence among SARS-CoV-2 strains reported from south of Iran. 
The binding affinity of BA.5 and BF.5 strains spike protein to ACE2 receptor is 
similar, and compared to BA.2 strain, was stronger. The BF.5 ORF9b K40R mutation 
causes a better binding affinity of the protein to the TOM70 receptor. Also, 
mutations that occurred in the ORF8 protein led to instability in the dimer 
formation of this protein and improved immune response for mutations that 
occurred in BA.2 strain, while this mutation did not occur in BF.5 strain. The 
mutations that were detected in nucleocapsid protein CTD and NTD domains caused 
the stability of these domains.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
836,"Data on spatiotemporal distribution of rotavirus diarrhea are limited in many 
endemic settings. This study determined the prevalence and seasonal distribution 
of rotavirus among Nigerian children with diarrhea. Here, a total of 406 fecal 
samples were collected from patients attending six health facilities in Lagos 
between January - December 2019. Socio-demographic data of each enrolled child 
were collected. Rotavirus VP6 antigen was detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay 
(ELISA) and confirmation by VP7 gene detection by reverse transcription 
polymerase-chain reaction. The overall rotavirus diarrhea prevalence was 16.3% 
by ELISA with children above 2 years having 29.2% of this prevalence and higher 
occurrence in females (59.1%) than males (40.9%) (P < .05). Rotavirus diarrhea 
diagnosis using RT-PCR showed 100% concordance with ELISA. Cases of rotavirus 
diarrhea were detected from March to July and from September to November with 
the highest number of cases detected in May and June (22.7% each), followed by 
July (21.2%). The prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea remains high in Lagos with an 
emerging higher disease activity in children above 2. A different rotavirus 
transmission dynamics compared to previous studies from Nigeria and other 
African countries was found. VP6 ELISA may reliably be used for continuous 
rotavirus surveillance in Nigeria."
837,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), structural and functional changes in the brain may 
give rise to disruption of specific cognitive functions. The aim of this study 
is to investigate the functional connectivity alterations in the pulvinar's 
subdivisions and total pulvinar voxel-based morphometry (VBM) changes in 
individuals with AD and healthy controls. A seed-based functional connectivity 
analysis was applied to the anterior, inferior, lateral, and medial pulvinar in 
each hemisphere. Furthermore, VBM analysis was carried out to compare gray 
matter (GM) volume differences in the pulvinar and thalamus between the two 
groups. Connectivity analysis revealed that the pulvinar subdivisions had 
decreased connectivity in individuals with AD. In addition, the pulvinar and 
thalamus in each hemisphere were significantly smaller in the AD group. The 
pulvinar may have a role in AD-related cognitive impairments and the intrinsic 
connectivity network changes and GM loss in pulvinar subdivisions suggest the 
cognitive deterioration occurring in those with AD. HIGHLIGHTS: The pulvinar may 
play a role in pathophysiology of cognitive impairments in those with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Decreased structural volume and functional 
connectivity were found in patients with AD. The inferior pulvinar is 
functionally the most affected subdivision by AD compared to the others."
838,"BACKGROUND: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a promising candidate 
blood-based biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and 
prognostication. The timing of its disease-associated changes, its clinical 
correlates, and biofluid-type dependency will influence its clinical utility.
METHODS: We evaluated plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP in 
families with autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), leveraging the predictable age at 
symptom onset to determine changes by stage of disease.
RESULTS: Plasma GFAP elevations appear a decade before expected symptom onset, 
after amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation and prior to neurodegeneration and 
cognitive decline. Plasma GFAP distinguished Aβ-positive from Aβ-negative ADAD 
participants and showed a stronger relationship with Aβ load in asymptomatic 
than symptomatic ADAD. Higher plasma GFAP was associated with the degree and 
rate of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Serum GFAP showed similar 
relationships, but these were less pronounced for CSF GFAP.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support a role for plasma GFAP as a clinical biomarker 
of Aβ-related astrocyte reactivity that is associated with cognitive decline and 
neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) elevations appear a 
decade before expected symptom onset in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease 
(ADAD). Plasma GFAP was associated to amyloid positivity in asymptomatic ADAD. 
Plasma GFAP increased with clinical severity and predicted disease progression. 
Plasma and serum GFAP carried similar information in ADAD, while cerebrospinal 
fluid GFAP did not."
839,"BACKGROUND: There is controversy about the association between vitamin D and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). This article aims to explore the association of 
serum 25-hydroxyvitaminD (25 OHD) with the risk of CVD.
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science database, OVID, and Cochrane Library 
databases (last updated in August 2022) were systematically searched. The 
relationship between 25OHD and the risk of CVD was assessed by using the 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) and hazard ratio (HR). The effect model was selected 
by the size of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 40 cohort studies that contained 652352 
samples. The pooled results showed that a decreased level of 25OHD was 
associated with an increased relative risk of total CVD events (HR = 1.35, 95% 
CI: 1.26-1.43). Furthermore, the results also showed that a decreased 
circulating 25OHD level was associated with an increased mortality of CVD 
(HR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.30-1.57) and incidence of CVD (HR = 1.26, 95% CI: 
1.16-1.36), especially an increased risk of heart failure (HF) (HR = 1.38, 95% 
CI: 1.2-1.6), myocardial infarction (MI) (HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.13-1.44) and 
coronary heart disease (CHD) (HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.1-1.49).
CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis shows that reduced serum 25OHD 
concentrations is not only associated with increased total cardiovascular events 
and cardiovascular mortality, but also with increased risk of HF, MI, and CHD.
LIMITATIONS: The underlying mechanism still needs to be explored further, and 
well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the role of vitamin D in the occurrence 
and development of CVD."
840,"Probiotics positively influence age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) given 
their propensity to attenuate oxidative and inflammatory stress. We addressed 
the impact of probiotics on metabolic profiles, clinical indices, inflammatory 
and oxidative stress parameters in ARMD patients. We performed a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial analyzing 57 subjects with ARMD aged 
between 50 and 85 years. Subjects were randomized into two groups, and received 
daily for 8 weeks either probiotic capsule or placebo. Fasting blood samples 
were obtained at baseline and after the 8-week intervention for the 
determination of metabolic profiles and oxidative stress biomarkers. After the 
8-week intervention, compared with the placebo, probiotic supplementation 
significantly increased means HDL-cholesterol (Probiotic group: +3.86±4.42 vs. 
Placebo group: -0.55±4.93 mg/dL, P = .001), plasma total antioxidant capacity 
(TAC) (Probiotic group: +77.43±168.30 vs. Placebo group: -23.12±169.22 mmol/L, P 
= .02) and significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (Probiotic 
group: -0.18±0.46 vs. Placebo group: +0.18±0.25 µmol/L, P = .001). There was no 
significant effect of probiotic administration on other metabolic profiles and 
clinical symptoms. Overall, an eight-week probiotic administration among ARMD 
patients had beneficial effects on TAC, MDA and HDL-cholesterol levels; however, 
it did not affect clinical signs and other metabolic profiles."
841,"BACKGROUND: In current Western medical ethics, patient-centered medicine is 
considered the norm. However, the cultural background of collectivism in East 
Asia often leads to family-centered decision-making. In Japan, prior studies 
have reported that family-centered decision-making is more likely to be 
preferred in situations of disease notification and end-of-life decision-making. 
Nonetheless, there has been a recent shift from collectivism to individualism 
due to changes in the social structure. Various personal factors have also been 
reported to influence moral decision-making. Therefore, this study examined 
whether the current trend in attitudes of healthcare decision-making in Japan is 
family-centered or patient-centered among the general public and physicians. In 
addition, the personal factors that influence this tendency were examined.
METHODS: Three vignettes on disease notification and two vignettes on 
decision-making during end-of-life care were created, and 457 members of the 
public and 284 physicians were asked about their attitudes (behavioral 
intentions) regarding these vignettes.
RESULTS: Approximately, 95% of physicians were patient-centered in explaining 
the patient's severe medical condition. However, approximately 80% of physicians 
emphasized the wishes of the family over patient wishes when making 
life-sustaining decisions. Nearly half the general public emphasized the 
patient's wishes in the explanation of a severe medical condition and in 
life-sustaining decisions. In both the public and physician groups, personal 
factors, particularly the presence or absence of a disease under treatment and 
prior caregiving experience, influenced ethical attitudes toward medical 
treatment decisions.
CONCLUSIONS: In relatively low-conflict situations, such as the announcement of 
a patient's medical condition, physicians tended to be patient-centered, while 
they tended to be family-centered in situations of strong conflict in 
withholding life-sustaining treatment. The fact that personal factors influenced 
the family-centered response in situations of strong conflict highlights the 
importance of not only acquiring knowledge of medical ethics but also learning 
to fairly apply this knowledge in practice."
842,"AFF3 at 2q11.2 encodes the nuclear transcriptional activator AF4/FMR2 Family 
Member 3. AFF3 constitutes super elongation complex like 3, which plays a role 
in promoting the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis and development. 
The degron motif in AFF3 with nine highly conserved amino acids is recognized by 
E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce protein degradation. Recently, AFF3 missense 
variants in this region and variants featuring deletion including this region 
were identified and shown to cause KINSSHIP syndrome. In this study, we 
identified two novel and one previously reported missense variants in the degron 
of AFF3 in three unrelated Japanese patients. Notably, two of these three 
variants exhibited mosaicism in the examined tissues. This study suggests that 
mosaic variants also cause KINSSHIP syndrome, showing various phenotypes. This

843,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there 
has been an explosion of sequencing of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, making it the most widely sequenced virus in 
the history. Several databases and tools have been created to keep track of 
genome sequences and variants of the virus; most notably, the GISAID platform 
hosts millions of complete genome sequences, and it is continuously expanding 
every day. A challenging task is the development of fast and accurate tools that 
are able to distinguish between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assign 
them to a clade.
RESULTS: In this article, we leverage the frequency chaos game representation 
(FCGR) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop an original method 
that learns how to classify genome sequences that we implement into CouGaR-g, a 
tool for the clade assignment problem on SARS-CoV-2 sequences. On a testing 
subset of the GISAID, CouGaR-g achieved an $96.29\%$ overall accuracy, while a 
similar tool, Covidex, obtained a $77,12\%$ overall accuracy. As far as we know, 
our method is the first using deep learning and FCGR for intraspecies 
classification. Furthermore, by using some feature importance methods, CouGaR-g 
allows to identify k-mers that match SARS-CoV-2 marker variants.
CONCLUSIONS: By combining FCGR and CNNs, we develop a method that achieves a 
better accuracy than Covidex (which is based on random forest) for clade 
assignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, also thanks to our training on a much 
larger dataset, with comparable running times. Our method implemented in 
CouGaR-g is able to detect k-mers that capture relevant biological information 
that distinguishes the clades, known as marker variants.
AVAILABILITY: The trained models can be tested online providing a FASTA file 
(with 1 or multiple sequences) at 
https://huggingface.co/spaces/BIASLab/sars-cov-2-classification-fcgr. CouGaR-g

844,"Protein translation is an essential cellular process and dysfunctional protein 
translation causes various neurodevelopmental disorders. The eukaryotic 
translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the 
ribosome, while the eEF1B complex acts as a guanine exchange factor (GEF) of GTP 
for GDP indirectly catalyzing the release of eEF1A from the ribosome. The gene 
EEF1D encodes the eEF1Bδ subunit of the eEF1B complex. EEF1D is alternatively 
spliced giving rise to one long and three short isoforms. Two different 
homozygous, truncating variants in EEF1D had been associated with severe 
intellectual disability and microcephaly in two families. The published variants 
only affect the long isoform of EEF1D that acts as a transcription factor of 
heat shock element proteins. By exome sequencing, we identified two different 
homozygous variants in EEF1D in two families with severe developmental delay, 
severe microcephaly, spasticity, and failure to thrive with optic atrophy, poor 
feeding, and recurrent aspiration pneumonias. The EEF1D variants of this study 
are localized in the C-terminal GEF domain suggesting that a disturbed protein 
translation machinery might contribute to the neurodevelopmental phenotype. 
Pathogenic variants localized in both the alternatively spliced domain or in the 
GEF domain of EEF1D cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly 
and spasticity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
845,"Identifying the best analytical approach for capturing moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity (MVPA) using accelerometry is complex but inconsistent 
approaches employed in research and surveillance limits comparability. We 
illustrate the use of a consensus method that pools estimates from multiple 
approaches for characterising MVPA using accelerometry. Participants (n = 30) 
wore an accelerometer on their right hip during two laboratory visits. Ten 
individual classification methods estimated minutes of MVPA, including 
cut-point, two-regression, and machine learning approaches, using open-source 
count and raw inputs and several epoch lengths. Results were averaged to derive 
the consensus estimate. Mean MVPA ranged from 33.9-50.4 min across individual 
methods, but only one (38.9 min) was statistically equivalent to the criterion 
of direct observation (38.2 min). The consensus estimate (39.2 min) was 
equivalent to the criterion (even after removal of the one individual method 
that was equivalent to the criterion), had a smaller mean absolute error 
(4.2 min) compared to individual methods (4.9-12.3 min), and enabled the 
estimation of participant-level variance (mean standard deviation: 7.7 min). The 
consensus method allows for addition/removal of methods depending on data 
availability or field progression and may improve accuracy and comparability of 
device-based MVPA estimates while limiting variability due to convergence 
between estimates."
846,"In this study, we determined both hygienic sanitary risk and microbiological 
quality of raw meat and meat-contact surfaces in butcher shops and retails from 
the North Governorate in Lebanon. A total of 55 samples were analyzed (36 raw 
meat and 19 environmental swabs). The overall counts of pathogenic bacteria 
indicate high levels of contamination of both minced meat and contact surfaces. 
Presumptive Salmonella and Listeria were found in the samples. Salmonella spp. 
was observed in 63.8% of all cuts, of whom 41.6% is detected from butcher shops' 
meat. L. monocytogenes was present in 47.2% of meat from butcher shops and 30.5% 
of retails. Total aerobic count followed by S. aureus and fecal coliforms were 
the most detected pathogens in environmental swabs. Most visited facilities 
presented moderate hygienic sanitary risk, with average scores of 55.25 in 
butchers' shops and 65.25 in retail. Findings highlight the necessity for 
governmental surveillance and implementation of food safety laws."
847,"The spike (S) glycoprotein and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are the crucial 
pathogenic proteins of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS 
CoV-2) virus during its interaction with the host. Even FDA-approved drugs like 
dexamethasone and grazoprevir are not able to curb the viral progression inside 
the host and are reported with adverse effects on body metabolism. In this 
context, we aim to report corilagin a novel, potential dual inhibitor of S and N 
proteins from Terminalia chebula. The bioactive compounds of T. chebula were 
subjected to a series of computational investigations including molecular 
docking simulations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy 
calculations, and PASS pharmacological analysis. The results obtained from these 
studies revealed that corilagin was highly interactive with the S 
(-8.9 kcal/mol) and N (-9.2 kcal/mol) proteins, thereby showing dual inhibition 
activity. It was also found to be stable enough to induce biological activity 
inside the inhibitor binding pocket of the target enzymes throughout the 
dynamics simulation run for 100 ns. This is also confirmed by the changes in the 
protein conformations, evaluated using free energy landscapes. Outcomes from 
this investigation identify corilagin as the lead potential dual inhibitor of S

near future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
848,"OBJECTIVE: Teriparatide (TPTD) and abaloparatide (ABL) are two osteoanabolic 
drugs targeting parathyroid hormone (PTH)1R signalling. This study aimed to 
investigate the effects of TPTD and ABL on the adolescent mandibular growth.
METHOD: In total, 70 4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided 
into 14 groups, treated with intermittent TPDT or ABL at various doses, 
accompanied by mandibular advancement (MA) or not. 3D printing was used to 
fabricate an innovative splint for MA. After a 4-week treatment, morphological 
measurement, histological and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. 
Mandibular condylar chondrocytes (MCCs) were treated with TPTD or ABL, followed 
by CCK-8 assay, alcian blue staining, real time-PCR and immunofluorescent 
staining.
RESULT: In vivo, TPTD or ABL alone increased the condylar length and cartilage 
thickness, with up-regulated SOX9 and COL II, whilst down-regulated COL X; 
however, when combined with MA, the promotive effects were attenuated. TPTD or 
ABL alone increased the mandibular body height and mandibular angle width, 
whilst increased the mandibular body length and alveolar bone width when 
combined with MA. In vitro, TPTD or ABL enhanced the MCC proliferation, 
glycosaminoglycan synthesis, COL II and SOX9 expression, whilst down-regulated 
COL X, Ihh and PTH1R expression.
CONCLUSION: Both ABL and TPTD enhance mandibular growth in adolescent rats with 
site-specific and mechano-related effects, including propelling chondrogenesis 
at the condylar cartilage and promoting bone apposition at other 
mechano-responsive sites. They behave as promising drugs for mandibular growth 
modification, and in general ABL seems more potent than TPTD in this context."
849,"Cancer immunotherapy agents fight cancer via immune system stimulation and have 
made significant advances in minimizing side effects and prolonging the survival 
of patients with solid tumors. However, major limitations still exist in cancer 
immunotherapy, including the inefficiency of immune response stimulation in

850,"OBJECTIVE: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although it is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous 
disease, it is usually treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Here, we aimed to 
investigate gene expression frequency with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and 
the relation of gene mutations with remission and relapse status in patients 
with DLBCLs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated gene mutation profiles by NGS in patients 
with DLBCL-NOS and analyzed the correlation between gene mutations and response 
and relapse rates and other clinical indices.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight of forty patients were evaluated. The most commonly 
mutated genes were ANKRD, BRCA1, BRCA2, EZH2, KMTC2, MYC, MYD88, NF1, NOTCH1, 
PMS2, PTEN, and WRN. The relapse rate was found higher in DLBCL patients with 
ANKRD26, BRCA2, MYD88, and NOTCH1 mutations. Also, remission duration was found 
shorter in patients with ANKRD26, BRCA2, and MYD88 mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the presence of some genetic mutations 
is effective on prognosis in patients with DLBCL. NGS-based evaluation of DLBCL 
treatment can be used in the future."
851,"INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Hypernatremia myopathy is a rare disease often unrecognized 
by clinicians. This study aimed to present a case series of hypernatremic 
myopathy with an emphasis on profiling its clinical characteristics and 
exploring its pathogenesis.
METHODS: We reviewed seven patients with hypernatremic myopathy and reported 
their demographic data, etiology, clinical manifestations, laboratory and 
electrophysiological characteristics. A muscle biopsy was performed on one 
patient.
RESULTS: All patients had hypothalamic lesions as the cause of the hypernatremia 
including craniopharyngioma, germinoma, pituitary adenoma, Langerhans cell 
histiocytosis, and glioma. The clinical manifestations varied from mild weakness 
to complete paralysis. Myalgia and muscle cramps were also observed. Four of the 
patients had rhabdomyolysis on admission and developed acute kidney injury. All 
patients had markedly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) and sodium levels. 
There was a significant positive correlation between serum sodium and CK levels. 
A high prevalence of hypopituitarism in different axes was observed in our 
study. Central hypogonadism (5/7), central hypothyroidism (3/7), and central 
diabetes insipidus (3/7) were the most common manifestations of hypothalamic 
dysfunction. Myopathic changes were observed on needle electromyography. The 
muscle biopsy of one patient showed diffuse necrotic fibers and scattered 
hypercontracted fibers with increased ragged red fibers.
DISCUSSION: Hypernatremia myopathy should be considered in hypernatremic 
patients with muscle weakness, and myalgia. Rhabdomyolysis frequently occurs and 
may lead to acute kidney injury in hypernatremia myopathy. Testing of 
hormone-levels and performance of brain magnetic resonance imaging for possible 
hypothalamic lesions are strongly recommended. This article is protected by

852,"PURPOSE: Clinically, the management of cystic renal masses is tricky. The study 
aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic microwave 
ablation-assisted partial nephrectomy (LMAPN) for cystic renal tumors.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 2017 and January 2022, LMAPN was 
performed on 43 patients (29 men and 14 women; age range: 22-80 years; median 
age 54 years) with Bosniak category III (n = 15) or IV (n = 28) cystic renal 
tumors (size range: 1.2-5.0 cm; mean size 2.8 cm). The median follow-up period 
was 26 months (range: 7-56 months). Baseline and perioperative data, 
pathological features, renal function, postoperative complications and oncologic 
outcomes were collected and evaluated.
RESULTS: Forty-three cystic renal tumors were successfully managed by LMAPN. The 
mean operating time was 79 min (range: 40-130 min). The mean time of renal 
pedicle clamping was 19 min (range: 12-25 min). Mean intraoperative blood loss 
was 28.4 mL (range: 10-80 mL). The mean postoperative hospitalization duration 
was 4 days (range: 2-6 days). Negative surgical margins were diagnosed in all 
cases. During the follow-up, no patient appeared with distant metastasis, wound 
or peritoneal cavity implantation. No major but minor complications of 
Clavien-Dindo grade I were encountered after the operation. The 1-, 3- and 
4-year overall survival rate was 100%, 96.6% and 88.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study focusing on LMAPN for cystic renal tumors, 
demonstrating its favorable feasibility, safety and disease control. Long-term 
follow-up is necessary to draw conclusions on the preference and advantages of 
the new therapeutic approach."
853,"The collateral impact of antibiotics on the microbiome has attained increasing 
attention. However, the ecological consequences of long-term antibiotic exposure 
on the gut microbiome, including antibiotic resistance, are still limited. Here, 
we investigated long-term exposure effects to amoxicillin on the human gut 
microbiome and resistome. Fecal samples were collected from 20 patients 
receiving 3-months of amoxicillin or placebo treatment as part of a Norwegian 
multicenter clinical trial on chronic low back pain (AIM study). Samples were 
collected at baseline, last day of treatment, and 9 months after antibiotic 
cessation. The abundance and diversity of microbial and resistome composition 
were characterized using whole shotgun and functional metagenomic sequencing 
data. While the microbiome profiles of placebo subjects were stable over time, 
discernible changes in diversity and overall microbiome composition were 
observed after amoxicillin treatment. In particular, health-associated 
short-chain fatty acid producing species significantly decreased in proportion. 
However, these changes were short-lived as the microbiome showed overall 
recovery 9 months post-treatment. On the other hand, exposure to long-term 
amoxicillin was associated with an increase in total antimicrobial resistance 
gene load and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes, with persistent 
changes even at 9 months post-treatment. Additionally, beta-lactam resistance 
was the most affected antibiotic class, suggesting a targeted response to 
amoxicillin, although changes at the gene level varied across individuals. 
Overall, our results suggest that the impact of prolonged amoxicillin exposure 
was more explicit and long-lasting in the fecal resistome than in microbiome 
composition. Such information is relevant for designing rational administration 
guidelines for antibiotic therapies."
854,"BACKGROUND: There is limited data on the pattern and severity of myocardial 
injury in patients with COVID-19 vaccination associated myocarditis.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to define the myocardial damage occurring after BNT162b2 
vaccination, raise awareness about adverse reactions developing after 
vaccination, and determine the patterns and scope of Cardiac magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) findings.
PATIENTS/METHODS: A total of 9 patients diagnosed with vaccine-associated 
myopericarditis were followed up.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patient at diagnosis was 15.3 ± 1.0 (range: 14-17) 
years, and all patients were male. Seven patients presented with myocarditis 
symptoms after their second vaccine dose, one patient presented with 
pericarditis symptoms after his first dose, and the other patient presented with 
myocarditis symptoms after his booster dose. The median time at presenting to 
the hospital was 3 (range: 2-22) days. Seven (77.7%) patients had abnormal 
electrocardiography (ECG) findings, and the most prevalent finding was diffuse 
ST-segment elevation. Initial cardiac MRI results were abnormal in all patients, 
where 8 (88.8%) patients had late gadolinium enhancement, and 5 (55.5%) had 
myocardial edoema. Three patients showed local left ventricular wall-motion 
abnormalities. In their follow-up MRIs 3-6 months later, myocardial edoema was 
present in 2 (28.5%) patients, while late gadolinium enhancement was present in 
all patients (7/7, 100%, 2 patients did not have control MRI time). Hypokinetic 
segments were still present in one of the 3 patients. No negative cardiac events 
were observed in the short-term follow-up of any patient.
CONCLUSION: Further follow-up evaluation and larger multicenter studies are 
needed to determine the clinical significance of persistent cardiac MRI 
abnormalities."
855,"AIM: There are limited data on the impact of 2 vs 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine in 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The primary aim of the study was 
to assess the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine based on number of administered doses 
in patients with IBD.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX, a 
multi-institutional database to compare patients with IBD who received 1, 2, or 
3 doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 to unvaccinated IBD patients 
(1.1.2020-7.26.2022) to assess the risk of COVID-19 after 1:1 propensity score 
matching. We also evaluated the impact of vaccine on a composite of severe 
COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, intubation, intensive care unit 
care, acute kidney injury, or mortality.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, vaccinated patients with 2 (adjusted 
OR [aOR], 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-0.9) and 3 doses (aOR, 0.7; 95% 
CI, 0.5-0.9) were found to have a lower risk of COVID-19 compared with 
unvaccinated patients. Vaccinated patients with IBD had a lower risk of severe 
COVID-19 outcomes (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9) compared with unvaccinated 
patients. There was no difference in the risk of COVID-19 in IBD patients with 2 
compared with 3 doses (aOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.7-1.3). However, IBD patients with 2 
doses were at an increased risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19 (aOR, 1.78; 
95% CI, 1.02-3.11) compared with those that received 3 doses.
CONCLUSION: Vaccinated patients with IBD had a lower risk of severe COVID-19 
outcomes compared with unvaccinated patients. A third dose of COVID-19 vaccine 
compared with 2 doses decreases the risk of hospitalization but not breakthrough 
infection in patients with IBD."
856,"BACKGROUND: STN1013001 is an innovative latanoprost cationic emulsion for 
open-angle glaucoma/ocular hypertension (OAG/OHT) and ocular surface disease 
(OSD).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A 5-year, 7 health states, 1-year cycle early Markov 
model-supported cost-utility analysis (CUA) of STN1013001 vs. other latanoprost 
formulations (Latanoprost) followed the Italian National Health Service (INHS) 
perspective.One-way, probabilistic and scenario sensitivity analyses tested the 
uncertainty of the baseline results. Value of information analysis (VOIA) 
investigated the potential cost-effectiveness of collecting further evidence.
RESULTS: Over 5 years, the Markov model-supported CUA predicts STN1013001 to be 
potentially highly cost-effective vs. Latanoprost (+€57.60 cost at €2020 values; 
+0.089 Quality-Adjusted Life Years).The Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (€647.65) 
falls well below the lower limit of the acceptability range proposed for Italy 
(€25,000-€40,000).Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the baseline 
findings. VOIA highlighted that further information might only be cost-effective 
for OAG/OHT utilities and OSD-related disutility.
CONCLUSION: STN1013001 is potentially highly cost-effective and strongly 
dominant vs. Latanoprost for OAG/OHT+OSD patients from the INHS perspective. 
These findings should be re-assessed using the data from the ongoing Phase III 
trial (NCT04133311) comparing the efficacy and safety of STN1013001 vs. 
Latanoprost and with future real-world CUAs upon the availability of STN1013001 
on the Italian market."
857,"INTRODUCTION: The introduction of effective human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccination, screening, and treatment programs has led the World Health 
Organization to call for the global elimination of cervical cancer. Assessing 
progress towards this goal is supported through monitoring vaccination coverage 
and its impact.
AREAS COVERED: We performed a targeted review to assess the characteristics of 
HPV-related data systems from seven high-income countries (HICs) that 
represented varied approaches, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, 
Scotland, Sweden, and the United States (US). Included data systems focused on 
preventive and early detection measures: HPV vaccination and cervical screening 
programs, as well as HPV-related disease outcomes. Differences were observed in 
approach to development of data systems, along with variation in geographical 
scope and methods of data collection.
A challenge exists in how to best follow-up the ongoing global-scale elimination 
efforts in a comprehensive manner. These sources provide a wealth of information 
regarding the strengths and limitations of, and notable variation among, current 
data systems used in HICs. This review can inform improvements to existing 
prevention programs and the implementation of new programs in other countries, 
and thus support optimization of cervical cancer prevention policy."
858,"Chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs) are a common neurosurgical disease for which 
middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization is emerging as an attractive and 
efficacious endovascular treatment modality. We present the first known case of 
a Streptococcus intermedius epidural abscess that resulted following MMA 
embolization for a left-sided CSDH that required evacuation and washout through 
a craniotomy. Intracranial infections can be a potentially devastating 
complication from MMA embolization in this patient population."
859,"Introduction: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided natural orifice transluminal 
gallbladder polypectomy provides a minimally invasive alternative to 
cholecystectomy. The study aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of 
protocol for gallbladder endoscopic mucosal resection (gEMR) under EUS guidance 
using a porcine model.Material and methods: Fifteen Bama mini pigs were randomly 
divided into the control (CG, n = 3) and experimental (EG, n = 12) groups. 
EUS-guided fine needle aspiration was performed in the CG and used to establish 
a gallbladder pathway for polyp resection under EUS guidance in the EG. 
Procedural safety was evaluated using routine blood and biochemical tests, 
microbial bile cultures, histopathological tests, and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays for inflammatory adhesion factors.Results: EUS-guided metal 
stents were successfully deployed in all 12 pigs. Two cases of stent 
displacement occurred postoperatively, and one pig died of infectious 
peritonitis on the first day after stent implantation. In 11 surviving 
experimental animals, mature gallbladder paths were formed at 7-14 days after 
gastro-cholecystostomy, through which gEMR of gallbladder polyps was 
successfully performed. There were no significant changes in levels of 
inflammatory and adhesion factors during the postoperative process.Conclusions: 
EUS-gEMR may be a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment approach for 
gallbladder polyps."
860,"BACKGROUND: Survival after meningioma surgery is often reported with inadequate 
allowance for competing causes of death.
METHODS: We processed the Système National des Données de Santé, the French 
administrative medical database to retrieve appropriate patients' case of 
surgically treated meningiomas. The Pohar Perme relative survival (RS) method 
was implement.
RESULTS: A total of 28,778 patients were identified between 2007 and 2017 of 
which 75% were female. Median age at surgery 59 years. Cranial convexity was the 
most common (24.7%) location and, benign meningioma represented 91.5% of all 
meningioma. Median follow-up was 3.5 years interquartile range [3.4-3.5]. At 
data collection, 2,232 patients were dead. The five-year survival relative to 
the expected survival of an age- and gender-matched French standard population 
was 96.2% 95% confidence interval (CI)[95.7-96.8]. Meningioma absolute excess 
risk of death was 973/100,000 person-years 95%CI[887-1068] (p< .001). The 
related standardised mortality ratio was 1.8 95%CI[1.7-1.9] (p< .001). In the 
adjusted model, male gender (hazard ratio [HR] =1.39, 95%CI[1.27-1.54], 
p< .001), age at surgery (HR=0.97, 95%CI[0.97-0.97], p < .001), type 2 
neurofibromatosis (HR=2.95, 95%CI[1.95-4.46], p < .001), comorbidities HR=1.39, 
95%CI[1.36-1.42], p < .001), location (HR=0.8, 95%CI[0.67-0.95], p= .0111),

and radiotherapy (HR=1.43, 95%CI[1.26-1.62], p < .001) were established as 
independent predictors of RS.
CONCLUSION: This unique study highlights the excess mortality associated with 
meningioma disease. Many factors such as gender, age, location, 
histopathological grading, redo surgery influence the RS."
861,"INTRODUCTION: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is replacing viral 
hepatitis as the leading cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) in many Western countries. NAFLD-associated HCC usually affects 
older patients with multiple comorbidities, frequently develops in the absence 
of cirrhosis and is often diagnosed later with worse chance of survival. The 
worse prognosis is also due to limited surveillance strategies and a lower 
efficacy of standard treatments.
AREAS COVERED: We evaluate the available literature to understand the current 
surveillance strategies and treatment limitations in the work up of 
NAFLD-associated HCC, focusing on the differences with HCC associated with other 
liver diseases.
EXPERT OPINION: In this review we discuss epidemiology and risk factors for HCC 
in NAFLD patients and address key HCC surveillance and management issues. 
Although most data are still preliminary, the detection of non-cirrhotic NAFLD 
patients at increased risk for HCC and the potential adoption of novel screening 
tools could lead to accurate and suitable HCC surveillance and management 
strategies for NAFLD patients."
862,"Flow cytometry is a sophisticated technology used widely in both basic research 
and as a routine tool in clinical diagnosis. The technology has progressed from 
single parameter detection in the 1970s and 1980s to high end multicolor 
analysis, with currently 30 parameters detected simultaneously, allowing the 
identification and purification of rare subpopulations of cells of interest. 
Flow cytometry continues to evolve and expand to facilitate the investigation of 
new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. The present review gives an overview of 
basic theory and instrumentation, presents and compares the advantages and 
disadvantages of conventional, spectral and imaging flow cytometry as well as 
mass cytometry. Current methodologies and applications in both research, pre- 
and clinical settings are discussed, as well as potential limitations and future 
evolution. This finding encourages the reader to promote such relationship 
between basic science, diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach since the 
standard methods have limitations (e.g., in differentiating the cells after 
staining). Moreover, such path inspires future cytometry specialists develop 
new/alternative frontiers between pre- and clinical diagnosis and be more 
flexible in designing the study for both human as well as veterinary medicine."
863,"BACKGROUND: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) has a relapsing-remitting course and is 
associated with high burden of comorbidities, leading to repeated 
hospitalizations. We investigated the burden, risk factors, causes and outcomes 
of hospitalization and readmission in patients with GCA in a US national cohort.
METHODS: Using the 2017 US National Readmission Database, we identified adults 
≥50-year- old hospitalized with GCA between January-June 2017, with at least a 
6-month of follow-up. We estimated the burden of hospitalization including 
6-month risk of readmission, total days spent in hospital and costs, annually. 
We examined patient-, hospital-, and index hospitalization-related factors for 
6-month readmission and total days of hospitalization, through binomial logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: We included 1,206 patients hospitalized with GCA (70% women, median 
age, 77y), with 13% patients experiencing GCA-related ophthalmological 
complications at index admission. On follow-up, 3% died, and 34% patients were 
readmitted within 6 months, primarily for infections (23%) and cardiovascular 
diseases (15%). Charlson's comorbidity index ≥1, smoking, and obesity were 
associated with readmission. Patients with GCA spent 5 [3-11] days in median in 
hospital per year, with those in top quartile spending 19 [14-26] days/year in 
hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GCA frequently experience unplanned healthcare 
utilization, with 1 in 3 experiencing readmission within 6 months, and 3% dying 
within the follow-up. Infection and cardiovascular diseases are common causes of 
readmission, and may be related to corticosteroid exposure. Population health 
management strategies are required for these vulnerable patients with GCA. This

864,"OBJECTIVES: The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is commonly involved in patients 
with systemic sclerosis (SSc) with varied manifestations. As our understanding 
of SSc GI disease pathogenesis and risk stratification is limited, we sought to 
investigate whether patterns of esophageal dysfunction associate with specific 
clinical phenotypes in SSc.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center (JHSC) 
Research Registry who completed high resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) 
studies as part of their clinical care between 2011 and 2020 were identified. 
Associations between esophageal abnormalities on HREM [absent contractility 
(AC), ineffective esophageal motility (IEM), hypotensive LES (hypoLES)] and 
patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and autoantibody profiles were 
examined.
RESULTS: Ninety-five patients with SSc had HREM data. Sixty-five patients 
(68.4%) had AC (37 patients with only AC, 28 patients with AC and a hypoLES), 9 
patients (9.5%) had IEM, and 11 patients (11.6%) had normal studies. AC was 
significantly associated with diffuse cutaneous disease (38.5% vs. 10.0%, 
p<0.01), more severe Raynaud phenomenon (RP) including digital pits, ulcers, or 
gangrene (56.9% vs. 30.0%; p=0.02) and reduced median diffusing capacity of lung 
for carbon monoxide (DLCO; 50.6% vs. 72.2%, p=0.03). AC was observed in most of 
the patients who died (13/14, p= 0.06). These findings were not seen in patients 
with IEM.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with SSc, AC is associated with a significantly more 
severe clinical phenotype. IEM may associate with a milder phenotype. Further 
studies are needed to evaluate AC, IEM and their clinical impact relative to the 
timing of other end organ complications in SSc."
865,"BACKGROUND: Castration-resistance is common in advanced prostatic 
adenocarcinomas (PACs) treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and 
usually occurs after 2 years following treatment. A minority of PACs confer 
innate ADT resistance without prior hormonal treatment. The expression of HMWCK 
in PAC cells has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the 
clinicopathologic and genomic features of HMWCK-expressing PACs and the 
relationship to ADT resistance.
METHODS: A total of 469 PACs were studied for HMWCK expression (39 
postradiotherapy, 57 post-ADT, 373 treatment-naïve PACs). Clinicopathologic 
correlations of the HMWCK expression with tumor grade groups, specific tumor 
morphologies, tumor stages and disease recurrence/persistence/progression were 
performed. Five HMWCK+ PACs were also sequenced for genetic alterations.
RESULTS: Thirty one of the 469 cases (6.6%) showed variable HMWCK+ PAC. The 
HMWCK+ PAC often focally presented in the tumor and vast majority were 
associated with high Gleason scores and unfavorable growth patterns (cribriform, 
comedo-necrosis, and intraductal carcinoma) as well as high tumor stages. A 
small percentage of the HMWCK+ PCA (2/31, 6.5%) presented with frank squamous 
histomorphology. Vast majority (22/31, 87%) had no history of prior ADT. The 
HMWCK+ PAC all displayed diminished to lost expression of AR/NKX3.1. Most of the 
cases progressed within 12 months of ADT or disease persisted despite ADT. Of 
the 5 HMWCK+ PACs subjected to gene sequencing, 4 presented with PTEN/PI3K/MAPK 
pathway alterations.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated HMWCK+ PAC to be a novel type of innate 
ADT-resistant PAC. Overexpression of HMWCK in PAC can be potentially used as a 
surrogate biomarker for aggressive and innate hormone-refractory PACs. The 
genetic alterations imply potential therapeutic implications of PI3K/MAPK 
inhibitors in the treatment of these deadly diseases."
866,"Only 100 years ago, traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) was commonly lethal. 
Today, most people who sustain SCI survive with continual efforts to improve 
their quality of life and neurological outcomes. SCI epidemiology is changing as 
preventative interventions reduce injuries in younger individuals, and there is 
an increased incidence of incomplete injuries in aging populations. Early 
treatment has become more intensive with decompressive surgery and proactive 
interventions to improve spinal cord perfusion. Accurate data, including 
specialized outcome measures, are crucial to understanding the impact of 
epidemiological and treatment trends. Dedicated SCI clinical research and data 
networks and registries have been established in the United States, Canada, 
Europe, and several other countries. We review four registry networks, the North 
American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) SCI Registry, the National Spinal Cord 
Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) Database, the Rick Hansen SCI Registry (RHSCIR), 
and the European Multi-Center Study about Spinal Cord Injury Study (EMSCI). We 
compare the registries' focuses, data platforms, advanced analytics use, and 
impacts. We also describe how registries' data can be combined with EHR or 
shared using federated analysis to protect registrants' identities. These 
registries have identified changes in epidemiology, recovery patterns, 
complication incidence, and the impact of practice changes like early 
decompression. They've also revealed latent disease-modifying factors, helped 
develop clinical trial stratification models and served as matched control 
groups in clinical trials. Advancing SCI clinical science for personalized 
medicine requires advanced analytical techniques, including machine learning and 
includes counterfactual analysis, and the creation of digital twins. Registries 
and other data sources help drive innovation in SCI clinical science."
867,"BACKGROUND: Like DNA methylation, histone modifications are considered important 
processes for epigenetic alterations in gene function, and abnormally high 
expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a key role in many human 
diseases. In addition to regulating the acetylation levels of histone and 
non-histone proteins and gene transcription, HDAC inhibitors as antitumor drugs 
can also affect the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway in tumor cells. Prostate 
cancer (PCa) is one of the most heritable malignancies in which DDR pathway 
defects can be detected in a considerable proportion of cases. Such defects are 
more prevalent in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and are highly 
enriched in metastatic lesions. There is currently evidence that DDR 
pathway-deficient PCa is associated with high-risk biological behaviors and 
response sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. Platinum-based drugs have 
been used in multiple clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination with 
other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of CRPC.
METHODS: This study evaluated the combined anticancer effect of (cisplatin) CDDP 
and the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat (SAHA) on three androgen-dependent cell lines 
PC-3, DU-145, and C4-2B in vitro. The efficacy and safety of SAHA combined with 
CDDP in the treatment of CRPC were further verified through animal experiments.
RESULTS: The combination of the two drugs increases cytotoxic effects by 
increasing DNA damage. Our results showed that the SAHA could not only reduce 
the expression of homologous recombinant repair proteins BRCA2, BRCA1, PARP1, 
and RAD51, but also decrease enzymes that Reduce the key enzymes of GSH 
biosynthesis, GSS and GCLC, and GSTP1 which can catalyze the binding of GSH to 
cisplatin. The intracellular GSH level also decreased with the increase of SAHA 
concentration, at the same time, the content of intracellular Pt element.
CONCLUSION: The combination of CDDP and SAHA can produce synergistic anticancer 
effects in androgen-independent PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results open 
up a new avenue for the effective treatment of CRPC. To optimize the 
chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced PCa, it is necessary to further 
study the molecular mechanism of platinum drugs, HDAC inhibitors, and their 
combined action."
868,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports the existence of a sex difference in 
immunity to tuberculosis (TB). This is most often to the detriment of males. 
This study aimed to assess the association between scar size from bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and mortality risk stratified by sex.
METHODS: Kaplan-Meier survivor functions and Cox proportional hazard models were 
used to assess mortality risk by sex and scar size. Groups were further compared 
by clinical and epidemiological characteristics.
RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2019, 2944 eligible patients were identified, of whom 
1003 were included in the final analysis. Males with BCG scars, particularly 
large scars, were less likely to die within 1 y of diagnosis than males with no 
scar (adjusted hazard ratio 0.36 [95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.88]). In 
contrast, females with small scars trended towards higher mortality than females 
with no scars or females with large scars.
CONCLUSIONS: BCG protects against death in male but not female patients with TB. 
More research is needed to determine the mechanisms underpinning these sex 
differences and whether they are generalizable beyond this setting."
869,"Autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) are defined as disorders of innate immunity. 
They were initially defined in contrast to autoimmune diseases because of the 
lack of involvement of the adaptive immune system and circulating 
autoantibodies. The four monogenic AIDs first described are called the 
""historical"" AIDs and include: Familial Mediterranean Fever (associated with 
MEFV mutations), cryopyrinopathies (associated with NLRP3 mutations), Tumor 
Necrosis Factor Receptor-associated Periodic Syndrome (associated with TNFRSF1A 
mutations) and Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (associated with MVK mutations). In 
the last 10 years, >50 new monogenic AIDs have been discovered due to genetic 
advances. The most important discovery for adult patients is VEXAS syndrome 
associated with somatic UBA1 mutations leading to an autoinflammatory disease 
affecting mostly elderly men. Diagnosis of monogenic AIDs is based on personal 
and family history and detailed analysis of symptoms associated with febrile 
attacks, in the context of elevated peripheral inflammatory markers. This review 
proposes a practical approach of the diagnosis of the main monogenic AIDs among 
adult patients to guide the clinician."
870,"OBJECTIVES: The multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score is an objective 
tool for monitoring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we 
report a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical value of the MBDA 
score in RA.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in five medical databases: 
MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Embase, Scopus, and Web of 
Science, from inception to 13 October 2021. Original articles reporting on the 
performance of the MBDA score's correlation with conventional disease activity 
measures, or the predictive and the discriminative value of the MBDA score for 
radiographic progression, therapy response, remission, and relapse were 
included.
RESULTS: Our systematic search provided a total of 1190 records. After selection 
and citation searches, we identified 32 eligible studies. We recorded moderate 
correlations between MBDA score and conventional DAMs at baseline (COR = 0.45, 
CI: 0.28-0.59; I2 = 71.0% for DAS28 CRP and COR = 0.55, CI: 0.19-0.78; I2 = 0.0% 
for DAS28-ESR) and at follow-up (COR = 0.44, CI: 0.28-0.57; I2 = 70.0% for DAS28 
CRP), and found that the odds of radiographic progression were significantly 
higher for patients with a high baseline MBDA score (>44) than for patients with 
a low baseline MBDA score (<30) (OR = 1.03, CI: 1.02-1.05; I2 = 10.0%).
CONCLUSION: MBDA score might be used as an objective disease activity marker. In 
addition, it is also a reliable prognostic marker of radiographic progression."
871,"The impact of the 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) of 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) needs study. We analysed data from 989 MDS 
subjects classified using the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to

criteria of MDS-SF3B1 identifies a more homogenous disease entity than the WHO 
2016 criteria of myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS). MDS, 
not otherwise specified with single lineage dysplasia (MDS, NOS-SLD) patients 
had a better prognosis than MDS, NOS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS, NOS-MLD) 
patients. MDS with mutated TP53 and MDS/acute myeloid leukaemia with mutated 
TP53 patients had the briefest survivals. These data support the ICC of MDS, 
which allows more accurate diagnoses and risk stratification."

873,"The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) controls locomotion in vertebrates. In 
humans with Parkinson disease, locomotor deficits are increasingly associated 
with decreased activity in the MLR. This brainstem region, commonly considered 
to include the cuneiform and pedunculopontine nuclei, has been explored as a 
target for deep brain stimulation to improve locomotor function, but the results 
are variable, from modest to promising. However, the MLR is a heterogeneous 
structure, and identification of the best cell type to target is only beginning. 
Here, I review the studies that uncovered the role of genetically defined MLR 
cell types, and I highlight the cells whose activation improves locomotor 
function in animal models of Parkinson disease. The promising cell types to 
activate comprise some glutamatergic neurons in the cuneiform and caudal 
pedunculopontine nuclei, as well as some cholinergic neurons of the 
pedunculopontine nucleus. Activation of MLR GABAergic neurons should be avoided, 
since they stop locomotion or evoke bouts flanked with numerous stops. MLR is 
also considered a potential target in spinal cord injury, supranuclear palsy, 
primary progressive freezing of gait, or stroke. Better targeting of the MLR 
cell types should be achieved through optimized deep brain stimulation 
protocols, pharmacotherapy, or the development of optogenetics for human use."
874,"Families in Ireland often wait over 1 year to see a genetic counselor (GC). This 
qualitative study aimed to explore the views of families who received a 
diagnosis of 22q11DS in Ireland regarding the need for timely access to genetic 
counseling at the point of diagnosis. Twenty participants were recruited through 
the '22q Ireland' support group, giving a response rate of approximately 10% of 
the total support group members. Semi-structured interviews were conducted 
online and by telephone which explored experiences of receiving diagnoses, 
medical care, genetic counseling, mental health, and coping with the diagnosis. 
Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. The 
experiences of 20 participants were classified into five main themes: Receiving 
Diagnosis, Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (HCPs, excluding GCs), 
Medical Care, Information, and Impact of Condition. Participants reported 
receiving diagnoses for their children in a sub-optimal manner due to 
inappropriate settings and insufficient information, support, and pre-test 
counseling. Parents reported feeling responsible for managing their child's 
complex and fragmented medical care. Participants reported insufficient empathy 
and little awareness of 22q11DS among HCPs. Participants perceived genetic 
counseling to be associated with family planning and reported delayed, if any, 
access to services. Mental health was a particular worry among participants. 
Conferences about 22q11DS are the main source of information for parents. 
Participants reported a range of emotions after diagnosis and described the 
family impact. The findings suggest both an association between HCPs' poor 
understanding of 22q11DS and the perceived lack of empathy from HCPs and 
fragmented medical care. There is an identified need for advocacy of the GC 
profession in Ireland to support these families. Increased awareness of 22q11DS 
among HCPs and the development of a coordinated care pathway for 22q11DS, with 
timely access to genetic counseling, may improve care and lead to better 
outcomes."
875,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which is associated with 
the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been described as an 
inflammatory complication of exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It carries a risk of serious and lethal 
complications, including cardiogenic shock. Here, we report the pathological 
findings of the pericardium in a 10-year-old child with MIS-C, who developed 
pericarditis-induced cardiac tamponade. In the patient's pericardium, the 
numbers of infiltrating CD68+ macrophages; CD3+ , CD4+ , and CD8+ T cells; and 
myeloperoxidase+ granulocytes were increased, although the number of CD20+ B 
cells was not. These findings provide a clue to understanding the 
pathophysiology of MIS-C."
876,"AIMS: Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is one the most frequent muscular 
dystrophies in adults. Although DM1 has long been considered mainly a muscle 
disorder, growing evidence suggests the involvement of peripheral nerves in the 
pathogenicity of DM1 raising the question of whether motoneurons (MNs) actively 
contribute to neuromuscular defects in DM1.
METHODS: By using micropatterned 96-well plates as a co-culture platform, we 
generated a functional neuromuscular model combining DM1 and MBNL-knock-out 
human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived MNs and human healthy skeletal 
muscle cells.
RESULTS: This approach led to the identification of pre-synaptic defects which 
affect the formation or stability of the neuromuscular junction at an early 
developmental stage. These neuropathological defects could be reproduced by the 
loss of RNA-binding MBNL proteins, whose loss of function in vivo is associated 
with muscular defects associated with DM1. These experiments indicate that the 
functional defects associated with MNs can be directly attributed to MBNL family 
proteins. Comparative transcriptomic analyses also revealed specific 
neuronal-related processes regulated by these proteins that are commonly 
misregulated in DM1.
CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the application to DM1, our approach to generating a robust 
and reliable human neuromuscular system should facilitate disease modelling 
studies and drug screening assays."
877,"It has been reported that stressful events in early life influence behavior in 
adulthood and are associated with different psychiatric disorders, such as major 
depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety 
disorder. Maternal separation (MS) is a representative animal model for 
reproducing childhood stress. It is used as an animal model for depression, and 
has well-known effects, such as increasing anxiety behavior and causing 
abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This study 
investigated the effect of MS on anxiety or aggression-like behavior and the 
number of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus. Mice were separated from their 
dams for four hours per day for 19 d from postnatal day two. Elevated plus maze 
(EPM) test, resident-intruder (RI) test, and counted glutamic acid decarboxylase 
67 (GAD67) or parvalbumin (PV) positive cells in the hippocampus were executed 
using immunohistochemistry. The maternal segregation group exhibited increased 
anxiety and aggression in the EPM test and the RI test. GAD67-positive neurons 
were increased in the hippocampal regions we observed: dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, 
CA1, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. PV-positive neurons were 
increased in the DG, CA3, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. Consistent with 
behavioral changes, corticosterone was increased in the MS group, suggesting 
that the behavioral changes induced by MS were expressed through the effect on 
the HPA axis. Altogether, MS alters anxiety and aggression levels, possibly 
through alteration of cytoarchitecture and output of the ventral hippocampus 
that induces the dysfunction of the HPA axis."
878,"Ion channels regulate a large number of cellular functions and their functional 
role in many diseases makes them potential therapeutic targets. Given their 
diverse distribution across multiple organs, the roles of ion channels, 
particularly in age-associated transcriptomic changes in specific organs, are 
yet to be fully revealed. Using RNA-seq data, we investigated the rat 
transcriptomic profiles of ion channel genes across 11 organs/tissues and 4 
developmental stages in both sexes of Fischer 344 rats and identify 
tissue-specific and age-dependent changes in ion channel gene expression. 
Organ-enriched ion channel genes were identified. In particular, the brain 
showed higher tissue-specificity of ion channel genes, including Gabrd, Gabra6, 
Gabrg2, Grin2a, and Grin2b. Notably, age-dependent changes in ion channel gene 
expression were prominently observed in the thymus, including in Aqp1, Clcn4, 
Hvcn1, Itpr1, Kcng2, Kcnj11, Kcnn3, and Trpm2. Our comprehensive study of ion 
channel gene expression will serve as a primary resource for biological studies 
of aging-related diseases caused by abnormal ion channel functions."
879,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) involves multi-factorial conditions linked to an 
elevated risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. 
Pre-metabolic syndrome (pre-MetS) possesses two MetS components but does not 
meet the MetS diagnostic criteria. Although cardiac autonomic derangements are 
evident in MetS, there is little information on their status in pre-MetS 
subjects. In this study, we sought to examine cardiac autonomic functions in 
pre-MetS and to determine which MetS component is more responsible for impaired 
cardiac autonomic functions. A total of 182 subjects were recruited and divided 
into healthy controls (n=89) and pre-MetS subjects (n=93) based on inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. We performed biochemical profiles on fasting blood samples 
to detect pre-MetS. Using standardized protocols, we evaluated anthropometric 
data, body composition, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability 
(HRV), and autonomic function tests (AFTs). We further examined these parameters 
in pre-MetS subjects for each MetS component. Compared to healthy controls, we 
observed a significant cardiac autonomic dysfunction (CAD) through reduced BRS, 
lower overall HRV, and altered AFT parameters in pre-MetS subjects, accompanied 
by markedly varied anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters. 
Furthermore, all examined BRS, HRV, and AFT parameters exhibited an abnormal 
trend and significant correlation toward hyperglycemia. This study demonstrates 
CAD in pre-MetS subjects with reduced BRS, lower overall HRV, and altered AFT 
parameters. Hyperglycemia was considered an independent determinant of 
alterations in all the examined BRS, HRV, and AFT parameters. Thus, 
hyperglycemia may contribute to CAD in pre-MetS subjects before progressing to 
MetS."
880,"BACKGROUND: Kidney stones are a highly prevalent disease worldwide. 
Additionally, both environmental and occupational exposure to Pb and Cd continue 
to be prevalent globally and can result in renal toxicity. The objective of this 
study was to examine the potential presence of Pb and Cd in kidney stones, and 
to assess for correlation with demographic factors including smoking, gender, 
age, and kidney stone matrix composition.
METHODS: Patient kidney stones (n = 96) were analyzed using Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy to identify the stone constituents. Cd and Pb 
concentrations (µg/g) were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass 
spectrometry. Cd and Pb concentrations were correlated using bivariable and 
multivariable statistical analysis with demographic factors (age, gender, 
smoking status), and kidney stone composition.
RESULTS: Kidney stone Cd (median 0.092 µg/g, range 0.014 to 2.46) and Pb 
concentrations (median 0.95 µg/g, range 0.060 to 15.4) were moderately 
correlated (r = 0.56, P < 0.0001). Cd concentrations were positively associated 
with patient history of smoking, patient age, and calcium oxalate monohydrate 
levels while negatively associated with struvite and uric acid/uric acid 
dihydrate. Pb concentrations were positively associated with females and apatite 
levels while negatively associated with uric acid/uric acid dihydrate. After 
holding constant other stone type composition levels, smoking status, and age, 
both Pb and Cd were positively associated with apatite and negatively associated 
with uric acid/uric acid dihydrate, struvite, and calcium carbonate.
CONCLUSIONS: Cd and Pb kidney stone concentrations are associated with specific 
kidney stone types. Cd and Pb kidney stone concentrations are both associated 
with smoking."
881,"Barrett's esophagus (BE) occurs in 5-15% of patients with gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD). While acid suppressive therapy is a critical component of 
BE management to minimize the risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma, 
surgical control of mechanical reflux is sometimes necessary. Magnetic sphincter 
augmentation (MSA) is an increasingly utilized anti-reflux surgical therapy for 
GERD. While the use of MSA is listed as a precaution by the United States Food 
and Drug Administration, there are limited data showing effective BE regression 
with MSA. MSA offers several advantages in BE including effective reflux 
control, anti-reflux barrier restoration and reduced hiatal hernia recurrence. 
However, careful patient selection for MSA is necessary."
882,"AIMS: Low wall shear stress (WSS) is acknowledged to play a role in plaque 
development through its influence on local endothelial function. Also, 
lipid-rich plaques (LRPs) are associated with endothelial dysfunction. However, 
little is known about the interplay between WSS and the presence of lipids with 
respect to plaque progression. Therefore, we aimed to study the differences in 
WSS-related plaque progression between LRPs, non-LRPs, or plaque-free regions in 
human coronary arteries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present single-centre, prospective study, 40 
patients who presented with an acute coronary syndrome successfully underwent 
near-infrared spectroscopy intravascular ultrasound (NIRS-IVUS) and optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) of at least one non-culprit vessel at baseline and 
completed a 1-year follow-up. WSS was computed applying computational fluid 
dynamics to a three-dimensional reconstruction of the coronary artery based on 
the fusion of the IVUS-segmented lumen with a CT-derived centreline, using 
invasive flow measurements as boundary conditions. For data analysis, each 
artery was divided into 1.5 mm/45° sectors. Plaque growth based on IVUS-derived 
percentage atheroma volume change was compared between LRPs, non-LRPs, and 
plaque-free wall segments, as assessed by both OCT and NIRS. Both NIRS- and 
OCT-detected lipid-rich sectors showed a significantly higher plaque progression 
than non-LRPs or plaque-free regions. Exposure to low WSS was associated with a 
higher plaque progression than exposure to mid or high WSS, even in the regions 
classified as a plaque-free wall. Furthermore, low WSS and the presence of 
lipids had a synergistic effect on plaque growth, resulting in the highest 
plaque progression in lipid-rich regions exposed to low shear stress.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that NIRS- and OCT-detected lipid-rich 
regions exposed to low WSS are subject to enhanced plaque growth over a 1-year 
follow-up. The presence of lipids and low WSS proves to have a synergistic 
effect on plaque growth."
883,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the level of ADMA (asymmetric 
dimethylarginine), SDMA (symmetric dimethylarginine), and IL-1β (Interleukin-1β) 
in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from periodontitis patients and control 
subjects.
BACKGROUND: ADMA and SDMA are potentially hazardous non-proteinogenic amino 
acids that limit nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and have many functions in various 
human disorders. ADMA causes a structural change in nitric oxide synthase, while 
SDMA blocks arginine cell uptake. Increased plasma ADMA has been widely 
recognized as a ""trigger"" initiating impaired NO bioavailability and vascular 
dysfunction, which ultimately leads to oxidative stress.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients with periodontitis (P) (Stage III, Grade C, 
n = 25) and 20 control (C) subjects were included in the study. The IL-1β level 
of GCF was measured by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and ADMA and SDMA by liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: Periodontitis patients had higher clinical parameters than controls 
(p < .001). Levels of IL-1β, ADMA and SDMA GCF were statistically significantly 
higher in group P than in group C (respectively; p = .003, p < .0001, 
p < .0001). There was no difference in the ADMA/SDMA ratio (p = .312) between 
the groups. There were significant positive correlations between clinical 
periodontal parameters and IL-1β, ADMA, and SDMA levels (p < .05). ADMA and SDMA 
levels were significantly correlated with IL-1β (p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ADMA and SDMA may be involved in the 
pathogenesis of the periodontal disease."
884,"Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a devastating 
disease in wheat (Triticum aestivum) that results in substantial yield losses 
and mycotoxin contamination. Reliable genetic resources for FHB resistance in 
wheat are lacking. In this study, we characterized glycoside hydrolase 12 (GH12) 
family proteins secreted by F. graminearum. We established that two GH12 
proteins, Fg05851 and Fg11037, have functionally redundant roles in F. 
graminearum colonization of wheat. Furthermore, we determined that the GH12 
proteins Fg05851 and Fg11037 are recognized by the leucine-rich-repeat 
receptor-like protein RXEG1 in the dicot Nicotiana benthamiana. Heterologous 
expression of RXEG1 conferred wheat responsiveness to Fg05851 and Fg11037, 
enhanced wheat resistance to F. graminearum and reduced levels of the mycotoxin 
deoxynivalenol in wheat grains in a Fg05851/Fg11037-dependent manner. In the 
RXEG1 transgenic lines, genes related to pattern-triggered plant immunity, the 
salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and anti-oxidative homeostasis signaling pathways 
were upregulated during F. graminearum infection. However, expression of these 
genes was not significantly changed during infection by the deletion mutant 
ΔFg05851/Fg11037, suggesting that the recognition of Fg05851/Fg11037 by RXEG1 
triggered plant resistance against FHB. Moreover, introducing RXEG1 into three 
other different wheat cultivars via crossing also conferred resistance to F. 
graminearum. Expression of RXEG1 did not have obvious deleterious effects on 
plant growth and development in wheat. Our study reveals that N. benthamiana 
RXEG1 remains effective when transferred into wheat, a monocot, which in turn 
suggests that engineering wheat with interfamily plant immune receptor 
transgenes is a viable strategy for increasing resistance to FHB."
885,"OBJECTIVES: Accurately predicting of progression is important for patients with 
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). We previously reported that bladder 
neck involvement (BNI) was significantly associated with progression of NMIBC. 
In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of the detailed BNI 
location in NMIBC patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 651 patients diagnosed with primary NMIBC 
at a single center between 2000 and 2018. Using the detailed BNI location, 
patients were divided into the following three groups: dorsal BNI (BNId; 4 to 8 
o'clock position), ventral BNI (BNIv; 8 to 4 o'clock but not 4 to 8 o'clock 
position), and non-BNI group. Both time to progression to muscle-invasive 
disease and distant metastasis was compared among the three groups. A prognostic 
model was developed and its discriminative ability was evaluated.
RESULTS: Dorsal bladder neck involvement and BNIv were observed in 43 (6.6%) and 
36 (5.5%) patients, respectively. During a median follow-up of 61 months, 35 
(5.4%) patients progressed. The cumulative incidence at 5 years was 12%, 0%, and 
5.0% in BNId, BNIv, and non-BNI groups, respectively. On multivariate analysis, 
BNId was a significant and independent risk factor for progression, tumor stage 
pT1, and histologic grade G3. One point was assigned to each factor, and 
patients were classified into four well-stratified prognostic groups based on 
the total score.
CONCLUSION: Dorsal bladder neck involvement was an independent and significant 
risk factor for progression in primary NMIBC. Our simple and practical 
prognostic model including BNId is easy to use and may help selecting the 
optimal treatment and its timing."
886,"PURPOSE: After the emergence of the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus, 
vaccination with various vaccines has started to be implemented across the 
world. To identify dermatological reactions developing after the COVID-19 
vaccines administered in Turkey and determine their clinical features and risk 
factors that may play a role in their development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients aged ≥18 years, who presented 
to 13 different dermatology clinics in Turkey between July 2021 and September 
2021 after developing dermatological reactions following the administration of 
the COVID-19 vaccine. After providing written consent, the patients were asked 
to complete a standard survey including questions related to age, gender, 
occupation, comorbidities, the regular medication used, the onset of cutaneous 
reactions after vaccination, and localization of reactions. Dermatological 
reactions were categorized according to whether they developed after the first 
or second dose of the vaccine or whether they occurred after the inactivated or 
messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. The relationship between dermatological reactions 
and some variables such as gender and comorbidities was also evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 269 patients [116 women (43.1%), 153 men (56.9%)] were 
included in the study. It was observed that the dermatological diseases and 
reactions that most frequently developed after vaccination were urticaria 
(25.7%), herpes zoster (24.9%), maculopapular eruption (12.3%), and pityriasis 
rosea (4.5%). The rate of dermatological reactions was 60.6% after the 
administration of the mRNA vaccine and 39.4% after that of the inactivated 
vaccine. There was a statistically significantly higher number of reactions 
among the patients that received the mRNA vaccine (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The most common reactions in our sample were urticaria, herpes 
zoster, and maculopapular eruption. Physicians should know the dermatological 
side effects of COVID-19 vaccines and their clinical features."
887,"Muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders with a 
wide range of the clinical and genetic spectrum. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) 
has been on the rise to become the usual method of choice for molecular 
diagnosis in patients presenting with muscular dystrophy or congenital or 
metabolic myopathy phenotype. Here, we used a panel with 47 genes including not 
only muscular dystrophy but also myopathy-associated genes that had been used as 
a first-tier approach. A total of 146 patients who were referred to our clinic 
with the prediagnosis of muscular dystrophy and/or myopathy were included in the 
study. Dystrophin gene deletion/duplication was ruled out on the patients with a 
preliminary diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In this study, the 
molecular etiology of 67 patients was proved with the gene panel with a 
diagnostic yield of 46%. Causal variants were identified in 23 genes including 
CAPN3(11), DYSF(9), DMD(8), SGCA(5), TTN(4), LAMA2(3), LMNA(3), SGCB(3), 
COL6A1(3), DES (2), CAV3(2), FKRP(2), FKTN(2), ANO5, COL6A2, CLCN1, GNE, 
POMGNT1, POMGNT2, POMT2, SYNE1, TCAP, and FLNC with 16 novel variants. There 
were 27 patients with uncertain molecular results including the ones who had a 
variant of uncertain significance, who had only one heterozygous variant for an 
autosomal recessive disease, and the ones who had two variants in different 
genes. Molecular diagnosis in muscular dystrophy is essential to plan clinical 
management and choosing treatment options. Also, the results will affect the 
reproduction options. Targeted next-generation sequencing is a cost-effective 
method that reduces the WES requirements with a significant diagnostic rate."
888,"BACKGROUND: Vitiligo is an autoimmune dermatological disease characterized by 
hypopigmented macules. Treatments include topical agents, phototherapy, and 
laser therapies. Different lasers should be individually chosen regarding 
location, extent, activity of the disease.
AIMS: This article aims to demonstrate how blue LED is effective and safe, as 
its wavelength is very close to the UV spectrum (415 nm vs. 400 nm), but, unlike 
UV therapy, blue LED have not shown any long-term cancerogenic side effects.
PATIENTS/METHODS: We treated 30 patients affected by vitiligo localized on 
different anatomical areas with blue light-emitting diodes.
RESULTS: Complete repigmentation occurred in 75.33% of treated patients (22 out 
of 30 patients, 14 males, and 8 females). Partial repigmentation occurred in the 
remaining patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Blue LED light may be a safe and well-tolerated way to induce 
repigmentation in patients affected by vitiligo."
889,"Although human hepatocyte-transplanted immunodeficient mice support infection 
with hepatitis viruses, these mice fail to develop viral hepatitis due to the 
lack of an adaptive immune system. In this study, we generated new 
immunodeficiency cDNA-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/SCID/Rag2-/- 
/Jak3-/- mice and established a mouse model with both a humanized liver and 
immune system. Transplantation of human hepatocytes with human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-A24 resulted in establishment of a highly replaced liver in 
cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mice. These mice were successfully infected with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) for a prolonged period and 
facilitate analysis of the effect of anti-HCV drugs. Administration of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from an HLA-A24 donor 
resulted in establishment of 22.6-81.3% human CD45-positive mononuclear cell 
chimerism in liver-infiltrating cells without causing graft-versus-host disease 
in cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mice without human hepatocyte transplantation. 
When mice were transplanted with human hepatocytes and then administered 
HLA-A24-positive human PBMCs, an alloimmune response between transplanted human 
hepatocytes and PBMCs occurred, with production of transplanted 
hepatocyte-specific anti-HLA antibody. In conclusion, we succeeded in 
establishing a humanized liver/immune system characterized by an allo-reaction 
between transplanted human immune cells and human liver using a novel 
cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mouse. This mouse model can be used to generate a 
chronic hepatitis mouse model with a human immune system with application not 
only to hepatitis virus virology but also to investigation of the pathology of 
post-transplantation liver rejection."
890,"The skin is a dynamic ecosystem on which diverse microbes reside. The 
interkingdom interaction between microbial species in the skin microbiota is 
thought to influence the health and disease of the skin although the roles of 
the intra- and interkingdom interactions remain to be elucidated. In this 
context, the interactions between Malassezia and Staphylococcus, the most 
dominant microorganisms in the skin microbiota, have gained attention. This 
study investigated how the interaction between Malassezia and Staphylococcus 
affected the antifungal susceptibility of the fungus to the azole antifungal 
drug ketoconazole. The susceptibility was significantly decreased when 
Malassezia was co-cultured with Staphylococcus. We found that acidification of 
the environment by organic acids produced by Staphylococcus influenced the 
decrease of the ketoconazole susceptibility of M. restricta in the co-culturing 
condition. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that the significant increased 
ergosterol content and cell membrane and wall thickness of the M. restricta 
cells grown in the acidic environment may be the main cause of the altered azole 
susceptibility of the fungus. Overall, our study suggests that the interaction 
between Malassezia and Staphylococcus influences the antifungal susceptibility 
of the fungus and that pH has a critical role in the polymicrobial interaction 
in the skin environment."
891,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, 
affects 6.5 million Americans and over 50 million people globally. Clinical, 
genetic, and phenotypic studies of dementia provide some insights of the 
observed progressive neurodegenerative processes, however, the mechanisms 
underlying AD onset remain enigmatic.
AIMS: This paper examines late-onset dementia-related cognitive impairment 
utilizing neuroimaging-genetics biomarker associations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants, ages 65-85, included 266 healthy 
controls (HC), 572 volunteers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 188 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Genotype dosage data for AD-associated single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted from the imputed ADNI genetics 
archive using sample-major additive coding. Such 29 SNPs were selected, 
representing a subset of independent SNPs reported to be highly associated with 
AD in a recent AD meta-GWAS study by Jansen and colleagues.
RESULTS: We identified the significant correlations between the 29 genomic 
markers (GMs) and the 200 neuroimaging markers (NIMs). The odds ratios and 
relative risks for AD and MCI (relative to HC) were predicted using multinomial 
linear models.
DISCUSSION: In the HC and MCI cohorts, mainly cortical thickness measures were 
associated with GMs, whereas the AD cohort exhibited different GM-NIM relations. 
Network patterns within the HC and AD groups were distinct in cortical 
thickness, volume, and proportion of White to Gray Matter (pct), but not in the 
MCI cohort. Multinomial linear models of clinical diagnosis showed precisely the 
specific NIMs and GMs that were most impactful in discriminating between AD and 
HC, and between MCI and HC.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that advanced analytics provide mechanisms for 
exploring the interrelations between morphometric indicators and GMs. The 
findings may facilitate further clinical investigations of phenotypic 
associations that support deep systematic understanding of AD pathogenesis."
892,"Accurate variant pathogenicity predictions are important in genetic studies of 
human diseases. Inframe insertion and deletion variants (indels) alter protein 
sequence and length, but not as deleterious as frameshift indels. Inframe indel 
Interpretation is challenging due to limitations in the available number of 
known pathogenic variants for training. Existing prediction methods largely use 
manually encoded features including conservation, protein structure and 
function, and allele frequency to infer variant pathogenicity. Recent advances 
in deep learning modeling of protein sequences and structures provide an 
opportunity to improve the representation of salient features based on large 
numbers of protein sequences. We developed a new pathogenicity predictor for 
SHort Inframe iNsertion and dEletion (SHINE). SHINE uses pretrained protein 
language models to construct a latent representation of an indel and its protein 
context from protein sequences and multiple protein sequence alignments, and 
feeds the latent representation into supervised machine learning models for 
pathogenicity prediction. We curated training data from ClinVar and gnomAD, and 
created two test datasets from different sources. SHINE achieved better 
prediction performance than existing methods for both deletion and insertion 
variants in these two test datasets. Our work suggests that unsupervised protein 
language models can provide valuable information about proteins, and new methods 
based on these models can improve variant interpretation in genetic analyses."
893,"Elective genetic testing (EGT) to identify disease risk in individuals who may 
or may not meet clinical criteria for testing is increasingly being offered in 
clinical practice. However, little is known about how EGT is currently 
implemented and how genetics professionals perceive this type of testing. We 
conducted a mixed-methods survey study to evaluate genetics professionals' 
perspectives and attitudes about EGT and describe the current landscape of EGT 
practices in the United States (U.S.) and Canada. Six clinical geneticists and 
131 genetic counselors responded to the online survey, among whom 44% reported 
offering EGT in their practice. Over 84% of survey respondents agreed that EGT 
may improve health outcomes and understanding of genotype-phenotype 
correlations, and 85% agreed that potential risks include result 
misinterpretation and contribution to economic health disparities. Though most 
respondents felt comfortable providing pretest (77%) and post-test (86%) 
counseling for EGT, lack of provider resources (such as time and personnel) and 
prioritization of diagnostic testing were cited most frequently in free-text 
responses as reasons for not offering EGT. Of those offering EGT, 88% reported 
positive overall experiences. Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions 
identified benefits of EGT as expanding access to genetic testing, providing 
potential health benefits, and providing psychological benefits for patients. 
Disadvantages included prohibitive costs, limited clinical utility, and strain 
on resources. Overall, we found that genetics providers perceive both potential 
benefits and harms of EGT and that those offering this testing had generally 
positive experiences, although ethical reservations and practical limitations 
exist."
894,"Therapeutic application of vaccines to endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains 
uncertain. In this study, we aimed to identify potential tumor antigens for use 
in the development of an anti-tumor mRNA vaccine and clarify immune subtypes and 
their characteristics for immunotherapeutic application in heterogeneous EC by 
integrating multi-omics data. Importantly, four potential tumor antigen 
candidates-PGR, RBPJ, PARVG, and MSX1-were identified and significantly 
correlated with better overall survival, disease-free survival, and distinct 
antigen-presenting cell infiltration in EC. In addition, two different immune 
subtypes by consensus clustering analysis of the immune-related genes were 
identified. Patients with C2 immunophenotypes exhibited superior survival 
outcomes and ""hot"" immunoreactivity and harbored higher microsatellite 
instability scores and tumoral mutation burden but lower copy-number variation 
burden. Furthermore, the distinct expression of immunogenic cell death 
modulators and differential microenvironmental characteristics of immune-cell 
infiltration were also revealed between C1 and C2 immune-subtype tumors. 
Enrichment analysis of the co-expression of immune-related genes showed 
enrichment in immune response, immune cell-mediated immunity, and antigen 
processing pathways. These results indicated that these identified tumor 
antigens can be used for developing antitumor mRNA vaccines, and tumors with C2 
immunophenotypic characteristics demonstrated sensitivity and susceptibility to 
immunotherapy in EC."
895,"We investigated whether Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is related to Diabetic Foot 
Ulcers (DFU) development, adjusted for the stratification of the International 
Work Group on Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) guidance. DR and IWGDF stratification were 
registered retrospectively in patients hospitalized from 2009 to 2017 for 
uncontrolled and/or complicated type 2 diabetes. New DFUs were registered until 
2020. Survival analyses categorized the subjects for DR, and multivariate Cox 
regression adjusted for confounders. The 522 patients (57.9% male) were 62±9 
years old, with a diabetes duration of 14±10 years, HbA1c of 8.7±1.8%, 33.9% 
macroangiopathies and 44.8% diabetic kidney diseases. Their grades of DFU risk 
were 0 for 43.3%, 1 for 23.9%, 2 for 7.1%, and 3 for 25.6%. During the 52 months 
follow-up (IQR: 32-71), 58 new DFUs and 18 lower-limb amputations occurred, 
mostly in patients with DR present in 140 (26.8%) patients. Adjusted for age, 
sex and conventional risk factors (duration and control of diabetes, arterial 
hypertension, dyslipidemia), and other complications (macroangiopathy, diabetic 
kidney disease), DR associated with a greater incidence of DFUs. Adjusted for 
the IWGDF classification, DR was related to new DFUs (HR: 2.51, 95%CI: 
1.48-4.26) and amputations (HR: 3.56, 95%CI: 1.26-10.07). This relationship 
persisted in ascending IWGDF grades, with incidences of DFUs from 2/1000 (grade 
0, no DR) to 121/1000 patient-years (grade 3 and DR), and amputations from 0 
(grade 0, no DR) to 38/1000 patient-years (grade 3 and DR). Diabetic retinopathy 
independently relates to the incidence of foot ulcers and amputations in 
patients hospitalized for type 2 diabetes. This article is protected by

896,"AIM: To identify the factors affecting Emergency Department Length of Stay for 
transferred critically ill patients.
BACKGROUND: The Length of Stay of the transferred patients is an important 
indicator of Emergency Department service quality; thus, understanding the 
factors affecting the Emergency Department Length of Stay of transferred 
critically ill patients is essential.
METHODS: Using the electronic medical records of 968 transferred critically ill 
Emergency Department patients of a tertiary hospital in Korea, prediction models 
for Emergency Department Length of Stay were built using various machine 
learning algorithms.
RESULTS: The logistic regression (AUROC 0.85) models showed the best 
performance, followed by random forest (AUROC 0.83) and Naive Bayes (AUROC 
0.83). The logistic regression model indicated that fewer consultations, the 
highest acuity level, need for an emergency operation or angiography, need for 
ICU admission, severe emergency disease and fewer diagnoses were the 
statistically significant predictors for Emergency Department Length of Stay of 
6 h or less.
CONCLUSIONS: The transferred critically ill patients analysed in this study who 
required immediate or specialized care tended to receive needed care on time at 
the study site.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Understanding the factors affecting the 
Emergency Department Length of Stay of transferred critically ill patients is 
crucial for developing strategies to manage the nursing resource of Emergency 
Department successfully."
897,"Focused ultrasound can be used to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 disease, assess 
disease severity, and inform management of COVID-19 and associated pathologies, 
reducing radiation exposure from other imaging modalities and minimizing spread 
of infection. Ultrasound examinations performed by trained nurses in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) enable more patients to receive these assessments. 
This case series evaluates the use of nurse-led focused cardiac and lung 
ultrasound for clinical management of ICU patients with COVID-19. We describe 
common pathophysiological findings and how findings were used to inform clinical 
decision-making. An ultrasound trained ICU nurse performed Focused Ultrasound in 
Intensive Care (FUSIC) cardiac and lung scans enabling calculation of a lung 
severity score on adult ICU patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in a 
single-centre setting. Fifteen scans were performed on 15 patients. Thirteen 
(87%) patients had normal left ventricular function; 12 (80%) normal right 
ventricular function. All 15 (100%) scans identified abnormal lung findings 
including irregular thickened pleura, B-lines, sub-pleural consolidation and 
hepatization. Worse lung severity scores were correlated with higher Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (r = 0.70; 
p = .003). Of the 15 scans, 10 (67%) identified abnormal pathology contributing 
to a change in clinical management. This included targeted fluid removal (4, 
27%), change in respiratory management (3, 20%) and need for formal 
echocardiographic assessment (3, 20%). Findings from five (33%) scans required 
no intervention. This case series demonstrates nurse-led ultrasound could be a 
useful adjunct in the management of the COVID-19 patient."
898,"OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidences indicate that a distinct CD11c+ T-bet+ B cell 
subset termed age/autoimmune-associated B cells (ABCs) is the major pathogenic 
autoantibody producer in lupus. Human lupus is associated with significant 
metabolic alterations, but how ABCs orchestrate their typical transcription 
factors (TFs) and metabolic programs to meet specific functional requirements is 
unclear. Our goal is to characterize the metabolism of ABCs and identify the 
regulators of metabolic pathways for developing new therapies for ABC-mediated 
autoimmunity.
METHODS: We developed a T-bet-tdTomato reporter mouse strain to trace live 
T-bet+ B cells and adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells from Bm12 mice to induce 
lupus. Then CD11c+ tdTomato+ B cells were sorted and conducted RNA sequencing 
and extracellular flux assay. Metabolic restriction to constrain ABC formation 
was tested on human and mouse B cells. The metabolic intervention was conducted 
in the Bm12-induced lupus model.
RESULTS: ABCs exhibited a hypermetabolic state with enhanced glycolytic 
capacity. The increased glycolytic rate in ABCs was promoted by IFN-γ signaling. 
T-bet, a downstream TF of IFN-γ, regulated the gene program of the glycolysis 
pathway in ABCs by repressing the expression of Bcl6. Functionally, glycolysis 
restriction could impair ABC formation. The engagement of glycolysis promoted 
survival and terminal differentiation of antibody-secreting cells. 
Administration of glycolysis inhibitor ameliorated ABCs accumulation and 
autoantibody production in Bm12-induced lupus model.
CONCLUSION: T-bet can couple immune signals and metabolic programming to 
establish pathogenic ABC formation and functional capacities. Modulating ABC 
favored metabolic program could be a novel therapeutic approach for lupus. This

899,"OBJECTIVE: Variants in STAT4 are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. How disease-associated variants affect 
STAT4 expression, in particular in CD4 T cells where STAT4 plays an essential 
role, is unknown.
METHODS: We compared Th1 differentiation between naïve CD4 T cells from healthy 
donors (HD) homozygous for the risk (R/R) or non-risk (NR/NR) alleles. We 
analyzed epigenetic marks in STAT4 and evaluated the relevance of its third 
intron. We assessed the consequences of Stat4 overexpression in vivo. We 
analyzed the effects of the STAT4 genotype in patients with lupus nephritis.
RESULTS: Naïve CD4 T cells from NR/NR HD, downregulated STAT4 in response to 
IL-12. In contrast, cells from R/R HD maintained high levels. R/R cells 
exhibited higher abundance of transcriptionally active STAT4 and increased IFN-γ 
production. Accordingly, R/R HD exhibited a stronger induction of local active 
enhancer marks. Genetic editing confirmed the presence of a negative regulatory 
region in the STAT4 third intron, where most of the SLE-associated STAT4 SNPs 
are located. In vivo forced expression demonstrated that increases in Stat4 
levels in T cells enhanced glomerulonephritis. Accordingly, the R/R genotype was 
associated with suboptimal response to treatment and with worse clinical 
outcomes in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.
CONCLUSIONS: The SLE-associated STAT4 haplotype is associated with abnormal 
IL-12-mediated STAT4 transcriptional regulation. Carriers of the risk variant 
exhibit exaggerated CD4 pro-inflammatory capacities that, in the context of SLE, 
contribute to a more severe disease. R/R patients may benefit from blockade of 
the IL-12-STAT4 pathway. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

900,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the need for additional safe, effective and affordable 
vaccines gave new impetus into development of vaccine genetic platforms. Here we 
report the findings from the phase 1, first-in-human, dose-escalation study of 
COVID-eVax, a DNA vaccine encoding the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the 
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Sixty-eight healthy adults received two doses of 0.5, 
1 or 2mg 28 days apart, or a single 2mg dose, via intramuscular injection 
followed by electroporation, and were monitored for 6 months. All participants 
completed the primary safety and immunogenicity assessments after 8 weeks. 
COVID-eVax was well tolerated, with mainly mild to moderate solicited adverse 
events (tenderness, pain, bruising, headache and malaise/fatigue) less frequent 
after the second dose, and induced an immune response (binding antibodies and/or 
T cells) at all prime-boost doses tested in up to 90% of the volunteers at the 
highest dose. However, the vaccine did not induce neutralizing antibodies, while 
particularly relevant was the T cell-mediated immunity, with a robust Th1 
response. This T cell-skewed immunological response adds significant information 
to the DNA vaccine platform and should be assessed in further studies for its 
protective capacity and potential usefulness also in other therapeutic areas, 
such as oncology."
901,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-6 
superfamily. LIF was initially discovered as a factor to induce the 
differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells and thus inhibit their proliferation. 
Subsequent studies have highlighted the multi-functions of LIF under a wide 
variety of physiological and pathological conditions in a highly cell-, tissue-, 
and context-dependent manner. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that LIF plays 
essential roles in the stem cell niche, where it maintains the homeostasis and 
regeneration of multiple somatic tissues, including intestine, neuron, and 
muscle. Further, LIF exerts a crucial regulatory role in immunity, and functions 
as a protective factor against many immunopathological diseases, such as 
infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and graft-verse-host disease 
(GVHD). It is worth noting that while LIF displays a tumor-suppressive function 
in leukemia, recent studies have highlighted the oncogenic role of LIF in many 
types of solid tumors, further demonstrating the complexities and 
context-dependent effects of LIF. In this review, we summarize the recent 
insights into the roles and mechanisms of LIF in stem cell homeostasis and 
regeneration, immunity, and cancer, and discuss the potential therapeutic 
options for human diseases by modulating LIF levels and functions."
902,"Cancer is a public health and social problem to which great attention should be 
attached. Not only are there a large number of cancer patients in China, but 
great differences also exist in etiology, epidemiology, disease spectrum, and 
treatment between China and western countries. Therefore, tumor-related data in 
China has its own characteristics. Full reference to the data of western 
countries cannot accurately reflect the real situation of cancer prevention and 
treatment in China. If we can integrate, process and analyze Chinese data, and 
find rules in specific etiology, incidence, drug sensitivity and prognosis, it 
will play an important role in the formulation of health policy, medical 
research and disease prevention. The Society of Cancer Big Data and Real World 
Study of China Anti-Cancer Association organized multidisciplinary experts, 
combined with domestic and foreign literature and clinical practice, after 
repeated discussion and revision, finished this consensus including background, 
analysis and management, direction planning and operation flow, basic design, 
quality control standards, evidence level classification, data security and 
privacy standards of big data and real world study. The aim is to take full 
advantages of Chinese cancer big data to carry out high-quality real world 
study, and better promote the prevention and treatment of cancer in China."
903,"As the globe has witnessed the pandemic, epidemic diseases exert a strong impact 
on human beings and ecosystems. Since the Sun is the primary energy source of 
the Earth, some scientific pioneers attempted to search for the discernible 
relation between solar activity and the incidence of epidemics. In this study, 
the periodic changes and trends of ancient Chinese epidemic data were analyzed 
in comparison with those of sunspot numbers, a solar activity proxy. The results 
show that the epidemic and solar activity changes are in good agreement to a 
certain extent, especially during the Gleissberg and the de Vries cycles. The 
wavelet coherence shows that the frequency of the epidemic data and sunspot 
numbers are highly associated. In addition, results from the ensemble empirical 
mode decomposition illustrate consistent variations in low-frequency 
decompositions. This study has important implications for further understanding 
of the potential impact of solar activity on Earth's biosphere, the underlying 
mechanism of which needs further exploration."
904,"Pneumothorax was previously considered as a complication of severe coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. However, it is now known that pneumothorax 
can develop in other cases. Here, we describe the case of a patient who 
developed tension pneumothorax after release from isolation from COVID-19 
pneumonia. The patient was admitted to our hospital with severe COVID-19 
pneumonia on the 10th day after onset. Ventilatory management was carried out on 
the first day of admission; however, the patient was weaned off the next day. 
The treatment course was uneventful. On the morning of discharge from the 
hospital, the patient experienced sudden dyspnea. Chest radiography revealed a 
large left-tension pneumothorax with a mediastinal shift to the right. As this 
finding required immediate attention, a chest tube was inserted. Chest computed 
tomography (CT) showed an airspace in the left thoracic cavity and subpleural 
thin-walled cystic lesions, such as bullae in the left lobe. One month later, 
chest CT showed resolution of the cystic lesions. The development of 
pneumothorax in COVID-19 pneumonia should be considered not only in cases of 
severe illness, but also after release from isolation. Recently, revisions to 
measures against COVID-19 have been considered worldwide, including shortening 
of the isolation period and reviewing the identification of all cases. This is 
an educational report demonstrating that life-threatening pneumothorax may 
develop after release from isolation due to COVID-19 pneumonia."
905,"A comparative analysis of two case histories showing the effects of COVID-19 and 
immunization with the Sputnik V vaccine on the dynamics of epilepsy is 
presented. The study was part of the ""Epilepsy and COVID-19"" research initiative 
in a cohort of patients with epilepsy divided into two groups: those 
experiencing COVID-19 and those immunized with vaccine against COVID-19. We 
present here a comparative analysis of two case histories: recurrence of 
seizures in COVID-19 in a young (male) patient and good tolerance of vaccine in 
an older (female) patient with comorbid pathology after surgical treatment of 
drug-resistant epilepsy. Patient K (age 32 years, male) had generalized genetic 
(idiopathic) epilepsy with remission of seizures for three years. On the 
background of mild COVID-19 the patient experienced recurrence of generalized 
tonic-clonic seizures with deterioration of electroencephalographic indicators. 
Patient F (age 59 years, female) had focal drug-resistant epilepsy with 
remission of seizures for three years following surgical treatment, with 
comorbid endocrine pathology. No side effects were seen on immunization with 
Sputnik V vaccine and clinical-electroencephalographic remission persisted. The 
results showed good tolerance of Sputnik V vaccine, with persisting remission of 
seizures after neurosurgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in the older 
patient with comorbid pathology and the potential for recurrence of seizures in 
the young patient on the background of mild COVID-19. These results will help 
practicing physicians determine management tactics in epilepsy patients. 
Continuation of this research on the effects of COVID-19 disease and vaccination 
on the dynamics of epilepsy in a larger cohort is needed."
906,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is endemic worldwide. Cardiovascular 
disease, particularly myocarditis, is one of the most common comorbidities in 
patients with COVID-19. However, heart failure due to COVID-19-triggered 
cardiomyopathy is not well understood. Additionally, ""pseudo"" heart failure 
symptoms have been reported in patients with a compensated condition, in which 
the heart works well enough that symptoms are unnoticeable or very easy to

patient with COVID-19 and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after heart 
failure treatment. Learning objective. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome 
(POTS) symptoms after coronavirus disease 2019 may be mistaken for heart failure 
symptoms; thus, it is essential to suspect POTS when symptoms such as shortness

physical findings."
907,"During the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, short-range virus transmission has 
been observed to have a higher risk of causing infection than long-range virus 
transmission. However, the roles played by the inhalation and large droplet 
routes cannot be distinguished in practice. A recent analytical study revealed 
the predominance of short-range inhalation over the large droplet spray route as 
causes of respiratory infections. In the current study, short-range exposure was 
analyzed via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using a discrete 
phase model. Detailed facial membranes, including eyes, nostrils, and a mouth, 
were considered. In CFD simulations, there is no need for a spherical 
approximation of the human head for estimating deposition nor the ""anisokinetic 
aerosol sampling"" approximation for estimating inhalation in the analytical 
model. We considered two scenarios (with two spheres [Scenario 1] and two human 
manikins [Scenario 2]), source-target distances of 0.2 to 2 m, and droplet 
diameters of 3 to 1,500 µm. The overall CFD exposure results agree well with 
data previously obtained from a simple analytical model. The CFD results confirm 
the predominance of the short-range inhalation route beyond 0.2 m for expiratory 
droplets smaller than 50 µm during talking and coughing. A critical droplet size 
of 87.5 µm was found to differentiate droplet behaviors. The number of droplets 
deposited on the target head exceeded those exposed to facial membranes, which 
implies a risk of exposure through the immediate surface route over a short 
range.

908,"BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported on platelet activity ex vivo 
and responsiveness in vitro among COVID-19 patients with or without 
thromboembolic complications.
OBJECTIVES: To assess platelet reactivity in moderate disease at early stages of 
COVID-19.
PATIENTS/METHODS: We performed a prospective, descriptive analysis on 100 
consecutive patients presenting with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the 
University Medical Center Freiburg during the first or second pandemic wave. 
Following PCR testing and compliance with study inclusion criteria, 20 
SARS-CoV-2 positive and 55 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (serving as patient 
controls) were enrolled. In addition, 15 healthy subjects were included. 
Platelet reactivity was assessed using whole blood impedance aggregometry and 
flow cytometry in response to various agonists.
RESULTS: Platelet aggregation was significantly impaired in COVID-19 patients as 
compared to patient controls or healthy subjects. The reduced platelet 
responsiveness in COVID-19 patients was associated with impaired activation of 
GPIIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3). By contrast, low P-selectin expression at baseline and 
intact secretion upon stimulation in vitro suggest that no pre-activation in 
vivo leading to ""exhausted"" platelets had occurred. The proportion of 
circulating platelet-neutrophil complexes was significantly higher in COVID-19 
patients (mean±SD, 41±13%) than in patient controls (18±7%; 95% CI:11.1-34.1; 
P=0.0002) or healthy subjects (17±4%; 95% CI:13.8-33.8; P<0.0001). Analysis of 
neutrophil adhesion receptors revealed up-regulation of CD11b (α-subunit of 
αMβ2) and CD66b (CEACAM8) but not of CD162 (PSGL-1) in COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite reduced platelet responsiveness, platelet-neutrophil 
complexes are increased at early stages of moderate disease. Thus, this cellular 
interaction may occur in COVID-19 without preceding platelet activation."
909,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of intranasal vaporized lidocaine in 
reducing pain for children undergoing a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab in the 
Emergency Department (ED).
STUDY DESIGN: A randomized blinded clinical trial was conducted in a paediatric 
ED. Both participants and the researcher evaluating the primary outcome were 
blinded. Children aged 6 to 17 years old requiring a NP swab were eligible. 
Participants were randomly allocated to receive intranasal lidocaine or a sham 
treatment prior to their NP swab. The primary outcome measure was pain during 
the swab as assessed by the visual analog scale. Secondary outcome measures were 
pain using the verbal numeric rating scale, fear using the children fear scale, 
and adverse effects of the intervention.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight participants were enrolled-45 in the lidocaine group and 
43 controls. The mean visual analog scale scores for pain were 46 mm in the 
lidocaine group and 53 mm in the control group (mean difference 7 mm; 95% CI: -5 
to 19 mm). No serious adverse events were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal lidocaine administered prior to NP swabs in the ED 
failed to show an improvement in pain scores for school-aged children and youth."
910,"The interaction of light with natural matter leads to a plethora of 
photosensitized reactions. These reactions cause the degradation of 
biomolecules, such as DNA, lipids, proteins, being therefore detrimental to the 
living organisms, or they can also be beneficial by allowing the treatment of 
several diseases by photomedicine. Based on the molecular mechanistic 
understanding of the photosensitization reactions, we propose to classify them 
in four processes: oxygen-dependent (type I and type II processes) and 
oxygen-independent [triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET) and photoadduct 
formation]. In here, these processes are discussed by considering a wide variety 
of approaches including time-resolved and steady-state techniques, together with 
solvent, quencher, and scavenger effects. The main aim of this survey is to 
provide a description of general techniques and approaches that can be used to 
investigate photosensitization reactions of biomolecules together with basic 
recommendations on good practices. Illustration of the suitability of these 
approaches is provided by the measurement of key biomarkers of singlet oxygen 
and one-electron oxidation reactions in both isolated and cellular DNA. Our work 
is an educational review that is mostly addressed to students and beginners."
911,"KEY POINTS: LPP3 expression is reduced in patients with coronary artery disease 
(CAD). Loss of LPP3 in CAD is associated with an increase in the LPP3 inhibitor, 
miR-92a. Inhibition of LPP3 in the microvascular of healthy patients mimics the 
CAD FMD phenotype. Inhibition of miR-92a restores NO-mediated FMD in the 
microvasculature of CAD patients.
ABSTRACT: Microvascular dysfunction predicts adverse cardiovascular events 
despite absence of large vessel disease. A shift in the mediator of 
flow-mediated dilation (FMD) from nitric oxide (NO) to mitochondrial-derived 
hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) occurs in arterioles from patients with coronary 
artery disease (CAD). The underlying mechanisms governing this shift are not 
completely defined. Lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3) is a transmembrane 
protein that dephosphorylates lysophosphatidic acid, a bioactive lipid causing a 
receptor-mediated increase in reactive oxygen species. A single nucleotide 
loss-of-function polymorphism in the gene coding for LPP3 (rs17114036) is 
associated with elevated risk for CAD, independent of traditional risk factors. 
LPP3 is suppressed by miR-92a, which is elevated in the circulation of patients 
with CAD. Repression of LPP3 increases vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis 
in animal models. We investigated the role of LPP3 and miR-92a as a mechanism 
for microvascular dysfunction in CAD. We hypothesized that modulation of LPP3 is 
critically involved in the disease-associated shift in mediator of FMD. LPP3 
protein expression was reduced in left ventricle tissue from CAD relative to 
non-CAD patients (p = 0.004), with mRNA expression unchanged (p = 0.96). 
Reducing LPP3 expression (non-CAD) caused a shift from NO to H2 O2 (% maximal 
dilation: Control 78.1±11.4% vs Peg-Cat 30.0±11.2%; p<0.0001). miR-92a is 
elevated in CAD arterioles (Fold change: 1.9±0.0.1 p = 0.04), while inhibition 
of miR-92a restored NO-mediated FMD (CAD) and enhancing miR-92a expression 
(non-CAD) elicited H2 O2 -mediated dilation (p<0.0001). Our data suggests LPP3 
is crucial in the disease-associated switch in the mediator of FMD. Abstract 
figure legend Maintenance of Lipid Phosphate Phosphatase 3 (LPP3) Maintains 
Microvascular Function in Health and Disease. A. In healthy microvasculature,

912,"The major predisposing factors of developing oral cancer include smoking, 
alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing. Betel quid chewing could cause the 
abrasion and damage of oral mucosa by crude fibers, chemical insults by additive 
slaked lime, and arecoline from areca nut. These would lead to the local 
consequence of oral submucosal fibrosis, which is regarded clinically as a 
precancer lesion and a major cause of trismus. In addition, the components and 
additives in betel quid contain chemical toxins and carcinogens, which would 
further affect the oral mucosa and gradually develop a malignancy. Following 
literature review, aside from having a greater total tumor burden and more local 
diseases in the oral cavity and digestive tract, patients with betel 
quid-related oral cancer also have more systemic diseases from metabolic 
syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and 
obesity than those without this habit. In conclusion, those patients who have 
the history of smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing would present 
much more unique clinical characteristics than those who only have a history of 
smoking and alcohol drinking. More attention should therefore be paid to 
pretreatment evaluation, treatment strategy, and posttreatment follow-up among 
betel quid chewers."
913,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) represent a public health problem 
because of their frequency and the severity of their consequences, i.e. 
amputation and mortality. Polymicrobial biofilms on the skin surface of these 
ulcers complicate wound healing. Few in vitro models exist to study the 
antibiotics activity in this context.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the in vitro activity of antibiotics against 
the two main bacteria isolated in DFI, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, using a dynamic system (BioFlux™ 200) and a chronic wound-like 
medium (CWM) that mimic the foot ulcer environment.
METHODS: Reference strains and two pairs of clinical S. aureus and P. aeruginosa 
isolated together from a DFI were cultivated in brain heart infusion and CWM 
media during 72 h at 37°C, alone and combined in the BioFlux™ 200 system. 
Antibiotic activity was evaluated after a mechanical debridement. The activities 
were measured by the reduction of biofilm percentage of bacteria in the 
microfluidic system using microscopy.
RESULTS: Daptomycin for S. aureus and ceftazidime for P. aeruginosa showed 
excellent activity to reduce biofilm biomass, whereas linezolid action was more 
mitigated and dalbavancin was ineffective. Ceftazidime + daptomycin presented 
the most potent in vitro activity on a mixed biofilm.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CWM and the BioFlux™ microfluidic system 
represents a valuable tool to screen the potential antimicrobial activity of 
antibiotics under conditions mimicking those encountered in DFI. It could help 
clinicians in their management of chronic wounds."
914,"RATIONALE: Total knee arthroplasty is a common surgical procedure but not 
appropriate for all patients with knee osteoarthritis. Patient decision aids 
(PtDAs) can promote shared decision making and enhance understanding and 
expectations of procedures among patients, resulting in better discussions 
between patients and healthcare providers about whether total knee arthroplasty 
is the most appropriate option.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluate impact of an individualised PtDA for 
osteoarthritis patients considering total knee arthroplasty 1 year after 
baseline assessment.
METHODS: Prospective, randomised controlled trial comparing an intervention arm 
(IA) and routine care arm (RCA). The IA included an online individualised 
patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) based PtDA and one-page summary report 
for the surgeon. We report secondary outcomes from the final assessment: patient 
expectations, decisional regret, patient satisfaction with outcomes of knee 
replacement, health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) and depression. We report 
changes in HRQOL between baseline and final assessments, study arms, and 
surgical versus non-surgical patients. Descriptive statistics were used to 
describe participant characteristics and continuous variables. Dichotomous 
outcomes (expectations, decisional regret, satisfaction) were analyzed using 
logistic regression and continuous outcomes (HRQOL, depression) were modelled 
using linear regression.
RESULTS: Overall, 140 participants completed all study assessments (IA: n = 69, 
RCA: n = 71); n = 108 underwent surgery (IA: n = 49, RCA: n = 59). Regardless of 
study arm, most participants reported expectations were met, minimal decisional 
regret, satisfaction with outcomes of knee replacement, and had improvements in 
HRQOL. While no significant differences in study outcomes were found between 
study arms, IA results were in the direction hypothesised in favour of the PtDA.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we were not able to detect statistically significant 
benefits associated with implementing this PROMs-based PtDA, there was no 
apparent negative effect on these outcomes 1 year after baseline. We anticipate 
there may be benefit to implementing this PtDA earlier in the osteoarthritis 
care pathway where patients have more opportunities to manage their disease 
non-surgically."
915,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has reinforced the necessity 
and importance of telepractice. Although studies suggest frameworks to 
facilitate telepractice implementation, how parents learn related therapeutic 
skills via telepractice remains unexplored. The purpose of this study was to 
explore the perspectives and performance changes of parents with children 
enrolled in aural-oral rehabilitation who transition from in-person sessions to 
telepractice.
METHODS: A total of 456 parents were enrolled in an aural-oral rehabilitation 
program with different online session formats [telepractice (n = 392), 
consultation (n = 23), and hybrid (n = 41)] during the pandemic. The Parental 
Teaching Skil Scale and the Parental Behavioral Skills Scale were used to 
examine parent performance changes before and during the lockdown. Furthermore, 
semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 parents.
RESULTS: Parents who scored higher in in-person courses were more likely to 
enrol in telepractice and make steady progress. Parents who participated in 
hybrid sessions tended to score lower on Parental Teaching Skill Scale before 
lockdown and reported that the dual-track, parallel learning method provided 
them with a set amount of time to discuss teaching difficulties with their 
therapists without being disturbed by their children. Parents who attended the 
consultation sessions scored higher on Parental Behavioral Skills Scale than on 
Parental Teaching Skill Scale during the in-person courses.
DISCUSSION: Parents who continued online courses during the lockdown showed 
consistent and significant gains in most skills related to aural-oral 
rehabilitation, regardless of session format. Moreover, parents who scored 
better on Parental Behavioral Skills Scale than in Parental Teaching Skill Scale 
during in-person courses tended to request consultation sessions during the 
lockdown."
916,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence supporting transmural remission (TR) as a long-term 
treatment target in Crohn's disease (CD) is still unavailable. Less stringent 
but more reachable targets such as isolated endoscopic (IER) or radiologic 
remission (IRR) may also be acceptable options in the long-term.
METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study including 404 CD patients evaluated by 
magnetic resonance enterography and colonoscopy. Five-year rates of 
hospitalization, surgery, use of steroids, and treatment escalation were 
compared between patients with TR, IER, IRR, and no remission (NR).
RESULTS: 20.8% of CD patients presented TR, 23.3% IER, 13.6% IRR and 42.3% NR. 
TR was associated with lower risk of hospitalization (odds-ratio [OR] 0.244 
[0.111-0.538], p < 0.001), surgery (OR 0.132 [0.030-0.585], p = 0.008), steroid 
use (OR 0.283 [0.159-0.505], p < 0.001), and treatment escalation (OR 0.088 
[0.044-0.176], p < 0.001) compared to no NR. IRR resulted in lower risk of 
hospitalization (OR 0.333 [0.143-0.777], p = 0.011) and treatment escalation (OR 
0.260 [0.125-0.540], p < 0.001), while IER reduced the risk of steroid use (OR 
0.442 [0.262-0.745], p = 0.002) and treatment escalation (OR 0.490 
[0.259-0.925], p = 0.028) compared to NR.
CONCLUSIONS: TR improved clinical outcomes over 5 years of follow-up in CD 
patients. Distinct but significant benefits were seen with IER and IRR. This 
suggests that both endoscopic and radiologic remission should be part of the 
treatment targets of CD."
917,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression of key epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) markers in gingival tissue samples collected from patients with 
periodontitis.
BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a process responsible for 
shifting epithelial-phenotype to mesenchymal-phenotype leading to loss of 
epithelial-barrier function. Thus, EMT could be involved as a pathogenic 
mechanism in periodontitis as both conditions share common promoters and 
signalling pathways.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gingival tissue samples were collected from patients with 
periodontitis (case) and healthy periodontium (control). Periodontal parameters 
including bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical 
attachment loss were recorded. Paraffinized tissue samples were processed and 
immunohistochemically stained to determine the expression of key EMT markers 
which included E-cadherin, β-catenin, Snail1 and vimentin.
RESULTS: The majority of cases (n = 65, 72.2%) were diagnosed with periodontitis 
stage 3 or 4, grade b or c vs 25 (27.8%) subjects with intact healthy 
periodontium. Discontinuity of epithelium was detected in up to 80.9% of 
periodontitis cases associated with reduced number of epithelial layers as 
compared to controls. Immunohistochemical expression of epithelial markers 
(E-cadherin and β-catenin) was significantly downregulated in periodontitis 
patients as compared with controls. Periodontitis cases exhibited significant 
upregulation of Snail1 expression. Furthermore, cytoplasmic vimentin (66.2%) and 
nuclear β-catenin (27.7%) were solely expressed in periodontally diseased 
tissues compared with control. Epithelial markers, E-cadherin and β-catenin, 
were significantly negatively correlated with increasing PPD, while vimentin 
showed positive correlation with this parameter.
CONCLUSION: There were marked downregulation of epithelial molecules and 
upregulation of mesenchymal markers in gingival tissues derived from 
periodontitis patients, suggesting expression of the EMT phenotype in the 
pathological epithelial lining of periodontal pockets."
918,"The DSM-5 Section III alternative model of personality disorder (AMPD) and the 
International Classification of Diseases - 11th Edition's (ICD-11) personality 
disorder classification allow clinicians to identify individual trait domains in 
which people score highly. However, how these domains relate to constructs 
associated with efficacious treatment approaches is unclear. The current study 
aimed to determine whether constructs from two evidence-based treatments (schema 
therapy [ST] and dialectical behavior therapy [DBT]) were associated with 
maladaptive personality traits in a way consistent with underlying theories. We 
examined associations between ST constructs, DBT skill use and maladaptive 
coping styles, and personality traits in a sample of 525 adults. Bivariate 
intercorrelations and a series of multiple regression analyses were conducted to 
investigate the associations. As hypothesized, maladaptive coping was strongly 
associated with all trait domains. Surprisingly, poor DBT-skill use was only 
associated with negative affectivity, detachment, and disinhibition trait 
domains. Specific schema domains were associated with each personality trait 
domain, supporting trait domain-schema domain specificity. The current study 
highlights the potential clinical utility of the AMPD and ICD-11 trait models 
and ultimately contributes to the dearth of evidence on their likely usefulness 
for treatment selection, planning, and applications."
919,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 caused a worldwide pandemia 
starting from March 2020. A major concern was for hematological patients, which 
resulted to be defenseless due to their impaired immune system and the 
difficulty to obtain a valid serological response to vaccination. A promising 
weapon is the use of anti-SARS-CoV2 monoclonal antibodies in patients with mild 
COVID-19 infection at high risk of progression into severe disease. Here, we 
reported our preliminary results of anti-SARS-CoV2 monoclonal antibodies 
administration for COVID-19 occurred after cell therapy. This article is

921,"OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of patients 
with vasoproliferative retinal tumor (VPRT) in India.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 50 eyes in 47 patients.
RESULTS: Of the 50 eyes, 25 (50%) were primary and 25 (50%) were secondary. 
Common ocular pathologies related to secondary VPRT included retinal detachment 
(n = 8, 32%) and Coats disease (n = 7, 28%). Overall, the mean age at 
presentation was 35 years (range; 3-74 years) and included 30 (64%) males and 17 
(36%) females. The lesions were unilateral in 44 (94%) patients. Secondary 
retinal features included intra/subretinal exudation (n = 41, 82%), vascularity 
(n = 32, 64%), subretinal fluid (n = 21, 42%), retinal neovascularisation 
(n = 9, 18%) and vitreous hemorrhage (n = 8, 16%). Thirty-four eyes (68%) 
underwent cryotherapy, of which 16 eyes (47%) received adjunct intravitreal 
anti-VEGF (12 eyes) or corticosteroid injection (4 eyes). Primary surgery 
included vitrectomy with/without encirclage and cryotherapy (n = 12, 24%) and 
plaque brachytherapy (n = 3, 6%). At last follow-up (mean 9.7 months, range 3-67 
months), 42 eyes (84%) had complete tumor regression with no improvement in 
visual outcomes when comparing presenting and final best corrected visual 
acuity. Comparing primary versus secondary VPRT, secondary VPRT presented a 
decade earlier (31 vs 40 years), needed surgical intervention (48% vs 20%), had 
poor tumor control (72% vs 92%) and worse visual outcomes (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: VPRTs commonly present as a unilateral lesions in the adult 
population with equal prevalence of primary and secondary variants. Compared 
with primary VPRT, secondary VPRTs require surgical treatment and are associated 
with poor visual outcome."
922,"AIM: This study aimed to identify the predictors of mortality and ICU 
requirements in hospitalized COVID-19 Patients with Diabetes.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: It was a retrospective study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 
infection from October 2020-February 2021 in four hospitals in Sylhet, 
Bangladesh. Logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the predictors 
of ICU requirement and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: In the whole cohort (n = 500), 11% of patients died and 24% of patients 
required intensive care unit (ICU) support. Non-survivors had significantly 
higher prevalence of lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. Significant 
predictors of in-hospital mortality were older age, neutrophil count, platelet 
count and admission peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2). Older age, 
ischemic heart disease, WBC count, D-dimer and admission SpO2 were identified as 
significant predictors for ICU requirement.

923,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicated that obesity would accelerate frailty 
progression. However, obesity is heterogeneous by different metabolic status. 
The associations of metabolic heterogeneity of obesity with frailty progression 
remain unclear.
METHODS: A total of 6730 participants from the China Health and Retirement 
Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and 4713 from the English Longitudinal Study of 
Ageing (ELSA) were included at baseline. Metabolic heterogeneity of obesity was 
evaluated based on four obesity and metabolic phenotypes as metabolically 
healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), 
metabolically healthy overweight/obesity (MHOO), and metabolically unhealthy 
overweight/obesity (MUOO). Frailty status was assessed by the frailty index (FI) 
ranging from 0 to 100 and frailty was defined as FI ≥ 25. Linear mixed-effect 
models were used to analyse the associations of metabolic heterogeneity of 
obesity with frailty progression.
RESULTS: In the CHARLS, MUOO and MUNW presented the accelerated FI progression 
with additional annual increases of 0.284 (95% CI: 0.155 to 0.413, P < 0.001) 
and 0.169 (95% CI: 0.035 to 0.303, P = 0.013) as compared with MHNW. MHOO 
presented no accelerated FI progression (β: -0.011, 95% CI: -0.196 to 0.173, 
P = 0.904) as compared with MHNW. In the ELSA, the accelerated FI progression 
was marginally significant for MUOO (β: 0.103, 95% CI: -0.005 to 0.210, 
P = 0.061) and MUNW (β: 0.157, 95% CI: -0.011 to 0.324, P = 0.066), but not for 
MHOO (β: -0.047, 95% CI: -0.157 to 0.062, P = 0.396) in comparison with MHNW. 
The associations of MUOO and MUNW with the accelerated FI progression were 
stronger after excluding the baseline frail participants in both cohorts. The 
metabolic status changed over time. When compared with stable MHNW, participants 
who changed from MHNW to MUNW presented the accelerated FI progression with 
additional annual increases of 0.356 (95% CI: 0.113 to 0.599, P = 0.004) and 
0.255 (95% CI: 0.033 to 0.477, P = 0.024) in the CHARLS and ELSA, respectively. 
The accelerated FI progression was also found in MHOO participants who 
transitioned to MUOO (CHARLS, β: 0.358, 95% CI: 0.053 to 0.663, P = 0.022; ELSA, 
β: 0.210, 95% CI: 0.049 to 0.370, P = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolically unhealthy overweight/obesity and normal weight, but 
not metabolically healthy overweight/obesity, accelerated frailty progression as 
compared with metabolically healthy normal weight. Regardless of obesity status, 
transitions from healthy metabolic status to unhealthy metabolic status 
accelerated frailty progression as compared with stable metabolically healthy 
normal weight. Our findings highlight the important role of metabolic status in 
frailty progression and recommend the stratified management of obesity based on 
metabolic status."
924,"BACKGROUND: Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is efficient in detecting 
multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques and evaluating the level of disease activity.
PURPOSE: To automatically detect active and inactive MS plaques in SWI images 
using a Bayesian approach.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 1.5-T scanner was used to evaluate 147 patients with MS. 
The area of the plaques along with their active or inactive status were 
automatically identified using a Bayesian approach. Plaques were given an orange 
color if they were active and a blue color if they were inactive, based on the 
preset signal intensity.
RESULTS: Experimental findings show that the proposed method has a high accuracy 
rate of 91% and a sensitivity rate of 76% for identifying the type and area of 
plaques. Inactive plaques were properly identified in 87% of cases, and active 
plaques in 76% of cases. The Kappa analysis revealed an 80% agreement between 
expert diagnoses based on contrast-enhanced and FLAIR images and Bayesian 
inferences in SWI.
CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrated that the proposed method has 
good accuracy for identifying the MS plaque area as well as for identifying the 
types of active or inactive plaques in SWI. Therefore, it might be helpful to 
use the proposed method as a supplemental tool to accelerate the specialist's 
diagnosis."
925,"Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) causes lacunar stroke and intracerebral 
hemorrhage, and is the most common pathology underlying vascular cognitive 
impairment. Increasingly, the importance of other clinical features of SVD is 
being recognized including motor impairment, (vascular) parkinsonism, impaired 
balance, falls, and behavioral symptoms, such as depression, apathy, and 
personality change. Epidemiological data show a high prevalence of the 
characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of white matter 
hyperintensities and lacunar infarcts in community studies, and recent data 
suggest that it is also a major health burden in low- and middle-income 
countries. In this review, we cover advances in diagnosis, imaging, clinical 
presentations, pathogenesis, and treatment.The two most common pathologies 
underlying SVD are arteriolosclerosis caused by aging, hypertension, and other 
conventional vascular risk factors, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) caused 
by vascular deposition of β-amyloid. We discuss the revised Boston criteria of 
CAA based on MRI features, which have been recently validated. Imaging is 
providing important insights into pathogenesis, including improved detection of 
tissue damage using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) leading to its use to monitor 
progression and surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. Advanced MRI techniques 
can demonstrate functional or dynamic abnormalities of the blood vessels, while 
the high spatial resolution provided by ultrahigh field MRI at 7 T allows 
imaging of individual perforating arteries for the first time, and the 
measurement of flow velocity and pulsatility within these arteries. DTI and 
structural network analysis have highlighted the importance of network 
disruption in mediating the effect of different SVD pathologies in causing a 
number of symptoms, including cognitive impairment, apathy, and gait 
disturbance.Despite the public health importance of SVD, there are few proven 
treatments. We review the evidence for primary prevention, and recent data 
showing how intensive blood pressure lowering reduces white matter 
hyperintensities (WMH) progression and delays the onset of cognitive impairment. 
There are few treatments for secondary prevention, but a number of trials are 
currently evaluating novel treatment approaches. Recent advances have implicated 
molecular processes related to endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide synthesis, 
blood-brain barrier integrity, maintenance and repair of the extracellular 
matrix, and inflammation. Novel treatment approaches are being developed to a 
number of these targets. Finally, we highlight the importance of large 
International collaborative initiatives in SVD to address important research 
questions and cover a number which have recently been established."
926,"Advances in cardiac surgical techniques taking place over the past 50 years have 
resulted in the vast majority of children born with congenital cardiac 
malformations now surviving into adulthood. As the focus shifts from survival to 
the functional outcomes of our patients, it is increasingly being recognized 
that a significant proportion of patients undergoing infant cardiac repair 
experience adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The etiology of abnormal brain 
development in the setting of congenital heart disease is poorly understood, 
complex and likely multifactorial. Furthermore, the efficacy of therapies 
available for the learning disabilities, attention deficit and hyperactivity 
disorders and other neurodevelopmental deficits complicating congenital heart 
disease are currently uncertain. This situation presents a challenge for 
prenatal counselling, as current antenatal testing does not usually provide 
prognostic information regarding the likely neurodevelopmental trajectories of 
individual patients. However, we believe it is important for parents to be 
informed about potential issues with child development when a new diagnosis of 
congenital heart disease is disclosed. Parents deserve a comprehensive and 
thoughtful approach to this subject, which conveys the uncertainties involved in 
predicting the severity of any developmental disorders encountered, while 
emphasizing the improvements in outcomes that have already been achieved in 
infants with congenital heart disease. A balanced approach to counselling should 
also discuss what local arrangements are in place for neurodevelopmental 
follow-up. This review presents an up-to-date overview of neurodevelopmental 
outcomes in patients with congenital heart disease, providing possible 
approaches to communicating this information to parents during prenatal 
counselling in a sensitive and accurate manner. This article is protected by

927,"BACKGROUND: Duodenal margin positivity is a poor prognostic factor following 
gastrectomy for resectable gastric cancer. Intraoperative frozen section (IFS) 
analysis allows radical resection to be achieved in a single operation but is 
time- and resource-consuming. Hence resection is usually performed based on 
surgeon's judgment and palpation.
AIM OF STUDY: To determine risk factors for duodenal resection margin (RM) 
positivity following gastrectomy for resectable gastric cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed prospectively maintained data 
of 376 patients admitted with diagnosis of gastric cancer from August 2011 to 
January 2020 in JIPMER, a tertiary center in Puducherry, India. Of these, 146 
patients underwent gastric resection with curative intent and were the subject 
of this study. RM status was assessed by definitive histopathology examination. 
The potential risk factors were compared between patients with positive margin 
on definitive histopathology examination and a control cohort of similar 
patients with negative margins.
RESULTS: Of the 146 patients, 16 patients (10.9%), 11 men and 5 women, had 
positive duodenal margin. The mean age of study group was 59 years. None of the 
patient characteristics like age, sex, comorbidities, or addictions were 
statistically significant with regard to duodenal margin positivity. Among tumor 
characteristics, locally advanced tumors and pyloroantral tumors were found more 
frequently in the margin-positive group. High-risk features for duodenal margin 
positivity were extensive nodal disease, oligometastatic disease, lymphovascular 
invasion, and perineural invasion. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and types of 
surgical access did not have significant impact on RM. Interestingly, both 
proximal and circumferential resection margin positivity had a linear 
association with distal margin positivity suggesting that tumor biology may have 
a significant role in margin positivity. However, none of these factors were 
statistically significant on multivariate analysis using logistic regression 
model. Among oligometastatic patients, survival was dependent on R0 resection 
and was not different from patients without metastases though our study was not 
powered for survival analysis (mean survival of 11.040 months) and expectedly, 
duodenal margin positive patients had lower overall survival compared to margin 
negative patients (mean survival of 5.188 vs. 11.763 months, p = 0.12).
CONCLUSIONS: Locally advanced tumors and pyloroantral tumors are associated with 
an increased risk of duodenal margin positivity after gastrectomy for carcinoma 
stomach and may benefit from intraoperative frozen section analysis as survival 
is negatively affected by positive RM. Patients with high-risk features like 
extensive nodal and oligometastatic disease have a greater propensity for 
positive duodenal margin. A prospective study with a large sample size is needed 
to further validate these results."
928,"Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of 
multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg 
cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic 
strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, we report a ""Trojan 
horse""-like hybrid system, nanocapsule-coupled Th17 cells, for MS treatment. 
Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently 
transmigrated across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and homed to the inflamed MS 
niche. Aminooxy-acetic acid (AOA), a transdifferentiation inducer, was locally 
released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. We 
demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enabled in situ phenotypic 
transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti-inflammatory Treg cells. This 
phenotypic conversion led to a domino-like immune response that was conducive to 
MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation 
of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory 
to anti-inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients 
suffering from other autoimmune diseases. This article is protected by

929,"BACKGROUND: BMP9-stimulated DPSCs, SCAPs and PDLSCs are effective candidates for 
repairing maxillofacial bone defects in tissue engineering, while the most 
suitable seed cell source among these three hDMSCs and the optimal combination 
of most suitable type of hDMSCs and BMP9 have rarely been explored. Moreover, 
the orthotopic maxillofacial bone defect model should be valuable but laborious 
and time-consuming to evaluate various candidates for bone regeneration. Thus, 
inspired from the maxillofacial bone defects and the traditional in vivo ectopic 
systems, we developed an intrabony defect repair model to recapitulate the 
healing events of orthotopic maxillofacial bone defect repair and further 
explore the optimized combinations of most suitable hDMSCs and BMP9 for bone 
defect repair based on this modified ectopic system.
METHODS: Intrabony defect repair model was developed by using decellularized 
bone matrix (DBM) constructs prepared from the cancellous part of porcine lumbar 
vertebral body. We implanted DBM constructs subcutaneously on the flank of each 
male NU/NU athymic nude mouse, followed by directly injecting the cell 
suspension of different combinations of hDMSCs and BMP9 into the central hollow 
area of the constructs 7 days later. Then, the quality of the bony mass, 
including bone volume fraction (BV/TV), radiographic density (in Hounsfield 
units (HU)) and the height of newly formed bone, was measured by micro-CT. 
Furthermore, the H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed to 
exam new bone and new blood vessel formation in DBM constructs.
RESULTS: BMP9-stimulated periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) exhibited the 
most effective bone regeneration among the three types of hDMSCs in DBM 
constructs. Furthermore, an optimal dose of PDLSCs with a specific extent of 
BMP9 stimulation was confirmed for efficacious new bone and new blood vessel 
formation in DBM constructs.
CONCLUSIONS: The reported intrabony defect repair model can be used to identify 
optimized combinations of suitable seed cells and biological factors for bone 
defect repair and subsequent development of efficacious bone tissue engineering 
therapies."
930,"BACKGROUND: Some patients have normal levels of complement during the diagnosis 
of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), although decreased serum levels of 
complement are a hallmark of the active phase of the disease. This study 
investigated the clinical characteristics, impact on the classification of SLE, 
and the prognosis of patients with SLE who had normal serum complement levels at 
initial diagnosis (N-com).
METHODS: We evaluated 21 patients with N-com and 96 patients with 
hypocomplementemia at the initial diagnosis of SLE (H-com). The classification 
rates among the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997, Systemic Lupus 
International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012, European League Against 
Rheumatism (EULAR)/ACR 2019 criteria, and clinical and immunological 
involvements were compared between SLE patients with N-com and H-com. Relapse 
and organ damage based on the SLICC/ACR damage index were also evaluated.
RESULTS: The classification rates of SLE were not significantly different in the 
ACR, SLICC, and EULAR/ACR criteria between the N-com and H-com groups. Patients 
with N-com had no significant differences in the classification rates among the 
three criteria, whereas patients with H-com had lower classification rates in 
the ACR criteria than in the SLICC criteria. A lower incidence of renal 
manifestation, less positivity for anti-dsDNA antibody, and a higher incidence 
of fever were observed in patients with N-com than in those with H-com. The 
occurrence of relapse and organ damage was not significantly different between 
patients with N-com and H-com.
CONCLUSION: Patients with N-com were less involved in renal manifestation and 
anti-dsDNA antibody positivity but had a higher incidence of fever than those 
with H-com, while having no disadvantage in SLE classification processes. Serum 
complement levels at the initial diagnosis of SLE may not predict prognosis."
931,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may be associated 
with late-onset necrotizing myositis, mimicking autoimmune inflammatory 
myositis; however, the exact underlying pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2-induced myositis is still unclear.
CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a rare case of necrotizing autoimmune 
myositis in a 67-year-old middle eastern male following coronavirus disease 2019 
infection, who presented with muscle weakness. The patient had positive 
anti-NXP2. The diagnosis of necrotizing autoimmune myositis was made according 
to muscle weakness, increased liver enzymes, electromyography and nerve 
conduction velocity results, and muscle biopsy. The patient underwent a full 
malignancy evaluation, which was unremarkable, and was discharged in relatively 
well condition with a daily dose of 1 mg/kg prednisolone and azathioprine 150 mg 
(2 mg/kg).
CONCLUSION: Our report highlights the already known possible protracted sequence 
of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and the potential for delayed-onset 
necrotizing myositis."
932,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with a postinfectious hyperinflammatory 
disorder, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), that shares 
characteristics with still's disease, known as systemic juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (SJIA) in children younger than 16, and adult onset Still's disease 
(AOSD) in children 16 and older. Both MIS-C and SJIA/AOSD can be complicated by 
macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a potentially fatal condition of cytokine 
storm.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 16 year-old male who developed quotidian fever, 
headache, conjunctival injection, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, 
rash, and symmetrical polyarticular arthralgia/arthritis 4 weeks after exposure 
to SARS-CoV-2 and 2 weeks after his first vaccination against COVID-19. Our 
patient's laboratory results were significant for elevated inflammatory markers 
and acute phase reactants. He met criteria for diagnosis with both MIS-C and 
AOSD. After receiving first-line treatment for both diseases, IVIG and 
methylprednisolone, our patient improved.
CONCLUSION: MAS is a life-threatening rheumatological emergency, and physicians 
must be able to identify diseases, like MIS-C and AOSD, that may be complicated 
by MAS. Our patient's distinguishing feature on presentation was symmetrical 
polyarticular arthralgia/arthritis, which has not been associated with MIS-C. 
Simultaneously, AOSD-which is associated with polyarticular 
arthralgia/arthritis-is only now being recognized as a possible post-infectious 
entity in the aftermath of COVID-19 infection. In patients like our own, who 
meet criteria for both MIS-C and AOSD, administering first line treatment for 
both diseases may be best practice."
933,"BACKGROUND: The West African Ebola virus epidemic from 2014 to 2016 is 
unprecedented in its scale, surpassing all previous and subsequent Ebola 
outbreaks since 1976. This epidemic provoked a humanitarian emergency that 
extended to different spheres of life, making visible ethical challenges in 
addition to medical, economic, and social ones. The present article aims to 
identify and differentiate the scope of ethical issues associated with the Ebola 
epidemic.
METHODS: An online media analysis was performed on articles published from March 
2014 to September 2015 in ten preselected academic journals (scientific press) 
and two online newspapers (lay press). Two methodological approaches were 
combined: a systematic literature search and a qualitative content analysis. An 
additional keyword search was conducted on the PubMed database for the period 
after the end of the Ebola epidemic (2016-2020) to obtain an overview of 
research dealing with medical ethics due to the epidemic and to compare these 
results with the identified ethical challenges.
RESULTS: A total of 389 articles dealing with the subject fields ""Ebola 
epidemic"" and ""ethics"" were researched. For qualitative content analysis, the 
time span with the highest article density was selected and a total of 64 
articles were included (15 scientific articles, 49 popular articles). Five core 
ethical challenges of the Ebola epidemic emerged: 1. Responsibility and 
Accountability, 2. Spillover Effects, 3. Research and Development, 4. Health 
Communication, and 5. Resource Allocation. Articles in academic journals were 
dominated by the discussion of normative aspects in the area of ""research and 
development"", while newspaper articles focused on aspects of ""responsibility and 
accountability"".
CONCLUSION: An ethical discussion of the Ebola epidemic requires an examination 
of as many of the ethical dimensions involved as possible. The presented 
investigation of the two types of media with regard to the Ebola epidemic offers 
this possibility of a more comprehensive insight into this diversity as a basis 
for ethical discussions."
934,"BACKGROUND: Risk of contralateral nodal metastases in oropharyngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is relatively low, however, many OPSCC patients receive 
bilateral neck treatment. This study evaluates the oncological outcomes with 
management of the contralateral cN0 neck based on lymphatic mapping with single 
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT).
METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of patients with lateralized cT1-2 and 
contralateral cN0 OPSCC treated with primary surgery between December 2017 and 
October 2019. All patients underwent pre-operative lymphatic mapping using 
SPECT-CT. Clinical parameters including demographics, tumor characteristics and 
oncological outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent primary site resection with transoral 
robotic surgery (TORS) and ipsilateral neck dissection with or without adjuvant 
therapy. Twelve patients (92.3%) had ipsilateral drainage on SPECT-CT, whereas 1 
(7.7%) patient had bilateral neck lymphatic drainage. Four patients (30.8%) 
underwent post-operative radiation therapy (PORT). Three patients with 
unilateral drainage on SPECT-CT underwent PORT with unilateral neck irradiation, 
and 1 patient with bilateral drainage underwent PORT with bilateral neck 
irradiation. Seven (53.8%) patients were staged as pT1, 6 (46.2%) patients as 
pT2, 6 (46.2%) patients were pN0, 3 (23.1%) patients were pN1, 1 (7.7%) patient 
was pN2a for and 3 (23.1%) patients were N2b. The median distance of the tumor 
from midline was 1.05 cm (0.0-1.58). Primary sites included tonsil (n = 10, 
76.9%) and tongue base (n = 3, 23.1%). The median follow-up time was 
15.4 months. All patients were disease free at the latest follow-up with no 
contralateral neck failures.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative mapping of lymphatic drainage in early stage OPSCC 
with SPECT-CT is a promising tool which can reduce treatment to the 
contralateral neck potentially without compromising oncological outcomes."
935,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive 
disorder that causes airway obstruction and lung inflammation. The first-line 
treatment of COPD is the bronchodilators of β2-agonists and antimuscarinic 
drugs, which can help control the airway obstruction, but the long-term use 
might render the drug tolerance. Bisphosphonates are widely used in 
osteoclast-mediated bone diseases treatment for decades. For drug repurposing, 
can delivery of a third generation of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, 
risedronate (RIS) ameliorate the progression of COPD?
METHODS: COPD rats or mice models have been established through 
cigarette-smoking and elastase injection, and then the animals are received RIS 
treatment via nebulization. Lung deposition of RIS was primarily assessed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The respiratory parameters of 
airway obstruction in COPD rats and mice were documented using plethysmography 
method and resistance-compliance system.
RESULTS: High lung deposition and bioavailability of RIS was monitored with 
88.8% of RIS input dose. We found that RIS could rescue the lung function 
decline of airspace enlargement and mean linear intercept in the COPD lung. RIS 
could curb the airway obstruction by suppressing 60% of the respiratory 
resistance and elevating the airway's dynamic compliance, tidal volume and 
mid-expiratory flow. As an inhibitor of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), 
RIS suppresses FDPS-mediated RAS and RhoA prenylation to obstruct its membrane 
localization in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), leading to the inhibition of 
downstream ERK-MLCK and ROCK1-MLCP pathway to cause ASMCs relaxation. 
Additionally, RIS nebulization impeded pro-inflammatory cell accumulation, 
particularly macrophages infiltration in alveolar parenchyma. The NF-κB, tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-6 declined in microphages following 
RIS nebulization. Surprisingly, nebulization of RIS could overcome the tolerance 
of β2-agonists in COPD-rats by increasing the expression of β2 receptors.
CONCLUSIONS: Nebulization of RIS could alleviate airway obstruction and lung 
inflammation in COPD, providing a novel strategy for treating COPD patients, 
even those with β2-agonists tolerance."
936,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has 
rapidly become a promising strategy for biomarker identification and 
development. The cell-type-specific nature of DNA methylation patterns and the 
direct relationship between cfDNA and apoptosis can potentially be used 
non-invasively to predict local alterations. In addition, direct detection of 
altered DNA methylation patterns performs well as a biomarker. In a previous 
study, we demonstrated marked DNA methylation alterations in brain tissue from 
patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis 
(MTLE-HS).
RESULTS: We performed DNA methylation profiling in cfDNA isolated from the serum 
of MTLE patients and healthy controls using BeadChip arrays followed by 
systematic bioinformatic analysis including deconvolution analysis and 
integration with DNase accessibility data sets. Differential cfDNA methylation 
analysis showed an overrepresentation of gene ontology terms and transcription 
factors related to central nervous system function and regulation. Deconvolution 
analysis of the DNA methylation data sets ruled out the possibility that the 
observed differences were due to changes in the proportional contribution of 
cortical neurons in cfDNA. Moreover, we found no overrepresentation of neuron- 
or glia-specific patterns in the described cfDNA methylation patterns. However, 
the MTLE-HS cfDNA methylation patterns featured a significant overrepresentation 
of the epileptic DNA methylation alterations previously observed in the 
hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of cfDNA methylation profiling as a 
rational approach to seeking non-invasive and reproducible epilepsy biomarkers."
937,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B is a public health concern in Aboriginal 
communities in the Northern Territory of Australia with prevalence almost four 
times the non-Aboriginal population. Infection is suspected to mainly occur in 
early life, however, the mode of transmission and vaccine effectiveness is not 
known in this population. WHO has set a target for hepatitis B elimination by 
2030; elimination in this disproportionately affected population in Australia 
will require understanding of the modes of transmission and vaccine 
effectiveness.
METHODS: We conducted the study at four very remote Aboriginal communities. We 
approached mothers who had chronic hepatitis B and had given birth between 1988 
and 2013 for consent. We obtained hepatitis B serology, immunisation and birth 
details from the medical record. If both mother and child had hepatitis B viral 
DNA detected, we performed viral whole genome sequencing.
RESULTS: We approached 45 women for consent, of whom 23 agreed to participate. 
We included 20 mothers and 38 of their children. Of the 20 included mothers, 5 
(25%) had children who were hepatitis B immune by exposure and 3 (15%) had 
children with evidence of chronic hepatitis B infection at the time of 
assessment. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) had been given at birth in 29/38 
(76.3, 95% CI 59.8-88.6) children, and 26 children (68.4, 95% CI 51.3-82.5) were 
fully vaccinated. Of the 3 children who had chronic hepatitis B, all had 
received HBIg at birth and two were fully vaccinated. Of the 5 who were immune 
by exposure, 4 had received HBIg at birth and one was fully vaccinated. Whole 
genome sequencing revealed one episode of definite mother to child transmission. 
There was also one definite case of horizontal transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic hepatitis B in this context is a sensitive issue, with a 
high proportion of women refusing consent. Although uncommon, there is ongoing 
transmission of hepatitis B to Aboriginal children in remote northern Australia 
despite vaccination, and this is likely occurring by both vertical and 
horizontal routes. Prevention will require ongoing investment to overcome the 
many barriers experienced by this population in accessing care."
938,"BACKGROUND: Antibody affinity maturation in vertebrates requires the enzyme 
activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) which initiates secondary antibody 
diversification by mutating the immunoglobulin loci. AID-driven antibody 
diversification is conserved across jawed vertebrates since bony and 
cartilaginous fish. Two exceptions have recently been reported, the Pipefish and 
Anglerfish, in which the AID-encoding aicda gene has been lost. Both cases are 
associated with unusual reproductive behavior, including male pregnancy and 
sexual parasitism. Several cold water fish in the Atlantic cod (Gadinae) family 
carry an aicda gene that encodes for a full-length enzyme but lack 
affinity-matured antibodies and rely on antibodies of broad antigenic 
specificity. Hence, we examined the functionality of their AID.
RESULTS: By combining genomics, transcriptomics, immune responsiveness, and 
functional enzymology of AID from 36 extant species, we demonstrate that AID of 
that Atlantic cod and related fish have extremely lethargic or no catalytic 
activity. Through ancestral reconstruction and functional enzymology of 71 AID 
enzymes, we show that this enzymatic inactivation likely took place relatively 
recently at the emergence of the true cod family (Gadidae) from their ancestral 
Gadiformes order. We show that this AID inactivation is not only concordant with 
the previously shown loss of key adaptive immune genes and expansion of innate 
and cell-based immune genes in the Gadiformes but is further reflected in the 
genomes of these fish in the form of loss of AID-favored sequence motifs in 
their immunoglobulin variable region genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent demonstrations of the loss of the aicda gene in two fish 
species challenge the paradigm that AID-driven secondary antibody 
diversification is absolutely conserved in jawed vertebrates. These species have 
unusual reproductive behaviors forming an evolutionary pressure for a certain 
loss of immunity to avoid tissue rejection. We report here an instance of 
catalytic inactivation and functional loss of AID rather than gene loss in a 
conventionally reproducing vertebrate. Our data suggest that an expanded innate 
immunity, in addition to lower pathogenic pressures in a cold environment 
relieved the pressure to maintain robust secondary antibody diversification. We 
suggest that in this unique scenario, the AID-mediated collateral genome-wide 
damage would form an evolutionary pressure to lose AID function."
939,"BACKGROUND: Pyrotinib (an irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor) plus capecitabine has 
survival benefits and acceptable tolerability in patients with HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer. We further assessed addition of pyrotinib to 
trastuzumab and docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.
METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 study (PHEDRA), 
treatment-naive women with HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer 
were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of oral 
pyrotinib or placebo (400 mg) once daily, plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg 
loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg) and docetaxel (100 mg/m2) every 3 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was the total pathological complete response (tpCR; ypT0/is and 
ypN0) rate per independent central review.
RESULTS: Between Jul 23, 2018, and Jan 8, 2021, 355 patients were randomly 
assigned, 178 to the pyrotinib group and 177 to the placebo group. The majority 
of patients completed four cycles of neoadjuvant treatment as planned (92.7% and 
97.7% in the pyrotinib and placebo groups, respectively). The tpCR rate was 
41.0% (95% CI 34.0 to 48.4) in the pyrotinib group compared with 22.0% (95% CI 
16.6 to 28.7) in the placebo group (difference, 19.0% [95% CI 9.5 to 28.4]; 
one-sided P < 0.0001). The objective response rate per investigator was 91.6% 
(95% CI 86.6 to 94.8) in the pyrotinib group and 81.9% (95% CI 75.6 to 86.9) in 
the placebo group after the neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in an increase of 
9.7% (95% CI 2.7 to 16.6). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were 
diarrhea (79 [44.4%] in the pyrotinib group and nine [5.1%] in the placebo 
group), neutropenia (33 [18.5%] and 36 [20.3%]), and decreased white blood cell 
count (29 [16.3%] and 24 [13.6%]). No deaths were reported during neoadjuvant 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint of the study was met. Neoadjuvant pyrotinib, 
trastuzumab, and docetaxel significantly improved the tpCR rate compared with 
placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel, with manageable toxicity, providing a new 
option for HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03588091."
940,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) 
remains unclear. IgG4-RD often mimics other diseases, including pancreatic 
cancer (PC) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS), which may easily lead to misdiagnosis. 
This study was performed to explore the metabolite changes and potential 
biomarkers of IgG4-RD and other misdiagnosed diseases.
METHODS: Untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics 
profiling of plasma samples from a cohort comprising healthy controls (HCs) and 
patients with IgG4-RD (n = 87), PC (n = 33), and SS (n = 31) was performed. A 
random forest machine learning model was used to verify the relevance of the 
identified metabolites in the diagnosis of different diseases and the prediction 
of disease prognosis.
RESULTS: The ATP-binding cassette transporter pathway was found to be most 
closely related to IgG4-RD, which was significantly up-regulated in the IgG4-RD 
group than in all the matched groups. Five metabolites were proved to be 
valuable biomarkers for IgG4-RD. Caftaric acid, maltotetraose, D-glutamic acid, 
1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine, and hydroxyproline were 
useful in distinguishing between IgG4-RD, PC, SS, and HC [area under the curve 
(AUC) = 1]. A combination of phenylalanine betaine, 
1-(1z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, Pi 40:8, uracil, and 
N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide showed a moderate value in predicting relapse 
in patients with IgG4-RD (AUC = 0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the metabolite changes of IgG4-RD and provide 
new insights for deepening our understanding of IgG4-RD despite the lack of 
validation in external cohorts. Metabolomic biomarkers have significance in the 
clinical diagnosis and disease prognosis of IgG4-RD."
941,"BACKGROUND: Early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is 
important to aid personalized treatment in osteosarcoma. Diffusion-weighted 
Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MRI was used to evaluate the predictive 
value for response to NACT and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.
METHODS: Total fifty-five patients with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were 
recruited prospectively, among them 35 patients were further analysed. Patients 
underwent 3 cycles of NACT (Cisplatin + Doxorubicin) followed by surgery and 
response adapted adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment outcomes were 
histopathological response to NACT (good-response ≥ 50% necrosis and 
poor-response < 50% necrosis) and survival outcome (event-free survival (EFS) 
and overall survival (OS)). IVIM MRI was acquired at 1.5T at baseline (t0), 
after 1-cycle (t1) and after 3-cycles (t2) of NACT. Quantitative IVIM parameters 
(D, D*, f & D*.f) were estimated using advanced state-of-the-art spatial penalty 
based IVIM analysis method bi-exponential model with total-variation penalty 
function (BETV) at 3 time-points and histogram analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Good-responders: Poor-responders ratio was 13 (37%):22 (63%). EFS and 
OS were 31% and 69% with 16.27 and 25.9 months of median duration respectively. 
For predicting poor-response to NACT, IVIM parameters showed AUC = 0.87, 
Sensitivity = 86%, Specificity = 77% at t0, and AUC = 0.96, Sensitivity = 86%, 
Specificity = 100% at t1. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed smaller 
tumour volume (HR = 1.002, p = 0.001) higher ADC-25th-percentile (HR = 0.047, 
p = 0.005) & D-Mean (HR = 0.1, p = 0.023) and lower D*-Mean (HR = 1.052, 
p = 0.039) were independent predictors of longer EFS (log-rank p-values: 0.054, 
0.0034, 0.0017, 0.0019 respectively) and non-metastatic disease (HR = 4.33, 
p < 10-3), smaller tumour-volume (HR = 1.001, p = 0.042), lower D*-Mean 
(HR = 1.045, p = 0.056) and higher D*.f-skewness (HR = 0.544, p = 0.048) were 
independent predictors of longer OS (log-rank p-values: < 10-3, 0.07, < 10-3, 
0.019 respectively).
CONCLUSION: IVIM parameters obtained with a 1.5T scanner along with novel BETV 
method and their histogram analysis indicating tumour heterogeneity were 
informative in characterizing NACT response and survival outcome in 
osteosarcoma."
942,"BACKGROUND: The strongest risk factor of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) is 
aging. Spontaneous asparaginyl deamidation leading to formation of isoaspartate 
(isoAsp) has been correlated with protein aggregation in NDDs.
METHODS: Two cohorts consisting of 140 subjects were studied. Cohort 1 contained 
patients with AD and healthy controls, while Cohort 2 recruited subjects with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular dementia (VaD), frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls. The levels of 
isoAsp in plasma human albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in plasma, as 
well as the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific against deamidated HSA 
were measured. Apart from the memory tests, plasma biomarkers for NDDs reported 
in literature were also quantified, including amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides Aβ40 
and Aβ42, neurofilament light protein (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) protein.
RESULTS: Deamidation products of blood albumin were significantly elevated in 
vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia (P < 0.05), but less so in PD. 
Intriguingly, the deamidation levels were significantly (P < 0.01) associated 
with the memory test scores for all tested subjects. Deamidation biomarkers 
performed superiorly (accuracy up to 92%) compared with blood biomarkers 
Aß42/Aß40, NfL, GFAP and p-tau181 in separating mild cognitive impairment from 
healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the diagnostic capacity of deamidation-related 
biomarkers in predicting NDDs at the early stage of disease, and the biomarker 
levels significantly correlated with cognitive decline, strongly supporting the 
role of deamidation in triggering neurodegeneration and early stages of disease 
development. Prospective longitudinal studies with a longer observation period 
and larger cohorts should provide a more detailed picture of the deamidation 
role in NDD progression."
943,"BACKGROUND: Prompt diagnosis of metabolic disorders in a resource-limited 
country like Nepal is daunting. Acute intermittent porphyria is a rare but 
common hepatic porphyria mostly seen in females of the reproductive age group. 
As its incidence is quite uncommon, conjectures about porphyria diagnosis are 
often duped into a diagnostic conundrum.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we unravel a case of a 15-year-old Hindu Nepalese girl 
distraught by the myriad of symptoms in the setting of severe abdominal pain 
accompanied by constipation and limb pain as the chief complaints. She presented 
with acute severe hypertension with marked persistent hyponatremia (up to 
109 mEq/L). Despite conservative management of hypertension and electrolytes, 
unresolved electrolyte imbalance led us to the speculation of disturbance in the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Due to her exacerbating neurovisceral 
status, she also required intensive care during the disease course. After 
thorough investigations and exemption of presumed provisional diagnoses, based 
on sustained symptomatic presentation, the clinical suspicion was driven towards 
a diagnosis of porphyria-related disorders. Positive Watson-Schwartz test 
substantiated the diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria. Her symptoms 
gradually abated after the consumption of high carbohydrate diets.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the baffling amalgamation of symptoms that 
simulate common diseases of concern yet are buried in the realm of porphyric 
disorders. Porphyria can be diagnosed using simple screening tools and timely 
treatment can diminish serious consequences."
944,"BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients in pediatric rheumatology suffer 
from ongoing disease activity into adulthood and thus need to be transferred 
into adult care. Transition as a structured individual process of preparation 
and patient empowerment can reduce risks of adverse long-term outcomes. The aim 
of this study was to measure long-term transition outcomes such as 
health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), patient satisfaction, and continuity of 
care in former patients of the interdisciplinary Tuebingen Transition Program 
(TTP).
METHODS: In an iterative team process, a standardized questionnaire was 
developed including the EQ-5D-5L to measure HR-QoL, visual analogue scales to 
measure various items of patient satisfaction, further questions on continuity 
of care and physical activity and physician global assessment (PGA) to determine 
disease activity. HR-QoL and physical activity were compared to data from the 
average German population. Data was analyzed descriptively, and a logistic 
regression analysis was performed to identify possible predictive factors for 
negative outcomes.
RESULTS: Response rate was 28.8% (85/295), 70.6% were female and median age was 
24.1 years. 70.6% were diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). 
Overall, HR-QoL was high (79.8 on the EQ VAS), yet lower than in the average 
population. The study cohort was more physically active than the respective 
average age groups. Mean patient satisfaction with pediatric care (8.4; standard 
deviation (SD) 1.7) and with the transition program (7.9; SD 2.6) was higher 
than with adult care (7.7; SD 2.2). 76.5% of participants received regular 
rheumatologic care after transfer. After excluding all participants in 
remission, the drop-out rate was 4.7%. A low PGA at the time of transfer was 
associated with higher HR-QoL and patient satisfaction after transfer.
CONCLUSIONS: HR-QoL of adult patients after successful transfer to adult 
rheumatology is reduced compared to the general population but physical activity 
and achievement of clinical remission could help to prevent negative long-term 
outcomes. Patient satisfaction and self-management of TTP patients were 
generally high, whereas youth-specific issues and their impact on the disease 
mandate greater attention. Treatment discontinuation rates were low and mostly 
due to remission. Further studies should focus on the identification of early 
predictors of long-term outcome to improve the process and outcome of 
transition."
945,"BACKGROUND: High glycemic variability (GV) is a poor prognostic marker in 
cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to investigate the association of GV with 
all-cause mortality in patients with acute heart failure (HF).
METHODS: The Korean Acute Heart Failure registry enrolled patients hospitalized 
for acute HF from 2011 to 2014. Blood glucose levels were measured at the time 
of admission, during hospitalization, and at discharge. We included those who 
had 3 or more blood glucose measurements in this study. Patients were divided 
into two groups based on the coefficient of variation (CoV) as an indicator of 
GV. Among survivors of the index hospitalization, we investigated all-cause 
mortality at 1 year after discharge.
RESULTS: The study analyzed 2,617 patients (median age, 72 years; median 
left-ventricular ejection fraction, 36%; 53% male). During the median follow-up 
period of 11 months, 583 patients died. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed 
that high GV (CoV > 21%) was associated with lower cumulative survival (log-rank 
P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional analysis showed that high GV was 
associated with an increased risk of 1-year (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.26-1.92) 
mortality. High GV significantly increased the risk of 1-year mortality in 
non-diabetic patients (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.47-2.54) but not in diabetic patients 
(HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.86-1.65, P for interaction = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: High in-hospital GV before discharge was associated with all-cause 
mortality within 1 year, especially in non-diabetic patients with acute HF."
946,"Diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LVDD) is equally common in elderly 
women and men. LVDD is a condition that can remain latent for a long time but is 
also held responsible for elevated left ventricular filling pressures and high 
pulmonary pressures that may result in (exercise-induced) shortness of breath. 
This symptom is the hallmark of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF) which is predominantly found in women as compared to men within the HF 
spectrum. Given the mechanistic role of LVDD in the development of HFpEF, we 
review risk factors and mechanisms that may be responsible for this sex-specific 
progression of LVDD towards HFpEF from an epidemiological point-of-view and 
propose future research directions."
947,"BACKGROUND: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes 
(iPSC-CMs) do not display all hallmarks of mature primary cardiomyocytes, 
especially the ability to use fatty acids (FA) as an energy source, containing 
high mitochondrial mass, presenting binucleation and increased DNA content per 
nuclei (polyploidism), and synchronized electrical conduction. This immaturity 
represents a bottleneck to their application in (1) disease modelling-as most 
cardiac (genetic) diseases have a middle-age onset-and (2) clinically relevant 
models, where integration and functional coupling are key. So far, several 
methods have been reported to enhance iPSC-CM maturation; however, these 
protocols are laborious, costly, and not easily scalable. Therefore, we 
developed a simple, low-cost, and rapid protocol to promote cardiomyocyte 
maturation using two small molecule activators of the peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor β/δ and gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPAR/PGC-1α) 
pathway: asiatic acid (AA) and GW501516 (GW). METHODS AND RESULTS: Monolayers of 
iPSC-CMs were incubated with AA or GW every other day for ten days resulting in 
increased expression of FA metabolism-related genes and markers for 
mitochondrial activity. AA-treated iPSC-CMs responsiveness to the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain inhibitors increased and exhibited higher flexibility in 
substrate utilization. Additionally, structural maturity improved after 
treatment as demonstrated by an increase in mRNA expression of 
sarcomeric-related genes and higher nuclear polyploidy in AA-treated samples. 
Furthermore, treatment led to increased ion channel gene expression and protein 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we developed a fast, easy, and economical method to 
induce iPSC-CMs maturation via PPAR/PGC-1α activation. Treatment with AA or GW 
led to increased metabolic, structural, functional, and electrophysiological 
maturation, evaluated using a multiparametric quality assessment."
948,"BACKGROUND: Periodontitis often causes irrevocable destruction of 
tooth-supporting tissues and eventually leads to tooth loss. Currently, stem 
cell-based tissue engineering has achieved a favorable result in regenerating 
periodontal tissues. Moreover, cell-free therapies that aim to facilitate the 
recruitment of resident repair cell populations to injured sites by promoting 
cell mobilization and homing have become alternative options to cell therapy.
MAIN TEXT: Cell aggregates (e.g., cell sheets) retain a large amount of 
extracellular matrix which can improve cell viability and survival rates after 
implantation in vivo. Electrostatic spinning and 3D bioprinting through 
fabricating specific alignments and interactions scaffold structures have made 
promising outcomes in the construction of a microenvironment conducive to 
periodontal regeneration. Cell-free therapies with adding biological agents 
(growth factors, exosomes and conditioned media) to promote endogenous 
regeneration have somewhat addressed the limitations of cell therapy.
CONCLUSION: Hence, this article reviews the progress of stem cell-based tissue 
engineering and advanced strategies for endogenous regeneration based on stem 
cell derivatives in periodontal regeneration."
949,"BACKGROUND: Sprouting angiogenesis is an important mechanism for morphogenetic 
phenomena, including organ development, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. 
In regenerative medicine, therapeutic angiogenesis is a clinical solution for 
recovery from ischemic diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been 
clinically used given their pro-angiogenic effects. MSCs are reported to promote 
angiogenesis by differentiating into pericytes or other vascular cells or 
through cell-cell communication using multiple protein-protein interactions. 
However, how MSCs physically contact and move around ECs to keep the sprouting 
angiogenesis active remains unknown.
METHODS: We proposed a novel framework of EC-MSC crosstalk analysis using human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and MSCs obtained from mice 
subcutaneous adipose tissue on a 3D in vitro model, microvessel-on-a-chip, which 
allows cell-to-tissue level study. The microvessels were fabricated and cultured 
for 10 days in a collagen matrix where MSCs were embedded.
RESULTS: Immunofluorescence imaging using a confocal laser microscope showed 
that MSCs smoothed the surface of the microvessel and elongated the angiogenic 
sprouts by binding to the microvessel's specific microstructures. Additionally, 
three-dimensional modeling of HUVEC-MSC intersections revealed that MSCs were 
selectively located around protrusions or roots of angiogenic sprouts, whose 
surface curvature was excessively low or high, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of our microvessel-on-a-chip system for 3D 
co-culture and image-based crosstalk analysis demonstrated that MSCs are 
selectively localized to concave-convex surfaces on scaffold structures and that 
they are responsible for the activation and stabilization of capillary vessels."
950,"BACKGROUND: For a substantial part of patients with chronic low back pain, the 
origin is located in the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). Minimally invasive sacroiliac 
joint fusion (MISJF) is increasingly being implemented as a treatment option in 
SIJ dysfunction. Despite remaining controversy, evidence continues to increase. 
This study evaluates the clinical results and safety of MISJF in a double-center 
consecutive case series in patients with SIJ dysfunction over a one-year 
observation period.
METHODS: SIJ complaints were diagnosed after history taking, physical 
examination and least a 50% reduction of SIJ pain 30-60 min following 
image-guided injection. Primary outcome measures were patient reported outcome 
measurements (PROMs), consisting of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score and 
EuroQol 5-dimensions 3-levels (EQ-5D-3L). Patients' perspectives on the effects 
of surgery were collected through questionnaires. Secondary outcome measures 
were implant positioning and (serious) adverse events ((S)AE's).
RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were included. In 44.8% of patients, SIJ 
dysfunction was of postpartum origin. The mean VAS-pain score improved from 7.83 
(± 1.71) to 4.97 (± 2.63) postoperatively (p < 0.001). EQ-5D-3L score improved 
from 0.266 (± 0.129) to 0.499 (± 0.260) postoperatively (p < 0.001). Opioid 
consumption decreased from 44.8 to 24.1% postoperatively (p = 0.026). In 13.7% 
of patients, an (S)AE occurred.
CONCLUSION: MISJF appears to be an effective and safe procedure in this cohort. 
Statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in pain and 
quality of life were observed one-year postoperatively. Future studies should 
focus on the long-term outcomes to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness 
of MISJF."
951,"BACKGROUND: Advances in ultrasensitive detection of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 
in plasma has enabled the use of blood tests to measure Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biomarker changes. Examination of postmortem brains of participants with 
antemortem plasma p-tau levels remains critical to understanding comorbid and 
AD-specific contribution to these biomarker changes.
METHODS: We analyzed 35 population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants 
with plasma p-tau at threonine 181 and threonine 217 (p-tau181, p-tau217) 
available within 3 years of death. Autopsied participants included cognitively 
unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia, and non-AD neurodegenerative 
disorders. Global neuropathologic scales of tau, amyloid-β, TDP-43, and 
cerebrovascular disease were examined. Regional digital pathology measures of 
tau (phosphorylated threonine 181 and 217 [pT181, pT217]) and amyloid-β (6F/3D) 
were quantified in hippocampus and parietal cortex. Neurotransmitter hubs 
reported to influence development of tangles (nucleus basalis of Meynert) and 
amyloid-β plaques (locus coeruleus) were evaluated.
RESULTS: The strongest regional associations were with parietal cortex for tau 
burden (p-tau181 R = 0.55, p = 0.003; p-tau217 R = 0.66, p < 0.001) and 
amyloid-β burden (p-tau181 R = 0.59, p < 0.001; p-tau217 R = 0.71, p < 0.001). 
Linear regression analysis of global neuropathologic scales explained 31% of 
variability in plasma p-tau181 (Adj. R2 = 0.31) and 59% in plasma p-tau217 
(Adj. R2 = 0.59). Neither TDP-43 nor cerebrovascular disease global scales 
independently contributed to variability. Global scales of tau pathology 
(β-coefficient = 0.060, p = 0.016) and amyloid-β pathology 
(β-coefficient = 0.080, p < 0.001) independently predicted plasma p-tau217 when 
modeled together with co-pathologies, but only amyloid-β (β-coefficient = 0.33, 
p = 0.021) significantly predicted plasma p-tau181. While nucleus basalis of 
Meynert neuron count/mm2 was not associated with plasma p-tau levels, a lower 
locus coeruleus neuron count/mm2 was associated with higher plasma p-tau181 
(R = -0.50, p = 0.007) and higher plasma p-tau217 (R = -0.55, p = 0.002). 
Cognitive scores (Adj. R2 = 0.25-0.32) were predicted by the global tau scale, 
but not by the global amyloid-β scale or plasma p-tau when modeled 
simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher soluble plasma p-tau levels may be the result of an 
intersection between insoluble deposits of amyloid-β and tau accumulation in 
brain, and may be associated with locus coeruleus degeneration."
952,"BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES) strongly predicts morbidity and premature 
mortality, especially for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, the effect 
of these factors on Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is not clear yet. This study was 
conducted to assess the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and MetS.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 10,009 people aged 35-70 enrolled 
from May 2016 to August 2018. The MetS was defined according to The Standard 
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-adult treatment panel III (ATP 
III) or NCEP-ATP III criteria. Demographics and socioeconomic data were gathered 
face-to-face through trained interviews. Also, lab, anthropometrics, and blood 
pressure measurements were assayed for participants. Logistic regression was 
used to estimate the association between SES and MetS, adjusted for the 
potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of MetS in the participants was 39.1%. The crude 
odds ratios were statistically significant for all the assessed variables 
(p < 0.05). After adjustment for age, sex, physical activity, smoking, and 
alcohol use as potential confounders, the results indicated significant direct 
independent associations between skill level (p = 0.006) and Townsend index 
(p = 0.002) with MetS. In contrast, no significant associations between 
educational level and wealth status with MetS.
CONCLUSION: The results of our study showed that SES is related to MetS. Among 
the four assessed SES indicators, skilled levels and Townsend score are strongly 
associated with MetS. We recommend considering people's SES when interventional 
programs are planned and conducted on MetS in similar communities."
953,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported interstitial lung disease (ILD) questionnaires are 
commonly used for the evaluation of ILD patients. However, research to test 
their performance is scarce.
METHODS: This study aimed to assess the performance of the Chest Questionnaire 
in consecutive ILD patients presenting to a tertiary ILD center. The results of 
Chest Questionnaires routinely filled by patients were analyzed together with 
clinical and demographic data retrieved from the patients' medical records. The 
ability of each questionnaire item to detect positive findings, such as 
environmental and occupational exposures, was examined relative to any 
additional findings detected by physician-acquired history. History was obtained 
by an experienced ILD pulmonologist who had access to the results of the 
questionnaire during the clinic visit.
RESULTS: The final cohort for analysis included 62 patients. Shortness of breath 
frequency and duration were the questionnaire items with the lowest probability 
of being filled out by patients. The questionnaire performed well in identifying 
96.2% of patients with a positive family history and 90.9% of patients with 
occupational exposures. However, exposures to mold or birds were frequently 
missed, self-reported by only 53.1% of exposed patients. Questionnaire's 
performance was also lower for other exposures associated with ILD (48.3%). An 
ILD-related exposure was less likely to be identified by the questionnaire in 
males (p = 0.03), while age had no such effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The Chest Questionnaire performed well in several domains, while 
failing to detect some relevant exposures. Therefore, its use should be 
accompanied by careful history taking by the physician."
954,"BACKGROUND: In recognition of the risk factors common between oral diseases and 
various chronic conditions and the intersection between oral health and 
some sustainable development goals, the current cross-sectional study was 
designed to quantify the burden of dental caries and identify factors associated 
with its occurrence in permanent teeth.
METHODS: Using data from Egypt's population-based survey (2013-2014), two 
individual-level outcomes; past caries experience (DMFT > 0) and presence of 
untreated carious lesions (DT > 0) were assessed using the WHO basic methods for 
oral health surveys. Information on potential explanatory variables including 
sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to fluoridated water, dental 
attendance, and dental anxiety was gathered using a structured questionnaire. 
Stratified multistage cluster random sampling was used to recruit survey 
participants. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify 
significant potential risk factors for caries in the permanent dentition of 
Egyptians.
FINDINGS: A total of 9,457 participants were included of which 70.3% had at 
least one untreated carious lesion. After adjusting for all covariates, 
analphabetic Egyptians were found to have significantly higher odds of caries 
experience in permanent dentition DMFT > 0 (OR 1.54, 95% CI [1.20-1.98]), DT > 0 
(OR 1.62, 95% CI [1.32-2.00]). Males, however, had significantly lower caries 
risk DMFT > 0 (OR 0.75, 95% CI [0.67-0.85]), DT > 0 (OR 0.81, 95% CI 
[0.73-0.89]) when compared to females. Regarding age, mean DMFT scores were 
significantly lower in age groups (6-15 years) (OR 0.03, 95% CI [0.014; 0.082]), 
(16- 20 years) (OR 0.09, 95% CI [0.037; 0.23]), and (21-35 years) (OR 0.22, 95% 
CI [0.09; 0.53]) than among people ≥ 60 years.
CONCLUSION: Addressing individual-level caries risk factors should be 
complemented by addressing upstream factors to reduce burden of untreated dental 
caries among Egyptians."
955,"Synthetic nanoparticles with surface bioconjugation are promising platforms for 
targeted therapy, but their simple biological functionalization is still a 
challenging task against the complex intercellular environment. Once synthetic 
nanoparticles enter the body, they are phagocytosed by immune cells by the 
immune system. Recently, the cell membrane camouflage strategy has emerged as a 
novel therapeutic tactic to overcome these issues by utilizing the fundamental 
properties of natural cells. Macrophage, a type of immune system cells, plays 
critical roles in various diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, infection and inflammation, due to the recognition and 
engulfment function of removing substances and pathogens. Macrophage membranes 
inherit the surface protein profiles and biointerfacing properties of source 
cells. Therefore, the macrophage membrane cloaking can protect synthetic 
nanoparticles from phagocytosis by the immune cells. Meanwhile, the macrophage 
membrane can make use of the natural correspondence to accurately recognize 
antigens and target inflamed tissue or tumor sites. In this review, we have 
summarized the advances in the fabrication, characterization and homing capacity 
of macrophage membrane cloaking nanoparticles in various diseases, including 
cancers, immune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system 
diseases, and microbial infections. Although macrophage membrane-camouflaged 
nanoparticles are currently in the fetal stage of development, there is huge 
potential and challenge to explore the conversion mode in the clinic."
956,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing adaptation of plants to their environment is the basis 
for their survival. In this adaptation, mechanoperception of gravity and local 
curvature plays a role of prime importance in finely regulating growth and 
ensuring a dynamic balance preventing buckling. However, the abiotic environment 
is not the exclusive cause of mechanical stimuli. Biotic interactions between 
plants and microorganisms also involve physical forces and potentially 
mechanoperception. Whether pathogens trigger mechanoperception in plants and the 
impact of mechanotransduction on the regulation of plant defense remains however 
elusive.
RESULTS: Here, we found that the perception of pathogen-derived mechanical cues 
by microtubules potentiates the spatio-temporal implementation of plant immunity 
to fungus. By combining biomechanics modeling and image analysis of the 
post-invasion stage, we reveal that fungal colonization releases plant cell 
wall-born tension locally, causing fluctuations of tensile stress in walls of 
healthy cells distant from the infection site. In healthy cells, the 
pathogen-derived mechanical cues guide the reorganization of mechanosensing 
cortical microtubules (CMT). The anisotropic patterning of CMTs is required for 
the regulation of immunity-related genes in distal cells. The CMT-mediated 
mechanotransduction of pathogen-derived cues increases Arabidopsis disease 
resistance by 40% when challenged with the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
CONCLUSIONS: CMT anisotropic patterning triggered by pathogen-derived mechanical 
cues activates the implementation of early plant defense in cells distant from 
the infection site. We propose that the mechano-signaling triggered immunity 
(MTI) complements the molecular signals involved in pattern and 
effector-triggered immunity."
957,"BACKGROUND: Mexican-origin adults living near the U.S.-Mexico border experience 
unique and pervasive social and ecological stressors, including poverty, 
perceived discrimination, and environmental hazards, potentially contributing to 
the high burden of chronic disease. However, there is also evidence that 
residents in high-density Mexican-origin neighborhoods exhibit lower prevalence 
rates of disease and related mortality than those living in other areas. 
Understanding the factors that contribute to health resiliencies at the 
community scale is essential to informing the effective design of health 
promotion strategies.
METHODS: La Vida en la Frontera is a mixed-methods participatory study linking a 
multi-disciplinary University of Arizona research team with Campesinos Sin 
Fronteras, a community-based organization founded by community health workers in 
San Luis, Arizona. This paper describes the current protocol for aims 2 and 3 of 
this multi-faceted investigation. In aim 2 a cohort of N≈300 will be recruited 
using door-to-door sampling of neighborhoods in San Luis and Somerton, AZ. 
Participants will be surveyed and undergo biomarker assessments for indicators 
of health and chronic stress at three time points across a year length. A subset 
of this cohort will be invited to participate in aim 3 where they will be 
interviewed to further understand mechanisms of resilience and wellbeing.
DISCUSSION: This study examines objective and subjective mechanisms of the 
relationship between stress and health in an ecologically diverse rural 
community over an extended timeframe and illuminates health disparities 
affecting residents of this medically underserved community. Findings from this 
investigation directly impact the participants and community through deepening 
our understanding of the linkages between individual and community level stress 
and chronic disease risk. This innovative study utilizes a comprehensive 
methodology to investigate pathways of stress and chronic disease risk present 
at individual and community levels. We address multiple public health issues 
including chronic disease and mental illness risk, health related disparities 
among Mexican-origin people, and health protective mechanisms and behaviors."
958,"BACKGROUND: Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN) accounts for a 
main cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic renal failure and uremia. 
This paper aimed to examine the effect of Ntrk1 on MsPGN development, so as to 
identify a novel therapeutic target for MsPGN.
METHODS: The MsPGN rat model was constructed by single injection of Thy1.1 
monoclonal antibody via the tail vein. Additionally, the Ntrk1 knockdown rat 
model was established by injection of Ntrk1-RNAi lentivirus via the tail vein. 
Periodic acid-schiff staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on 
kidney tissues. Moreover, the rat urinary protein was detected. Mesangial cells 
were transfected and treated with p38 inhibitor (SB202190) and ERK inhibitor 
(PD98059). Meanwhile, the viability and proliferation of mesangial cells were 
analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays. 
Gene expression was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) and Western-blot (WB) assays.
RESULTS: The proliferation of mesangial cells was enhanced in glomerulus and 
Ki67 expression was up-regulated in renal tubule of MsPGN rats. The urine 
protein level increased in MsPGN rats. Pro-inflammatory factors and Ntrk1 
expression were up-regulated in glomerulus of MsPGN rats. Ntrk1 up-regulation 
promoted the viability, proliferation, expression of pro-inflammatory factors 
and activation of the STAT3, p38 and ERK signaling pathways in mesangial cells. 
Ntrk1 knockdown reduced mesangial cell proliferation, urine protein, 
pro-inflammatory factors, activation of STAT3, p38 and ERK signaling pathways in 
glomerulus, and decreased Ki67 expression in renal tubule of MsPGN rats. 
Treatment with SB202190 and PD98059 reversed the effect of Ntrk1 on promoting 
the viability, proliferation and inflammatory response of mesangial cells.
CONCLUSION: Ntrk1 promoted mesangial cell proliferation and inflammation in 
MsPGN rats by activating the STAT3 and p38/ERK MAPK signaling pathways."
959,"BACKGROUND: Carbon monoxide intoxication and smoke inhalation injury can lead to 
severe disorders, and the current literature has elaborated on the importance of 
major cardiopulmonary impairment. Exercise intolerance has seldom been 
discussed, particular in patient with low cardiovascular risk.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two young male fire survivors who presented with exercise 
intolerance after CO intoxication and smoke inhalation injury. Both received 
bronchodilator and glucocorticoid therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, and 
hyperbaric oxygen therapy for airway edema and CO intoxication during acute 
care. Serum carboxyhemoglobin levels improved after treatment (8.2-3.9% in Case 
A and 14.8-0.8% in Case B). However, subjective exercise intolerance was noted 
after discharge. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing revealed exercise-induced 
myocardial ischemia during peak exercise (significant ST-segment depression on 
exercise electrocardiogram). They were instructed to exercise with precaution by 
setting the intensity threshold according to the ischemic threshold. Their 
symptoms improved, and no cardiopulmonary events were reported in the 6-month 
follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The present case report raised the attention that exercise 
intolerance after carbon monoxide intoxication and smoke inhalation injury in 
low cardiovascular risk population may be underestimated. Cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing help physician to discover exercise-induced myocardial ischemia 
and set up the cardiac rehabilitation program accordingly."
960,"BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is frequently observed in young 
adults. There is no wide consensus on optimal treatment in the literature, and 
various procedures are used in clinical practice. The objective of this study 
was to assess current practice, experience, training, and attitudes towards PSD 
surgery among Norwegian surgeons.
METHODS: An online survey on PSD surgery was created and sent to all members of 
the Norwegian Surgical Association. Categorical data were reported as 
frequencies and percentages.
RESULTS: Most currently practicing Norwegian surgeons used the Bascom's cleft 
lift (93.2%) or minimally invasive procedures (55.4%). Midline excisions with 
primary closure (19.7%) or secondary healing (22.4%) were still used by some 
surgeons, though. Most surgeons had received training in PSD surgery supervised 
by a specialist, but only about half of them felt sufficiently trained. The 
surgeons generally performed few PSD operations per year. Many considered PSD as 
a condition of low surgical status and this patient group as underprioritized.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PSD surgery in Norway has been moving 
away from midline excisions and towards off-midline flap procedures and 
minimally invasive techniques. PSD and its treatment have a low status among 
many Norwegian surgeons. This study calls for attention to this underprioritized 
group of patients and shows the need for consensus in PSD treatment such as 
development of national guidelines in Norway. Further investigation on training 
in PSD and the role of supervision is needed."
961,"Phototheranostics has received sustained attention due to its great potential in 
revolutionizing conventional strategies of cancer treatment. However, trapped by 
the complexity, poor reproducibility, insufficient phototheranostic outputs, and 
inevitable damage to normal tissue of most multicomponent phototheranostic 
systems, its clinical translation has been severely hindered. Therefore, the 
exploration of ""one for all"" smart phototheranostic agents with versatile 
functionalities remains an appealing yet enormously challenging task. Herein, a 
reversibly pH-switchable and near-infrared second photosensitizer featuring 
aggregation-induced emission was tactfully designed by molecular engineering for 
precise tumor-targeting fluorescence imaging-guided phototherapy. Thanks to the 
strong intramolecular charge transfer, enhanced highly efficient intersystem 
crossing, and sufficient intramolecular motion, the developed agent DTTVBI was 
endowed with boosted type-I superoxide anion radical generation and excellent 
photothermal performance under 808 nm laser irradiation. More importantly, 
DTTVBI nanoparticles with high biocompatibility exhibit remarkably enhanced 
type-I photodynamic/photothermal therapy in the tumor region, thus offering 
significant antitumor effects both in vitro and in the patient-derived tumor 
xenograft model of colon cancer. This work sheds new light on the development of 
superior versatile phototheranostics for cancer therapy."
962,"BACKGROUND: Korea has a two-tiered universal health security system: the 
wage-based National Health Insurance (NHI) program and government-subsidized 
Medical Aid (MA) program. Beneficiaries of the MA program belong to the lowest 
economic class. This study aims to investigate the association between economic 
status-defined as NHI or MA enrollment-and health disparity of older people 
aged ≥ 65 years in South Korea.
METHODS: The claims records of 672,525 older age population from the 2017 Health 
Insurance Review and Assessment Service-Adult Patient Sample were used to 
estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of MA vs. NHI beneficiaries for prevalence 
for common geriatric diseases. Logistic regression and negative binomial 
regression were used to investigate the association between economic status and 
prevalence or healthcare utilization for each disease.
RESULTS: MA beneficiaries showed significantly higher prevalence than NHI 
beneficiaries for seven out of nine diseases (aORs ranging from 1.18 to 1.95). 
The discrepancy in the prevalence between the two groups was highest among those 
aged 65-69 years (aORs: 1.34-2.94), and diminished as they got older (aORs: 
1.05-1.67). MA beneficiaries had significantly more outpatient visits to treat 
six diseases (aORs: 1.07-1.28), and more hospitalization to treat seven diseases 
(aORs:1.08-1.73) than NHI beneficiaries.
CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of common geriatric diseases among MA than NHI 
beneficiaries confirms unfavorable health disparity in the elderly living in 
extreme poverty. Similar or higher healthcare utilization in treating the same 
conditions among MA beneficiaries suggests a low possibility of inequity for 
access to healthcare resources covered by the universal health security system 
due to poor economic status. Greater excess use of inpatient than outpatient 
care by MA beneficiaries implies that the condition of poor older adults might 
be more severe when diagnosed with the same disease."
963,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of 
inflammatory gene expression, but their roles in neuroinflammation are poorly 
understood. Here, we identified the inflammation-related lncRNAs and correlated 
mRNAs of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human microglial cell line HMC3. 
We explored their potential roles and interactions using bioinformatics tools 
such as gene ontology (GO), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), and 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).
RESULTS: We identified 5 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, 4 of which 
(AC083837.1, IRF1-AS1, LINC02605, and MIR3142HG) are novel for microglia. The 
DElncRNAs with their correlated DEmRNAs (99 total) fell into two network modules 
that both were enriched with inflammation-related RNAs. However, treatment with 
the anti-inflammatory agent JQ1, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and 
extra-terminal (BET) protein BRD4, neutralized the LPS effect in only one 
module, showing little or even enhancing effect on the other.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide insight into, and a resource for studying, 
the regulation of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and its potential therapy 
by small-molecule BET inhibitors."
964,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people around the world either 
directly or indirectly. Deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 as the 
underlying cause of death or as a contributing cause of death. It is estimated 
that millions of excess deaths were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in 
2020 and 2021. The importance of a clinical autopsy on COVID-19 corpses lies in 
understanding the pathogenesis of the disease better. Moreover, a forensic 
autopsy may be performed on a COVID-19-infected corpse when indicated for 
medico-legal purposes. From the autopsy perspective, handling COVID-19-infected 
corpses requires specific guidelines and safety measures to be followed to limit 
the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus. This is essential as 
COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by a newly discovered virus. 
This review narrates the safety measures that should be followed at different 
stages of handling COVID-19 corpses, starting from the death scene to burial and 
funeral. Ethical issues in handling COVID-19 corpses are also briefed in this 
review. As COVID-19 can be transmitted through infected bodies, it is crucial to 
wear recommended personal protective equipment, specifically for 
aerosol-generating procedures. There are specific safety measures to be 
considered before transporting the body to the mortuary, with particular 
requirements to be implemented there, such as specific engineering controls, 
staff training, and autopsy room precautions. After conducting the autopsy, 
disinfection of the tools and equipment, body bags, transport vehicles, and the 
autopsy room should be considered."
965,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) often has 
lifelong neurodevelopmental consequences. We aimed to review early predictors 
(<4 months of age) of long-term outcome.
METHODS: We carried out a systematic literature search (PubMed and Embase), and 
included articles describing term-born infants with PAIS that underwent a 
diagnostic procedure within four months of age, and had any reported outcome 
parameter ≥12 months of age. Two independent reviewers included studies and 
performed risk of bias analysis.
RESULTS: We included 41 articles reporting on 1395 infants, whereof 1255 (90%) 
infants underwent follow-up at a median of 4 years. A meta-analysis was 
performed for the development of cerebral palsy (n = 23 studies); the best 
predictor was the qualitative or quantitative assessment of the corticospinal 
tracts on MRI, followed by standardized motor assessments. For long-term 
cognitive functioning, bedside techniques including (a)EEG and NIRS might be 
valuable. Injury to the optic radiation on DTI correctly predicted visual field 
defects. No predictors could be identified for behavior, language, and 
post-neonatal epilepsy.
CONCLUSION: Corticospinal tract assessment on MRI and standardized motor 
assessments are best to predict cerebral palsy after PAIS. Future research 
should be focused on improving outcome prediction for non-motor outcomes.
IMPACT: We present a systematic review of early predictors for various long-term 
outcome categories after perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS), including a 
meta-analysis for the outcome unilateral spastic cerebral palsy. Corticospinal 
tract assessment on MRI and standardized motor assessments are best to predict 
cerebral palsy after PAIS, while bedside techniques such as (a)EEG and NIRS 
might improve cognitive outcome prediction. Future research should be focused on 
improving outcome prediction for non-motor outcomes."
966,"Radiation therapy (RT) can enhance the abscopal effect of immune checkpoint 
blockade. This phase I/II study investigated the efficacy and safety of 
nivolumab plus RT in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer requiring palliative 
RT for bone metastases. Cohort A included luminal-like disease, and cohort B 
included both luminal-like and triple-negative disease refractory to standard 
systemic therapy. Patients received 8 Gy single fraction RT for bone metastasis 
on day 0. Nivolumab was administered on day 1 for each 14-day cycle. In cohort 
A, endocrine therapy was administered. The primary endpoint was the objective 
response rate (ORR) of the unirradiated lesions. Cohorts A and B consisted of 18 
and 10 patients, respectively. The ORR was 11% (90% CI 4-29%) in cohort A and 0% 
in cohort B. Disease control rates were 39% (90% CI 23-58%) and 0%. Median 
progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% CI 2.1-6.1 months) and 2.0 months 
(95% CI 1.2-3.7 months). One patient in cohort B experienced a grade 3 adverse 
event. Palliative RT combined with nivolumab was safe and showed modest 
anti-tumor activity in cohort A. Further investigations to enhance the 
anti-tumor effect of endocrine therapy combined with RT plus immune checkpoint 
blockade are warranted.Trial registration number and date of registration UMIN:

967,"Reprogramming Müller glia (MG) into functional cells is considered a promising 
therapeutic strategy to treat ocular diseases and vision loss. However, current 
AAV-based system for MG-tracing was reported to have high leakage in recent 
studies. Here, we focused on reducing the leakage of AAV-based labeling systems 
and found that different AAV serotypes showed a range of efficiency and 
specificity in labeling MG, leading us to optimize a human GFAP-Cre reporter 
system packaged in the AAV9 serotype with the woodchuck hepatitis virus 
post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) removed. The leakage ratio of the 
AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-ΔWPRE decreased by an approximate 40-fold compared with the 
AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-WPRE labeling system. In addition, we validated the specificity 
of the AAV-ΔWPRE system for tracing MG reprogramming under Ptbp1-suppression and 
observed strict non-MG-conversion, similar to previous studies using genetic 
lineage tracking mouse models. Thus, the AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-ΔWPRE system showed high 
efficiency and specificity for MG labeling, providing a promising tool for 
tracing cell fate in vivo."
968,"INTRODUCTION: Progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH) is a rare, debilitating 
disorder characterized by heterotopic ossification in the skin and muscles, 
resulting in contractures of the joints and progressive loss of function. While 
60-70% of the POH patients have paternally inherited, inactivating pathogenic 
variants in GNAS, the remaining 30-40% have no known etiology. FAM111B 
pathogenic variants, located on chromosome 11q12.1, cause POIKTMP (hereditary 
fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary 
fibrosis), a very rare, autosomal-dominant disorder with high frequency of de 
novo missense pathogenic variants, which affects multiple tissues and organs, 
causing extensive fibrosis and muscle adiposis, though the exact mechanism is 
unknown. To our knowledge, there are no reports of FAM111B associated with POH. 
We describe the first case of POH phenotype associated with a novel de novo 
frameshift pathogenic variant in the FAM111B and present an analysis of the 
protein structure and function caused by this genomic disruption.
CASE: A 15-year-old African-American male presented with generalized calcific 
nodules, progressive contractures, and muscle weakness leading to immobility, 
beginning at 6 years of age. Cutaneous examination showed generalized hard 
nodules varying from small to plaque-like ulcerated erupted skin lesions. 
Biochemical evaluation revealed 25(OH) vitamin D insufficiency (20 ng/mL), and 
normal levels of parathyroid hormone, FGF-23, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and 
phosphorus. Skeletal survey radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of the 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed extensive soft tissue and muscle heterotopic 
ossifications involving shoulders, axillae, trunk, abdomen, pelvis, upper and 
lower extremities, in a clumped, conglomerate distribution within muscle, 
subcutaneous fat, and in some areas extending to the skin. There was no 
pulmonary fibrosis on the chest CT. The clinical and radiographic findings were 
most consistent with POH. A trio-clinical exome sequencing revealed a de novo 
heterozygous likely pathogenic variant in the FAM111B (OMIM # 615584) 
(c.1462delT [p.Cys488Valfs*21]). The resulted frameshift change in exon 4 
replaced C-terminal region with 21 alternative amino acids. Multiple, previously 
reported disease-associated variants appear to localize within the trypsin-like 
cysteine/serine peptidase domain in which this variant occurs, supporting the 
functional significance of this region, though none have been previously 
reported to be associated with POH phenotype. Our 3D protein modeling showed 
obliteration of predicted protein folding and structure, and elimination of the 
zinc-binding domain, likely severely affecting protein function.
CONCLUSION: This is the first case of POH phenotype associated with a novel de 
novo pathogenic frameshift variant in FAM111B. Whether the frameshift change in 
FAM111B predicts POH remains unclear. Further evaluations are necessary to fully 
elucidate this finding and the potential role and mechanism by which the FAM111B 
variants contributes to POH phenotype."
969,"Rasagiline has a certain potential in neuroprotection and delaying the 
progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the poor pharmacokinetics (PK) 
characteristics of conventional oral tablets and poor medication compliance 
limit the optimal efficacy of rasagiline. Based on this, we designed and 
optimized a sustained-release rasagiline in situ gel based on in vitro release 
and in vivo PK results. Among them, we found for the first time that aluminum 
hydroxide can effectively shorten the lag phase and promote early and late 
release, making the daily release more uniform. After subcutaneous 
administration of the optimized gel formulation at a monthly dose, the Cmax 
(64 ng/ml) was lower than that of free rasagiline (494 ng/ml) administered 
subcutaneously at a daily dose and comparable to that of oral administration of 
Azilect® (59.1 ng/ml) at a daily dose. In the meantime, the plasma concentration 
of rasagiline was mainly maintained at 5-10 ng/ml for about 1 month, and the 
active metabolite 1-aminoindane in plasma was also able to maintain a steady 
state. The rasagiline in situ gel has suitable viscosity and injectability, good 
repeatability of subcutaneous injection, and controllable impurities and can 
achieve sustained release in vivo with small burst release, which may have the 
clinical application advantages of maximizing the disease-modifying effect of 
rasagiline and improving medication compliance. The rasagiline in situ gel was 
optimized through the feedback of in vitro release and in vivo pharmacokinetics 
(PK), in which the addition of aluminum hydroxide had a modulating effect on 
uniform release. The gel has low burst release and maintains steady-state blood 
drug concentration for about 1 month."
970,"The cerebellum is involved in many motor, autonomic and cognitive functions, and 
new tasks that have a cerebellar contribution are discovered on a regular basis. 
Simultaneously, our insight into the functional compartmentalization of the 
cerebellum has markedly improved. Additionally, studies on cerebellar output 
pathways have seen a renaissance due to the development of viral tracing 
techniques. To create an overview of the current state of our understanding of 
cerebellar efferents, we undertook a systematic review of all studies on 
monosynaptic projections from the cerebellum to the brainstem and the 
diencephalon in mammals. This revealed that important projections from the 
cerebellum, to the motor nuclei, cerebral cortex, and basal ganglia, are 
predominantly di- or polysynaptic, rather than monosynaptic. Strikingly, most 
target areas receive cerebellar input from all three cerebellar nuclei, showing 
a convergence of cerebellar information at the output level. Overall, there 
appeared to be a large level of agreement between studies on different species 
as well as on the use of different types of neural tracers, making the emerging 
picture of the cerebellar output areas a solid one. Finally, we discuss how this 
cerebellar output network is affected by a range of diseases and syndromes, with 
also non-cerebellar diseases having impact on cerebellar output areas."
971,"PURPOSE: Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) 
which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD 
on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study 
the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.
METHODS: RNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts 
and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were 
identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall 
survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were 
identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association 
between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic 
mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.
RESULTS: Consensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters 
(ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME 
cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three 
ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best 
prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above 
analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of 
cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 
3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. 
Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk 
signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high 
infiltration of immune-active cells.
CONCLUSION: This study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, 
excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding 
immunotherapy and chemotherapy."
972,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis) 
is a chronic inflammation-induced cholestatic process in the liver. 
Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) are observed in around 90% of patients, 
which suggests that PBC is an autoimmune disease. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), 
ADH isoenzymes and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are localized in the liver, and 
they are useful markers of liver dysfunction. In this study, the activity of 
total ADH, ADH isoenzymes and ALDH was evaluated in the blood serum of patients 
with PBC. The experimental group comprised 50 PBC patients, both male and 
female, aged 28-67. The control group consisted of 50 healthy subjects, both 
male and female, aged 25-65. The serum activity of class I ADH, class II ADH and 
ALDH was measured by spectrofluorophotometry, whereas total ADH and class III 
ADH activity was determined by photometry methods. The activity of class I ADH 
and total ADH was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the 
control group (p < 0.001). An increase in class I ADH and total ADH activity 
indicates that the isoenzyme class I ADH is released by compromised liver cells 
and can be useful diagnostic markers of PBC."
973,"PURPOSE: We explore the use of intravenously delivered perfluorocarbon (PFC) 
nanoemulsion and 19F MRI for detecting inflammation in a mouse model of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Correlative studies of 1H-based liver 
proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T1 measurements and histology are also 
evaluated.
PROCEDURES: C57BL/6 mice were fed standard or high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks to 
induce NAFLD. 1H MRI measurements of PDFF and T1 relaxation time were performed 
at baseline to assess NAFLD onset prior to administration of a PFC nanoemulsion 
to enable 19F MRI of liver PFC uptake. 1H and 19F MRI biomarkers were acquired 
at 2, 21, and 42 days post-PFC to assess changes. Histopathology of liver tissue 
was performed at experimental endpoint.
RESULTS: Significant increases in liver volume, PDFF, and total PFC uptake were 
noted in HFD mice compared to Std diet mice. Liver fluorine density and T1 
relaxation time were significantly reduced in HFD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated longitudinal quantification of multiple MRI 
biomarkers of disease in NAFLD mice. The changes in liver PFC uptake in HFD mice 
were compared with healthy mice that suggests that 19F MRI may be a viable 
biomarker of liver pathology."
974,"BACKGROUND: Patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) may co-present with 
features of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis 
(PSC). Using a national transplant registry, the outcomes of patients with these 
autoimmune liver conditions were compared.
METHODS: The UNOS-STAR registry was used to select a study population of AIH, 
PSC, and PBC liver transplant (LT) patients. Living and multi-organ transplant 
cases were excluded. Using the UNOS-registered diagnoses, the study population 
was subdivided into those with nonoverlapping autoimmune liver diseases and 
those with overlapping forms (e.g., AIH-PBC). Outcomes were compared, using 
endpoints such as all-cause mortality, graft failure, and organ-system specific 
causes of death.
RESULTS: The main analysis featured 2048 entries, with 1927 entries having 
nonoverlapping AIH, 52 entries having PSC overlap, and 69 entries having PBC 
overlap. Patients with PBC overlap were more likely to have graft failure 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.46 95% CI 1.70-7.05), mortality secondary to 
respiratory causes (aHR 3.57 95% CI 1.23-10.43), and mortality secondary to 
recurrent disease (aHR 9.53 95% CI 1.85-49.09). Case incidence rates reflected 
these findings, expressed in events per 1000 person-years. For patients with PBC 
overlap and nonoverlapping AIH cases, respectively. Graft failure: 28.87 events 
vs. 9.42 events, mortality secondary to respiratory causes: 12.83 deaths vs. 
3.77 deaths, mortality secondary to recurrent disease: 6.42 deaths vs. 1.26 
deaths. Those with AIH-PSC overlap experienced a higher risk of death from graft 
infection (aHR 10.43 95% CI 1.08-100.37; case-incidence rate: 3.89 vs. 0.31 
mortalities per 1000 person-years). Supplementary analysis showed similar 
findings, in which overlapping autoimmune conditions were associated with higher 
adverse outcome rates.
CONCLUSION: Patients with AIH-PBC overlap have higher risk of mortality due to 
recurrent liver disease and respiratory causes, and patients with AIH-PSC 
overlap have higher risk of mortality due to graft infection. While further 
prospective studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms related to 
these findings, our study characterizes the prognostic implications of AIH 
overlap on post-LT mortality and graft failure risks."
975,"Black-spot shell disease decreases pearl quality and threatens pearl oyster 
survival. Establishment of a rapid, specific, and sensitive assay to detect 
Tenacibaculum sp. strain Pbs-1 associated with black-spot shell disease is of 
commercial importance. We developed a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive 
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect Tenacibaculum sp. 
Pbs-1 in Akoya pearl oysters Pinctada fucata. A set of five specific primers 
(two inner, two outer, and a loop) were designed based on the 16S-23S internal 
spacer region of strain Pbs-1. The optimum reaction temperature was 63 °C, and 
concentrations of the inner and loop primers were 1.4 and 1.0 µM, respectively. 
The LAMP product can be detected using agarose gel electrophoresis, and the 
color change in the reaction tube can be detected visually (by the naked eye) 
following the addition of malachite green. Our assay proved to be specific for 
strain Pbs-1, with no cross-reactivity with five other species of Tenacibaculum. 
The detection limit of the LAMP assay at 35 min is 50 pg, and at 60 min it is 
5 fg. We evaluated the LAMP assay using diseased and healthy pearl oysters. The 
results demonstrate the suitability and simplicity of this test for rapid field 
diagnosis of strain Pbs-1."
976,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Periodontitis is a highly prevalent disease in 
psychiatric patients, including those undergoing symptomatic treatment with 
second-generation antipsychotics. Some of these drugs, such as clozapine (CLO) 
and olanzapine (OLA), have prominent metabolic effects such as weight gain, 
hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, which are risk factors for periodontitis. In 
addition to the metabolic effects, there are reports of changes in salivary 
flow, gingival bleeding, and caries. In this context, we aimed to evaluate if 
the metabolic effects of OLA and CLO alter periodontal parameters in an animal 
model of periodontitis without the environmental and psychosocial biases 
inherent to human diseases.
METHODS: In the first set of experiments, male and female adult Wistar rats 
received oral administration of CLO, OLA, or vehicle for 45 days. They were 
evaluated for body mass composition and weight gain, blood glucose parameters 
(fasting and glucose tolerance and insulin resistance tests), and lipid profile 
(HDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides). In a second set of experiments, the 
same measurements were performed in female rats exposed to the antipsychotics 
for 45 days and ligature-induced periodontitis on the 30th day of treatment. 
Macroscopic measurements of exposed roots, microtomography in the furcation 
region of the first molar, and histological evaluation of the region between the 
first and second molars were evaluated to assess bone loss. Additionally, 
gingival measurements of myeloperoxidase activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine 
TNF-α were made.
RESULTS: Only females exposed to OLA had more significant weight gain than 
controls. They also exhibited differences in glucose metabolism. 
Ligature-induced periodontitis produced intense bone retraction without changing 
the density of the remaining structures. The bone loss was even higher in rats 
with periodontitis treated with OLA or CLO and was accompanied by a local 
increase in TNF-α caused by CLO. These animals, however, did not exhibit the 
same metabolic impairments observed for animals without periodontitis.
CONCLUSION: The use of clozapine and olanzapine may be a risk factor for 
periodontal disease, independent of systemic metabolic alterations."
977,"Renal cell carcinoma accounts for 2-3% of all cancers. It is difficult to 
diagnose early. Recently, genome-wide studies have identified that histone 
methylation was one of the functional classes that is most frequently 
dysregulated in renal cell cancer. Mutation or mis-regulation of histone 
methylation, methyltransferases, demethylases are associated with gene 
expression and tumor progression in renal cell cancer. Herein, we summarize 
histone methylations, demethylases and their alterations and mechanisms in renal 
cell cancer."
978,"BACKGROUND: Lacrimal adenoid cystic carcinoma (LACC) is the most common orbital 
malignant epithelial neoplasm. LACC with high-grade transformation (LACC-HGT) 
has higher rates of recurrence, metastasis, and mortality than LACC without HGT. 
This study investigated the effects of microRNA-29a-3p (miR-29a-3p) in the 
pathogenesis of LACC-HGT.
METHODS: An Agilent human miRNA microarray was used to screen the differentially 
expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in LACC and LACC-HGT tumor tissues. Then, the primary 
cells obtained in previous studies were used to determine the effect of 
miR-29a-3p.
RESULTS: The expression of miR-29a-3p was abnormally lower in LACC-HGT than in 
LACC. miR-29a-3p can specifically target the 3' UTR of Quaking mRNA and 
down-regulate Quaking expression, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, 
migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of LACC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated that miR-29a-3p functions as a tumor 
suppressor by down-regulating the expression of Quaking to inhibit the 
tumorigenesis of LACC cells. This study may also reveal the pathogenesis of HGT 
in LACC cells and provide a reference for LACC-HGT targeted diagnosis."
979,"BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excessive 
hepatic lipid accumulation, imposes serious challenges on public health 
worldwide. Breastfeeding has been reported to reduce the risk of NAFLD. 
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayer membrane vesicles released from various 
cells into the extracellular space, participating in multiple life processes. 
Whether EVs from human milk exert metabolic benefits against NAFLD is worth 
investigating.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, the EVs were isolated from human milk 
collected from healthy mothers and quantified. Functional analyses were 
performed using the NAFLD mouse model and free fatty acid (FFA)-stimulated mouse 
primary hepatocytes. The results showed that human milk-derived EVs could 
effectively alleviate high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin 
resistance in mice with NAFLD via inhibiting lipogenesis and increasing 
lipolysis. The FFA-induced lipid accumulation was also inhibited in hepatocytes 
after treatment with human milk-derived EVs. Mechanistically, the human milk 
derived-EVs cargo (proteins and miRNAs), which linked to lipid metabolism, may 
be responsible for these beneficial effects.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study highlighted the therapeutic benefits of 
human milk-derived EVs and provided a new strategy for NAFLD treatment."
980,"Integration of high-dimensional tumor gene expression data with 
clinicopathological data can increase our understanding of disease diversity, 
enable retrospective patient stratification, and identify new potential 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Using a systems biology approach, we provide 
a holistic overview of gene co-expression networks in head and neck squamous 
cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis of HNSCC 
RNA sequencing data from 519 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was 
used to determine correlates of 5-year survival, using regression tree-based 
optimal threshold calculations. Survival-associated gene sets were transformed 
to gene set scores that were assessed for correlation with clinicopathological 
data. We identified 8 gene co-expression modules for HNSCC tumors, each of which 
contained co-expressed genes associated significantly with 5-year survival. 
Survival-associated co-expression gene signatures correlated dominantly with 
tumor HPV and p16 status. Network analysis identified that survival was 
associated with signaling networks of infection, immunity, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, glycolysis, focal adhesion, 
extracellular matrix, MYC signaling, autophagy and transcriptional regulation. 
EMT-associated gene signatures were expressed dominantly in fibroblasts, and 
cancer-associated fibroblasts were inversely correlated with immune activity. 
Interestingly, a high Immune Suppression Score based on expression of 21 genes 
associated with immune inhibition and including immune checkpoints, cytokines 
and regulatory T cell factors, was also associated with increased survival 
probability, and was significantly higher in HPV+ HNSCC. Networks associated 
with HNSCC survival were further associated with survival in cervical cancer, 
melanoma and lung cancer. This study defines 5129 genes associated with HNSCC 
survival, organized into co-expressed networks, their correlation with 
clinicopathological data, and with gene expression data from other malignant 
diseases, and provides a source for the discovery of biomarkers and novel 
therapies for HNSCC."
981,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients with 
coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). We aimed to explore the changes in AKI 
epidemiology between the first and the second COVID wave in the United Kingdom 
(UK).
METHODS: This was an observational study of critically ill adult patients with 
COVID-19 in an expanded tertiary care intensive care unit (ICU) in London, UK. 
Baseline characteristics, organ support, COVID-19 treatments, and patient and 
kidney outcomes up to 90 days after discharge from hospital were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 772 patients were included in the final analysis (68% male, 
mean age 56 ± 13.6). Compared with wave 1, patients in wave 2 were older, had 
higher body mass index and clinical frailty score, but lower baseline serum 
creatinine and C-reactive protein (CRP). The proportion of patients receiving 
invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) on ICU admission was lower in wave 2 (61% 
vs 80%; p < 0.001). AKI incidence within 14 days of ICU admission was 76% in 
wave 1 and 51% in wave 2 (p < 0.001); in wave 1, 32% received KRT compared with 
13% in wave 2 (p < 0.001). Patients in wave 2 had significantly lower daily 
cumulative fluid balance (FB) than in wave 1. Fewer patients were dialysis 
dependent at 90 days in wave 2 (1% vs. 4%; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill adult patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19, the 
risk of AKI and receipt of KRT significantly declined in the second wave. The 
trend was associated with less MV, lower PEEP and lower cumulative FB.

982,"Since the brain was found to be somehow flexible, plastic, researchers worldwide 
have been trying to comprehend its fundamentals to better understand the brain 
itself, make predictions, disentangle the neurobiology of brain diseases, and 
finally propose up-to-date treatments. Neuroplasticity is simple as a concept, 
but extremely complex when it comes to its mechanisms. This review aims to bring 
to light an aspect about neuroplasticity that is often not given enough 
attention as it should, the fact that the brain's ability to change would 
include its ability to disconnect synapses. So, neuronal shrinkage, decrease in 
spine density or dendritic complexity should be included within the concept of 
neuroplasticity as part of its mechanisms, not as an impairment of it. To that 
end, we extensively describe a variety of studies involving topics such as 
neurodevelopment, aging, stress, memory and homeostatic plasticity to highlight 
how the weakening and disconnection of synapses organically permeate the brain 
in so many ways as a good practice of its intrinsic physiology. Therefore, we 
propose to break down neuroplasticity into two sub-concepts, ""upward 
neuroplasticity"" for changes related to synaptic construction and ""downward 
neuroplasticity"" for changes related to synaptic deconstruction. With these 
sub-concepts, neuroplasticity could be better understood from a bigger landscape 
as a vector in which both directions could be taken for the brain to flexibly 
adapt to certain demands. Such a paradigm shift would allow a better 
understanding of the concept of neuroplasticity to avoid any data interpretation 
bias, once it makes clear that there is no morality with regard to the organic 
and physiological changes that involve dynamic biological systems as seen in the 
brain."
983,"Studies have shown cortical alterations in individuals with autism spectrum 
disorders (ASD) as well as in individuals with high polygenic risk for ASD. An 
important addition to the study of altered cortical anatomy is the investigation 
of the underlying brain network architecture that may reveal brain-wide 
mechanisms in ASD and in polygenic risk for ASD. Such an approach has been 
proven useful in other psychiatric disorders by revealing that brain network 
architecture shapes (to an extent) the disorder-related cortical alterations. 
This study uses data from a clinical dataset-560 male subjects (266 individuals 
with ASD and 294 healthy individuals, CTL, mean age at 17.2 years) from the 
Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database, and data of 391 healthy individuals 
(207 males, mean age at 12.1 years) from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition 
and Genetics database. ASD-related cortical alterations (group difference, 
ASD-CTL, in cortical thickness) and cortical correlates of polygenic risk for 
ASD were assessed, and then statistically compared with structural 
connectome-based network measures (such as hubs) using spin permutation tests. 
Next, we investigated whether polygenic risk for ASD could be predicted by 
network architecture by building machine-learning based prediction models, and 
whether the top predictors of the model were identified as disease epicenters of 
ASD. We observed that ASD-related cortical alterations as well as cortical 
correlates of polygenic risk for ASD implicated cortical hubs more strongly than 
non-hub regions. We also observed that age progression of ASD-related cortical 
alterations and cortical correlates of polygenic risk for ASD implicated 
cortical hubs more strongly than non-hub regions. Further investigation revealed 
that structural connectomes predicted polygenic risk for ASD (r = 0.30, 
p < 0.0001), and two brain regions (the left inferior parietal and left 
suparmarginal) with top predictive connections were identified as disease 
epicenters of ASD. Our study highlights a critical role of network architecture 
in a continuum model of ASD spanning from healthy individuals with genetic risk 
to individuals with ASD. Our study also highlights the strength of investigating 
polygenic risk scores in addition to multi-modal neuroimaging measures to better 
understand the interplay between genetic risk and brain alterations associated 
with ASD."
984,"Evolutionary dynamics is well captured by the replicator equations when the 
population is infinite and well-mixed. However, the extinction dynamics is 
modified with finite and structured populations. Experiments on the 
non-transitive ecosystem containing three populations of bacteria found that the 
ecological stability sensitively depends on the spatial structure of the 
populations. Based on the Reference-Gamble-Birth algorithm, we use agent-based 
Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the extinction dynamics in the 
rock-paper-scissors ecosystem with finite and structured populations. On the 
fully-connected network, the extinction time in stable and unstable regimes 
falls into two universal functions when plotted with the rescaled variables. On 
the two dimensional grid, the spatial structure changes the transition boundary 
between stable and unstable regimes but doesn't change its extinction trend. The 
finding of universal scaling in extinction dynamics is unexpected, and may 
provide a powerful method to classify different evolutionary dynamics into 
universal classes."
985,"The international precision oncology program INFORM enrolls relapsed/refractory 
pediatric cancer patients for comprehensive molecular analysis. We report a 
two-year pilot study implementing ex vivo drug sensitivity profiling (DSP) using 
a library of 75-78 clinically relevant drugs. We included 132 viable tumor 
samples from 35 pediatric oncology centers in seven countries. DSP was conducted 
on multicellular fresh tumor tissue spheroid cultures in 384-well plates with an 
overall mean processing time of three weeks. In 89 cases (67%), sufficient 
viable tissue was received; 69 (78%) passed internal quality controls. The DSP 
results matched the identified molecular targets, including BRAF, ALK, MET, and 
TP53 status. Drug vulnerabilities were identified in 80% of cases lacking 
actionable (very) high-evidence molecular events, adding value to the molecular 
data. Striking parallels between clinical courses and the DSP results were 
observed in selected patients. Overall, DSP in clinical real-time is feasible in 
international multicenter precision oncology programs."
986,"Biofilm (BF) growth is believed to play a major role in the development of 
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the intensive care unit. Despite 
concerted efforts to understand the potential implication of endotracheal tube 
(ETT)-BF dispersal, clinically relevant data are lacking to better characterize 
the impact of its mesostructure and microbiological singularity on the 
occurrence of VAP. We conducted a multicenter, retrospective observational study 
during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, between March and May 2021. In 
total, 64 ETTs collected from 61 patients were included in the present BIOPAVIR 
study. Confocal microscopy acquisitions revealed two main morphological aspects 
of ETT-deposited BF: (1) a thin, continuous ribbon-shaped aspect, less likely 
monobacterial and predominantly associated with Enterobacter spp., Streptococcus 
pneumoniae or Viridans streptococci, and (2) a thicker, discontinuous, 
mushroom-shaped appearance, more likely characterized by the association of 
bacterial and fungal species in respiratory samples. The microbiological 
characterization of ETT-deposited BF found higher acquired resistance in more 
than 80% of analyzed BF phenotypes, compared to other colonization sites from 
the patient's environment. These findings reveal BF as a singular 
microbiological compartment, and are of added clinical value, with a view to 
future ETT-deposited BF-based antimicrobial stewardship in critically ill 
patients. Trial registration NCT04926493. Retrospectively registered 15 June

987,"Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is crucial in regulating the immunological 
tolerance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alveolar macrophage 
(AM)-derived PD-L1 binds to its receptor, PD-1, on surveilling lymphocytes, 
leading to lymphocyte exhaustion. Increased PD-L1 expression is associated with 
cigarette smoke (CS)-exposure. However, the PD-L1 role in CS-associated lung 
diseases associated with NSCLC, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), is still unclear. In two different cohorts of ever smokers with COPD or 
NSCLC, and ever and never smoker controls, we evaluated PD-L1 expression: (1) 
via cutting-edge digital spatial proteomic and transcriptomic profiling (Geomx) 
of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissue sections (n = 19); and 
(2) via triple immunofluorescence staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) AMs 
(n = 83). PD-L1 mRNA expression was also quantified in BAL AMs exposed to CS 
extract. PD-L1 expression was increased in the bronchiolar wall, parenchyma, and 
vascular wall from mild-moderate (GOLD 1-2) COPD patients compared to 
severe-very severe (GOLD 3-4) COPD patients and controls. Within all the COPD 
patients, PD-L1 protein expression was associated with upregulation of genes 
involved in tumor progression and downregulation of oncosuppressive genes, and 
strongly directly correlated with the FEV1% predicted, indicating higher PD-L1 
expression in the milder vs. more severe COPD stages. In bronchioles, PD-L1 
levels were strongly directly correlated with the number of functionally active 
AMs. In BAL, we confirmed that AMs from patients with both GOLD 1-2 COPD and 
NSCLC had the highest and similar, PD-L1 expression levels versus all the other 
groups, independently from active cigarette smoking. Intriguingly, AMs from 
patients with more severe COPD had reduced AM PD-L1 expression compared to 
patients with mild COPD. Acute CS extract stimulation increased PD-L1 mRNA 
expression only in never-and not in ever-smoker AMs. Lungs from patients with 
mild COPD and NSCLC are characterized by a similar strong PD-L1 expression 
signature in bronchioles and functionally active AMs compared to patients with 
severe COPD and controls. Active smoking does not affect PD-L1 levels. These 
observations represent a new resource in understanding the innate immune 
mechanisms underlying the link between COPD and lung cancer onset and 
progression and pave the way to future studies focused on the mechanisms by 
which CS promotes tumorigenesis and COPD."
988,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to clarify the frequency of thoracic 
recurrence and identify associated pathological features in postoperative 
patients with borderline or malignant ovarian epithelial tumors (BMOT) in stage 
I versus higher stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 368 consecutive patients with a single primary 
BMOT were treated at our hospital. This study included the 217 patients with no 
residual disease on the first CT after standard treatment. The timing and 
pattern of recurrence on follow-up CT images with a scan range from chest to 
pelvis were evaluated retrospectively. Patient characteristics, tumor histology, 
and stage were recorded from electronic medical records.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 48 months, recurrence was detected 
by CT in 9 patients in stage I (n = 159) and 15 in stage II/III (n = 58) 
(p = 0.0001). Thoracic recurrence was detected in four patients in stage I and 
four in stage II/III (p = 0.15). Abdominal recurrence was identified as a factor 
associated with thoracic recurrence (P < 0.001). Clear cell carcinomas accounted 
for three out of four thoracic recurrences in stage I and two out of four in 
stage II/III, and had the highest rates of thoracic recurrence (7.7% in stage I 
and 22.2% in stage II/III) among all histological types associated with thoracic 
recurrence. Among patients with recurrence, thoracic recurrence-free probability 
(p = 0.38), median abdominal recurrence-free interval (18 vs 16 months; 
p = 0.55) and thoracic recurrence-free interval (16.5 vs 23 months; p = 0.89) 
did not differ significantly between stage I and stage II/III.
CONCLUSION: The frequency and timing of thoracic recurrence did not differ 
significantly in postoperative patients with BMOT in stage I versus stage 
II/III. Abdominal recurrence and a histological type of clear cell carcinoma 
were most often associated with thoracic recurrence in stage I."
989,"Ferroptosis is a unique form of programmed cell death driven by iron-dependent 
phospholipid peroxidation that was proposed in recent years. It plays an 
important role in processes of various trace element-related diseases and is 
regulated by redox homeostasis and various cellular metabolic pathways (iron, 
amino acids, lipids, sugars), as well as disease-related signaling pathways. 
Some limited pioneering studies have demonstrated ferroptosis as a mechanism for 
the health effects of essential trace elements and potentially toxic trace 
elements, with crosstalk among them. The aim of this review is to bring together 
research articles and identify key direct and indirect evidence regarding 
essential trace elements (iron, selenium, zinc, copper, chromium, manganese) and 
potentially toxic trace elements (arsenic, aluminum, mercury) and their possible 
roles in ferroptosis. Our review may help determine future research priorities 
and opportunities."
990,"Beyond the characteristics of a brain lesion, such as its etiology, size or 
location, lesion network mapping (LNM) has shown that similar symptoms after a 
lesion reflects similar dis-connectivity patterns, thereby linking symptoms to 
brain networks. Here, we extend LNM by using a multimodal strategy, combining 
functional and structural networks from 1000 healthy participants in the Human 
Connectome Project. We apply multimodal LNM to a cohort of 54 stroke patients 
with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a 
combination of motor and sensory tests. Results are two-fold. First, multimodal 
LNM reveals that the functional modality contributes more than the structural 
one in the prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, when looking at each 
modality individually, the performance of the structural networks strongly 
depended on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, 
thereby eliminating the effect that larger lesions generally produce more severe 
sensorimotor impairment. In contrast, functional networks provided similar 
performance regardless of whether or not the effect of lesion size was removed. 
Overall, these results support the extension of LNM to its multimodal form, 
highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of network 
modalities, and their corresponding influence on behavioral performance after 
brain injury."
991,"Among the common methods used for antibody immobilization on electrode surfaces, 
which is the best available option for immunosensor fabrication? To answer this 
question, we first used graphene-chitosan-Au/Pt nanoparticle (G-Chi-Au/PtNP)

monoclonal antibody (ARV/MAb) was immobilized on the GE surface by using four 
common methods, which included glutaraldehyde (Glu),

direct incubation or cysteamine hydrochloride (CH). Third, the electrodes were 
incubated with bovine serum albumin, four different avian reovirus (ARV)

(0-104.82 EID50 mL-1 ARV) and 100 times broader than those of the immunosensors 
immobilized via Glu (0-103.82 EID50 mL-1 ARV) or EDC/NHS (0-103.82 EID50 mL-1 
ARV). And the four immunosensors showed excellent selectivity, reproducibility 
and stability."
992,"The strong suppression of Aedes albopictus on two Guangzhou islands in China has 
been successfully achieved by releasing males with an artificial 
triple-Wolbachia infection. However, it requires the use of radiation to 
sterilize residual females to prevent population replacement. To develop a 
highly effective tool for dengue control, we tested a standalone incompatible 
insect technique (IIT) to control A. albopictus in the urban area of Changsha, 
an inland city where dengue recently emerged. Male mosquitoes were produced in a 
mass rearing facility in Guangzhou and transported over 670 km under low 
temperature to the release site. After a once-per-week release with high numbers 
of males (phase I) and a subsequent twice-per-week release with low numbers of 
males (phase II), the average numbers of hatched eggs and female adults 
collected weekly per trap were reduced by 97% and 85%, respectively. The 
population suppression caused a 94% decrease in mosquito biting at the release 
site compared to the control site. Remarkably, this strong suppression was 
achieved using only 28% of the number of males released in a previous trial. 
Despite the lack of irradiation to sterilize residual females, no 
triple-infected mosquitoes were detected in the field post release based on the 
monitoring of adult and larval A. albopictus populations for two years, 
indicating that population replacement was prevented. Our results support the 
feasibility of implementing a standalone IIT for dengue control in urban areas."
993,"In the COVID-19 pandemic, children were considered to play a major role in 
SARS-CoV-2 transmission similar to influenza. Thus, mitigation measures have 
been focused on children, impacting their everyday life severely. Despite this, 
infectivity in this age group regarding SARS-CoV-2 is not yet clarified. We 
performed a serology study in households with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to 
evaluate virus transmission with focus on children and adolescents. Between 
January and July 2021, 341 minors and 650 adults from 300 households with a 
confirmed index case participated in the FamilyCoviDD19-study including 
serological assessment for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and a questionnaire on 
demographics, recent and ongoing symptoms, hygiene measures and comorbidities. 
45 (16.3%) of all index cases were < 18 years old. Thereof, 55.6% reported 
COVID-19 associated symptoms, while nearly all adult index cases were 
symptomatic (94.8%). There was significantly less virus transmission by children 
and adolescents compared to adult index cases with a secondary attack rate of 
0.29 vs. 0.54. With the caveat that the results do not necessarily apply to the 
Delta and Omicron variants, we conclude that children and adolescents are less 
susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection, more frequently show an asymptomatic 
course of disease and are less infective than adults."
994,"BACKGROUND: Valvuloplastic esophagogastrostomy (VEG) using the double flap 
technique (DFT) after proximal gastrectomy (PG) represents a promising procedure 
for the prevention of reflux oesophagitis. We aimed to retrospectively 
investigate the efficacy of minimally invasive PG followed by VEG-DFT in 
preventing reflux oesophagitis among patients who require intra-mediastinal 
anastomosis.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent reconstruction with DFT after LPG 
from November 2013 to January 2021 were enrolled in the present study. Data were 
obtained through a review of our prospectively maintained database. At 1 year 
after surgery, multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for 
gastroesophageal reflux disease of Los Angeles (LA) classification grade B or 
higher.
RESULTS: The incidence of LA grade B or higher reflux oesophagitis 1 year after 
surgery was 10%. Multivariate analyses revealed that the longitudinal length of 
the resected oesophagus of > 20 mm was the only significant risk factor for 
reflux oesophagitis. Patients with a longitudinal length of the resected 
oesophagus > 20 mm (group-L, n = 35) had a significantly longer total operative 
time and a higher rate of complications within 30 days of surgery than those 
with a length of ≤ 20 mm (group-S, n = 45). LA grade B or higher reflux 
oesophagitis was significantly higher in group-L than in group-S (20% vs. 2.2%; 
P = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for surgical procedures with improved efficacy for 
the prevention of reflux oesophagitis in patients requiring oesophageal 
resection of > 20-mm."
995,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has 
caused a global pandemic since 2019. Variants of concern (VOCs) declared by the 
World Health Organization require continuous monitoring because of their 
possible changes in transmissibility, virulence, and antigenicity. The Omicron 
variant, a VOC, has become the dominant variant worldwide since November 2021. 
In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the number of confirmed cases increased 
rapidly after the detection of Omicron VOC on November 24, 2021. In this study, 
we estimated the underlying epidemiological processes of Omicron VOC in South 
Korea using time-scaled phylodynamic analysis. Three distinct phylogenetic 
subgroups (Kor-O1, Kor-O2, and Kor-O3) were detected in South Korea. The Kor-O1 
subgroup circulated in the Daegu region, whereas Kor-O2 and Kor-O3 circulated in 
Incheon and Jeollanam-do, respectively. The viral population size and case 
number of the Kor-O1 subgroup increased more rapidly than those of the other 
subgroups, indicating the rapid spread of the virus. The results indicated the 
multiple introductions of Omicron sub-lineages into South Korea and their 
subsequent co-circulation. The evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should 
be continuously monitored, and control strategies need to be improved to control 
the multiple variants."
996,"Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), including 
osimertinib, an irreversible EGFR-TKI, are important treatments for non-small 
cell lung cancer with EGFR-TKI sensitizing or EGFR T790M resistance mutations. 
While patients treated with osimertinib show clinical benefit, disease 
progression and drug resistance are common. Emergence of de novo acquired 
resistance from a drug tolerant persister (DTP) cell population is one mechanism 
proposed to explain progression on osimertinib and other targeted cancer 
therapies. Here we profiled osimertinib DTPs using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to 
characterize the features of these cells and performed drug screens to identify 
therapeutic vulnerabilities. We identified several vulnerabilities in 
osimertinib DTPs that were common across models, including sensitivity to MEK, 
AURKB, BRD4, and TEAD inhibition. We linked several of these vulnerabilities to 
gene regulatory changes, for example, TEAD vulnerability was consistent with 
evidence of Hippo pathway turning off in osimertinib DTPs. Last, we used genetic 
approaches using siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout to validate AURKB, BRD4, and 
TEAD as the direct targets responsible for the vulnerabilities observed in the 
drug screen."
997,"The chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein CHD8 is the most frequently 
mutated gene in autism spectrum disorder. Despite its prominent disease 
involvement, little is known about its molecular function in the human brain. 
CHD8 is a chromatin regulator which binds to the promoters of actively 
transcribed genes through genomic targeting mechanisms which have yet to be 
fully defined. By generating a conditional loss-of-function and an endogenously 
tagged allele in human pluripotent stem cells, we investigated the molecular 
function and the interaction of CHD8 with chromatin in human neurons. Chromatin 
accessibility analysis and transcriptional profiling revealed that CHD8 
functions as a transcriptional activator at its target genes in human neurons. 
Furthermore, we found that CHD8 chromatin targeting is cell context-dependent. 
In human neurons, CHD8 preferentially binds at ETS motif-enriched promoters. 
This enrichment is particularly prominent on the promoters of genes whose 
expression significantly changes upon the loss of CHD8. Indeed, among the ETS 
transcription factors, we identified ELK1 as being most highly correlated with 
CHD8 expression in primary human fetal and adult cortical neurons and most 
highly expressed in our stem cell-derived neurons. Remarkably, ELK1 was 
necessary to recruit CHD8 specifically to ETS motif-containing sites. These 
findings imply that ELK1 and CHD8 functionally cooperate to regulate gene 
expression and chromatin states at MAPK/ERK target genes in human neurons. Our 
results suggest that the MAPK/ERK/ELK1 axis potentially contributes to the 
pathogenesis caused by CHD8 mutations in human neurodevelopmental disorders."
998,"The Early Bronze Age in Europe is characterized by social and genetic 
transformations, starting in the early 3rd millennium BCE. New settlement and 
funerary structures, artifacts and techniques indicate times of change with 
increasing economic asymmetries and political hierarchization. Technological 
advances in metallurgy also played an important role, facilitating trade and 
exchange networks, which became tangible in higher levels of mobility and 
connectedness. Archeogenetic studies have revealed a substantial transformation 
of the genetic ancestry around this time, ultimately linked to the expansion of 
steppe- and forest steppe pastoralists from Eastern Europe. Evidence for 
emerging infectious diseases such as Yersinia pestis adds further complexity to 
these tumultuous and transformative times. The El Argar complex in southern 
Iberia marks the genetic turnover in southwestern Europe ~ 2200 BCE that 
accompanies profound changes in the socio-economic structure of the region. To 
answer the question of who was buried in the emblematic double burials of the El 
Argar site La Almoloya, we integrated results from biological relatedness 
analyses and archaeological funerary contexts and refined radiocarbon-based 
chronologies from 68 individuals. We find that the El Argar society was 
virilocally and patrilineally organized and practiced reciprocal female exogamy, 
supported by pedigrees that extend up to five generations along the paternal 
line. Synchronously dated adult males and females from double tombs were found 
to be unrelated mating partners, whereby the incoming females reflect 
socio-political alliances among El Argar groups. In three cases these unions had 
common offspring, while paternal half-siblings also indicate serial monogamy or 
polygyny."
999,"There is a paucity of research regarding the association between the risk of 
incident dementia and changes in smoking habits in the acute ischemic stroke 
population. We aimed to investigate the effects of smoking habit change on the 
risk of incident dementia in an ischemic stroke population using data from the 
Korean National Health Insurance Services Database. This nationwide 
population-based cohort study included 197,853 patients with ischemic stroke. 
The patients were divided into never smokers, former smokers, smoking quitters, 
sustained smokers, and new smokers, based on the 2-year change in smoking status 
between the two consecutive health examinations before and after the index 
stroke. The patients were followed up from the index date to 2018 to assess the 
development of dementia. Dementia was further categorized into Alzheimer's, 
vascular, and other types of dementia according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision diagnosis. Multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between changes 
in smoking habits and the risk of dementia. After a median of 4.04 years of 
follow-up, 19,595 (9.9%) dementia cases were observed. Among them, 15,189 (7.7%) 
were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease dementia and 2719 (1.4%) were diagnosed 
with vascular dementia. After adjusting for covariates, including age, sex, 
alcohol intake habits, cigarette pack-year, regular physical activity, income, 
history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney 
disease, new smokers, sustained smokers, and smoking quitters were significantly 
associated with a higher risk of all-cause dementia than never smokers (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR] 1.395, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.254-1.552; aHR 1.324, 
95% CI 1.236-1.418; and aHR 1.170, 95% CI 1.074-1.275, respectively). Similar 
trends were observed for both Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia, but 
the association between new smokers and vascular dementia was not significant. 
The impact of smoking habit change was more prominent in the 40-65-year-old 
group. New and sustained smokers had a substantially higher risk of incident 
dementia after ischemic stroke than never smokers. Smoking quitters also had an 
elevated risk of incident dementia, but the detrimental effects were lower than 
those in new and sustained smokers."
1000,"Long-term sequelae of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) constitute Long COVID. 
Although Long COVID has been reported globally, its risk factors and effects on 
quality of life (QOL) remain unclear. We conducted a cross-sectional study using 
questionnaires and electronic medical records of COVID-19 patients who were 
diagnosed or hospitalized at five facilities in Japan. Responses were obtained 
from 285 out of 1,150 patients. More than half of the participants reported Long 
COVID symptoms of varying severity 1 year after COVID-19. Common sequelae 
included fatigue, dyspnea, alopecia, concentration problems, memory problems, 
sleeplessness, and joint pain, which often significantly reduced their QOL. 
COVID-19 severity was strongly associated with sputum production, chest pain, 
dyspnea, sore throat, and diarrhea, but not with fatigue, dysgeusia, anosmia, 
alopecia, and sleeplessness. Fatigue, dysgeusia, anosmia, alopecia, and 
sleeplessness affected the QOL among participants with asymptomatic or mild 
COVID-19 during the acute phase. Moreover, these sequelae persisted for 
prolonged periods."
1001,"The function and underlying mechanisms of p50 in the regulation of protein 
expression is much less studied because of its lacking of transactivation 
domain. In this study, we discovered a novel function of p50 in its 
stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein under the 
condition of cells exposed to arsenic exposure. In p50-deficient (p50-/-) cells, 
the HIF-1α protein expression was impaired upon arsenic exposure, and such 
defect could be rescued by reconstitutional expression of p50. Mechanistic study 
revealed that the inhibition of autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7)-dependent 
autophagy was in charge of p50-mediated HIF-1α protein stabilization following 
arsenic exposure. Moreover, p50 deletion promoted nucleolin (NCL) protein 
translation to enhance ATG7 mRNA transcription via directly binding 
transcription factor Sp1 mRNA and increase its stability. We further discovered 
that p50-mediated miR-494 upregulation gave rise to the inhibition of 
p50-mediated NCL translation by interacting with its 3'-UTR. These novel 
findings provide a great insight into the understanding of biomedical 
significance of p50 protein in arsenite-associated disease development and 
therapy."
1002,"The prognosis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive 
metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remained unsatisfactory currently, more anti-HER2 
agents are needed. Here we report a phase I study that evaluated the safety, 
activity, and biomarkers of LZM005, a HER2 antibody, used as a monotherapy or in 
combination with trastuzumab plus docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive MBC. 
From October 2017 to December 2019, 34 patients received LZM005 (14 monotherapy, 
20 combination therapy). No DLT was observed. The common adverse events (AEs) in 
phase Ia included diarrhea (21.4%), infusion reaction (21.4%), and 
hypertriglyceridemia (21.4%), while those in phase Ib were leukopenia (85.0%), 
neutropenia (75.0%), anemia (60.0%), diarrhea (60.0%), and rash/pruritus 
(50.0%). All AEs were manageable. In phase Ia, partial response (PR) was 
achieved in one case (1/14, overall response rate [ORR]: 7.1%); the disease 
control rate was 42.90% (6/14). In phase Ib, 11 patients (55.0%) achieved PR, 
and eight (40.0%) had stable disease. The ORR was 100% (6/6) in 
trastuzumab-naive and 35.7% (5/14) in trastuzumab-pretreated patients. Biomarker 
analysis showed that chromatin remodeling genes KMT2B and BRWD1 were associated 
with better progression-free survival. LZM005 is well tolerated and shows potent 
activity in patients with HER2-positive MBC."
1003,"Folate (vitamin B9) is the coenzyme involved in one-carbon transfer biochemical 
reactions essential for cell survival and proliferation, with its inadequacy 
causing developmental defects or severe diseases. Notably, mammalian cells lack 
the ability to de novo synthesize folate but instead rely on its intake from 
extracellular sources via specific transporters or receptors, among which 
SLC19A1 is the ubiquitously expressed one in tissues. However, the mechanism of 
substrate recognition by SLC19A1 remains unclear. Here we report the cryo-EM 
structures of human SLC19A1 and its complex with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate at 
3.5-3.6 Å resolution and elucidate the critical residues for substrate 
recognition. In particular, we reveal that two variant residues among SLC19 
subfamily members designate the specificity for folate. Moreover, we identify 
intracellular thiamine pyrophosphate as the favorite coupled substrate for 
folate transport by SLC19A1. Together, this work establishes the molecular basis 
of substrate recognition by this central folate transporter."
1004,"As SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and other variants of concern (VOCs) continue spreading 
worldwide, development of antibodies and vaccines to confer broad and protective 
activity is a global priority. Here, we report on the identification of a 
special group of nanobodies from immunized alpaca with potency against diverse 
VOCs including Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5, SARS-CoV-1, and major 
sarbecoviruses. Crystal structure analysis of one representative nanobody, 
3-2A2-4, discovers a highly conserved epitope located between the cryptic and 
the outer face of the receptor binding domain (RBD), distinctive from the 
receptor ACE2 binding site. Cryo-EM and biochemical evaluation reveal that 
3-2A2-4 interferes structural alteration of RBD required for ACE2 binding. 
Passive delivery of 3-2A2-4 protects K18-hACE2 mice from infection of authentic 
SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron. Identification of these unique nanobodies will 
inform the development of next generation antibody therapies and design of 
pan-sarbecovirus vaccines."
1005,"Sedentary time is associated with increased risks of detrimental health 
outcomes. Prolonged sedentary time associates with cardiometabolic risk factors 
and increased mortality regardless of physical activity. Therefore, the purpose 
of this study was to examine the associations of sedentary time and 
cardiometabolic risk factors among university employees in Eastern Ethiopia. A 
cross-sectional study was conducted among 1200 participants. Data were collected 
using the World Health Organization STEPS survey instrument, and sedentary 
behavior questionnaire in hour per day. Sedentary time is the time spent for any 
duration (minutes per day or hours per day) by considering a local context. 
Study participants were asked how many minutes or hours they spent in sedentary 
time at work, their leisure time and in transportation. Finally, the total 
sedentary time was calculated by the sum of the individual spent in sedentary 
time at work, leisure, and transportation. Cardiometabolic risk factors were 
assessed with blood samples analysis and anthropometric measurements. The 
associations between sedentary time and cardiometabolic risk factors were 
examined using linear regression models. An adjusted coefficient (β) with the 
95% confidence interval (CI) was used to report the results. p value < 0.05 was 
considered for statistical significance. The mean age of the study participants 
were (35 ± 9.4 years). Almost half of the study participants, 566 (48.6) were 
women and 598 (51.4%) were men. As the total sedentary time was increased by one 
unit, the body mass index increased by β = 0.61; (95% CI 0.49-0.71),waist 
circumference increased by β = 1.48; (95% CI 1.14-1.82), diastolic blood 
pressure increased by β = 0.87; (95% CI 0.56-1.18), systolic blood pressure 
increased by β = 0.95; (95% CI 0.45-1.48), triglycerides increased by β = 7.07; 
(95% CI 4.01-10.14), total cholesterol increased by β = 3.52; (95% CI 
2.02-5.02), fasting plasma glucose increased by β = 4.15; (95% CI 5.31-4.98) and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by β = 2.14; (95% CI 0.96-3.33) 
with the effects of other variables maintain constant. These findings depict the 
need for strategies that policymakers should promote physical activity and 
encouraging the breaking up of prolonged sedentary time to reduce 
cardiometabolic risk factors among university employees in Ethiopia."
1006,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has devastated global health. 
Identifying key host factors essential for SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication is 
expected to unravel cellular targets for the development of broad-spectrum 
antiviral drugs which have been quested for the preparedness of future viral 
outbreaks. Here, we have identified host proteins that associate with 
nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of 
SARS-CoV-2 using a mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approach. Among the 
candidate factors, CDK2 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 2), a member of 
cyclin-dependent kinases, interacts with nsp12 and causes its phosphorylation at 
T20, thus facilitating the assembly of the RdRp complex consisting of nsp12, 
nsp7 and nsp8 and promoting efficient synthesis of viral RNA. The crucial role 
of CDK2 in viral RdRp function is further supported by our observation that CDK2 
inhibitors potently impair viral RNA synthesis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken 
together, we have discovered CDK2 as a key host factor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp 
complex, thus serving a promising target for the development of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp 
inhibitors."
1007,"Nutrient-limiting conditions are common during cancer development. The 
coordination of cellular glucose levels and cell survival is a fundamental 
question in cell biology and has not been completely understood. 4EBP1 is known 
as a translational repressor to regulate cell proliferation and survival by 
controlling translation initiation, however, whether 4EBP1 could participate in 
tumor survival by other mechanism except for translational repression function, 
especially under glucose starvation conditions remains unknown. Here, we found 
that protein levels of 4EBP1 was up-regulated in the central region of the tumor 
which always suffered nutrient deprivation compared with the peripheral region. 
We further discovered that 4EBP1 was dephosphorylated by PTPMT1 under glucose 
starvation conditions, which prevented 4EBP1 from being targeted for 
ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation by HERC5. After that, 4EBP1 
translocated to cytoplasm and interacted with STAT3 by competing with JAK and 
ERK, leading to the inactivation of STAT3 in the cytoplasm, resulting in 
apoptosis under glucose withdrawal conditions. Moreover, 4EBP1 knockdown 
increased the tumor volume and weight in xenograft models by inhibiting 
apoptosis in the central region of tumor. These findings highlight a novel 
mechanism for 4EBP1 as a new cellular glucose sensor in regulating cancer cell 
death under glucose deprivation conditions, which was different from its 
classical function as a translational repressor."
1008,"Over 1400 patients using dry powder inhalers (DPIs) to deliver COPD maintenance 
therapies were recruited across Europe and Australia. Their peak inspiratory 
flow (PIF) was measured, inhaler technique was observed, and adherence to 
treatment assessed. From relating the findings with patient health status, and 
thereby identifying critical errors, key clinical recommendations for primary 
care clinicians were determined, namely - measure PIF before prescribing a DPI 
to ensure inhalation manoeuvre ability is well-matched with the device. Some 
patients could benefit from inhalation training whereas others should have their 
DPI changed for one better suited to their inspiratory ability or alternatively 
be prescribed an active device (such as a soft mist inhaler or pressurized 
metered dose inhaler). Observing the inhalation technique was valuable however 
this misses suboptimal PIF (approaching one fourth of patients with a 
satisfactory observed manoeuvre had a suboptimal PIF for their DPI). Assess 
adherence as deliberate non-adherence can point to a mismatch between a patient 
and their inhaler (deliberate non-adherence was significantly associated with 
PIFs below the minimum for the DPI). In-person observation of inhalation 
technique was found to be inferior to video rating based on device-specific 
checklists. Where video assessments are not possible, observation training for 
healthcare professionals would therefore be valuable particularly to improve the 
ability to identify the critical errors associated with health status namely 
'teeth and lips sealed around mouthpiece', 'breathe in' and 'breathing out 
calmly after inhalation'. However, it is recommended that observation alone 
should not replace PIF measurement in the DPI selection process.Trial

1009,"The progression of cancer from localized to metastatic disease is the primary 
cause of morbidity and mortality. The interplay between the tumor and its 
microenvironment is the key driver in this process of tumor progression. In 
order for tumors to progress and metastasize they must reprogram the cells that 
make up the microenvironment to promote tumor growth and suppress endogenous 
defense systems, such as the immune and inflammatory response. We have 
previously demonstrated that stimulation of Tsp-1 in the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) potently inhibits tumor growth and progression. Here, we identify a novel 
tumor-mediated mechanism that represses the expression of Tsp-1 in the TME via 
secretion of the serine protease PRSS2. We demonstrate that PRSS2 represses 
Tsp-1, not via its enzymatic activity, but by binding to low-density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). These findings describe a hitherto 
undescribed activity for PRSS2 through binding to LRP1 and represent a potential 
therapeutic strategy to treat cancer by blocking the PRSS2-mediated repression 
of Tsp-1. Based on the ability of PRSS2 to reprogram the tumor microenvironment, 
this discovery could lead to the development of therapeutic agents that are 
indication agnostic."
1010,"Deep learning (DL) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has shown 
excellent performance in differentiating individuals with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, the value of DL in detecting progressive structural MRI (sMRI) 
abnormalities linked to AD pathology has yet to be established. In this study, 
an interpretable DL algorithm named the Ensemble of 3-dimensional convolutional 
neural network (Ensemble 3DCNN) with enhanced parsing techniques is proposed to 
investigate the longitudinal trajectories of whole-brain sMRI changes denoting 
AD onset and progression. A set of 2369 T1-weighted images from the multi-centre 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging 
Studies cohorts are applied to model derivation, validation, testing, and 
pattern analysis. An Ensemble-3DCNN-based P-score is generated, based on which 
multiple brain regions, including amygdala, insular, parahippocampal, and 
temporal gyrus, exhibit early and connected progressive neurodegeneration. 
Complex individual variability in the sMRI is also observed. This study 
combining non-invasive sMRI and interpretable DL in detecting patterned sMRI 
changes confirmed AD pathological progression, shedding new light on predicting 
AD progression using whole-brain sMRI."
1011,"Background.Raw bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) variables are related to 
physical function in healthy and diseased populations. Therefore, BIA may be an 
insightful, noninvasive method of assessment to track following anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).Objectives.Evaluate phase angle, 
reactance and impedance at 50 kHz (PhA50, Xc50, andZ50, respectively) in the 
operative (OP) and non-operative (NOP) limbs during ACLR 
rehabilitation.Approach.Seventeen patient (12 M, 5 F; 18.8 ± 4.8 years) clinic 
reports were evaluated prior to ACLR (PRE), two- (2 W), six- (6 W), and 
twelve-weeks (12 W) post-ACLR and at return to sport testing (RTS).Setting.All 
observations occurred during the participant's physical therapy 
visits.Measurements.A multi-frequency BIA device measured segmental PhA, Xc, 
andZ. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess any leg and time 
interaction and changes over leg and time, independently. Any interactions or 
main effects were considered significant atp< 0.05.Main results.Significant 
legxtime interactions were observed for each variable. PhA50and Xc50of NOP were 
higher (p< 0.001) than OP at each time point by an average of by 0.9° and 4.9 Ω, 
respectively. In OP, PhA50and Xc50decreased from PRE to 2 W and increased from 6 
to 12 W and 12 W to RTS (p< 0.01, for all). At RTS, PhA50and Xc50were similar to 
PRE in OP (p> 0.05). ForZ50, the OP leg did not change over time (p> 
0.05).Z50was greater in NOP at 2 and 6 W (p< 0.01, for both). There were 
differences in PhA50in NOP between PRE and 6 W and from 6 W to RTS (p< 0.05 for 
both). Xc50did not change (p> 0.05), andZ50PRE was lower than at 2 W (p< 
0.05).Significance.A multi-frequency BIA device can detect changes in segmental 
BIA variables following ACLR."
1012,"This study aimed to investigate the impact of sub epidermal moisture (SEM) 
measurement and targeted pressure ulcer (PU) prevention, versus visual skin 
assessment and usual care, on mean SEM delta scores and early pressure ulcer 
development in acute hospital patients. A quantitative quasi-experimental 
observational approach was used. A total of 149 at risk acute hospital patients 
took part, 78 treatment, and 71 control. SEM deltas were recorded daily for a 
maximum of 5 days using the SEM Scanner (Bruin Biometrics LLC, Los Angeles, 
California), on three sites: the sacrum, the right heel, and the left heel, with 
enhanced and targeted PU prevention interventions occurring in those with an 
elevated SEM delta scores in the treatment group. Intention to treat analysis 
was used to guide the final composition of results. SEM PU represents PU 
development as identified by 2 days of sustained abnormal SEM delta scores, 
≥0.5, after day one. The mean number of days completed by participants was just 
under 4 days, participants had many different comorbidities, with the most 
common being: hypertension, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Results showed that following the introduction of SEM guided targeted 
treatments, participants in the treatment group yielded a statistically 
significant reduction in mean SEM delta scores (MD: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.39; 
P < .0001), and in the odds of developing a SEM PU (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.24 to 
1.00; P = .05). In the treatment group, none of the participants developed a 
visual PU, whereas, in the control group, 1.41% (n = 1/71) developed a visual 
PU. Based on all the results, the following is concluded, (1). There was a 
greater reduction in mean SEM delta scores among those cared for using SEM 
measurement and targeted PU prevention, versus those cared for using visual skin 
assessment and usual care, and (2). the mean SEM delta scores was statistically 
significantly lower at the study end for those who received targeted treatments 
based on abnormal SEM scores. More research is now needed in other and larger 
at-risk groups to further validate what was found in this study."
1013,"Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of lipids in biological tissues is useful for 
correlating molecular distribution with pathological results, which could 
provide useful information for both biological research and disease diagnosis. 
It is well understood that the lipidome could not be clearly deciphered without 
tandem mass spectrometry analysis, but this is challenging to achieve in MSI due 
to the limitation in sample amount at each image spot. Here we develop a 
multiplexed MS2 imaging (MS2I) method that can provide MS2 images for 10 lipid 
species or more for each sampling spot, providing spatial structural lipidomic 
information. Coupling with on-tissue photochemical derivatization, imaging of 20 
phospholipid C=C location isomers is also realized, showing enhanced molecular 
images with high definition in structure for mouse brain and human liver cancer 
tissue sections. Spatially mapped t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding 
has also been adopted to visualize the tumor margin with enhancement by 
structural lipidomic information."
1014,"AIMS: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is predominantly diagnosed 
in men. The few available studies suggest affected women have a more favourable 
cardiac phenotype. We aimed to characterize sex differences among consecutive 
patients with non-hereditary and two prevalent forms of hereditary (h)ATTR-CM 
diagnosed over a 20-year period.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of deep phenotyping at presentation, changes on 
serial echocardiography and overall prognosis were evaluated. In total, 1732 
consecutive patients were studied, comprising: 1095 with wild-type (wt)ATTR-CM; 
206 with T60A-hATTR-CM; and 431 with V122I-hATTR-CM. Female prevalence was 
greater in T60A-hATTR-CM (29.6%) and V122I-hATTR-CM (27.8%) compared to 
wtATTR-CM (6%). At presentation, females were 3.3 years older than males 
(wtATTR-CM: 81.9 vs. 77.8 years; T60A-hATTR-CM: 68.7 vs. 65.1 years; 
V122I-hATTR-CM: 77.1 vs. 74.9 years). Body size significantly influenced 
measures of disease severity; when indexed, overall structural and functional 
phenotype was similar between sexes, the few significant differences suggested a 
mildly worse phenotype in females. No significant differences were observed in 
both disease progression on serial echocardiography and mortality across the 
overall population (p = 0.459) and when divided by genotype (wtATTR-CM: 
p = 0.730; T60A-hATTR-CM: p = 0.161; V122I-hATTR-CM: p = 0.056).
CONCLUSION: This study of a well-characterized large cohort of ATTR-CM patients 
did not demonstrate overall differences between sexes in either clinical 
phenotype, when indexed, or with respect to disease progression and prognosis. 
Non-indexed wall thickness measurements may have contributed to both 
under-representation and delays in diagnosis for affected females and highlights 
the potential role of utilizing indexed echocardiographic parameters for a more 
accurate assessment of patients at diagnosis and for disease prognostication."
1015,"Dry eye disease (DED) is a complex multifactorial condition caused by loss of 
ocular surface homeostasis from quantitative and/or qualitative tear film 
deficiency. Schirmer tear test (STT) is often the only diagnostic test used to 
assess for DED in veterinary practice. STT is invaluable in the diagnosis and 
monitoring of quantitative tear film deficiency (i.e., keratoconjunctivitis 
sicca); however, it is not sufficient to optimize therapy and fully recognize 
other contributing factors for the disturbance in ocular surface homeostasis. 
The present work reviews diagnostic tests for assessing aqueous tear production 
in veterinary medicine, as well as the quality of tears, corneal epithelial 
barrier integrity, and the lacrimal functional unit."
1016,"INTRODUCTION: Nord-Kivu is facing a high prevalence of hypoxemia diseases 
requiring the use of oxygen concentrators.
PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: This article describes the level of functionality of oxygen 
concentrators in 31 hospital structures, in North Kivu province of Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC).
METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study carried out a survey of 
managerial and maintenance personnel and the removal of parameters on the 
operation of oxygen concentrators from 31 hospitals handling Covid19 cases in 
North Kivu. The collected data was encoded and analyzed using SPSS version 26 
software.
RESULTS: The oxygen concentrators were of 28 different brands, and in 65.8% of 
cases with a 5-liter capacity. They were used in 70% of cases in 4 departments 
(Intensive care, operating room, emergency room, internal medicine). They were 
donated in 66.2% of cases (n=225), without accessory equipment in33.6% of cases 
and without training of maintenance technician in three of five cases or users 
in one in two cases. In 45% of cases, maintenance was provided. In 67.6% of 
cases oxygen concentrators were not functional (n=225), with impaired volume 
flow in 54.9% of cases and oxygen levels in 34,6% of cases. The oxygen deficit 
was variable depending on the type of hospital structures (p=0,005) but not the 
volume flow (P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Low functionality of oxygen concentrators increases patient risk 
and shows the interest to implement a provincial strategy for the management and 
maintenance of bio-medical equipment and its integration into regional health 
development plan."
1017,"PURPOSE: Arterial stiffness and steno-occlusion of the lower-extremity can 
result from many vascular lesions, including acute thromboembolisms, soft 
plaques, calcified plaques, or inflammatory disease. Ultrasound (US) 
elastography measures the tissue deformation response to compression and 
displays tissue stiffness. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of 
arterial lesions in the lower extremities using US elastography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 20 patients who 
visited our institute for arterial disease treatment between May 2016 and 
November 2017. An US examination with B-mode and strain elastography (SE) was 
performed of four different lesion types at 45 sites: acute and subacute 
thromboembolisms, soft plaques, calcified plaques, and thromboangiitis 
obliterans lesions (TAOs). During SE, stress was externally applied by the 
operator using the transducer. Strain ratio (SR) was calculated as the fraction 
of the average strain in the reference area divided by the average strain in the 
lesion. The SR was compared among different lesion types, with the accompanying 
vein as the reference region of interest.
RESULTS: The strain was highest in the soft plaques (0.63%±0.23%), followed by 
the TAOs (0.45%±0.11%), calcified plaques (0.44%±0.13%), and acute 
thromboembolisms (0.34%±0.23%), which were statistically significant (P=0.026). 
However, the mean SR was highest for the calcified plaques (2.33%±0.80%), 
followed by the TAOs (1.63%±0.40%), acute thromboembolisms (1.60%±0.48%), and 
soft plaques (1.51±0.39), and which were statistically significant (P=0.013).
CONCLUSION: Despite several limitations, vascular elastography may be useful for 
differentiating between lesion types in peripheral arterial disease."
1018,"As macrophage infiltration is significantly related to the progression of 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), monitoring the macrophages is a valuable 
strategy for IBD diagnosis. However, owing to the harsh physiological 
environment of the gastrointestinal tract and enzymatic degradation, the 
development of orally administrable imaging probes for tracking macrophages 
remains a considerable challenge. Accordingly, herein, we have developed an 
orally administrable aggregation-induced emission biomimetic probe 
(HBTTPIP/β-glucan particles (GPs)) for tracing macrophages; HBTTPIP/GPs can 
diagnose and alleviate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colonic inflammation 
and self-report the treatment efficiency. The fluorophore HBTTPIP can 
effectively aggregate in GPs, restricting intramolecular rotation and activating 
the fluorescence of HBTTPIP. After being orally administrated, HBTTPIP/GPs is 
phagocytosed by intestinal macrophages, which then migrate to colonic lesions, 
enabling non-invasive monitoring of the severity of IBD via in vivo fluorescence 
imaging. Notably, oral HBTTPIP/GPs ameliorates DSS-induced IBD by inhibiting the 
expressions of pro-inflammatory factors and improving colonic mucosal barrier 
function. Furthermore, these HBTTPIP/GPs have realized self-feedback the 
therapeutic effects of GPs on DSS-induced colitis. The oral biomimetic probe 
HBTTPIP/GPs reported herein provides a novel theranostic platform for IBD, 
integrating non-invasive diagnosis of IBD in situ and the corresponding 
treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1019,"BACKGROUND: Cancer and its treatments have the potential to significantly impact 
mental health, provoking feelings of anxiety, depression, and distress, which 
can last long after treatment is over. One of the most rapidly emerging 
influences in the healthcare field is mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), 
which are designed to cultivate present moment awareness, attentional 
flexibility, compassion and acceptance, to reduce physical and psychological 
distress. However, there is limited research into the efficacy of MBIs or 
disease specific MBIs in shifting negative coping, ruminative thinking and fears 
of compassion as primary outcomes in individuals with cancer.
AIMS: This exploratory study was designed to evaluate inter- and 
intra-individual change in the management of negative coping, rumination and 
fears of compassion, following a cancer-specific mindfulness-based intervention.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A single group, non-experimental, repeated measures study 
of 22 participants across six cancer care centres explored the efficacy of an 
8-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Cancer (MBCT-Ca) course. The 
Reliable Change Index (RCI) examined reliable clinical improvement, 
deterioration, or no change in individuals on the Mental Adjustment to Cancer 
Scale (MACS), the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) and the Fears of Compassion 
Scale (FCS). About 82% of participants (n = 18) saw an improvement in at least 
one measure. A significant decrease in primary outcome scores was observed in 
negative coping, ruminating and fears of self-compassion. There were significant 
correlations between the fear of self-compassion and depressive ruminating, fear 
of accepting compassion from others and showing it to others pre and post 
intervention.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the MBCT-Ca programme may significantly 
reduce negative coping, ruminating and fears of self-compassion improving 
psychological health and wellbeing in cancer survivors."
1020,"Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the gold standard after acute coronary 
syndromes (ACS) or chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) undergoing percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI). Because local and systemic ischemic complications 
can occur particularly in the early phase (i.e. 1-3 months) after ACS or PCI, 
the synergistic platelet inhibition of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is of the 
utmost importance in this early phase. Moreover, the use of the more potent 
P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor have shown to further reduce the 
incidence of ischemic events compared to clopidogrel after an ACS. On the other 
hand, prolonged and potent antiplatelet therapy are inevitably associated with 
increased bleeding, which unlike thrombotic risk, tends to be stable over time 
and may outweigh the benefit of reducing ischemic events in these patients. The 
duration and composition of antiplatelet therapy remains a topic of debate in 
cardiology due to competing ischemic and bleeding risks, with guidelines and 
recommendations considerably evolving in the past years. An emerging strategy, 
called ""de-escalation"", consisting in the administration of a less intense 
antithrombotic therapy after a short course of standard DAPT, has shown to 
reduce bleeding without any trade-off in ischemic events. De-escalation may be 
achieved with different antithrombotic strategies and can be either unguided or 
guided by platelet function or genetic testing. The aim of this review is to 
summarize the evidence and provide practical recommendations on the use of 
different de-escalation strategies in patients with ACS and CCS."
1021,"Accelerated approval based on a likely surrogate endpoint can be life-changing 
for patients suffering from a rare progressive disease with unmet medical need, 
as it substantially hastens access to potentially lifesaving therapies. In one 
such example, antisense morpholinos were approved to treat Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy (DMD) based on measurement of shortened dystrophin in skeletal muscle 
biopsies as a surrogate biomarker. New, promising therapeutics for DMD include 
AAV gene therapy to restore another form of dystrophin termed mini- or 
microdystrophin. AAV-microdystrophins are currently in clinical trials but have 
yet to be accepted by regulatory agencies as reasonably likely surrogate 
endpoints. To evaluate microdystrophin expression as a reasonably likely 
surrogate endpoint for DMD, this review highlights dystrophin biology in the 
context of functional and clinical benefit to support the argument that 
microdystrophin proteins have a high probability of providing clinical benefit 
based on their rational design. Unlike exon-skipping based strategies, the 
approach of rational design allows for functional capabilities (i.e. quality) of 
the protein to be maximized with every patient receiving the same optimized 
microdystrophin. Therefore, the presence of rationally designed microdystrophin 
in a muscle biopsy is likely to predict clinical benefit and is consequently a 
strong candidate for a surrogate endpoint analysis to support accelerated 
approval."
1022,"In the Czech Republic, due to the population aging, the prevalence of cognitive 
dysfunction is increasing. Researchers estimate that by 2050 the number of 
patients with dementia in the Czech Republic will more than double. Since 
dementia cannot be cured, it is important to prevent the cognitive dysfunction 
development by influencing modifiable risk factors. Arterial hypertension (AH) 
is one of the main risk factors for the development of cognitive dysfunction and 
dementia. Elevated blood pressure values in youth are associated with a higher 
risk of cognitive decline in middle age and with the development of dementia in 
old age. Blood pressure control in low-risk patients with stage I hypertension 
reduces the risk of dementia development, including Alzheimers disease. 
Therefore, improving the AH control in the population since younghood will be 
needed to influence the emerging cognitive dysfunction pandemic."
1023,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are not just a matter of scarring or 
inflammation in the lung tissue. The lungs can also serve as a repository for 
products that can be produced in excessive amounts in the human body as a result 
of disease. Geneticaly based dysfunctions of lysosomal enzymes, which leads to 
an unefficient degradation and transport of various macromolecules from 
lysosomes, are considered to be storage diseases sensu stricto. ILDs were 
described in patients with Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease and Fabry 
disease. In a broader context, however, the accumulation of various substances 
in the lung tissue is also encountered in cases of pediatric pulmonary 
interstitial glycogenosis (PIG), alveolar lipoproteinosis or pulmonary 
amyloidosis. The cause of PIG is not clear. The disease was first described in 
2002 and a lung tissue sample is required to establish this diagnosis. Even 
though PIG usually goes well in childhood and the patients difficulties 
spontaneously subside over time, the long-term prognosis of the patients is 
unknown. Alveolar lipoproteinoses can be acquired (e.g. after massive exposure 
to silica dust), autoimmune, but also genetically determined. Unlike lysosomal 
storage diseases, in the case of pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis, 
accumulation of abnormal macromolecules occurs only in the lungs of affected 
individuals. Similarly, amyloidosis is not a single disease, but a group of 
diseases with different etiopathogenesis, as a result of which amyloid - a group 
of different proteins with a distinctvive conformation, which can be deposited 
in various organs, including the lungs - is formed. The diagnosis of pulmonary 
alveolar lipoproteinosis is based on the typical appearance and biochemical 
composition of the fluid obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, the diagnosis of 
amyloidosis is histological."
1024,"Currently, the approach to a patient with asthma is in accordance with 
personalized medicine wherein the decision on the treatment pathway is based on 
the type of asthmatic inflammation and other comorbidities that accompany 
asthma. For an allergic asthma patient, allergen immunotherapy (AIT), which has 
a disease-modifying effect and the potential to prevent further progression of 
allergic symptoms, is one of the treatment modalities. It is an effective 
treatment that, unlike pharmacotherapy, modifies the course of allergic 
respiratory diseases and induces allergen specific immune tolerance that 
persists for up to several years after treatment cessation. Therapeutic 
allergens of high quality, efficacy, and safety according to European regulatory 
authorities are an integral part of the treatment of respiratory allergies. It 
is a safe treatment option which still remains the only causal immuno¬modulatory 
therapy for allergic eosinophilic asthma."
1025,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is one of the most common diseases in developed 
countries with significant socioeconomic consequences. The severity of DVT lies 
in the potential for life-threatening pulmonary embolism and the development of 
chronic venous insufficiency, referred to as post-thrombotic syndrome. Virchow 
contributed to the understanding of the pathophysiological events that lead to 
thrombosis by describing three basic risk mechanisms. The first therapeutic 
attempts in the 17th century included venepuncture and the application of 
leeches. The first anticoagulant drug was heparin, which entered clinical 
practice after 1935. Subsequent commercialization of oral vitamin K antagonists 
(warfarin) and the advent of low molecular weight heparin along with compression 
therapy allowed the expansion of outpatient treatment of DVT. Recently, new oral 
anticoagulants have been introduced, leading to improved safety due to lower 
risk of bleeding complications and simplification of the treatment process. The 
next step in the development of therapeutic options are invasive methods of 
early thrombus removal, which significantly shorten the process and aim to 
reduce the occurrence of late complications. These methods include local 
catheter-directed thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator, mechanical 
thrombectomy and their combination called pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy. The 
latter is currently used in patients with acute ilio-femoral DVT."
1026,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is still a serious medical problem with the 
non-decreasing incidence of new cases despite prophylaxis in risky situations. 
It is a multifactorial disease, in which the hereditary component is also 
significantly involved. The aim of the current research is to search for new 
polymorphisms that are involved in thrombogenesis in addition to classical 
thrombophilia (deficiency of natural coagulation inhibitors and FVL and FII 
prothrombin mutations). The article provides an overview of the results of 
already performed genome-wide association studies of VTE and their use for the 
calculation of the so-called polygenic risk score, which could be used for 
individualized prevention of VTE after standardization of the method."
1027,"Dysnatremias are among the most common mineral imbalances encountered in 
clinical practice. Both hyponatremia and hypernatremia are associated with 
increased morbiditidy and mortality and represent negative prognostic factors 
regardless of their cause. Serum osmolality, extracellular fluid volume and 
sodium urine concentration are important parameters for evaluation the cause and 
differential diagnosis. The rate of onset of ionic disorder and severity of 
clinical symptoms are essential. While acute disorders with symptoms are treated 
immediately, in chronic disorders, thorough diagnostic evaluation and a careful 
approach to their correction are necessary. Especially with rapid substitution 
of chronic hyponatremia, there is a risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. 
Therefore, a slow correction of the serum sodium level with frequent 
mineralogram checks is required."
1028,"In this case report is discussed the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma in the 
case of a patient in whose age the occurrence of the disease is very rare. The 
patient underwent a series of non-invasive and invasive examinations, the 
results of which eventually led to a surgical solution of the suspected lesion 
(Wipples procedure). Histological examination of the resection confirmed mixed 
type ampular adenocarcinoma. In the context of this finding, the results of the 
examination, their information value, interpretation and mutual interaction are 
discussed. In the postoperative period, the patient suffered from 
gastrointestinal bleeding, subileum and poor postoperative healing. After 
hospitalization, the patient was transferred to oncology care and indicated for 
genetic testing."
1029,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is a relatively common disease characterized 
by low bone mass and microstructural changes of trabecular bone. The reduced 
bone strength is caused a variety of complications, including fragility fracture 
and sarcopenia. We used CCK-8 and EdU assays to evaluate cell proliferation 
rates. The osteogenesis effect was detected using ALP staining, alizarin red 
staining, and q-PCR. In vivo, the effects of exosomes derived from HUC-MSCs were 
evaluated using HE staining, IHC staining and Masson staining. In addition, we 
explored the mechanism of exosomes and found that the AKT signaling pathway 
played an important role in osteogenesis and cell proliferation. This paper 
mainly explored the function of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord 
mesenchymal stem cells (HUC-MSCs) and provided a new strategy for the treatment 
of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In conclusion, exogenous administration of 
exosomes can contribute to the treatment postmenopausal osteoporosis to a 
certain extent."
1030,"Variations in telomere length (TL) have been associated with aging, stress, and 
many diseases. Placenta TL is an essential molecular component influencing the 
outcome of birth. Previous investigations into the relationship between placenta 
TL and preeclampsia (PE) have produced conflicting findings. We conducted a 
retrospective case-control analysis in this study to address the disparity. We 
used placenta samples from 224 births received from Hawaii Biorepository (HiBR) 
between 2006 and 2013, comprising 129 healthy full-term controls and 95 severe 
PE samples. The average absolute placental TL was calculated using the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique. We utilized multiple 
linear regressions to associate placental TL with severe PE and other 
demographic, clinical and physiological data. The outcome demonstrates that the 
placental TL of severe PE cases did not significantly differ from that of 
healthy controls. Instead, there is a strong correlation between gestational age 
and placenta TL shortening. Placental TL also exhibits racial differences: (1) 
Latino moms' TL is significantly longer than non-Latino mothers' (p=0.009). (2) 
Caucasian patients with severe PE have shorter TL than non-Caucasian patients 
(p=0.0037). This work puts the long-standing question of whether severe PE 
influences placental TL to rest. Placental TL is not related to severe PE but is 
negatively associated with gestational age and is also affected by race."

1032,"Twin pregnancy is often associated with adverse obstetric outcomes. Mother to 
child transmission of HIV in twin pregnancy is less explored. The present study 
aimed to determine the risk of vertical transmission of HIV in HIV exposed twin 
pregnancy in comparison to singleton and to explore associated factors. We 
conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 348 HIV exposed babies (58 twin 
and 290 singleton) through systematic sampling from program database of West 
Bengal, India from April 2016 to March 2021. HIV vertical transmission rate was 
compared between single and twin live births. The effects of factors like 
maternal age, timing of maternal HIV diagnosis, duration of Antiretroviral 
Treatment, mode of delivery, birth weight and gender of baby etc. were 
determined. The HIV transmission rate for twin pregnancy (15.52% ) was 
significantly higher than single live-birth (5.5%) [Adjusted Odds Ratio = 3.08 
(1.15-8.23)]. Among twin deliveries, maternal HIV diagnosis during intrapartum 
and postpartum period was associated with HIV transmission [Crude Odds Ratio= 
11.0 (2.2-54.9)]. In conclusion perinatal HIV transmission is more common in 
twin pregnancies and linked with time of detection of maternal HIV. Early HIV 
detection and additional Antiretroviral regimen may be thought of for twin 
pregnancies."
1033,"The Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2021 and gradually overtook the Delta variant, 
which was the predominant variant at that time. The Omicron variant has been 
consecutively replaced by related sublineages. The real-time RT-PCR assays 
developed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan (i.e., the 
NIID-N2 and NIID-S2 assays) are the reference assays that have been used in 
Japan since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the applicability of the 
NIID assays for the Omicron variants, trends in the prevalence of nucleotide 
mismatches in the primer/probe sequences were traced using sequences registered 
in the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data database. Approximately 
99% of the deposited Omicron variant sequences did not have any mismatches in 
the NIID assay primer/probes from January to August 2022. This indicates that 
the NIID assays have been able to detect the changing SARS-CoV-2 Omicron 
variants."
1034,"Antibiotic treatment is critical for gonorrhea-infected individuals and for 
preventing disease transmission. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular epidemiological characteristics of 
Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in Changsha, China. A total of 271 N. gonorrhoeae 
isolates collected from clinical laboratories of two hospitals between 2016 and 
2021 were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility using the agar dilution 
method. N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (MG-MAST) was conducted for 
genotyping, and phylogenetic analysis was determined using porB and tbpB 
sequences. Results showed that ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and penicillin were 
at high levels of antimicrobial resistance, which were no longer recommended to 
treat gonorrhea. All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin. However, in 
2016-2021, a total of 15 (5.5%) ceftriaxone-resistant strains and 31 (11.4%) 
isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone were found and the 
resistance rate of azithromycin in 2016-2017 had reached 7.1%. 
Epidemiologically, mosaic penA allele was identified in all 
ceftriaxone-resistant isolates. The most prevalent NG-MAST ST was ST5061. 
Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the resistant isolates were not clustered 
alone. This study, though performed locally, raises the alert on gonorrhea 
medication that ceftriaxone may not be adequate as a first-line treatment for 
gonorrhea in Changsha."
1035,"Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories are necessary to study microorganisms 
that are highly pathogenic to humans and have no prevention or therapeutic 
measures. Currently, most BSL-4 facilities have suit-type laboratories to 
conduct experiments on highly pathogenic microorganisms. In 2021, the first 
Japanese suit-type BSL-4 laboratory was constructed at Nagasaki University. 
Positive pressure protection suit (PPPS) is a primary barrier that protect and 
isolate laboratory workers from pathogens and the laboratory environment. Here, 
we developed a novel PPPS originally designed to be used in the Nagasaki BSL-4 
laboratory. We modified several parts of the domestic chemical protective suit, 
including its front face shield, cuff, and air supply hose, for safe handling of 
microbiological agents. The improved suit, PS-790BSL4-AL, showed resistance to 
several chemicals, including quaternary ammonium disinfectant, and did not show 
any permeation against blood and phages. To validate the suit's integrity, we 
also established an airtight test that enabled the elimination of individual 
differences for quantitative testing. Thus, our developed suit is sufficient as 
a primary barrier and allows for the safe handling of pathogens in our new BSL-4 
laboratory."
1036,"Objectives This study aimed to clarify the vaccination coverage of 
vaccine-preventable diseases and the factors and reasons for non-vaccination 
among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods/Patients This 
single-centre, cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 September to 30 
November 2020 in a 715-bed regional tertiary-care teaching hospital in Japan. A 
questionnaire survey was undertaken to investigate the vaccination status of 
patients with SLE, and the factors and reasons for not receiving the influenza 
vaccine, 23-valent-pneumococcal-polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), varicella vaccine live (VVL), and 
recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV). Results The vaccination coverage for the 
influenza vaccine, PPSV23, PCV13, VVL, and RZV was 61%, 22%, 19%, 3.4%, and 0%, 
respectively, among 261 patients. The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy 
was 'efficacy concerns about vaccines' for the influenza vaccine and 'cost' for 
PPSV23 and PCV13. The factors significantly associated with non-vaccination were 
prescription of high-dose glucocorticoids and no history of visits to other 
internal medicine clinics for the influenza vaccine; a younger age and 
prescription of high-dose glucocorticoids for PPSV23; and a younger age, no 
medication with hydroxychloroquine, no history of hospitalisation in internal 
medicine, and extensive clinical experience of the doctor for PCV13. Conclusion 
These findings, which demonstrated that the factors and reasons for 
non-vaccination varied by vaccine type, suggest that individualised strategies 
should be used to promote vaccination in this population."

immunosuppressed patients. We herein report a 79-year-old Japanese man who 
received low-dose prednisolone therapy for neurosarcoidosis and 
panhypopituitarism. He presented a 10-day history of a fever and altered mental 
status. The FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel and serum cryptococcal 
antigen tests were both negative, but the cerebrospinal fluid sample became 
positive for Cryptococcus neoformans after seven-day incubation. After the 
diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis, we successfully treated the patient with a 
recommended treatment regimen. When an immunocompromised patient presents with a 
subacute fever accompanying any central nervous symptoms, cryptococcal

1038,"Pregnancy is a known risk factor for amebic enteritis, which develops into 
potentially fatal fulminant amebic enteritis in some cases. We describe a case 
of a 27-year-old non-immunosuppressed pregnant woman with fulminant amebic 
enteritis complicated with cytomegalovirus enteritis. She improved with 
intensive care and intravenous metronidazole and ganciclovir but eventually 
required subtotal colectomy for intestinal stenosis. It is difficult to diagnose 
amebic enteritis, especially in a non-endemic area. Amebic enteritis must be 
considered as a differential diagnosis for refractory diarrhea with bloody 
stools in women in the perinatal period, even those without immunosuppression."
1039,"Anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is 
an autoimmune demyelinating disorder that mainly occurs post-infection or 
post-vaccination. MOGAD after inoculation with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) vaccines is rare, and we herein report a rare case of a patient with 
MOGAD after vaccination using the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2; 
Pfizer Japan Inc.; Tokyo). Our report highlights the fact that MOGAD following 
inoculation with COVID-19 vaccine may show clinical relapse during reduction of 
the oral steroid dose, and continuous treatments with immunological agents is 
needed to prevent disease recurrence."
1040,"We describe two follicular lymphoma (FL) patients with MYC/BCL2 double- and 
MYC/BCL2/BCL6 triple-hit translocations. The first patient (case 1) was a man in 
his 30s who presented with stage IV disease with leukemic manifestation. The 
second patient (case 2) was a man in his 60s who presented with relapsed FL, but 
his disease was in a limited stage. Histopathology of the lymph node biopsies 
revealed grade 3A FL in both cases. MYC positivity and the Ki-67-labeling index 
were 60-70 and 20% in case 1 and 30 and 50% in case 2, respectively. G-banding 
revealed t(8;14;18)(q24;q32;q21) in both cases and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization using MYC, IGH, and BCL2 break-apart probes confirmed 
t(8;14;18)(+5'BCL2,-3'MYC;+3'MYC,-5'IGH;+5'IGH,-5'BCL2). In case 2, additional 
materials of der(8)t(8;14;18) were duplicated and translocated to chromosome Y, 
and t(3;16)(q27;p13)/BCL6::CIITA was identified. We obtained BCL2-major 
breakpoint region::IGHJ5::IGHG1 and MYC exon 2::IGHA2 fusion sequences by 
long-distance polymerase chain reaction in case 1, and proposed that t(8;14;18) 
was generated by two-step translocations and that BCL2::IGH and MYC::IGH 
involved the same IGH allele. Both patients responded to the standard 
chemotherapy for FL. We suggest that the presence of t(8;14;18) in FL does not 
immediately indicate high-grade transformation and aggressive clinical behavior 
requiring intensive chemotherapy."
1041,"Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare malignancy showing morphologic and 
immunophenotypic features of histiocytes. HS has morphologic overlap with many 
other diseases, including various kinds of lymphomas. Gray zone lymphoma (GZL) 
is a rare B-cell lymphoma subtype characterized by overlapping features between 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma. The histologic 
overlap with other diverse diseases of HS and the pathological diversity of GZL 
make it difficult to render a diagnosis. A 44-year-old woman who was initially 
diagnosed with HS was diagnosed with GZL after reexamination, including a 
genetic alteration test. After 6 cycles of brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, 
vinblastine, and dacarbazine, she achieved a complete response. Genomic 
alteration assessment may be useful for the accurate diagnosis of malignant 
lymphomas, which are difficult to diagnose, such as GZL."
1042,"In this study, we examined a cohort of Japanese patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) with cup-like nuclei. In particular, we attempted to provide a 
detailed definition of the clinical features of AML with cup-like nuclei. The 
clinical records of patients diagnosed with de novo AML were collected 
retrospectively. We showed that approximately 23% of all patients with AML 
diagnosed during the study period had AML with cup-like nuclei. All three 
cup-like AML cases had FLT3-ITD mutations. In addition, we reported a high 
incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute cerebral 
infarction in patients with AML with cup-like nuclei. Our results show that AML 
with cup-like nuclei may be more common than expected. Due to these unique 
characteristics, recognition of this morphology is recommended."
1043,"The cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) regimen, 
containing doxorubicin (DXR), which is a key drug for aggressive non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL), is a standard chemotherapeutic regimen; however, its 
administration in elderly patients is often intolerable. Pirarubicin 
(tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin [THP]) is an anthracycline developed in Japan. We 
have conducted a phase II trial of a full-dose THP-COP (modified CHOP regimen 
with DXR replaced by THP) regimen for elderly patients with newly diagnosed, 
advanced-stage, aggressive NHL. Patients aged 70-79 years old with previously 
untreated NHL according to the Working Formulation (D through H and J), disease 
stage I with a bulky mass or stage II-IV, and performance status of 0-1 were 
eligible. The THP-COP regimen, which consisted of 750-mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 
50-mg/m2 THP, 1.4-mg/m2 vincristine (capped at 2.0 mg) on day 1, and 100-mg 
prednisolone daily on days 1 to 5, was delivered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. The 
primary endpoint was complete response (CR) rate. Twenty-nine patients were 
enrolled in the study. The CR rate was 65.5% (95% confidence interval, 
45.7-82.1%). The 3-year failure-free and overall survival rates were 54.1% and 
53.9%, respectively. The most frequent observed grade 3 or 4 toxicity was 
neutropenia, which occurred in 80% of the patients. Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction 
was observed in one patient. The full-dose THP-COP regimen exhibited similar 
efficacy and safety, and a tendency for less cardiac toxicity, when compared 
with the standard CHOP regimen in elderly Japanese patients with newly 
diagnosed, advanced-stage, aggressive NHL."
1044,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous group of chronic 
lung conditions. Genome-wide association studies have identified 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COPD and the co-occurring 
conditions, suggesting common biological mechanisms underlying COPD and these 
co-occurring conditions. To identify them, we have integrated information across 
different biological levels (i.e., genetic variants, lung-specific 3D genome 
structure, gene expression and protein-protein interactions) to build 
lung-specific gene regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks. We have 
queried these networks using disease-associated SNPs for COPD, unipolar 
depression and coronary artery disease. COPD-associated SNPs can control genes 
involved in the regulation of lung or pulmonary function, asthma, brain region 
volumes, cortical surface area, depressed affect, neuroticism, Parkinson's 
disease, white matter microstructure and smoking behaviour. We describe the 
regulatory connections, genes and biochemical pathways that underlay these 
co-occurring trait-SNP-gene associations. Collectively, our findings provide new 
avenues for the investigation of the underlying biology and diverse clinical 
presentations of COPD. In so doing, we identify a collection of genetic variants 
and genes that may aid COPD patient stratification and treatment."

1046,"The Golgi apparatus modifies and transports secretory and membrane proteins. In 
some instances, the production of secretory and membrane proteins exceeds the 
capacity of the Golgi apparatus, including vesicle trafficking and the 
post-translational modification of macromolecules. These proteins are not 
modified or delivered appropriately due to insufficiency in the Golgi function. 
These conditions disturb Golgi homeostasis and induce a cellular condition known 
as Golgi stress, causing cells to activate the 'Golgi stress response,' which is 
a homeostatic process to increase the capacity of the Golgi based on cellular 
requirements. Since the Golgi functions are diverse, several response pathways 
involving TFE3, HSP47, CREB3, proteoglycan, mucin, MAPK/ETS, and PERK regulate 
the capacity of each Golgi function separately. Understanding the Golgi stress 
response is crucial for revealing the mechanisms underlying Golgi dynamics and 
its effect on human health because many signaling molecules are related to 
diseases, ranging from viral infections to fatal neurodegenerative diseases. 
Therefore, it is valuable to summarize and investigate the mechanisms underlying 
Golgi stress response in disease pathogenesis, as they may contribute to 
developing novel therapeutic strategies. In this review, we investigate the 
perturbations and stress signaling of the Golgi, as well as the therapeutic 
potentials of new strategies for treating Golgi stress-associated diseases."
1047,"INTRODUCTION: Lung transplant (LTX) patients are at high risk of cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) infection, which is often associated with high mortality and morbidity. 
Reactivation of CMV causes cell injury due to the cytopathic effect of viral 
replication and triggering of T cell immunity. The aim of this study was to 
compare expression of Immune checkpoints (ICs) (PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3 and TIGIT) 
in CD4, CD8 and CD56 and activation markers CD137, CD154 and CD69 of end-stage 
patients awaiting lung transplant.
METHODS: Eighteen pre-LTX positive for anti-CMV IgG titres and 18 healthy 
subjects were enrolled. IC and activation markers has been evaluated through 
flow cytometric analysis in HC and pre-LTX patients. Reactive (QF+) and 
unreactive (QF-) patients were stratified according to QuantiFERON-CMV assays. 
ICs and activation markers expression were determined before and after in vitro 
stimulation with pp-65 and IE-1 antigens.
RESULTS: Lower expression of PD-1 was observed in CD4 and CD8 cells of pre-LTX 
patients than controls, whereas CTLA4 appeared up-regulated in CD56 and CD8 
cells. TIGIT is increased on the surface of CD4, CD8 and NK cells after peptide 
stimulation in QF-negative patients and PD-1 is only downregulated after 
stimulation in the QF-positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new evidence of immune dysregulation in 
patients with end-stage lung disorders, particularly in relation to immune 
checkpoint cell biology. The change in QF+ mostly happens on cytotoxic cells NK 
and CD8, while the changes in QF- were observed in adaptive immune cells, 
including CD4 and CD8."
1048,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Serum bilirubin is an established marker of liver disease. 
Reliable tools for non-invasive assessment of jaundice in cirrhosis patients, at 
risk of clinical decompensation, are highly desirable. Whilst smartphone-based 
imaging has been described in neonatal jaundice, it has not been investigated in 
advanced cirrhosis patients.
METHODS: We included 46 hospitalized patients with acute cirrhosis 
decompensation and jaundice. Scleral images using an Android smartphone were 
taken to derive ""Scleral Colour Values (SCV)"" which were matched with same day 
serum bilirubin measurements. In 29 patients, repeat SCV and bilirubin 
measurements were performed over time. We analysed the relationship of SCV and 
its dynamics with serum bilirubin, clinical scores, and patient outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 46 patients, 26 (57%) had alcoholic hepatitis as the decompensation 
precipitant. Seven patients died during admission; a further 12 following 
hospital discharge. SCV had an excellent linear correlation with serum bilirubin 
(rho=0.90, p<0.001); changes in SCV and serum bilirubin across different time 
points, were also closely associated (rho=0.77, p<0.001). SCV correlated 
significantly with CLIF Consortium Acute Decompensation score (rho=0.38, 
p<0.001) and grade of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (rho=0.42, p=0.039). SCV 
was higher in patients who died, however, not significantly (86.1 [IQR 
83.0-89.7] vs. 82.3 [IQR 78.5-83.3], p=0.22). The associations of SCV with 
clinical parameters mirrored those of serum bilirubin.
CONCLUSION: Smartphone-based assessment of jaundice shows excellent concordance 
with serum bilirubin and is associated with clinical parameters in acute 
cirrhosis decompensation. This approach offers promise for remote assessment of 
cirrhosis patients at-risk of decompensation, post hospital discharge."
1049,"Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is rising rapidly in many 
industrialised and affluent areas in the Asia Pacific region. Current available 
guidelines, mainly from Europe and North America, may not be completely 
applicable to clinicians caring for children with PIBD in this region due to 
differences in disease characteristics and regional resources constraints. This 
position paper is an initiative from the Asian Pan-Pacific Society for Pediatric 
Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (APPSPGHAN) with the aim of providing 
an up-to-date, evidence-based approach to PIBD in the Asia Pacific region, 
taking into consideration the unique disease characteristics and financial 
resources available in this region. A group of pediatric gastroenterologists 
with special interest in PIBD performed an extensive literature search covering 
epidemiology, disease characteristics and natural history, management and 
monitoring. Gastrointestinal infections, including tuberculosis, need to be 
excluded before diagnosing IBD. In some populations in Asia, the Nudix Hydrolase 
15 (NUD15) gene is a better predictor of leukopenia induced by azathioprine than 
thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT). The main considerations in the use of 
biologics in the Asia Pacific region are high cost, ease of access, and 
potential infectious risk, especially tuberculosis. Conclusion: This position 
paper provides a useful guide to clinicians in the medical management of 
children with PIBD in the Asia Pacific region."
1050,"Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in cerebral ischemic stroke (IS). In the 
acute phase of IS, microglia are activated towards the pro-inflammatory (M1) and 
anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. Argon, an inert gas, can reduce 
neuroinflammation and alleviate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, 
whether argon regulates M1/M2 polarization to protect against I/R injury as well 
as the underlying mechanism has not been reported. In this study, we analyzed 
the activation and polarization of microglia after I/R injury with or without 
argon administration and explored the effects of argon on NLRP3 
inflammasome-mediated inflammation in microglia in vitro and in vivo. The 
results showed that argon application inhibited the activation of M1 
microglia/macrophage in the ischemic penumbra and the expression of proteins 
related to NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis in microglia. Argon administration 
also inhibited the expression and processing of IL-1β, a primary 
pro-inflammatory cytokine. Thus, argon alleviates I/R injury by inhibiting 
pro-inflammatory reactions via suppressing microglial polarization towards M1 
phenotype and inhibiting the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. More 
importantly, we showed that argon worked better than the specific NLRP3 
inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 in suppressing neuroinflammation and protecting 
against cerebral I/R injury, suggesting the therapeutic potential of argon in 
neuroinflammation-related neurodegeneration diseases as a potent gas inhibitor 
of the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway."
1051,"ALG8 protein-truncating variants (PTVs) have previously been described in 
patients with polycystic liver disease and in some cases cystic kidney disease. 
Given a lack of well-controlled studies, we determined whether individuals 
heterozygous for ALG8 PTVs are at increased risk of cystic kidney disease in a 
large, unselected health system-based observational cohort linked to electronic 
health records in Pennsylvania (Geisinger-Regeneron DiscovEHR MyCode study). Out 
of 174,172 patients, 236 were identified with ALG8 PTVs. Using ICD-based 
outcomes, patients with these variants were significantly at increased risk of 
having any kidney/liver cyst diagnosis (Odds Ratio 2.42, 95% confidence 
interval: 1.53-3.85), cystic kidney disease (3.03, 1.26-7.31), and 
nephrolithiasis (1.89, 1.96-2.97). To confirm this finding, blinded radiology 
review of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies was 
completed in a matched cohort of 52 thirty-plus year old ALG8 PTV heterozygotes 
and related non-heterozygotes. ALG8 PTV heterozygotes were significantly more 
likely to have cystic kidney disease, defined as four or more kidney cysts 
(57.7% vs. 7.7%), or bilateral kidney cysts (69.2% vs. 15.4%), but not one or 
more liver cyst (11.5% vs. 7.7%). In publicly-available UK Biobank data, ALG8 
PTV heterozygotes were at significantly increased risk of ICD code N28 (other 
disorders of kidney/ureter) (3.85% vs. 1.33%). ALG8 PTVs were not associated 
with chronic kidney disease or kidney failure in the MyCode study or the UK 
Biobank data. Thus, PTVs in ALG8 result in increased risk of a mild cystic 
kidney disease phenotype."
1052,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the aetiology, clinical features, diagnostic studies and 
outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a French cohort of 
hospitalized kidney transplant recipients kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, multicenter study in kidney transplant 
recipients admitted to 10 French centers for CAP from January 2016 to December 
2018. CAP discharge diagnoses were clinically and radiologically validated. We 
assessed a descriptive analysis of all confirmed CAP including medical ward and 
intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.
RESULTS: 165 CAP episodes in 132 patients were included. Median time from 
transplantation to admission was 6.4 [IQR, 1.6-12.3] years, with corticosteroid 
exposure in 112/165 (67.9%) cases. Sputum culture was performed in 47/165 
(28.5%) cases including 7/47 (14.9%) positive samples. Bronchoscopy was 
performed in 87/165 (52.7%) cases with pathogens identified in 39/87 (44.8%) 
cases. Microbiological studies led to identify a respiratory pathogen in 64/165 
(38.8%) CAP episodes including 11/64 (17.2%) polymicrobial cases. Among these 64 
episodes, 75 micro-organisms were identified; 46/75 (61.3%) core respiratory 
pathogens and 29/75 (38.7%) opportunistic or drug-resistant organisms including 
Pneumocystis jirovecii 9/75 (12%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5/75 (6.7%), 
multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae 4/75 (5.3%) and Aspergillus 4/75 (5.3%). 
Patients required ICU admission in 26/165 (15.8%) episodes, invasive ventilation 
in 20/165 (12.1%) cases and 22/165 (13.3%) needed in-hospital dialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: CAP episodes occurred in KTR with a long history of 
immunosuppressive drug exposure. Diagnostic studies identified a micro-organism 
in more than one third of CAP episodes, including drug-resistant and 
opportunistic pathogens."
1053,"Excessive stress can precipitate depression and anxiety diseases, and damage 
gastrointestinal functionality and microbiota changes, favoring the development 
of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) - defined by dysregulation in 
the brain-gut interaction. Therefore, the present study investigated if 
Emotional-Single Prolonged Stress (E-SPS) induces depressive/anxiety-like 
phenotype and gut dysfunction in adult Swiss male mice. For this, mice of the 
E-SPS group were subjected to three stressors sequential exposure: 
immobilization, swimming, and odor of the predator for 7 days (incubation 
period). Next, animals performed behavior tests and 24h later, samples of feces, 
blood, and colon tissue were collected. E-SPS increased the plasma 
corticosterone levels, immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim 
test, decreased the grooming time in the splash test, OAT%, and OAE% in the 
elevated plus-maze test, as well as increased anxiety index. Mice of E-SPS had 
increased % of intestinal transit rate, % of fecal moisture content, and fecal 
pellets number, and decreased Claudin1 content in the colon. E-SPS decreased the 
relative abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroidia class, Bacteroidales 
order, Muribaculaceae and Porphyromonadaceae family, Muribaculum, and 
Duncaniella genus. However, E-SPS increased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria 
phylum, Coriobacteriales order, and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, and 
demonstrated Mucispirillum genus presence. The present study showed that E-SPS 
induced depressive/anxiety-like phenotype, predominant diarrhea gut dysfunction, 
and modulated the gut bacterial microbiota profile in male adult Swiss mice. 
E-SPS might be a promising model for future studies on the brain-gut interaction 
and the development of FGIDs with psychological comorbidities."
1054,"BACKGROUND: Autonomy supportive health environments can assist patients to 
achieve behavior change and positively influence adherence. Telerehabilitation 
may increase access to rehabilitation services, but creating an autonomy 
supportive environment may be challenging.
RESEARCH QUESTION: To what degree does telerehabilitation provide an autonomy 
supportive environment? What is the patient experience of an 8-week 
telerehabilitation program?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals undertaking telerehabilitation or 
center-based pulmonary rehabilitation within a larger randomized controlled 
equivalence trial completed Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ - short 
form) to assess perceived autonomy support. Telerehabilitation participants were 
invited to undertake 1:1 semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed 
verbatim and thematically coded to identify major themes and sub-themes.
RESULTS: 136 participants (n=69 telerehabilitation) completed HCCQ and n=30 
(42%) telerehabilitation participants undertook interviews. HCCQ summary scores 
indicated participants 'strongly agreed' the telerehabilitation environment was 
autonomy supportive, which was similar to center-based participants (HCCQ 
summary score p=0.6; individual HCCQ items p≥0.3). Telerehabilitation interview 
data supported quantitative findings identifying 5 major themes, with 
sub-themes, being: 1) Making it easier to participate in pulmonary 
rehabilitation, as telerehabilitation was convenient, saved time and money and 
offered flexibility; 2) Receiving support in a variety of ways, including 
opportunities for peer-support and receiving an individualized program guided by 
expert staff; 3) Internal and external motivation to exercise, as a consequence 
of being in a supervised group, seeing results for effort and being inspired by 
others; 4) Achieving success, through provision of equipment and processes to 
prepare and support operation of equipment and technology; 5) After the 
rehabilitation program, continuing to exercise but dealing with feelings of 
loss.
INTERPRETATION: Telerehabilitation was perceived as an autonomy supportive 
environment, in part by making it easier to undertake pulmonary rehabilitation. 
Support for behavior change, understanding and motivation were derived from 
clinicians and patient-peers. The extent to which autonomy support translates 
into ongoing self-management and behavior change is not clear."
1055,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, 
annually resulting in 20 million infections, 3 million cases of clinical 
disease, and 60,000 fatalities worldwide, significantly endangering pregnant 
women and immunocompromised individuals. HEV-related research has been 
considerably delayed, and no HEV-specific therapeutics have yet been developed. 
We aimed to discover efficient anti-HEV drugs through high throughput screening 
that could be validated in vitro and in a preclinical animal study in vivo, and 
elucidate the underlying antiviral mechanism.
METHODS: Using appropriate cellular and rodent HEV infection models, we studied 
a critical pathway for host-HEV interaction and performed a preclinical study of 
the corresponding antivirals by targeting proteostasis of the HEV replicase.
RESULTS: We found 17 inhibitors that target HEV-HSP90 interactions by an 
unbiased compound library screening on human hepatocytes harboring an HEV 
replicon. Inhibitors of HSP90 (iHSP90) markedly suppressed HEV replication with 
efficacy exceeding that of conventional antivirals (IFNα and ribavirin) in 
vitro. Mechanistically, iHSP90 treatment released the viral replicase ORF1 
protein from the ORF1-HSP90 complex and triggered ORF1 for rapid 
ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in abrogated HEV 
replication. Furthermore, a preclinical trial in a Mongolian gerbil HEV 
infection model showed this novel anti-HEV strategy to be safe, efficient, and 
able to prevent HEV-induced liver damage.
CONCLUSIONS: This study collectively illustrates a critical proteostasis pathway 
for host-HEV interaction and paves the way for translating the new understanding 
of the HEV life cycle into clinically promising antivirals.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Appropriate treatment options for HEV-infected pregnant 
women as well as immunocompromised patients are lacking, creating an urgent need 
for developing safe HEV-specific therapies. This study identified new antivirals 
(inhibitors of HSP90) that significantly decrease the HEV infection by targeting 
viral replicase for degradation. Moreover, these anti-HEV drugs were validated 
in an HEV rodent model and found to be safe and efficient for prevention of 
HEV-induced liver injury in preclinical experiments. Our findings substantially 
promote the understanding of HEV pathobiology and the pace of antiviral 
development."
1056,"OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors and time course for repeat procedures after 
ureteroscopy (URS) or shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) procedure using a large 
employer-based claims database.
METHODS: We identified all patients who underwent treatment for ureteral or 
renal stone with URS or SWL from 1/1/2007 to 12/31/2014 using the IBM MarketScan 
Commercial Database. Repeat stone procedure was evaluated after a 90-day grace 
period from the index procedure. Patients were followed until 12/31/2017. We 
performed multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards to determine 
independent risk factors for repeat procedure after the initial stone removal.
RESULTS: A total of 189,739 patients underwent a SWL or URS and were included in 
the study. The incidence of repeat procedure per 100 person years was 6.8, and 
4.4 after SWL and URS, respectively. The median time to reoperation was 12.5 
months for SWL and 14.6 months for URS. On multivariable analysis, SWL was 
associated with an increased risk of repeat procedure compared to URS. 
(HR = 1.63). Paralysis, neurogenic bladder and inflammatory bowel disease were 
also associated with an increased risk of repeat procedure (HR=1.66, 1.40, and 
1.36 respectively) CONCLUSIONS: In a large national cohort, patients with 
paralysis and neurogenic bladder had a significantly higher risk of repeat stone 
procedure. SWL was associated with higher risk of repeat procedure than URS. 
Urologists can use these data to identify and counsel patients at high risk for 
need for recurrent procedure."
1057,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) exhibit a baseline 
hypercoagulable state and are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism 
(VTE). There is little data on the efficacy of standard prophylaxis in 
preventing VTE following non-cardiovascular surgery in this patient population. 
Our objective was to investigate the incidence of VTE in patients with SCD 
undergoing non-cardiovascular surgery.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review for 352 patients with SCD who 
underwent non-cardiovascular surgery from August 2009 to August 2019 at Beaumont 
Hospitals. An equal number of controls without SCD were propensity-matched for 
age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and specific surgery. Data collected 
included demographics, comorbidities, VTE prophylaxis used, the occurrence of 
deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), hospital length of stay, and 
30-day mortality.
RESULTS: There was no difference in age, race, sex, ethnicity, operative time, 
or hospital length of stay between SCD and propensity-matched control patients. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis was used more frequently in SCD patients 
than in controls (96.3% vs 88.6%, P<.001). Four DVTs were seen in SCD patients 
(1.1%) vs five in the control group (1.4%, P>.999); one patients in each group 
developed a pulmonary embolism (PE) 0.3%, P>.999). There was no difference in 
30-day mortality among SCD patients vs controls (1, 0.3% vs 3, 0.9%, P=.312). Of 
those diagnosed with VTE within 30 days postoperatively, there were no 
differences in age, sex, race, BMI, or procedure type. DVT was diagnosed 
significantly later in SCD patients than in controls (median post-operative day 
12 vs 5, P=.014). None of the five SCD patients with VTE was a smoker, whereas 
four of the six non-SCD patients with VTE were current or former tobacco users 
(P=.061). All patients who developed VTE had received DVT prophylaxis at the 
time of surgery.
CONCLUSION: There appears to be no difference in the perioperative rates of DVT, 
PE, or mortality in SCD patients undergoing non-cardiovascular surgery compared 
with matched controls. Vigilant attention to routine venous prophylaxis seems to 
effectively reduce the VTE risk in these hypercoagulable patients. SCD patients 
may need VTE prophylaxis for a longer period postoperatively than those without 
SCD."

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary sign endpoint was change from baseline at 
Week 8 in tCFS. The primary symptom endpoint was change from baseline at Week 8 
in eye dryness score (0-100 visual analog scale [VAS]). Key secondary endpoints 
were change from baseline in eye dryness score at Week 2, tCFS at Week 2, eye 
burning/stinging score (0-100 VAS) at Week 8, and central corneal fluorescein 
staining (cCFS; 0-3 NEI scale) at Week 8.
RESULTS: A total of 597 patients were randomized and treated (NOV03, 303; 
saline, 294). At Week 8, improvement from baseline was significantly greater 
with NOV03 versus saline for both tCFS (least-squares [LS] mean treatment 
difference, -0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.40, -0.55; P<0.001) and VAS 
dryness score (LS mean treatment difference, -7.6; 95% CI: -11.8, -3.4; 
P<0.001). Improvement from baseline also significantly favored NOV03 on all key 
secondary endpoints: LS mean treatment difference (95% CI) was -4.7 (-8.2, -1.2) 
for VAS dryness score at Week 2, -0.6 (-0.9, -0.2) for tCFS at Week 2, -5.5 
(-9.5, -1.6) for VAS burning/stinging score at Week 8, and -0.2 (-0.4, -0.1) for 
cCFS at Week 8; all P<0.01. Most ocular adverse events were mild in severity; 
there were no serious ocular adverse events. One patient discontinued NOV03 due 
to an adverse event (eye irritation).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with DED associated with MGD, NOV03 eye drops 
demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements 
versus hypotonic saline in both the signs and symptoms of DED. NOV03 appeared 
well tolerated in this population."
1060,"OBJECTIVES: There is a paucity of literature on the natural history of 
extracranial carotid artery occlusion (CAO). This study reviews the natural 
history of this patient cohort.
METHODS: This single-institution retrospective analysis studied patients with 
CAO diagnosed by duplex ultrasound between 2010 and 2021. Patients were 
identified by searching our office-based IAC accredited vascular laboratory 
database. Imaging and clinical data were obtained via our institutional 
Electronic Medical Record. Outcomes of interest included ipsilateral stroke, 
attributable neurologic symptoms, and ipsilateral intervention after diagnosis.
RESULTS: The full duplex database consisted of 5523 patients who underwent 
carotid artery duplex exam during the study period. The CAO cohort consisted of 
139 patients; incidence of CAO was 2.5%. Mean age at diagnosis was 69.7 years; 
31.4% were female. Hypertension (72.7%), hyperlipidemia (64.7%), and prior 
smoking (43.9%) were the most common comorbid conditions. Of the CAO cohort, 
61.3% (n=85) of patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis; 38.8% (n=54) were 
diagnosed after a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurring within six 
months prior to diagnosis, with 21.6% occurring ipsilateral to the CAO and 10.1% 
occurring contralateral to the CAO. 7.2% (n=10) had unclear symptoms or 
laterality at presentation. Of the CAO cohort, ninety-five patients (68.3%) had 
duplex imaging follow-up (mean 42.7±31.3 months). Of those with follow up 
studies, seven patients (5.0%) developed subsequent stroke ipsilateral to the 
CAO with mean occurrence 27.8 ±39.0 months post-diagnosis. In addition, five 
patients (3.6%) developed other related symptoms, including global 
hypoperfusion, (2.4%) and TIA (1.2%). Of those 95 patients with follow up duplex 
ultrasound imaging, six (4.3%) underwent eventual ipsilateral intervention, 
including CEA (n=4), TF-CAS (n=1), and carotid bypass (n=1), with mean 
occurrence 17.7±23.7 months post-diagnosis. The aggregate rate of ipsilateral 
CVA, attributable neurologic symptoms, or ipsilateral intervention was 11.5%. Of 
95 patients with follow up duplex ultrasound imaging, 5 underwent subsequent 
duplex studies demonstrating ipsilateral patency, resulting in a 5.3% 
discrepancy rate between sequential duplex studies. All 6 patients undergoing 
intervention received periprocedural cross-sectional imaging (MRA or CTA). In 5 
of these 6 patients, cross-sectional demonstrated severe stenosis rather than 
CAO, disputing prior duplex ultrasound findings.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large, institutional cohort of patients with a CAO 
diagnosis on duplex ultrasound, a clinically meaningful subset of patients 
experienced CVA, related symptoms, or intervention. We also found a notable rate 
of temporal duplex discrepancies among patients with CAO diagnoses, and 
discrepancies between CAO diagnosis per duplex ultrasound and findings on 
cross-sectional imaging for those patients who underwent intervention. These 
results suggest that use of a single duplex ultrasound as a sole diagnostic tool 
in CAO may not be sufficient, and that physicians should consider close duplex 
ultrasound surveillance of these patients, potentially in conjunction with 
additional confirmatory imaging modalities. Further investigation into optimal 
workup and surveillance protocols for CAO is needed."
1061,"Recently, Vibrio anguillarum, a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium, has been 
becoming a major constraint on the development of the turbot aquaculture 
industry because of its characteristics of worldwide distribution, broad host 
range and potentially devastating impacts. Although the function of 
protein-coding mRNAs in the immune response against bacterial infection has been 
reported, as well as several non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), the relationships between mRNAs and ncRNAs in 
the immune system of turbot liver are still limited during bacterial infection. 
In the present study, the comprehensive analyses of whole-transcriptome 
sequencing were conducted in turbot liver infected by V. anguillarum. The 
differential expression was analyzed in the data of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. 
The interactions of miRNA-circRNA pairs and miRNA-mRNA pairs were predicted 
basing on the negative regulatory relationships between miRNAs and their target 
circRNAs\mRNAs. The circRNA-related ceRNA regulatory networks were constructed 
for the analyses of regulated mechanism in turbot immune system. Subsequently, 
the RT-qPCR was carried out to verify the results of sequencing. Therefore, we 
identified 31 circRNAs, 53 miRNAs and 948 mRNAs with differential expression. 
Gene set enrichment analyses using Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that innate immunity was principally 
activated at the early stages of infection, while adaptive immunity was 
activated after 24 hrs. Finally, 65 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathways were 
constructed, based on the hypothesis of ceRNA regulatory networks. In 
conclusion, our findings provide new insights on the underlying immune response 
to bacterial infection and identify novel target genes for the prevention and 
control of disease in turbot."
1062,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic rhinitis (CR) and rhinosinusitis are prevalent conditions 
affecting people all over the world. Their exact relationship is still not fully 
understood. We sought to find out, whether CR is a risk factor for chronic 
rhinosinusitis (CRS) and which main subgroup or other factors could be 
predisposing.
METHODS: Patients with diagnosed CR between 2005 and 2010 were selected from the 
electronic medical record and were contacted by phone call. They were 
interviewed and screened for possible CRS using internationally approved 
questionnaires, e.g. NOSE-D and SNOT-20-GAV. Those with elevated scores were 
invited for a clinical examination.
RESULTS: Of 113 patients available for statistical analysis (48/65 = f/m), mean 
age of 52 ± 15 years, 13 patients were diagnosed with CRS. Extrapolated for the 
total cohort of 334, calculated prevalence was 9.5%. No statistical 
significantly higher probability of developing CRS for either main subgroup of 
CR was found. Age of onset, prior surgery of the nose, and use of topical nasal 
treatments were associated with the development of CRS in multivariate analyses 
(OR = 0.1, 3.2, and 3.2, respectively).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Only a small number of rhinitis patients developed CRS, 
questioning the paradigm of CR being a clear risk factor for CRS."
1063,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) have 
long prodromal phases without dementia. However, the patterns of cerebral 
network alteration in this early stage of the disease remain to be clarified.
METHOD: Participants were 48 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due 
to AD (MCI-AD), 18 patients with MCI with DLB (MCI with Lewy bodies: MCI-LB), 
and 23 healthy controls who underwent a 1.5-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging 
scan. Cerebral networks were extracted from individual T1-weighted images based 
on the intracortical similarity, and we estimated the differences of network 
metrics among the three diagnostic groups.
RESULTS: Whole-brain analyses for degree, betweenness centrality, and clustering 
coefficient images were performed using SPM8 software. The patients with MCI-LB 
showed significant reduction of degree in right putamen, compared with healthy 
subjects. The MCI-AD patients showed significant lower degree in left insula and 
bilateral posterior cingulate cortices compared with healthy subjects. There 
were no significant differences in small-world properties and in regional gray 
matter volume among the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We found the change of degree in the patients with MCI-AD and with 
MCI-LB, compared with healthy controls. These findings were consistent with the 
past single-photon emission computed tomography studies focusing on AD and DLB. 
The disease-related difference in the cerebral neural network might provide an 
adjunct biomarker for the early detection of AD and DLB."
1064,"PURPOSE: To explore the risk factors and construct nomogram models to predict 
the risks of clinically significant intraocular lens (IOL) tilt and decentration 
after cataract surgery in age-related cataract patients.
SETTING: Zhongshan ophthalmic center, Guangzhou, China.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
METHODS: A total of 207 patients (207 eyes) who underwent phacoemulsification 
combined with IOL implantation were enrolled in the study. Casia2 was used to 
measure the tilt and decentration of crystalline lens and IOL before and 3 
months after surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were used to determine the risk factors of clinically significant IOL tilt and 
decentration, and nomogram prediction models were constructed according to the 
results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-four eyes (11.59%) and 16 eyes (7.73%) had clinically 
significant IOL tilt and decentration at 3 months after cataract surgery. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that preoperative crystalline 
lens tilt and decentration were the risk factors for clinically significant IOL 
tilt (OR=3.519, P<0.001) and decentration (OR=410.22, P=0.001), respectively. 
Axial length was another association factor for clinically significant IOL 
decentration (OR=2.155, P=0.019). The risk models demonstrated good calibrations 
and discriminations for the predictions of clinically significant IOL tilt (ROC 
area=0.833, cut-off value=6.5) and decentration (ROC area=0.757, cut-off 
value=0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: The good performances of our models suggested that they may be 
useful risk-prediction tools for postoperative IOL tilt and decentration. The 
measurement of preoperative crystalline lens tilt and decentration should be one 
of the routine examinations before cataract surgery, especially for toric and 
multifocal IOLs."
1065,"BACKGROUND: The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) Department of Health (DOH) 
conducted a second Zika health brigade (ZHB) in 2021 to provide recommended 
Zika-related pediatric health screenings, including vision, hearing, neurologic, 
and developmental screenings, for children in the USVI. This was replicated 
after the success of the first ZHB in 2018, which provided recommended 
Zika-related pediatric health screenings to 88 infants and children exposed to 
Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy.
METHODS: Ten specialty pediatric care providers were recruited and traveled to 
the USVI to conduct the screenings. USVI DOH scheduled appointments for children 
included in CDC's U.S. Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry (USZPIR). During the 
ZHB, participants were examined by pediatric ophthalmologists, pediatric 
audiologists, and pediatric neurologists. We report the percentage of 
participants who were referred for additional follow-up care or given follow-up 
recommendations in the 2021 ZHB and compare these referrals and recommendations 
to those given in the 2018 ZHB.
RESULTS: Thirty-three children born to mothers with laboratory evidence of ZIKV 
infection during pregnancy completed screenings at the 2021 ZHB, of which 15 
(45%) children were referred for additional follow-up care. Ophthalmological 
screenings resulted in the highest number of new referrals for a specialty 
provider among ZHB participants, with 6 (18%) children receiving referrals for 
that specialty. Speech therapy was the most common therapy referral, with 10 
(30%) children referred, of which 9 (90%) were among those who attended the 2018 
ZHB.
CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-three children in a jurisdiction with reduced access to 
healthcare specialists received recommended Zika-related pediatric health 
screenings at the ZHB. New and continuing medical and developmental concerns 
were identified and appropriate referrals for follow-up care and services were 
provided. The ZHB model was successful in creating connections to health 
services not previously received by the participants."
1066,"mRNA-based medicines are a promising modality for preventing virus-caused 
illnesses, including COVID-19, and treating various types of cancer and genetic 
diseases. To develop such medicines, methods to characterize long mRNA molecules 
are needed for quality control and metabolic analysis. Here, we developed an 
analytical platform based on isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS) that quantitatively characterizes long, modified mRNAs by 
comparing them to a stable isotope-labeled reference with an identical sequence 
to that of the target medicine. This platform also includes database searching 
using the mass spectra as a query, which allowed us to confirm the primary 
structures of 200 to 4300 nt mRNAs including chemical modifications, with 
sequence coverage at 100%, to detect/identify defects in the sequences, and to 
define the efficiencies of the 5'-capping and integrity of the polyadenylated 
tail. Our findings indicated that this platform should be valuable for 
quantitatively characterizing mRNA vaccines and other mRNA medicines."
1067,"Heavy metals (HM) are among the elements that are rare in nature and threaten 
human health, animals, and the environment. Fix sources including (power plants, 
industries, homes) and mobile sources include (cars and motorcycles) are the 
main sources production and emission of HM. It is important to understand the 
main information about sources of emission, chemical processes (reactions, 
oxidation, and leaching), and how they precipitate. The aim of this study was to 
evaluation an increased risk of leukemia due to exposure to HM. In this article 
narrative, the first literature search was performed with 580 articles according 
to different databases: Elsevier, PubMed, Web of science, Spring, and Google 
Scholar databases. 70 articles were included in the analysis process. Finally, 8 
full-text articles were selected in this research. The search was restricted to 
English-language papers published between 2000 and 2021. In final stage 
literature, there is a notable health effect (carcinogenic) because of exposure 
to heavy metals. According to the results of this research natural procedures 
and human activities (industrial processes, car exhaust, and cigarette smoke) 
are the most important of ways that heavy metals can enter the natural cycle. 
Air, food, soil, water, and groundwater are the main sources of heavy metals 
that can cause severe disorders in the human body. After entering the body 
through ingestion heavy metals produce stable bio-toxic compounds. These 
compounds by disrupting biological processes, interrupt the body's functions and 
cause various cancers in the human body. The results of this study can help to 
politicians for make comprehensive decisions to solve the problem and increase 
public awareness of the use of protective equipment."
1068,"Adequate mass and function of adipose tissues (ATs) play essential roles in 
preventing metabolic perturbations. The pathological reduction of ATs in 
lipodystrophy leads to an array of metabolic diseases. Understanding the 
underlying mechanisms may benefit the development of effective therapies. 
Several cellular processes, including autophagy and vesicle trafficking, 
function collectively to maintain AT homeostasis. Here, we investigated the 
impact of adipocyte-specific deletion of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) on AT homeostasis and systemic 
metabolism in mice. We report that PIK3C3 functions in all ATs and that its 
absence disturbs adipocyte autophagy and hinders adipocyte differentiation, 
survival, and function with differential effects on brown and white ATs. These 
abnormalities cause loss of white ATs, whitening followed by loss of brown ATs, 
and impaired ""browning"" of white ATs. Consequently, mice exhibit compromised 
thermogenic capacity and develop dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin 
resistance, and type 2 diabetes. While these effects of PIK3C3 largely contrast 
previous findings with the autophagy-related (ATG) protein ATG7 in adipocytes, 
mice with a combined deficiency in both factors reveal a dominant role of the 
PIK3C3-deficient phenotype. We have also found that dietary lipid excess 
exacerbates AT pathologies caused by PIK3C3 deficiency. Surprisingly, glucose 
tolerance is spared in adipocyte-specific PIK3C3-deficient mice, a phenotype 
that is more evident during dietary lipid excess. These findings reveal a 
crucial yet complex role for PIK3C3 in ATs, with potential therapeutic 
implications."
1069,"The limited efficacy of the current antitumor microenvironment strategies is due 
in part to the poor understanding of the roles and relative contributions of the 
various tumor stromal cells to tumor development. Here, we describe a versatile 
in vivo anthrax toxin protein delivery system allowing for the unambiguous 
genetic evaluation of individual tumor stromal elements in cancer. Our 
reengineered tumor-selective anthrax toxin exhibits potent antiproliferative 
activity by disrupting ERK signaling in sensitive cells. Since this activity 
requires the surface expression of the capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG2) 
toxin receptor, genetic manipulation of CMG2 expression using our 
cell-type-specific CMG2 transgenic mice allows us to specifically define the 
role of individual tumor stromal cell types in tumor development. Here, we 
established mice with CMG2 only expressed in tumor endothelial cells (ECs) and 
determined the specific contribution of tumor stromal ECs to the toxin's 
antitumor activity. Our results demonstrate that disruption of ERK signaling 
only within tumor ECs is sufficient to halt tumor growth. We discovered that 
c-Myc is a downstream effector of ERK signaling and that the MEK-ERK-c-Myc 
central metabolic axis in tumor ECs is essential for tumor progression. As such, 
disruption of ERK-c-Myc signaling in host-derived tumor ECs by our 
tumor-selective anthrax toxins explains their high efficacy in solid tumor 
therapy."
1070,"Kinesin motor proteins perform several essential cellular functions powered by 
the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis reaction. Several single-point 
mutations in the kinesin motor protein KIF5A have been implicated to hereditary 
spastic paraplegia disease (HSP), a lethal neurodegenerative disease in humans. 
In earlier studies, we have shown that a series of HSP-related mutations can 
impair the kinesin's long-distance displacement or processivity by modulating 
the order-disorder transition of the linker connecting the heads to the coiled 
coil. On the other hand, the reduction of kinesin's ATP hydrolysis reaction rate 
by a distal asparagine-to-serine mutation is also known to cause HSP disease. 
However, the molecular mechanism of the ATP hydrolysis reaction in kinesin by 
this distal mutation is still not fully understood. Using classical molecular 
dynamics simulations combined with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics 
calculations, the pre-organization geometry required for optimal hydrolysis in 
kinesin motor bound to α/β-tubulin is determined. This optimal geometry has only 
a single salt-bridge (of the possible two) between Arg203-Glu236, putting a 
reactive water molecule at a perfect position for hydrolysis. Such geometry is 
also needed to create the appropriate configuration for proton translocation 
during ATP hydrolysis. The distal asparagine-to-serine mutation is found to 
disrupt this optimal geometry. Therefore, the current study along with our 
previous one demonstrates how two different effects on kinesin dynamics 
(processivity and ATP hydrolysis), caused by a different set of genotypes, can 
give rise to the same phenotype leading to HSP disease."
1071,"Antibody heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) variable region exons are 
assembled by V(D)J recombination. V(D)J junctional regions encode 
complementarity-determining-region 3 (CDR3), an antigen-contact region immensely 
diversified through nontemplated nucleotide additions (""N-regions"") by terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). HIV-1 vaccine strategies seek to elicit 
human HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), such as the potent 
CD4-binding site VRC01-class bnAbs. Mice with primary B cells that express 
receptors (BCRs) representing bnAb precursors are used as vaccination models. 
VRC01-class bnAbs uniformly use human HC VH1-2 and commonly use human LCs Vκ3-20 
or Vκ1-33 associated with an exceptionally short 5-amino-acid (5-aa) CDR3. Prior 
VRC01-class models had nonphysiological precursor levels and/or limited 
precursor diversity. Here, we describe VRC01-class rearranging mice that 
generate more physiological primary VRC01-class BCR repertoires via 
rearrangement of VH1-2, as well as Vκ1-33 and/or Vκ3-20 in association with 
diverse CDR3s. Human-like TdT expression in mouse precursor B cells increased LC 
CDR3 length and diversity and also promoted the generation of shorter LC CDR3s 
via N-region suppression of dominant microhomology-mediated Vκ-to-Jκ joins. 
Priming immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer, which strongly engages VRC01 
precursors, induced robust VRC01-class germinal center B cell responses. 
Vκ3-20-based responses were enhanced by N-region addition, which generates 
Vκ3-20-to-Jκ junctional sequence combinations that encode VRC01-class 5-aa CDR3s 
with a critical E residue. VRC01-class-rearranging models should facilitate 
further evaluation of VRC01-class prime and boost immunogens. These new 
VRC01-class mouse models establish a prototype for the generation of 
vaccine-testing mouse models for other HIV-1 bnAb lineages that employ different 
HC or LC Vs."
1072,"Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV), made from glutaraldehyde-fixed xenografts, are 
widely used for surgical and transcatheter valve interventions but suffer from 
limited durability due to structural valve degeneration (SVD). We focused on 
metabolic syndrome (MetS), a risk factor for SVD and a highly prevalent 
phenotype in patients affected by valvular heart disease with a well-recognized 
cluster of comorbidities. Multicenter patient data (N = 251) revealed that 
patients with MetS were at significantly higher risk of accelerated SVD and 
required BHV replacement sooner. Using a next-generation proteomics approach, we 
identified significantly differential proteomes from leaflets of explanted BHV 
from MetS and non-MetS patients (N = 24). Given the significance of protein 
infiltration in MetS-induced SVD, we then demonstrated the protective effects of 
polyoxazoline modification of BHV leaflets to mitigate MetS-induced BHV 
biomaterial degeneration (calcification, tissue cross-linking, and 
microstructural changes) in an ex vivo serum model and an in vivo with MetS rat 
subcutaneous implants."
1073,"WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) is a core scaffolding component of many multiprotein 
complexes that perform a variety of critical chromatin-centric processes in the 
nucleus. WDR5 is a component of the mixed lineage leukemia MLL/SET complex and 
localizes MYC to chromatin at tumor-critical target genes. As a part of these 
complexes, WDR5 plays a role in sustaining oncogenesis in a variety of human 
cancers that are often associated with poor prognoses. Thus, WDR5 has been 
recognized as an attractive therapeutic target for treating both solid and 
hematological tumors. Previously, small-molecule inhibitors of the 
WDR5-interaction (WIN) site and WDR5 degraders have demonstrated robust in vitro 
cellular efficacy in cancer cell lines and established the therapeutic potential 
of WDR5. However, these agents have not demonstrated significant in vivo 
efficacy at pharmacologically relevant doses by oral administration in animal 
disease models. We have discovered WDR5 WIN-site inhibitors that feature 
bicyclic heteroaryl P7 units through structure-based design and address the 
limitations of our previous series of small-molecule inhibitors. Importantly, 
our lead compounds exhibit enhanced on-target potency, excellent oral 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, and potent dose-dependent in vivo efficacy in a 
mouse MV4:11 subcutaneous xenograft model by oral dosing. Furthermore, these 
in vivo probes show excellent tolerability under a repeated high-dose regimen in 
rodents to demonstrate the safety of the WDR5 WIN-site inhibition mechanism. 
Collectively, our results provide strong support for WDR5 WIN-site inhibitors to 
be utilized as potential anticancer therapeutics."
1074,"A growing body of work has addressed human adaptations to diverse environments 
using genomic data, but few studies have connected putatively selected alleles 
to phenotypes, much less among underrepresented populations such as Amerindians. 
Studies of natural selection and genotype-phenotype relationships in 
underrepresented populations hold potential to uncover previously undescribed 
loci underlying evolutionarily and biomedically relevant traits. Here, we worked 
with the Tsimane and the Moseten, two Amerindian populations inhabiting the 
Bolivian lowlands. We focused most intensively on the Tsimane, because long-term 
anthropological work with this group has shown that they have a high burden of 
both macro and microparasites, as well as minimal cardiometabolic disease or 
dementia. We therefore generated genome-wide genotype data for Tsimane 
individuals to study natural selection, and paired this with blood mRNA-seq as 
well as cardiometabolic and immune biomarker data generated from a larger sample 
that included both populations. In the Tsimane, we identified 21 regions that 
are candidates for selective sweeps, as well as 5 immune traits that show 
evidence for polygenic selection (e.g., C-reactive protein levels and the 
response to coronaviruses). Genes overlapping candidate regions were strongly 
enriched for known involvement in immune-related traits, such as abundance of 
lymphocytes and eosinophils. Importantly, we were also able to draw on extensive 
phenotype information for the Tsimane and Moseten and link five regions 
(containing PSD4, MUC21 and MUC22, TOX2, ANXA6, and ABCA1) with biomarkers of 
immune and metabolic function. Together, our work highlights the utility of 
pairing evolutionary analyses with anthropological and biomedical data to gain 
insight into the genetic basis of health-related traits."
1075,"T cells differentiate into highly diverse subsets and display plasticity 
depending on the environment. Although lymphocytes are key mediators of 
inflammation, functional specialization of T cells in inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) has not been effectively described. Here, we performed deep profiling of T 
cells in the intestinal mucosa of IBD and identified a CD4+ tissue-resident 
memory T cell (Trm) subset that is increased in Crohn's disease (CD) showing 
unique inflammatory properties. Functionally and transcriptionally distinct CD4+ 
Trm subsets are observed in the inflamed gut mucosa, among which a CD-specific 
CD4+ Trm subset, expressing CD161 and CCR5 along with CD103, displays previously 
unrecognized pleiotropic signatures of innate and effector activities. These 
inflammatory features are further enhanced by their spatial proximity to gut 
epithelial cells. Furthermore, the CD-specific CD4+ Trm subset is the most 
predominant producer of type 1 inflammatory cytokines upon various stimulations 
among all CD4+ T cells, suggesting that the accumulation of this T cell subset 
is a pathological hallmark of CD. Our results provide comprehensive insights 
into the pathogenesis of IBD, paving the way for decoding of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying this disease."
1076,"The cellular prion protein (PrPC) converts to alternatively folded pathogenic 
conformations (PrPSc) in prion infections and binds neurotoxic oligomers formed 
by amyloid-β α-synuclein, and tau. β-Endoproteolysis, which splits PrPC into N- 
and C-terminal fragments (N2 and C2, respectively), is of interest because a 
protease-resistant, C2-sized fragment (C2Sc) accumulates in the brain during 
prion infections, seemingly comprising the majority of PrPSc at disease endpoint 
in mice. However, candidates for the underlying proteolytic mechanism(s) remain 
unconfirmed in vivo. Here, a cell-based screen of protease inhibitors 
unexpectedly linked type II membrane proteins of the S9B serine peptidase 
subfamily to PrPC β-cleavage. Overexpression experiments in cells and assays 
with recombinant proteins confirmed that fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and 
its paralog, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), cleave directly at multiple sites 
within PrPC's N-terminal domain. For wild-type mouse and human PrPC substrates 
expressed in cells, the rank orders of activity were human FAP ~ mouse FAP > 
mouse DPP4 > human DPP4 and human FAP > mouse FAP > mouse DPP4 >> human DPP4, 
respectively. C2 levels relative to total PrPC were reduced in several tissues 
from FAP-null mice, and, while knockout of DPP4 lacked an analogous effect, the 
combined DPP4/FAP inhibitor linagliptin, but not the FAP-specific inhibitor 
SP-13786, reduced C2Sc and total PrPSc levels in two murine cell-based models of 
prion infections. Thus, the net activity of the S9B peptidases FAP and DPP4 and 
their cognate inhibitors/modulators affect the physiology and pathogenic 
potential of PrPC."
1077,"The pathological accumulation of the microtubule binding protein tau drives 
age-related neurodegeneration in a variety of disorders, collectively called 
tauopathies. In the most common tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), the 
accumulation of pathological tau strongly correlates with cognitive decline. The 
underlying molecular mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration in tauopathies 
remain incompletely understood and no effective disease modifying 
pharmacological interventions currently exist. Here, we show that tau toxicity 
depends on the highly conserved nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein SPOP 
in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of tauopathy. Loss of function mutations in 
the C. elegans spop-1 gene significantly improves behavioral deficits in tau 
transgenic animals, while neuronal overexpression of SPOP-1 protein 
significantly worsens behavioral deficits. In addition, loss of spop-1 rescues a 
variety of tau-related phenotypes including the accumulation of total and 
phosphorylated tau protein, neurodegeneration, and shortened lifespan. Knockdown 
of SPOP-1's E3 ubiquitin ligase cul-3/Cullin3 does not improve tauopathy 
suggesting a non-degradative mechanism of action for SPOP-1. Suppression of 
disease-related phenotypes occurs independently of the nuclear speckle resident 
poly(A)-binding protein SUT-2/MSUT2. MSUT2 modifies tauopathy in mammalian 
neurons and in AD. Our work identifies SPOP as a novel modifier of tauopathy and 
a conceptual pathway for therapeutic intervention."
1078,"Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease comprising multiple distinct subtypes 
with different genetic features and pathological characteristics. Although a 
large number of antineoplastic compounds have been approved for clinical use, 
patient-to-patient variability in drug response is frequently observed, 
highlighting the need for efficient treatment prediction for individualized 
therapy. Several patient-derived models have been established lately for the 
prediction of drug response. However, each of these models has its limitations 
that impede their clinical application. Here, we report that the whole-tumor 
cell culture (WTC) ex vivo model could be stably established from all breast 
tumors with a high success rate (98 out of 116), and it could reassemble the 
parental tumors with the endogenous microenvironment. We observed strong 
clinical associations and predictive values from the investigation of a broad 
range of BC therapies with WTCs derived from a patient cohort. The accuracy was 
further supported by the correlation between WTC-based test results and 
patients' clinical responses in a separate validation study, where the 
neoadjuvant treatment regimens of 15 BC patients were mimicked. Collectively, 
the WTC model allows us to accomplish personalized drug testing within 10 d, 
even for small-sized tumors, highlighting its potential for individualized BC 
therapy. Furthermore, coupled with genomic and transcriptomic analyses, 
WTC-based testing can also help to stratify specific patient groups for 
assignment into appropriate clinical trials, as well as validate potential 
biomarkers during drug development."
1079,"After natalizumab (NAT) cessation, some multiple sclerosis (MS) patients 
experience a severe disease rebound. The rebound pathophysiology is still 
unclear; however, it has been linked to interleukin-17-producing T-helper (Th17) 
cells. We demonstrate that during NAT treatment, MCAM+CCR6+Th17 cells gradually 
acquire a pathogenic profile, including proinflammatory cytokine production, 
pathogenic transcriptional signatures, brain endothelial barrier impairment, and 
oligodendrocyte damage via induction of apoptotic pathways. This is accompanied 
by an increase in Th17 cell frequencies in the cerebrospinal fluid of 
NAT-treated patients. Notably, Th17 cells derived from NAT-treated patients, who 
later developed a disease rebound upon treatment cessation, displayed a distinct 
transcriptional pathogenicity profile associated with altered migratory 
properties. Accordingly, increased brain infiltration of patient Th17 cells was 
illustrated in a humanized mouse model and brain histology from a rebound 
patient. Therefore, peripheral blood-accumulated MCAM+CCR6+Th17 cells might be 
involved in rebound pathophysiology, and monitoring of changes in Th17 cell 
pathogenicity in patients before/during NAT treatment cessation might enable 
rebound risk assessment in the future."
1080,"Obesity is a major risk factor for cancer. Conventional thought suggests that 
elevated adiposity predisposes to heightened inflammatory stress and potentiates 
tumor growth, yet underlying mechanisms remain ill-defined. Here, we show that 
tumors from patients with a body mass index >35 carry a high burden of senescent 
cells. In mouse syngeneic tumor models, we correlated a pronounced accretion of 
senescent cancer cells with poorly immunogenic tumors when mice were subjected 
to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Highly immunogenic tumors showed lesser 
senescence burden suggesting immune-mediated elimination of senescent cancer 
cells, likely targeted as a consequence of their senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype. Treatment with the senolytic BH3 mimetic small molecule inhibitor 
ABT-263 selectively stalled tumor growth in mice with DIO to rates comparable to 
regular diet-fed mice. Thus, consideration of body adiposity in the selection of 
cancer therapy may be a critical determinant for disease outcome in poorly 
immunogenic malignancies."
1081,"Mutations in GBA1, encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase), cause Gaucher disease 
(GD) and are also genetic risks in developing Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Currently, the approved therapies are only effective for directly treating 
visceral symptoms, but not for primary neuronopathic involvement in GD (nGD). 
Progranulin (PGRN), encoded by GRN, is a novel modifier of GCase, but the impact 
of PGRN in GBA1 mutation-associated pathologies in vivo remains unknown. Herein, 
Grn-/- mice crossed into Gba9v/9v mice, a Gba1 mutant line homozygous for the 
Gba1 D409V mutation, generating Grn-/-Gba9v/9v (PG9V) mice. PG9V mice exhibited 
neurobehavioral deficits, early onset, and more severe GD phenotypes compared to 
Grn-/- and Gba9v/9v mice. Moreover, PG9V mice also displayed PD-like phenotype. 
Mechanistic analysis revealed that PGRN deficiency caused severe 
neuroinflammation with microgliosis and astrogliosis, along with impaired 
autophagy associated with the Gba1 mutation. A PGRN-derived peptide, termed ND7, 
ameliorated the disease phenotype in GD patient fibroblasts ex vivo. 
Unexpectedly, ND7 penetrated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and effectively 
ameliorated the nGD manifestations and PD pathology in Gba9v/null and PG9V mice. 
Collectively, this study not only provides the first line of in vivo but also 
ex vivo evidence demonstrating the crucial role of PGRN in GBA1/Gba1 
mutation-related pathologies, as well as a clinically relevant mouse model for 
mechanistic and potential therapeutics studies for nGD and PD. Importantly, a 
BBB penetrant PGRN-derived biologic was developed that may provide treatment for 
rare lysosomal storage diseases and common neurodegenerative disorders, 
particularly nGD and PD."
1082,"Growing evidence suggests that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) likely increases 
the risks of dementia, yet little is known about the relative contributions of 
different constituents. Here, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort 
study (2000 to 2017) by integrating the Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse 
database and two independently sourced datasets of high-resolution PM2.5 major 
chemical composition, including black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), nitrate 
(NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), ammonium (NH4+), and soil dust (DUST). To investigate 
the impact of long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents on incident all-cause 
dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), hazard ratios for dementia and AD were 
estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, and penalized splines were used 
to evaluate potential nonlinear concentration-response (C-R) relationships. 
Results using two exposure datasets consistently indicated higher rates of 
incident dementia and AD for an increased exposure to PM2.5 and its major 
constituents. An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 mass was associated with 
a 6 to 7% increase in dementia incidence and a 9% increase in AD incidence. For 
different PM2.5 constituents, associations remained significant for BC, OM, 
SO42-, and NH4+ for both end points (even after adjustments of other 
constituents), among which BC and SO42- showed the strongest associations. All 
constituents had largely linear C-R relationships in the low exposure range, but 
most tailed off at higher exposure concentrations. Our findings suggest that 
long-term exposure to PM2.5 is significantly associated with higher rates of 
incident dementia and AD and that SO42-, BC, and OM related to traffic and 
fossil fuel combustion might drive the observed associations."
1083,"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, which are dimers of 
a glycosylated polymorphic transmembrane heavy chain and the small-protein 
β2-microglobulin (β2m), bind peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum that are 
generated by the cytosolic turnover of cellular proteins. In virus-infected 
cells, these peptides may include those derived from viral proteins. 
Peptide-MHC-I complexes then traffic through the secretory pathway and are 
displayed at the cell surface where those containing viral peptides can be 
detected by CD8+ T lymphocytes that kill infected cells. Many viruses enhance 
their in vivo survival by encoding genes that down-regulate MHC-I expression to 
avoid CD8+ T cell recognition. Here, we report that two accessory proteins 
encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 
down-regulate MHC-I expression using distinct mechanisms. First, ORF3a, a 
viroporin, reduces the global trafficking of proteins, including MHC-I, through 
the secretory pathway. The second, ORF7a, interacts specifically with the MHC-I 
heavy chain, acting as a molecular mimic of β2m to inhibit its association. This 
slows the exit of properly assembled MHC-I molecules from the endoplasmic 
reticulum. We demonstrate that ORF7a reduces antigen presentation by the human 
MHC-I allele HLA-A*02:01. Thus, both ORF3a and ORF7a act post-translationally in 
the secretory pathway to lower surface MHC-I expression, with ORF7a exhibiting a 
specific mechanism that allows immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2."
1084,"Oral delivery of siRNA provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that 
require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal and systemic 
barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of 
siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which 
hurdles the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small-sized, 
fluorinated nanocapsules (F-NCs) were developed to mediate efficient oral 
delivery of TNF-α siRNA for anti-inflammation treatment. The NCs possessed a 
disulfide-cross-linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the 
gastrointestinal tract. Because of their small size (∼30 nm) and 
fluorocarbon-assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best-performing F3 -NCs 
showed excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without 
impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 
20.4% in relative to i.v. injection. The disulfide cross-linker could be cleaved 
inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate 
the TNF-α silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic 
inflammation, orally delivered F3 -NCs provoked efficient TNF-α silencing and 
pronounced anti-inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a 
transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and would render promising 
utilities for anti-inflammation treatment. This article is protected by

1085,"Calcium overload is one of the early determinants of the core cellular events 
that contribute to the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI), which include 
oxidative stress, ATP depletion, calcium overload, and inflammatory response 
with self-amplifying and interactive feedback loops that ultimately lead to 
cellular injury and renal failure. Excluding adjuvant therapy, there are 
currently no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AKI. Using an 
adipic dihydride linker, we modified the hyaluronic acid polymer chain with a 
potent antioxidant, bilirubin, to produce an amphiphilic conjugate. 
Subsequently, we developed a kidney-targeted and reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)-responsive drug delivery system based on the flash nanocomplexation method 
to deliver a well-known intracellular calcium chelator, 
1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester 
(BAPTA-AM, BA), with the goal of rescuing renal cell damage via rapidly 
scavenging of intracellularly overloaded Ca2+. In the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) 
induced AKI rat model, a single dose of as-prepared formulation (BA 100 μg·kg-1) 
6 h post-reperfusion significantly reduced renal function indicators by more 
than 60% within 12 h, significantly alleviated tissular pathological changes, 
ameliorated tissular oxidative damage, significantly inhibited apoptosis of 
renal tubular cells and the expression of renal tubular marker kidney injury 
molecule 1, etc., thus greatly reducing the risk of kidney failure. 
Mechanistically, the treatment with BA-loaded NPs significantly inhibited the 
activation of the ER stress cascade response (IRE1-TRAF2-JNK, ATF4-CHOP, and 
ATF6 axis) and regulated the downstream apoptosis-related pathway while also 
reducing the inflammatory response. The BA-loaded NPs hold great promise as a 
potential therapy for I/R injury-related diseases."
1086,"Adoptively transferred virus-specific T-cells (VSTs) have shown remarkable 
safety and efficacy for the treatment of virus-associated diseases and 
malignancies in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, for whom 
VSTs are derived from the HSCT donor (DD-VSTs). Autologous VSTs have also shown 
promise for the treatment of virus-driven malignancies outside the HSCT setting. 
In both cases VSTs are manufactured as patient-specific products and the time 
required for procurement, manufacture, and release testing precludes their use 
in acutely ill patients. Further, good manufacturing practices (GMP)-compliant 
products are expensive, and failures are common in virus naive HSCT donors and 
in patient-derived VSTs rendered anergic by immunosuppressive tumors. Hence, 
highly characterized, banked VSTs (B-VSTs) that can be used for multiple 
unrelated recipients are highly desirable. The major challenges facing B-VSTs 
result from the inevitable mismatches in the highly polymorphic and immunogenic 
human leukocyte antigens (HLA) that presents internally processed antigens to 
the T-cell receptor leading to the requirement for partial HLA matching between 
B-VST and recipient. HLA mismatches lead to rapid rejection of allogenic T-cell 
products, and graft versus host disease induced by alloreactive T-cells in the 
infusion product. Here we summarize clinical outcomes to date of trials of 
B-VSTs used for the treatment of viral infections and malignancies, and their 
potential as a platform for chimeric antigen receptors targeting non-viral 
tumors. We will highlight the properties of VSTs that make them attractive 
off-the-shelf cell therapies, as well as the challenges that must be overcome 
before they can become mainstream."
1087,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of a multicomponent training (MT) physical 
exercise intervention in the cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and 
quality of life of older adults with major neurocognitive disorder (NCD).
METHODS: Quasi-experimental controlled trial. Thirty-six individuals (25 female) 
were equally distributed to an exercise group (aged 74.33 ± 5.87 years) or a 
control group (aged 81.83 ± 6.18 years). The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the 
Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) tests were performed before and 
after the intervention.
RESULTS: There was no clear interaction effect factor of intervention on 
ADAS-Cog (B = 1.33, 95% CI: -2.61 - 5.28, P = .513), NPI (B = -8.35, 95% CI: 
-18.48 - 1.72, P = .115), and QoL-AD (B = 2.87, 95% CI: .01 - 5.73, P = .058).
CONCLUSIONS: The 6-month MT physical exercise intervention did not present 
evidence of slowing down cognitive decline neither improving neuropsychiatric 
symptomatology, and quality of life of older adults with major NCD. Future 
studies with larger samples are needed to better understand the impact of 
physical exercise interventions using MT methodology on specific cognitive 
abilities, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life domains."
1088,"Cortical morphology changes with ageing and age-related neurodegenerative 
diseases. Previous studies suggest that the age effect is more pronounced in the 
frontal lobe. However, our knowledge of structural complexity changes in male 
and female brains is still limited. We measured cortical ribbon complexity 
through fractal dimension (FD) analysis at the hemisphere and lobe level in 7010 
individuals from the UK Biobank imaging cohort to study age-related sex 
differences (3332 males, age ranged 45-79 years). FD decreases significantly 
with age and sexual dimorphism exists. With correction for brain size, females 
showed higher complexity in the left hemisphere and left and right parietal 
lobes whereas males showed higher complexity in the right temporal and left and 
right occipital lobes. A nonlinear age effect was observed in the left and right 
frontal, and right temporal lobes. Differential patterns of age effects were 
observed in both sexes with relatively more age-affected regions in males. 
Significantly higher rightward asymmetries at hemisphere, frontal, parietal, and 
occipital lobe level and higher leftward asymmetry in temporal lobe were 
observed. There was no age-by-sex-by asymmetry interaction in any region. When 
controlling for brain size, the leftward hemispheric, and temporal lobe 
asymmetry decreased with age. Males had significantly lower asymmetry between 
hemispheres and higher asymmetry in the parietal and occipital lobes than 
females. This work provides distinct patterns of age-related sex and asymmetry 
differences that can aid in the future development of sex-specific models of the 
normal brain to ascribe cognitive functional significance of these patterns in 
ageing."
1089,"BACKGROUND: Ruxolitinib cream demonstrated safety and efficacy over 8 weeks in 
two double-blind phase 3 atopic dermatitis studies (NCT03745638/NCT03745651).
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate long-term safety (LTS) and disease control with ruxolitinib 
cream.
METHODS: Patients initially randomized to twice-daily 0.75%/1.5% ruxolitinib 
cream maintained their regimen during the 44-week LTS period (as-needed 
treatment). Patients on vehicle were rerandomized (1:1) at Week 8 to either 
ruxolitinib cream strength. Safety and disease control (Investigator's Global 
Assessment [IGA] score 0/1 and affected body surface area [BSA]) were assessed.
RESULTS: Over 52 weeks, adverse events (AEs) were reported in 
67.4%/62.6%/53.5%/57.6% of patients in 0.75%/1.5% ruxolitinib cream/vehicle to 
0.75% ruxolitinib cream/vehicle to 1.5% ruxolitinib cream groups 
(n=426/446/101/99). Most common AEs were upper respiratory tract infection 
(10.3%/11.4%/5.9%/7.1%) and nasopharyngitis (8.9%/9.9%/7.9%/14.1%). Most AEs 
were considered unrelated to treatment. Application site reactions were 
infrequent (3.8%/1.8%/1.0%/1.0%). Disease control was achieved throughout the 
LTS; 74.1%-77.8% of patients had IGA 0/1 at Week 52, and mean affected BSA was 
low (1.4%-1.8%).
LIMITATIONS: LTS had no control treatment.
CONCLUSION: During 44 weeks of as-needed treatment, ruxolitinib cream 
demonstrated effective disease control and tolerability; low ruxolitinib plasma 
concentrations alongside safety findings reflecting known risk factors suggest 
physiologically meaningful systemic Janus kinase inhibition is highly unlikely."
1090,"PURPOSE: The segmentation of retinal layers and fluid lesions on retinal optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) images is an important component of screening and 
diagnosing retinopathy in clinical ophthalmic treatment. We designed a novel 
network for accurate segmentation of the seven tissue layers of the retina and 
lesion areas of diabetic macular edema (DME), which can assist doctors to 
quantitatively analyze the disease.
METHODS: In this article, we propose the Retinal Layer Macular Edema Network 
(RLMENet) model to achieve end-to-end joint segmentation of retinal layers and 
fluids. The network employs dense multiscale attention to enhance the extraction 
of retinal layer and fluid detail information and achieve efficient long-range 
modeling, which improves the receptive field and obtains multiscale features. As 
the more complex decoder part is designed, which integrates more low-level 
feature information on the decoder side, more features are extracted to 
gradually restore the resolution of the feature map and improve the segmentation 
accuracy.
RESULTS: We used part of the OCT2017 dataset to train and verify the model to 
divide the data into a training set, validation set, and test set and set it to 
a 7:2:1 ratio. We evaluated our method on the ISIC2017 dataset. Experimental 
results showed that the RLMENet model designed in this work can accurately 
segment seven retinal tissue layers and DME lesions on the retinal OCT dataset. 
Finally, the MIoU value in the test set reached 86.55%. The model can be 
extended to other medical image segmentation datasets to achieve better 
segmentation performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method was superior to the existing segmentation 
methods, achieved a more refined segmentation effect and provided an auxiliary 
analysis tool for clinical diagnosis and treatment. This article is protected by

1091,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, phosphorylated-tau181 
(p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light 
(NfL) are putative blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
head-to-head cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons of the aforementioned 
biomarkers across the AD continuum are lacking.
METHODS: Plasma Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were measured utilizing 
the Single Molecule Array (Simoa) platform and compared cross-sectionally across 
the AD continuum, wherein Aβ-PET (positron emission tomography)-negative 
cognitively unimpaired (CU Aβ-, n = 81) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI Aβ-, 
n = 26) participants were compared with Aβ-PET-positive participants across the 
AD continuum (CU Aβ+, n = 39; MCI Aβ+, n = 33; AD Aβ+, n = 46) from the 
Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) 
cohort. Longitudinal plasma biomarker changes were also assessed in MCI (n = 27) 
and AD (n = 29) participants compared with CU (n = 120) participants. In 
addition, associations between baseline plasma biomarker levels and prospective 
cognitive decline and Aβ-PET load were assessed over a 7 to 10-year duration.
RESULTS: Lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and elevated p-tau181 and GFAP were 
observed in CU Aβ+, MCI Aβ+, and AD Aβ+, whereas elevated plasma NfL was 
observed in MCI Aβ+ and AD Aβ+, compared with CU Aβ- and MCI Aβ-. Among the 
aforementioned plasma biomarkers, for models with and without AD risk factors 
(age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status), p-tau181 performed 
equivalent to or better than other biomarkers in predicting a brain Aβ-/+ status 
across the AD continuum. However, for models with and without the AD risk 
factors, a biomarker panel of Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP performed 
equivalent to or better than any of the biomarkers alone in predicting brain 
Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum. Longitudinally, plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, 
p-tau181, and GFAP were altered in MCI compared with CU, and plasma GFAP and NfL 
were altered in AD compared with CU. In addition, lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and 
higher p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were associated with prospective cognitive 
decline and lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, and higher p-tau181 and GFAP were 
associated with increased Aβ-PET load prospectively.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that plasma biomarkers are altered 
cross-sectionally and longitudinally, along the AD continuum, and are 
prospectively associated with cognitive decline and brain Aβ-PET load. In 
addition, although p-tau181 performed equivalent to or better than other 
biomarkers in predicting an Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum, a panel of 
biomarkers may have superior Aβ-/+ status predictive capability across the AD 
continuum.
HIGHLIGHTS:  Area under the curve (AUC) of p-tau181 ≥ AUC of Aβ42/40, GFAP, NfL 
in predicting PET Aβ-/+ status (Aβ-/+).  AUC of Aβ42/40+p-tau181+GFAP panel ≥ 
AUC of Aβ42/40/p-tau181/GFAP/NfL for Aβ-/+.  Longitudinally, Aβ42/40, p-tau181, 
and GFAP were altered in MCI versus CU.  Longitudinally, GFAP and NfL were 
altered in AD versus CU.  Aβ42/40, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL are associated with 
prospective cognitive decline.  Aβ42/40, p-tau181, and GFAP are associated with 
increased PET Aβ load prospectively."
1092,"Acute canine monocytic ehrlichiosis due to Ehrlichia canis (aCME), and primary 
immune thrombocytopenia (pITP) are major differentials for dogs presented with 
thrombocytopenia, and the two diseases may clinically overlap. The aim of this 
study was to compare dogs diagnosed with naturally occurring aCME and pITP, to 
establish potentially useful clinical and clinicopathologic discriminators. A 
clinical record-based retrospective study was performed in 35 dogs diagnosed 
with aCME and 29 dogs with pITP. Dogs with aCME were significantly younger, and 
were more likely to experience depression or lethargy, anorexia, body weight 
loss, fever, lymphadenomegaly, tick infestation and ocular discharge on 
admission, compared to dogs with pITP. In contrast, dogs with pITP presented 
more frequently with overt bleeding and had a significantly higher bleeding 
score compared to dogs with aCME. Dogs with aCME were more likely to be anemic 
and hypoalbuminemic on presentation compared to dogs with pITP. Dogs with pITP 
had higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts as well as lower platelet 
counts than dogs with aCME and were more likely to present with leukocytosis, 
neutrophilia and monocytosis. These clinical, hematological, and biochemical 
findings may be helpful discriminators between aCME and pITP, on the 
understanding that they will be interpreted in the context of disease-specific 
testing."
1093,"BACKGROUND: The disaccharide galactose-α-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) is expressed 
in mammals other than humans, apes, and old-world monkeys. In humans, elevated 
immunoglobulin-E (IgE) antibodies specific for alpha-gal can result in allergic 
hypersensitivity known as alpha-gal syndrome (AGS). Case reports and series 
suggest that tick bites can induce alpha-gal specific IgE antibodies.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate tick exposure as a risk factor for AGS and elevated 
alpha-gal specific IgE (sIgE).
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study comparing AGS patients from a North 
Carolina allergy clinic with controls who were patients at a nearby internal 
medicine clinic. Cases and controls were administered a questionnaire to obtain 
information about demographics, home environment, outdoor activities, and 
recollection of tick bite. Serum samples taken at the time of enrollment were 
tested for total IgE, alpha-gal sIgE, and antibodies to other tickborne 
pathogens.
RESULTS: AGS patients were more likely to recall finding a tick on themselves 
(OR=11.20, 95% CI 4.97-25.15), live near wooded forest (OR=2.27, 95% CI 
0.92-5.55), and spend 17 or more hours per week outdoors in wooded areas 
(OR=5.58, 95% CI 2.56-12.19). AGS patients were also more likely to report 4 or 
more tick bites (OR=33.05, 95% CI 9.92-155.12) and reactions at the site of tick 
bites (OR=7.93, 95% CI 3.74-16.80). Elevated alpha-gal sIgE was also observed in 
33% of controls and was also associated with tick exposure in the controls 
(OR=4.25, 95% CI 2.21-8.18).
CONCLUSION: The results define tick bite as a risk factor for AGS and elevated 
alpha-gal sIgE."
1094,"BACKGROUND: Several studies report incidence of psychiatric symptoms and 
disorders among patients who recovered from COVID-19; however, little is known 
about the emotional impact of acute COVID-19 illness and recovery on these 
survivors. Qualitative methods are ideal for understanding the psychological 
impact of a novel illness.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the emotional experience of acute COVID-19 illness and 
recovery in patients who contracted the virus during the early months of the 
pandemic.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews conducted by consultation-liaison (C-L) 
psychiatrists were used to elicit participant responses about the emotional 
impact of the acute and recovery phases of COVID-19 illness. Participants 
recruited from the Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia area were 
interviewed and audio recorded between June 2020 and December 2020. The research 
team extracted qualitative themes from the recordings using the principles of 
thematic analysis.
RESULTS: One hundred and one COVID-19 survivors (54 women; mean [SD] age, 50 
[14.7] years) were interviewed a mean of 5.16 months after their acute illness, 
and their responses were audio recorded. Most participants were White (77%), 
non-Hispanic/Latino (86.1%), and not hospitalized for COVID-19 (87.1%). Coders 
identified 26 themes from participant responses. The most frequently coded 
themes included Anxiety/Worry (49), Uncertainty (37), Supportfrom Others (35), 
Alone/Isolation (32), Positive Reframe/Positive Emotions (32).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Survivors who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the early 
months of the pandemic described both negative and positive valence emotions. 
They experienced emotional distress and psychosocial stressors associated with 
acute illness and recovery but also drew upon personal resiliency to cope. This 
report highlights the utility of qualitative research methods in identifying 
emotional responses to a novel illness that may otherwise go unnoted. C-L 
psychiatrists may be uniquely positioned to work in collaboration with medical 
colleagues in developing a multidimensional approach to evaluating an emerging 
illness."
1095,"OBJECTIVE: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be a risk factor for the 
development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). No data are available in 
spondyloarthritis (SpA). The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
frequency of traumatic events and PTSD in patients with SpA and its different 
phenotypes, and to compare the results to patients with non inflammatory 
rheumatic disease and RA patients.
METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional, bi-centric study. 
Participants were patients diagnosed with SpA, non-inflammatory rheumatic or 
autoimmune disease (controls), or RA. Traumatic events were identified by the 
Brief Trauma Questionnaire (BTQ). PTSD was defined as the presence of a 
traumatic event and ≥4 symptoms on the Short PTSD Checklist Scale.
RESULTS: Among 1389 participants, 510 patients were diagnosed with SpA (167 
ankylosing spondylitis, 140 psoriatic arthritis, 130 non-radiographic-axial SpA, 
and 51 peripheral SpA), 365 with non-inflammatory rheumatic disease and 514 
patients with RA. The frequency of trauma in SPA patients was 33.7%, of which 
30.5% in AS, 30.7% in PsA, 37.7% in nr-axSpA, and 41.2% in peripheral SpA 
(P=NS). The prevalence of PTSD in SPA patients was 4.9%, (of which 3.6% in AS, 
2.9% in PsA, 6.2% in nr-axSpA, and 7.8% in peripheral SpA (P=NS)) and was not 
significantly different from the controls (after IPTW 4.8% vs 6.7%). The 
frequency of trauma and PTSD was also comparable between RA and controls, and 
between SPA and RA.
CONCLUSION: Traumatic events and PTSD occurring prior to diagnosis is as rare in 
SpA as in non-inflammatory rheumatic diseases and RA."
1096,"OBJECTIVES: Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) is a subset of 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), divided into two subtypes according to the 
presence of rheumatoid factor : pJIA without rheumatoid factor (pJIA RF-) and 
pJIA with positive rheumatoid factor (pJIA RF+), this latter is characterised 
with more structural damage. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) are 
often associated with RF. The respective performance of ACPA versus RF in 
structural outcome in pJIA, and in particular in adulthood pJIA remains unknown. 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether ACPA could be of value 
to assess structural damage in pJIA persisting in adulthood.
METHODS: Patients with pJIA and available data for ACPA, RF and X-ray were 
included retrospectively. Structural damage was assessed by two independent 
blinded investigators using Sharp Van Der Heijde scores.
RESULTS: 56 pJIA adult patients were included : 62% (35/56) had pJIA RF+ and 38% 
(21/56) pJIA RF-. ACPA positivity in pJIA was significantly associated with 
presence of RF (96% vs 26%, p<0.001 ). RF positivity was significantly 
associated with higher Sharp van Der Heijde erosion and total scores 
(respectively p< 0.01 and p< 0.05 ). There were higher Sharp Van Der Heijde 
erosion, joint space narrowing and total scores in the pJIA ACPA+ subgroup than 
in the pJIA ACPA- subgroup, although there was no statistical significance. 
However, when adjusted on disease duration, pJIA ACPA+ patients had 
significantly higher erosion and total scores than pJIA ACPA- patients (p<0.05), 
and pJIA ACPA+ patients required more bDMARDs than pJIA ACPA- patients (p<0.05). 
Moreover, pJIA patients with high Sharp van Der Heijde joint space narrowing and 
total scores had significantly higher ACPA levels (p<0.01). A correlation was 
identified between ACPA levels and Sharp van Der Heijde total score ( r=0.54, 
p<0.05). In the pJIA RF+ subgroup the presence of ACPA was associated with 
additional structural damage compared to no ACPA: sharp Van Der Heijde erosion, 
joint space narrowing and total scores were higher in the pJIA RF+ ACPA+ 
subgroup than in the pJIA RF+ ACPA- subgroup although these results did not 
reach significance.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pJIA RF+ ACPA+ adult patients may have a 
more severe articular phenotype than pJIA RF+ ACPA- patients. ACPA could bring 
an additional value to RF for pJIA patients regarding structural damage. 
Altogether our results show that RF and ACPA are associated with structural 
damage measured by Sharp Van Der Heijde score in pJIA persisting in adulthood."
1097,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence in support of a short-term association 
between ambient temperature and cardiac arrest attacks that is a serious 
manifestation of cardiovascular disease and has a high incidence and low 
survival rate. However, it remains unrecognized about the hazardous temperature 
exposure types, exposure risk magnitude, and vulnerable populations.
OBJECTIVES: We comprehensively summarize prior epidemiological studies looking 
at the short-term associations of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with 
various temperature exposures among different populations.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases from inception to 
October 2021 for eligible English language. Temperature exposure was categorized 
into three types: heat (included high temperature, extreme heat, and heatwave), 
cold (included low temperature and extreme cold), and temperature variation 
(included diurnal temperature range and temperature change between two adjacent 
days). Meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance was used to pool effect 
estimates.
RESULTS: This study included 15 studies from 8 countries, totaling around 1 
million OHCA events. Extreme heat and extreme cold were significantly associated 
with an increased risk of OHCA, and the pooled relative risks (RRs) were 1.071 
[95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.019-1.126] and 1.662 (95%CI: 1.138-2.427), 
respectively. The risk of OHCA was also elevated by heatwaves (RR = 1.248, 
95%CI: 1.091-1.427) and more intensive heatwaves had a greater effect. Notably, 
the elderly and males seemed to be more vulnerable to the effects of heat and 
cold. However, we did not observe a significant association between temperature 
variation and the risk of OHCA (1.005, 95%CI: 0.999-1.012).
CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to heat and cold may be novel risk factors for 
OHCA. Considering available studies in limited regions, the temperature effect 
on OHCA should be urgently confirmed in different regions."
1098,"Recently, the contamination of fungi in water has aroused widespread concern, 
which will pose a threat to water quality and safety, and raise diseases risk in 
the immunocompromised individuals. In this review, the characteristics and 
different physiological state of fungi in water are summarized. A comprehensive 
evaluation of the control efficiency and mechanism of waterborne fungi by the 
commonly used disinfection methods is provided as well. During the disinfection 
processes of chlorine (Cl2), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), chloramine (NH2Cl) and 
advanced disinfection processes (ADPs) such as O3-based ADPs and UV-based ADPs, 
the fungal spores firstly lost their culturability, followed by membrane 
integrity, and the intracellular ROS level increased at the same time, 
eventually the fungal spores were completely inactivated. The security 
strategies of drinking water against the contamination of fungi are also 
discussed in terms of water sources, water treatment plants and pipe network. 
Finally, future researches need to be explored are proposed: the rapid detection 
methods, the production laws and control of mycotoxin, and the outbreak 
conditions of fungi in water. Specifically, exploring efficient, safe and 
economical technologies, especially ADPs, is still the main direction in the 
disinfection of fungi in future studies. This review can offer a comprehensive 
understanding on the occurrence and control of fungi in water to fill the 
knowledge gap and provide guidance for the future research."
1099,"Racemates in the environment can lead to inaccurate risk assessment. To obtain 
the enantiomeric level information of benzovindiflupyr for accurate risk 
assessment, the absolute configuration of benzovindiflupyr was first confirmed, 
and the enantioseparation method was developed by supercritical fluid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The enantioselectivity for bioactivity 
and toxicity was investigated, and the mechanism was explored by molecular 
docking and detecting succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity and content of 
succinate acid. 1S,4R-(-)-benzovindiflupyr was identified as the most active 
against the six targeted phytopathogens, which showed higher 1.7-54.5 times than 
1R,4S-(+)-benzovindiflupyr. Additionally, 1S,4R-(-)-benzovindiflupyr (LD50: 
21.54 μg L-1) was 103.7 times more toxic than 1R,4S-(+)-benzovindiflupyr against 
Daphnia magna. 1S,4R-(-)-benzovindiflupyr had a stronger affinity for SDH and 
significantly inhibited SDH activity, resulting in an increase in succinate acid 
in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, while its downstream products, fumaric and 
L-malic acid were significantly reduced. Moreover, the dissipation behavior of 
benzovindiflupyr on three vegetables was evaluated. 1S,4R-(-)-benzovindiflupyr 
was preferentially degraded in tomato, but opposite in leaves. The 
enantioselectivity in pepper and cucumber leaves was the same as in tomato, 
while there was no enantioselectivity in pepper and cucumber. The study provides 
a basis for accurate risk assessment and the development of high-effective and 
low-risk fungicides."
1100,"Perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate are common thyroid disruptors in daily 
life and alter testosterone levels in animals. However, little is known about 
the effects of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate on serum total testosterone 
(TT) in the general population. The study was designed to assess the 
associations between urinary levels of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate and 
serum total testosterone (TT) in the general population. The present study 
utilized data from the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutritional Examination 
Survey (NHANES). A total of 6201 participants aged 6-79 with information on 
urinary perchlorate, nitrate, thiocyanate, and serum total testosterone were 
included. We conducted multiple linear regression models and Bayesian Kernel 
Machine Regression (BKMR) models to estimate the associations by sex-age groups. 
Children (ages 6-11) have higher levels of perchlorate and nitrate than the 
rest. After adjusting for covariates, urinary perchlorate was significantly 
negatively associated with serum TT in male adolescents (β = -0.1, 95 % 
confidence interval: -0.2, -0.01) and female children [-0.13, (-0.21, -0.05)]. 
Urinary nitrate was significantly negatively associated with serum TT in female 
children, while urinary thiocyanate was significantly positively associated with 
serum TT in female adults aged 20 to 49 [0.05 (0.02, 0.08)]. BKMR analysis 
indicated that no other interactions were found between urinary perchlorate, 
nitrate, and thiocyanate. Our findings suggested that urinary perchlorate, 
nitrate, and thiocyanate levels may relate to serum total testosterone levels in 
specific sex-age groups. We identified male adolescents and female children as 
are most sensitive subgroups where testosterone is susceptible to interference."
1101,"The early sign detection of liver lesions plays an extremely important role in 
preventing, diagnosing, and treating liver diseases. In fact, radiologists 
mainly consider Hounsfield Units to locate liver lesions. However, most studies 
focus on the analysis of unenhanced computed tomography images without 
considering an attenuation difference between Hounsfield Units before and after 
contrast injection. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to develop an 
improved method for the automatic detection and classification of common liver 
lesions based on deep learning techniques and the variations of the Hounsfield 
Units density on computed tomography scans. We design and implement a 
multi-phase classification model developed on the Faster Region-based 
Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional 
Networks (R-FCN), and Single Shot Detector Networks (SSD) with the transfer 
learning approach. The model considers the variations of the Hounsfield Unit 
density on computed tomography scans in four phases before and after contrast 
injection (plain, arterial, venous, and delay). The experiments are conducted on 
three common types of liver lesions including liver cysts, hemangiomas, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Experimental results show that the proposed method 
accurately locates and classifies common liver lesions. The liver lesions 
detection with Hounsfield Units gives high accuracy of 100%. Meanwhile, the 
lesion classification achieves an accuracy of 95.1%. The promising results show 
the applicability of the proposed method for automatic liver lesions detection 
and classification. The proposed method improves the accuracy of liver lesions 
detection and classification compared with some preceding methods. It is useful 
for practical systems to assist doctors in the diagnosis of liver lesions. In 
our further research, an improvement can be made with big data analysis to build 
real-time processing systems and we expand this study to detect lesions from all 
parts of the human body, not just the liver."
1102,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of dual task (DT) training on DT gait 
performance and cognitive function in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
and to examine factors that might influence the effects of DT training.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Wiley Online Library, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and 
Medline were searched for articles published from January 2006 to December 2021.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials comparing DT training with usual 
care or general exercise were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: The outcomes studied were DT gait parameters including speed, 
step and stride length, cadence, step and stride time variability, dual task 
cost on gait speed, and Trail Making Tests (TMT) presented as standardized mean 
differences. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Ten randomized controlled trials with 466 participants were 
included in the meta-analysis. The included studies presented, in general, with 
a low to high risk of bias. Meta-analyses used a random-effects model for all 
analysis. The meta-analysis showed the DT training effects on DT gait speed 
(SMD=0.825, p=0.012), DT step and stride length (SMD=0.400, p=0.015), TMT-A 
(SMD=0.533, p=0.010) and TMT-B (SMD=0.516, p=0.012) compared to the control 
group. Only the effect on TMT-A was maintained at the follow-up assessment. The 
results of meta-regression showed that participants with slower initial single 
task gait speed improved more after DT training on DT step and stride length.
CONCLUSIONS: The DT training improved more in DT gait speed with 
moderate-quality evidence as compared with usual care or conventional physical 
training in individuals with PD. The beneficial effects of DT training on DT 
step and stride length, attention and executive function were also demonstrated 
in this meta-analysis. Furthermore, the improvement in the DT walking step and 
stride length was related to the participant's initial single task gait speed."
1103,"Vitiligo has been reported to be associated with a variety of diseases, but it 
has not been systematically reviewed. Therefore, we aimed to identify prevalent 
diseases in patients with vitiligo and quantify their associations compared with 
healthy controls. A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE from the 
inception to June, 2022 was conducted. Observational studies on prevalent 
diseases in vitiligo patients compared to healthy controls were included, 
whereas studies limited to pediatrics or providing only laboratory results were 
excluded. A total of 78 studies were eligible for analyses. Patients with 
vitiligo showed higher risks of having comorbid autoimmune and connective tissue 
diseases, including alopecia areata (odds ratio [OR], 2.63; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 2.50-2.78), discoid lupus erythematosus (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 
1.74-3.72), Sjogren's syndrome (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.98-3.16), myasthenia gravis 
(OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.74-3.02), systemic lupus erythematosus (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 
1.52-2.52), and rheumatoid arthritis (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.55-2.15). Thyroid 
diseases, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, sensorineural hypoacusis and 
ophthalmic abnormalities were also more prevalent in patients with vitiligo. In 
conclusion, vitiligo is associated with various systemic diseases. Physicians 
should evaluate and manage potential comorbid conditions in patients with 
vitiligo."
1104,"BACKGROUND: Given the importance in prevention of lower extremity amputations 
(LEA) associated with diabetes or peripheral artery disease (PAD), we sought to 
document the trends of primary LEA in Quebec, Canada, from years 2006 to 2019.
METHODS: Using the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System, we 
calculated crude and age-standardized annual incidence rates of primary LEA 
associated with diabetes and/or PAD among adults ≥40 years (99% confidence 
intervals [CI]), and all-cause 1-year mortality proportion trends following a 
primary LEA (95% CI), stratified by minor or major as the highest level of LEA 
during the same hospital stay and age groups. Trends were asssessed using 
multivariate regression models.
RESULTS: In 2019, the crude rate of primary LEA was 116.0 per 100,000 (n=825) 
with 93.7 and 21.9 per 100,000 of minor (n=665) and major (n=160) LEA, 
respectively. A tendency of decrease by 8% (-15.0 to 0.4%) of age-standardized 
incidence of primary LEA was observed between 2006 and 2019, while minor LEA 
increased by 14.2% (3.7 to 25.9%) and major LEA decreased by 49.5% (-57.1 to 
-40.5%). Incidence trends remained stable among the 40-64 years, and declined by 
14.6% and 20.1% for the 65-79 and ≥80 years, respectively. Major LEA decreased 
in all age groups, while minor LEA increased by 26.2% among the 40-64 years 
only. Age-standardized 1-year mortality decreased by 35.1% (95% CI: -43.4 to 
-25.7%) between 2006 and 2019, with a crude 1-year mortality of 11.3% in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of major LEA and 1-year mortality are encouraging 
while increased minor LEA, especially in younger age groups, emphasizes the 
importance to further improve preventive care."
1105,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common form of pediatric cancer 
affecting the lymphoblast, a type of white blood cell found in the bone marrow. 
In this disease, the normal lymphoblast cells transform into leukemic cells and 
subsequently enter the bloodstream. Leukemic cells found in patients with ALL 
have shown differences in cholesterol uptake and utilization. Current treatment 
consists of chemotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, and 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In addition, minimal residual 
disease (MRD) has become an effective tool in measuring treatment efficacy and 
the potential for relapse. Chemotherapy resistance remains a significant barrier 
in the treatment of ALL. Biomarkers such as an upregulated Akt signaling pathway 
and an overexpressed VLA-4 integrin-protein have been associated with drug 
resistance. Nanoparticles have been used to favorably alter the pharmacokinetic 
profile of conventional drug agents. These drug-delivery systems are designed to 
selectively deliver their drug payloads to desired targets. Therefore, 
nanoparticles offer advantages such as improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. 
This review highlights conventional treatment options, distinctive 
characteristics of pediatric ALL, therapeutic challenges encountered during 
therapy, and the key role that nanotherapeutics play in the treatment of ALL."
1106,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the percentage and correlates of giving and receiving 
cigarettes as gifts among adult non-smokers in China.
METHODS: We analyzed non-smokers (N=1,813) aged ≥18 years using data from the 
International Tobacco Control China Wave 5 Survey. Descriptive statistics 
summarized the characteristics of those who gave and received cigarettes as 
gifts. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors 
associated with the two behaviors.
RESULTS: Among non-smokers, 9.9% reported giving cigarettes as gifts to family 
or friends in the last 6 months. Higher level of knowledge about smoking harms 
was associated with lower adjusted odds of gifting cigarettes. Non-smokers aged 
25-39, with middle income, positive attitude toward cigarette gifts, exposure to 
anti-smoking information and smoking promotion, and those who reported receiving 
cigarettes as gifts from family or friends were more likely to give cigarettes 
as gifts. 6.6% of non-smokers reported receiving cigarettes as gifts in the last 
6 months. High education, neutral or positive attitude toward cigarette gifts, 
exposure to anti-smoking information, exposure to smoking promotion, and having 
smoking friends were associated with receiving cigarettes as gifts.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concerning that Chinese cultural norms that support cigarette 
gifting have extended to giving non-smokers cigarettes as gifts. Effective 
anti-smoking messages are needed. Changing the norms around cigarette gifting 
and increasing knowledge about smoking harms should help reduce cigarette 
gifting among non-smokers.
IMPLICATIONS: Easy access to cigarettes received as gifts, along with the wide 
acceptance of smoking in China, places Chinese non-smokers in a risky position. 
More educational campaigns targeting non-smokers to proactively prevent them 
from smoking are called for.The ineffectiveness of existing anti-smoking 
information highlights the need for more effective anti-smoking messages.That 
attitude toward cigarette gifts is the strongest predictor of giving cigarettes 
as gifts suggests a need for interventions to reverse the positive attitude 
about cigarette gifting in order to decrease the popularity of this activity."
1107,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Communication is fundamental for dementia care. The 
Trouble Source Repair framework (TSR) can identify strategies that facilitate or 
impede communication in dyadic interactions.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A secondary analysis of videos (N=221) from a 
clinical trial of a family caregiver telehealth intervention were analyzed using 
sequential behavioral coding of communication behaviors and breakdowns for 53 
caregiver and person with dementia dyads. Coded data from 3,642 30-second 
observations were analyzed using penalized regression for feature selection 
followed by Bayesian mixed-effects modeling to identify communication strategies 
associated with communication breakdown and repair.
RESULTS: Breakdown (coded as 0) was associated with caregivers changing topic 
(Mdn= -11.45, 95% CrI [-24.34, -4.37]), ignoring (Mdn=-11.49, 95% CrI [-24.49, 
-4.72]), giving commands (Mdn=-10.74, 95% CrI [-24.22, -3.38]), and taking over 
the task (Mdn=-4.06, 95% CrI [-7.28, -1.77]). Successful repair of breakdown was 
associated with verbalizing understanding (Mdn=0.46, 95% CrI [0.09, 0.86]), tag 
questions, (Mdn=2.4, 95% CrI [0.33, 5.35), and silence (Mdn=0.78, 95% Crl [0.42, 
1.15) and negatively associated with ignoring and changing topic (Mdn=-3.63, 95% 
Crl [-4.81, -2.57] and -2.51 [-3.78, -1.33], respectively).
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The TSR was effective in identifying specific 
communication strategies to avoid (changing topic, ignoring, commands, taking 
over the task) and to use to repair breakdown (verbalize understanding, tag 
questions, silence). Future research is needed test these strategies and explore 
potential effects of dementia stage, diagnosis, and dyad characteristics in 
additional samples. Behavioral coding provides evidence of communication best 
practices as a basis for family caregiver communication training."
1108,"Cancer is one of the most serious malignant diseases, and chemotherapy is 
cancer's main clinical treatment method. However, chemotherapy inevitably 
produces drug resistance, and side effects accompany them. Adjuvant therapy is 
an effective way to enhance chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity and reduce side 
effects. This study found allicin, garlic's active ingredient, is an inhibitor 
of transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A), a novel drug target of lung 
adenocarcinoma. Allicin concentration-dependently inhibited TMEM16A currents 
with an IC50 of 24.35 ± 4.14 μM. Allicin thiosulfinate moieties bound with 
R535A/E624A/E633A residues of TMEM16A blocked the ion transport function and 
downregulated TMEM16A protein expression affecting the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase signal transduction. Then, allicin reduced the viability and migration of 
LA795 cells, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, multitarget combination 
administration results indicated that the therapeutic effect of 3.56 mg/kg 
allicin and 3 mg/kg cisplatin combined administration was superior to the 
superposition of the two drugs alone, demonstrating that the anticancer effects 
of allicin and cisplatin were synergistic. In addition, low-concentration 
combined administration also avoided the side effects of cisplatin in mice. 
Based on the good tumor suppressor effect and high biosafety of allicin and 
cisplatin combination in vivo, allicin can be used for food adjuvant therapy of 
cisplatin chemotherapy."
1109,"OBJECTIVES: Ketamine has a fast-onset that may offer a paradigm change for 
depression at end-of-life. We aimed to synthesize evidence regarding the safety 
and/or efficacy of ketamine in depression treatment within a broad palliative 
care concept.
METHODS: We searched seven databases and included studies on the safety and 
efficacy of ketamine for depression treatment in patients diagnosed with any 
life-threatening disease; further, we conducted a narrative review of the 
evidence.
RESULTS: Among 2,252 screened titles and abstracts, we included 32 studies in 
our final synthesis. Specifically, we included 14 case reports, 2 case series, 2 
quasi-experimental studies, and 7 randomized clinical trials, as well as data 
from three unpublished clinical trials and seven cases from four larger case 
series. Most case reports reported a robust effect; however, the larger studies 
reported conflicting findings. Five randomized clinical trials reported positive 
outcomes; however, four of them were focused on a perioperative setting. 
Further, two negative studies did not primarily focus on depression and did not 
apply severity cutoffs.
CONCLUSIONS: Although ketamine is generally safe and potentially useful, its 
efficacy in palliative care settings remains unclear. It may be a reasonable 
alternative for perioperative depression in oncological patients."
1110,"Age-dependent formation of insoluble protein aggregates is a hallmark of many 
neurodegenerative diseases. We are interested in the cell chemistry that drives 
the aggregation of polyQ-expanded mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) protein into 
insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs). Using an inducible cell model of Huntington's 
disease, we show that a transient cold shock (CS) at 4 °C followed by recovery 
incubation at temperatures of 25-37 °C strongly and rapidly induces the 
compaction of diffuse polyQ-expanded HuntingtinExon1-enhanced green fluorescent 
protein chimera protein (mHtt) into round, micron size, cytosolic IBs. This 
transient CS-induced mHtt IB formation is independent of microtubule integrity 
or de novo protein synthesis. The addition of millimolar concentrations of 
sodium chloride accelerates, whereas urea suppresses this transient CS-induced 
mHtt IB formation. These results suggest that the low temperature of CS 
constrains the conformation dynamics of the intrinsically disordered mHtt into 
labile intermediate structures to facilitate de-solvation and hydrophobic 
interaction for IB formation at the higher recovery temperature. This work, 
along with our previous observation of the effects of heat shock protein 
chaperones and osmolytes in driving mHtt IB formation, underscores the primacy 
of mHtt structuring and rigidification for H-bond-mediated cross-linking in a 
two-step mechanism of mHtt IB formation in living cells."
1111,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are environmentally persistent 
endocrine-disrupting chemicals associated with long-term health outcomes. PFAS 
are transferred from maternal blood to human milk, an important exposure source 
for infants, and understanding of this transfer is evolving. We characterized 
concentrations of 10 PFAS in human milk (n = 426) and compared milk-to-plasma 
concentrations of 9 PFAS among a subset of women with paired samples (n = 294) 
from the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study using liquid chromatography-isotope 
dilution tandem mass spectrometry. We examined the relationship between 
perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in plasma versus 
milk and fit linear regression models to assess relationships between milk PFOA 
and PFOS and participant characteristics. The median plasma PFOA concentration 
was 0.94 ng/mL (interquartile range, IQR, 0.59-1.34) and that of PFOS was 2.60 
ng/mL (IQR 1.80-3.90); the median milk PFOA concentration was 0.017 ng/mL (IQR 
0.012-0.027) and that of PFOS was 0.024 ng/mL (IQR 0.016-0.036). PFOA and PFOS 
plasma and milk concentrations showed correlations of ρ = 0.83 and 0.77, 
respectively (p < 0.001). Parity, previous lactation, week of milk collection, 
and body mass index were inversely associated with milk PFAS. We estimate that 
even among our general population cohort, some infants (∼6.5%) are exposed to 
amounts of PFAS via milk that may have long-term health impacts."
1112,"Taxus wallichiana Zucc. is a high valued medicinal plant and has been mainly 
studied for its anti-cancer properties. However, research on its other important 
biological activities, such as its antimicrobial potential, still needs 
attention. The focus of the present study is to investigate the antimicrobial 
activity of secondary metabolites of T. wallichiana needles against 3 different 
groups of microorganisms, i. e., bacteria, actinobacteria, and fungi. Bioactive 
compounds from T. wallichiana needles were separated through column 
chromatography, and, TLC-bioautography. Mobile phases were optimized using 
Snyder's selectivity triangle. Antimicrobial spots were fractionated and 
compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Functional groups were 
characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to identify the molecular structures. GC/MS 
and LC/MS data analysis confirm the presence of fatty acids (arachidic acid, 
behenic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid), vitamins (nicotinamide), and 
alkaloids (cinchonine, timolol), aminobenzamides (procainamide), carbocyclic 
sugar (myoinositol), and alkane hydrocarbon (hexadecane), having antimicrobial 
activity in the needles of T. wallichiana. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first report on the isolation and characterization of antimicrobial 
compounds from the needles of Taxus wallichiana (Himalayan yew). The data 
obtained from the present study will be supportive to the new drug discoveries 
in modern medicine with various combinations of medicinal plant's active 
constituents that can be used for curing many diseases."
1113,"The aggregation of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide is one of the molecular hallmarks 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although Aβ deposits have mostly been observed 
extracellularly, various studies have also reported the presence of 
intracellular Aβ assemblies. Because these intracellular Aβ aggregates might 
play a role in the onset and progression of AD, it is important to investigate 
their possible origins at different locations of the cell along the secretory 
pathway of the amyloid precursor protein, from which Aβ is derived by 
proteolytic cleavage. Senile plaques found in AD are largely composed of the 
42-residue form of Aβ (Aβ42). Intracellularly, Aβ42 is produced in the 
endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Since lipid bilayers have been 
shown to promote the aggregation of Aβ, in this study, we measure the effects of 
the lipid membrane composition on the in vitro aggregation kinetics of Aβ42. By 
using large unilamellar vesicles to model cellular membranes at different 
locations, including the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane, late 
endosomes, the ER, and the Golgi apparatus, we show that Aβ42 aggregation is 
inhibited by the ER and Golgi model membranes. These results provide a 
preliminary map of the possible effects of the membrane composition in different 
cellular locations on Aβ aggregation and suggest the presence of an evolutionary 
optimization of the lipid composition to prevent the intracellular aggregation 
of Aβ."
1114,"Proteases are an important class of drug targets that continue to drive 
inhibitor discovery. These enzymes are prone to resistance mutations, yet their 
promise for treating viral diseases and other disorders continues to grow. This 
study develops a general approach for detecting microbially synthesized protease 
inhibitors and uses it to screen terpenoid pathways for inhibitory compounds. 
The detection scheme relies on a bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) system that links 
protease inactivation to the transcription of a swappable reporter gene. This 
system, which can accomodate multiple biochemical outputs (i.e., luminescence 
and antibiotic resistance), permitted the facile incorporation of four 
disease-relevant proteases. A B2H designed to detect the inactivation of the 
main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 enabled the 
identification of a terpenoid inhibitor of modest potency. An analysis of 
multiple pathways that make this terpenoid, however, suggested that its 
production was necessary but not sufficient to confer a survival advantage in 
growth-coupled assays. This finding highlights an important challenge associated 
with the use of genetic selection to search for inhibitors─notably, the 
influence of pathway toxicity─and underlines the value of including multiple 
pathways with overlapping product profiles in pathway screens. This study 
provides a detailed experimental framework for using microbes to screen 
libraries of biosynthetic pathways for targeted protease inhibitors."
1115,"Cell cycle progression plays a vital role in regulating proliferation, 
metabolism, and apoptosis. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have emerged as 
an important class of in vitro disease models, and incorporating the variation 
occurring from cell cycle progression in these systems is critical. Here, we 
report the use of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging to 
identify subtle biochemical changes within cells, indicative of the G1/S and 
G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Following previous studies, we first synchronized 
samples from two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, confirmed their states by flow 
cytometry and DNA quantification, and recorded spectra. We determined two 
critical wavenumbers (1059 and 1219 cm-1) as spectral indicators of the cell 
cycle for a set of isogenic breast cancer cell lines (MCF10AT series). These two 
simple spectral markers were then applied to distinguish cell cycle stages in a 
3D cell culture model using four cell lines that represent the main stages of 
cancer progression from normal cells to metastatic disease. Temporal dependence 
of spectral biomarkers during acini maturation validated the hypothesis that the 
cells are more proliferative in the early stages of acini development; later 
stages of the culture showed stability in the overall composition but unique 
spatial differences in cells in the two phases. Altogether, this study presents 
a computational and quantitative approach for cell phase analysis in tissue-like 
3D structures without any biomarker staining and provides a means to 
characterize the impact of the cell cycle on 3D biological systems and disease 
diagnostic studies using IR imaging."
1116,"The role of cytosolic stress granules in the integrated stress response has 
remained largely enigmatic. Here, we studied the functionality of the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in cells that were unable to form stress 
granules. Surprisingly, the inability of cells to form cytosolic stress granules 
had primarily a negative impact on the functionality of the nuclear UPS. While 
defective ribosome products (DRiPs) accumulated at stress granules in thermally 
stressed control cells, they localized to nucleoli in stress granule-deficient 
cells. The nuclear localization of DRiPs was accompanied by redistribution and 
enhanced degradation of SUMOylated proteins. Depletion of the SUMO-targeted 
ubiquitin ligase RNF4, which targets SUMOylated misfolded proteins for 
proteasomal degradation, largely restored the functionality of the UPS in the 
nuclear compartment in stress granule-deficient cells. Stress granule-deficient 
cells showed an increase in the formation of mutant ataxin-1 nuclear inclusions 
when exposed to thermal stress. Our data reveal that stress granules play an 
important role in the sequestration of cytosolic misfolded proteins, thereby 
preventing these proteins from accumulating in the nucleus, where they would 
otherwise infringe nuclear proteostasis."
1117,"Advances in genomic diagnostics hold promise for improved care of rare 
hematologic diseases. Here we describe a novel targeted therapeutic approach for 
Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia, an autosomal recessive disease characterized 
by severe normocytic anemia and bone abnormalities due to loss-of-function 
mutations in Thromboxane A Synthase 1 (TBXAS1). TBXAS1 metabolizes prostaglandin 
(PG)H2, the cyclooxygenase (COX) product of arachidonic acid, into thromboxane 
A2. Loss-of-function in TBXAS results in an increase in PGH2 availability for 
other PG synthases. Current treatment for Ghosal syndrome consists of 
corticosteroids. We hypothesized that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), which inhibit COX-1 and COX-2, could ameliorate the effects of TBXAS1 
loss and improve hematologic function by reducing prostaglandin formation. We 
treated two patients with Ghosal syndrome, one adult and one pediatric, with 
standard doses of NSAIDs (aspirin or ibuprofen). Both patients had rapid 
improvement of hematologic parameters and inflammatory markers without adverse 
events. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that urinary PG metabolites were 
increased along with proinflammatory lipoxygenase (LOX) products 
5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene E4. Our data show that NSAIDs at 
standard doses surprisingly reduced both COX and LOX products, leading to the 
resolution of cytopenias, and should be considered for first-line treatment for 
Ghosal syndrome."
1118,"CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells have demonstrated efficacy in graft-versus-host 
disease (GvHD) prevention and treatment. Preclinical and clinical studies 
indicate that Treg are able to protect from GvHD without interfering with the 
graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), 
although the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. To elucidate 
Treg suppressive function during in vivo suppression of acute GvHD, we performed 
paired T cell receptor (TCRa, TCRb genes) repertoire sequencing and RNA 
sequencing analysis on conventional T cells (Tcon) and Treg before and after 
transplantation in an MHC major-mismatch mouse model of HCT. We show that both 
Treg and Tcon underwent clonal restriction and that Treg did not interfere with 
the activation of alloreactive Tcon clones and the breadth of their TCR 
repertoire, however, markedly suppressed their expansion. Transcriptomic 
analysis revealed that Treg predominantly affected the transcriptome of CD4 Tcon 
and to a lesser extent of CD8 Tcon, modulating the transcription of genes 
encoding pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules as well as enzymes involved in 
metabolic processes, inducing a switch from glycolysis to oxidative 
phosphorylation. Finally, Treg did not interfere with the induction of gene sets 
involved in the GvT effect. Our results shed light into the mechanisms of acute 
GvHD suppression by Treg and will support the clinical translation of this 
immunoregulatory approach."
1119,"Disorders of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are known to influence the 
incidence and mortality of various diseases. It remains largely unknown whether 
and how the UPS affects the onset and progression of acute graft-versus host 
disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(allo-HSCT). The present study demonstrated that the deubiquitinase OTUD1 is an 
essential regulator of aGVHD. Activation of CD4+ T cells after allo-HSCT 
elevated the protein levels of OTUD1, which in turn interacted with the 
Notch2-ICD (NICD) to cleave the ubiquitin of NICD at the K1770 site, thereby 
inducing NICD protein accumulations in T cells. OTUD1-driven NICD signaling 
promoted the differentiation and functions of Th1 and Th17 cells and amplified 
the cascade of aGVHD. Moreover, by screening a FDA-approved drugs library the 
study identified dapagliflozin as an inhibitor targeting the OTUD1/NICD axis. 
Dapagliflozin administration significantly prolonged the survival of aGVHD mice. 
The present study characterized a previously unknown role of OTUD1 in T 
cell-mediated allogeneic responses and provided a promising therapeutic strategy 
to target OTUD1 for the alleviation of aGVHD."
1120,"The Neck Imaging Reporting and Data System (NI-RADS) is a guide developed and 
introduced in 2017 by head and neck radiologists who worked in an academic 
radiology department. Based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, the 
initial goals of NI-RADS were to make posttreatment head and neck cancer imaging 
dictations more succinct and efficient, guide treating physicians in the next 
appropriate steps when recurrence was suspected, and encourage institutional and 
national research. NI-RADS is more than a dictation template, and it is best 
instituted after a head and neck imaging practice is established. We support the 
use of NI-RADS once a radiologist understands the nuances of head and neck 
cancer, including the biology, common subsites involved, essentials of tumor 
staging, common posttreatment benign imaging appearances, and subtleties of 
recurrent disease."
1121,"BACKGROUND: Gold standard management of stage III colon cancer includes surgical 
resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite improved overall survival with 
adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer, it is reportedly underused in 
older adults. To date, no contemporary national analysis of adjuvant 
chemotherapy use and its impact in older adults with stage III colon cancer 
exists.
OBJECTIVE: To assess current use of adjuvant chemotherapy in older adults with 
stage III colon cancer and determine factors associated with noncompliance.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTINGS: Conducted using the National Cancer Database.
PATIENTS: Patients 65 years and older undergoing curative resection for stage 
III colon adenocarcinomas from 2010-2017.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adjuvant chemotherapy use, factors associated with 
adjuvant chemotherapy use, and overall survival with and without adjuvant 
chemotherapy in older adults with pathologic stage III disease.
RESULTS: Of 64,608 patients included, 64.3% received adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly independently associated with improved 
1-, 3-and 5-year overall survival versus no adjuvant chemotherapy (92.8%, 75.3%, 
62.4% vs. 70.8%, 46.6%, 32.7%; respectively, HR 0.475, 95% CI 0.459-0.492, p < 
0.001). Compared with the no adjuvant chemotherapy cohort, patients who received 
adjuvant chemotherapy were younger, female, and less co-morbid (p < 0.001). 
Factors associated with adjuvant chemotherapy noncompliance included advancing 
age (OR 0.857, 95% CI 0.854-0.861), lower annual income (OR 0.891, 95% CI 
0.844-0.940), open approach (0.730, 95% CI 0.633-0.842), longer length of stay 
(OR 0.949, 95% CI 0.949-0.954), pathologic stage IIIA (0.547, 95% CI 
0.458-0.652), and <12.
LIMITATIONS: Administrative data source with inherent risks of bias, coding 
errors, and limitations in the fields available for analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival but 
was only used in 64.3% of older adults with stage III colon cancer. Adjuvant 
chemotherapy noncompliance was seen in the most vulnerable and highest risk 
patients, including those with greater co-morbidity, lower income, and patients 
who received open surgery. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/C125."
1122,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term 
postpartum tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) therapy in hepatitis B virus 
(HBV)-infected mothers with high viral load.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, HBV-infected mothers with HBV 
DNA>2 × 10 5  IU/mL who initiated TDF prophylaxis treatment during pregnancy 
were divided into TDF continuation and discontinuation groups according to 
whether they stopped TDF treatment within 3 months after birth or not. 
Virological and biochemical markers were collected before TDF treatment, 
antepartum and postpartum.
RESULTS: In 131 women followed for a median of 18 months postpartum, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) abnormality rate was significantly lower in TDF 
continuation group vs. discontinuation group (39.4% vs. 56.9%, P  = 0.045), and 
continuous TDF therapy in postpartum was independently associated with lower 
risk of ALT flares [OR = 0.308, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.128-0.742; P 
 = 0.009]. Long-term postpartum TDF treatment can promote the decline of 
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) levels, 
but the HBeAg seroconversion rate in two groups was not significant (15.5% vs. 
11.7%, P  = 0.541). There were no statistical differences in bone metabolism 
markers between two groups ( P  > 0.05). Compared with the TDF discontinuation 
group, TDF continuation group had a significantly lower estimated glomerular 
filtration rate level and higher creatinine level in postpartum but within 
normal ranges ( P  < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: For pregnant women who received prophylactic TDF treatment, 
long-term TDF therapy continued in postpartum can reduce the risk of ALT flares 
and promote the rapid decline of HBeAg and HBsAg levels."
1123,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cardiovascular complications of liver cirrhosis include 
high cardiac output heart failure with reduced afterload and diastolic 
dysfunction. Heart Failure Association Pre-test assessment, Echocardiography and 
natriuretic peptide, Functional testing, Final etiology (HFA-PEFF) (values 0-6) 
is a diagnostic tool for heart failure. It is a cluster of echocardiographic and 
biochemical parameters. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess if 
HFA-PEFF score is associated with the severity of liver disease and to determine 
its prognostic significance in patients with cirrhosis.
METHODS: Patients with cirrhosis without an acute event were enrolled. A 
comprehensive echocardiography study was conducted, brain natriuretic peptide 
and N-terminal-pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide levels were measured and HFA-PEFF 
score was calculated. All patients were prospectively followed up after 
enrollment. The study end-point was defined as the composite of all-cause death.
RESULTS: Seventy-two consecutive patients [median age 59 years (inter-quartile 
range: 52-65), 72.2% males, Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) 12.9 
(8.5-16.3)] were included. The 52.8% had a high HFA-PEFF score (5 or 6) and the 
47.2% intermediate/low score (0-4). HFA-PEFF score was correlated with MELD 
score (rho = 0.566, P  < 0.001), but not with age, SBP and heart rate. The 
median follow-up was 24.2 (9.5-38.8) months. The 1- and 2-year cumulative 
mortality was higher in patients with high HFA-PEFF compared to those with 
intermediate/low (log-rank P  < 0.001 for both). The predicted 2-year 
probability of survival in high vs intermediate/low HFA-PEFF was found to be a 
prognostic factor of death even when adjusted for age, gender and MELD score 
[hazard ratio = 3.539 (1.134-11.046), P  = 0.029].
CONCLUSION: HFA-PEFF score is high among patients with liver cirrhosis, 
especially those with advanced liver disease. HFA-PEFF score is associated with 
survival even when adjusting for cirrhosis severity."
1124,"BACKGROUND: Serrate d polyps (SP) is associated with an increased risk of 
colorectal cancer. Patients with SP history tend to have SP recurrence. However, 
the risk factors for metachronous polyps (MP) in those patients are not well 
established.
METHODS: Data of colonoscopy were retrospectively reviewed from October 2012 to 
October 2021. The pathology database, electronic medical records and telephone 
follow-up data were also observed.
RESULTS: A total of 906 patients were studied including 278 patients with MPs 
and 628 patients without. The multiplicity of polyps (OR, 13.63; 95% CI, 
8.80-21.75), older age (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.87-20.63), abdominal obesity (OR, 
2.46; 95% CI, 0.98-6.42), current smoker (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.15-7.83) and 
sedentary lifestyle (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22-1.65) are significantly associated 
with the risk of MPs. Patients with baseline SP < 10 mm were more likely to 
develop higher or same risk-grade polyps (HSRGP) ( P  = 0.0014). Patients with 
non-clinically significant SPs whether coexisted with adenoma or not were more 
likely to develop HSRGPs when compared to others ( P  < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Total number of polyps, older age, sedentary behavior, abdominal 
obesity and smoking status contributed to the risk of MPs at surveillance 
colonoscopy. Patients with grade 1 SPs might require closer surveillance. SPs 
coexisting with conventional adenoma did not increase the risk of MPs but may 
increase the risk of developing HSRGPs."
1125,"OBJECTIVE: The first choice of treatment for rectal neuroendocrine tumors 
(R-NETs) 10 mm in size is endoscopic resection, there is still controversy 
concerning the optimal endoscopic treatment for resecting R-NETs. This study 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple ligation-assisted endoscopic 
submucosal resection combined with endoscopic ultrasonography (EMR-MLUS) for 
R-NETs.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 62 patients with R-NETs ≤10 mm 
in size who underwent EMR-MLUS or ligation-assisted endoscopic submucosal 
resection combined with endoscopic ultrasonography (EMR-LUS) between May 2019 
and April 2022, including tumor characteristics, endoscopic complete resection, 
pathological complete resection, the procedure time, adverse events, and 
follow-up were compared between the two groups of patients.
RESULTS: Of the 62 patients, 19 underwent EMR-MLUS and 43 underwent EMR-LUS. The 
endoscopic morphology of lesions was statistically different between group 
EMR-MLUS and group EMR-LUS ( P = 0.015), and most of them were flat and slightly 
raised lesions in group EMR-MLUS. Although the pathological complete resection 
rate was slightly higher in the EMR-MLUS group than in the EMR-LUS group (94.74% 
vs. 90.70%; P = 0.290), the endoscopic complete resection rate was high in both 
groups. Involvement of the lateral resection margin was found four cases in the 
ESMR-LUS group; one case of deep resection margin involvement in the EMR-MLUS 
group. The mean procedure time was longer in the EMR-MLUS group than in the 
EMR-LUS group (12.79 ± 1.01 min vs. 11.08 ± 1.89 min; P = 0.041). In group 
EMR-LUS, there were two cases of immediate bleeding; in group EMR-MLUS, one case 
of perforation, all of them were successfully treated by endoscopy. No 
recurrence, progression, or metastasis was found in all patients.
CONCLUSION: EMR-MLUS is a safe and effective technique that could be considered 
when removing small rectal NETs, especially flat and slightly raised lesions."
1126,"OBJECTIVES: Data are lacking on the immunogenicity of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in patients affected by coeliac 
disease, Whipple's disease and other noncoeliac enteropathies (NCE), 
characterised by primary or drug-related immunosuppression. We aimed to assess 
humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in these patients compared to 
controls.
METHODS: Between December 2021 and January 2022, IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein antibodies were measured in serum samples of coeliac disease, Whipple's 
disease and NCE patients attending our gastroenterology outpatient clinic for 
follow-up, who had received their first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination dose 3-6-9 (±1) 
months prior. Humoral response was compared with healthy controls (vaccinated 
healthcare workers undergoing serological screening), matched for gender, age, 
and time from first vaccine dose at sample collection.
RESULTS: A total of 120 patients [107 coeliac disease; 10 Whipple's disease; 2 
common-variable immunodeficiency (CVID); 1 idiopathic villous atrophy; 77 F, 
42 ± 16 years] and 240 matched controls (154 F, 43 ± 14 years) were enrolled. At 
3, 6 and 9 months, humoral response in coeliac patients was not impaired 
compared to controls. Inadequate humoral response to vaccination was 
significantly more common among Whipple's disease patients than controls ( P 
 < 0.001). Patients on immunosuppressive therapy had markedly lower IgG 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres (median 14 vs. 520 BAU/mL, P  < 0.001). As 
expected, patients with CVID showed no humoral response to vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Humoral immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was not reduced in 
coeliac disease patients compared to controls, although it was in Whipple's 
disease and CVID patients. Post-vaccination humoral response should be monitored 
in patients with Whipple's disease and chronic enteropathies on 
immunosuppressive therapy in order to schedule vaccine booster doses."
1127,"INTRODUCTION: Bowel preparation is crucial for colonoscopy completeness and 
lesions detection. Today, several cleansing products are equally recommended by 
guidelines, irrespective of patients' characteristics. Identification of 
preparation-specific risk factors for inadequate bowel preparation may lead to a 
personalized prescription of cleansing products to refine patients' tolerance 
and improve endoscopic outcomes.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive outpatients referred for 
colonoscopy using either a high-volume [HV: 4 l polyethylene glycol (PEG)] or a 
low-volume (LV: 2 l PEG + bisacodyl) preparation. Day-before regimen or 
split-dose regimen was used for morning or afternoon colonoscopies, 
respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify 
risk factors related to inadequate bowel preparation, according to the Boston 
bowel preparation scale for HV and LV preparations.
RESULTS: We enrolled 2040 patients, of which 1815 were included in the final 
analysis (average age 60.6 years, 50.2% men). Half of them (52%) used LV 
preparation. Adequate preparation was achieved by 87.6% without differences 
between the HV and LV groups (89.2% vs. 86.6%; P = 0.098). The use of day-before 
regimen and incomplete assumption of PEG were independent predictors of poor 
visibility for either HV or LV preparation. However, different specific risk 
factors for HV [diabetes: odds ratio (OR), 3.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
1.91-7.58; low level of instruction: OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.11-3.44; and previous 
abdominal surgery: OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.20-4.30] and for LV (heart disease: OR, 
2.06; 95% CI, 1.09-3.88; age > 65 years: OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.27) 
preparations were identified.
CONCLUSION: Day-before preparation and incomplete assumption of the purgative 
agents affect bowel visibility irrespective of the preparation volume. LV should 
be preferred to HV preparations in patients with diabetes, low level of 
instruction, and previous abdominal surgery, whereas an HV preparation should be 
preferred in patients with heart disease and in older patients."
1128,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The diagnostic role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided 
fine needle aspiration (FNA) and fine needle biopsy (FNB) of pelvic masses has 
not been well established. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS 
plus FNA/FNB in suspected local recurrence of pelvic masses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with a history of lower 
gastrointestinal and pelvic mass undergone EUS-FNA/FNB were included in the 
study.
RESULTS: In total 34 patients who underwent EUS-guided FNA or FNB of a 
perirectal mass were enrolled. The sampled lesion was a mass in 22 patients 
(64.7%) and a lymph node in 10 patients (29.4%). The univariate logistic 
regression analysis for diagnostic accuracy showed lesion size as a significant 
predictor of diagnostic accuracy [odds ratio (OR), 1.61; 1.08-2.27; P  = 0.02]. 
Diagnostic sensitivity was 100% (71.5-100%) with EUS-FNB and 75% (34.9-96.8%) 
with EUS-FNA ( P  = 0.12); specificity was 100% in both groups ( P  = 1.0). 
Sample adequacy was 94.1% in the whole cohort, with 20/20 adequacy rate (100%) 
in the EUS-FNB group and 12/14 (85.7%) in the EUS-FNA group ( P  = 0.28).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study demonstrating the diagnostic yield of EUS 
plus FNA/FNB in patients with pelvic masses comparing the two needles. Our 
results highlight the relevance of this technique, especially in undefined 
masses during oncological follow-up."
1129,"Liver fibrosis has a high incidence worldwide and is the common pathological 
basis of many chronic liver diseases. Liver fibrosis is caused by the excessive 
deposition of extracellular matrix and concomitant collagen accumulation in 
livers and can lead to the development of liver cirrhosis and even liver cancer. 
A large number of studies have provided evidence that liver fibrosis can be 
blocked or even reversed by appropriate medical interventions. However, the 
antifibrosis drugs with ideal clinical efficacy are still insufficient. The 
edible plant-derived natural compounds have been reported to exert effective 
antifibrotic effects with few side-effects, representing a kind of promising 
source for the treatment of liver fibrosis. In this article, we reviewed the 
current progress of the natural compounds derived from dietary plants in the 
treatment of liver fibrosis, including phenolic compounds (capsaicin, 
chlorogenic acid, curcumin, ellagic acid, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 
resveratrol, sinapic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid and vitamin E), 
flavonoid compounds (genistein, hesperidin, hesperetin, naringenin, naringin and 
quercetin), sulfur-containing compounds (S-allylcysteine, ergothioneine, lipoic 
acid and sulforaphane) and other compounds (betaine, caffeine, cucurbitacin B, 
lycopene, α-mangostin, γ-mangostin, ursolic acid, vitamin C and yangonin). The 
pharmacological effects and related mechanisms of these compounds in in-vivo and 
in-vitro models of liver fibrosis are focused."
1130,"BACKGROUND: No reliable model can currently be used for predicting coronary 
artery disease (CAD) occurrence in patients with diabetes. We developed and 
validated a model predicting the occurrence of CAD in these patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled patients with diabetes at Henan Provincial 
People's Hospital between 1 January 2020 and 10 June 2020, and collected data 
including demographics, physical examination results, laboratory test results, 
and diagnostic information from their medical records. The training set included 
patients ( n  = 1152) enrolled before 15 May 2020, and the validation set 
included the remaining patients ( n  = 238). Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were performed in the training set to develop a 
predictive model, which were visualized using a nomogram. The model's 
performance was assessed by area under the receiver-operating characteristic 
curve (AUC) and Brier scores for both data sets.
RESULTS: Sex, diabetes duration, low-density lipoprotein, creatinine, 
high-density lipoprotein, hypertension, and heart rate were CAD predictors in 
diabetes patients. The model's AUC and Brier score were 0.753 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.727-0.778] and 0.152, respectively, and 0.738 (95% CI 
0.678-0.793) and 0.172, respectively, in the training and validation sets, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model demonstrated favourable performance; thus, it can 
effectively predict CAD occurrence in diabetes patients."
1131,"The periodic emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) with 
unpredictable clinical severity and ability to escape preexisting immunity 
emphasizes the continued need for antiviral interventions. Two small molecule 
inhibitors, molnupiravir (MK-4482), a nucleoside analog, and nirmatrelvir 
(PF-07321332), a 3C-like protease inhibitor, have recently been approved as 
monotherapy for use in high risk COVID-19 patients. As preclinical data are only 
available for rodent and ferret models, we here assessed the efficacy of MK-4482 
and PF-07321332 alone and in combination against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 
Delta VOC in the rhesus macaque COVID-19 model. Macaques were infected with the 
SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and treated with either vehicle, MK-4482, PF-07321332 
or a combination of MK-4482 and PF-07321332. Clinical exams were performed at 1, 
2 and 4dpi to assess disease and virological parameters. Notably, use of MK-4482 
and PF-07321332 in combination improved the individual inhibitory effect of both 
drugs resulting in milder disease progression, stronger reduction of virus 
shedding from mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory tract, stronger reduction 
of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, and reduced lung pathology. 
Our data strongly indicate superiority of combined MK-4482 and PF-07321332

1132,"T helper 17 (Th17) cells have a prominent role in autoimmune diseases. In 
contrast, the nature of these cells in cancer is controversial, with either pro 
or anti-tumorigenic activities depending on various cancer settings. Chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a B-cell malignancy, is characterized by an 
imbalance in T-cell immune responses contributing to disease progression and 
increased mortality. Many clinical reports indicate an increase in Th17 cells 
and/or IL-17 serum cytokine levels in CLL patients compared to healthy 
individuals which correlates with various prognostic markers and significant 
changes in the tumor microenvironment. The exact mechanisms by which Th17 might 
contribute to CLL progression is still less investigated. In this review, we 
provide an updated presentation of the clinical information related to the 
significance of Th17 cells in CLL, and their interaction with the complex 
leukemic microenvironment including various mediators, immune and non-immune 
cells. Herein, we also address the available data regarding the effects of CLL 
targeted therapies on Th17 cells, and the potential of using these cells in 
adoptive cell therapies. Having a sound understanding of the role played by Th17 
in CLL is crucial for designing novel therapies that can achieve immune 
homeostasis and maximize clinical benefits."
1133,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the etiologies, 
outcomes, prognostic indicators and the role of genetic testing in children with 
acute liver failure (ALF).
METHODS: This retrospective study included 46 patients with pediatric acute 
liver failure (PALF) according to the PALF study group definition, admitted to 
King Fahad Specialist Hospital-Dammam, Saudi Arabia, between January 2014 and 
December 2021. Patients who survived with supportive therapy were designated as 
the recovery group, whereas those who died or underwent liver transplantation 
were designated as the death/transplant group.
RESULTS: There were 26 (56.5%) patients in the recovery group and 20 (43.5%) 
patients in the death/transplant group. Four patients (8.7%) underwent liver 
transplantation. After indeterminate causes (45.6%), genetic-metabolic diseases 
and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) were the most common cause with 15.2 and 
13%, respectively. Genetic testing had a high yield of (6/31) in identifying 
monogenic disease associated with ALF. Younger age, lower Glasgow Coma Scale and 
higher international normalized ratio (INR) on admission were predictors for 
poor prognosis. The death/transplant group had longer intensive care unit stay 
(P < 0.001), and on admission they had more advanced hepatic encephalopathy 
(P < 0.005), more prolonged prothrombin time (P < 0.001), higher lactate 
(P < 0.006), higher total and direct bilirubin (P < 0.008) and (P < 0.001), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Genetic, metabolic and DILI causes constituted the most common cause 
of PALF after indeterminate causes. The use of genetic testing can improve 
diagnostic rates in special cases, but we could not assess the effect of genetic 
testing on prognosis. The overall survival rate in our study was 65.2%. Younger 
age, higher admission INR and lower Glasgow coma scale were indicators of poor 
prognosis."
1134,"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a significant disease characterized 
by high mortality and complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
incidence/100 000 inhabitants and the in-hospital mortality/100 000 inhabitants 
of IE during the last 10 years in the province of Ravenna.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the public hospitals discharge database from 
January 2010 to December 2020 using the international classification of disease 
codification (ICD-9) for IE. We used the Italian national statistical institute 
(ISTAT) archive to estimate the number of Ravenna inhabitants/year. In 10 years, 
we identified a total of 407 patients with diagnosis of IE.The incidence of IE 
increased significantly from 6.29 cases/100 000 inhabitants in 2010 to 
19.58 cases/100 000 inhabitants in 2020 (P < 0.001). Also, the in-hospital 
mortality from IE increased over the same number of years, from 1.8 deaths/100 
000 inhabitants in 2010 to 4.4 deaths/100 000 inhabitants in 2020 (P < 0.001). 
The mortality rate (%) of IE over the years did not increase (P = 0.565). Also, 
over the years there was no difference in the site of infection (P = 0.372), 
irrespective of the valve localization or type, native valve (P = 0.347) or 
prosthetic valve (P = 0.145). On logistic regression analysis, age was the only 
predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.045, 95% confidence interval: 
1.015; 1.075, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Ravenna-based data on IE showed increased disease incidence but 
unchanged mortality rate over 10 years of follow-up. Age remains the sole 
predictor of population-based mortality, irrespective of the nature of the 
valve, native or substitute, and the organism detected on microbiology."
1135,"BACKGROUND: A steady increase in colorectal and prostate cancer survivors and 
patients with these cancers is expected in the upcoming years. As a result of 
primary cancer treatments, patients have numerous additional complaints, 
increasing the need for cancer aftercare. However, referrals to appropriate 
cancer aftercare remain inadequate, despite a wide range of aftercare options. 
Caregivers and patients often do not know which aftercare is the most 
appropriate for the individual patient. Since characteristics and complaints of 
patients within a diagnosis group may differ, predefined patient clusters could 
provide substantive and efficient support for professionals in the conversation 
about aftercare. By using advanced data analysis methods, clusters of patients 
who are different from one another within a diagnosis group can be identified.
OBJECTIVE: This study had a 2-fold objective: (1) to identify, visualize, and 
describe potential patient clusters within the colorectal and prostate cancer 
population and (2) to explore the potential usability of these clusters in 
clinical practice.
METHODS: First, we used cross-sectional data from patients with colorectal 
cancer and patients with prostate cancer provided by the population-based 
PROFILES (Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-Term 
Evaluation of Survivorship) registry, which were originally collected between 
2008 and 2012. To identify and visualize different clusters among the 2 patient 
populations, we conducted cluster analyses by applying the K-means algorithm and 
multiple-factor analyses. Second, in a qualitative study, we presented the 
patient clusters to patients with prostate, patients with colorectal cancer, and 
oncology professionals. To assess the usability of these clusters, we held 
expert panel group interviews. The interviews were video recorded and 
transcribed. Three researchers independently performed content-directed data 
analyses to understand and describe the qualitative data. Quotes illustrate the 
most important results.
RESULTS: We identified 3 patient clusters among colorectal cancer cases (n=3989) 
and 5 patient clusters among prostate cancer cases (n=696), which were described 
in tabular form. Patient experts (6/8, 75%) and professional experts (17/20, 
85%) recognized the patient clustering based on distinguishing variables. 
However, the tabular form was evaluated as less applicable in clinical practice. 
Instead, the experts suggested the development of a conversation tool (eg, 
decision tree) to guide professionals through the hierarchy of variables. In 
addition, participants suggested that information about possible aftercare 
initiatives should be offered and integrated. This would also ensure a good 
overview and seemed to be a precondition for finding suitable aftercare.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a fully data-driven approach can be 
used to identify distinguishable and recognizable (ie, in routine care) patient 
clusters in large data sets within cancer populations. Patient clusters can be a 
source of support for health professionals in the aftercare conversation. These 
clusters, when integrated into a smart digital conversation and referral tool, 
might be an opportunity to improve referral to cancer aftercare.

1136,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The unique and complex array of cutaneous lipids include 
essential components of the skin structure and signalling molecules mediating 
homeostasis and inflammation. Understanding skin lipid biology and metabolism 
can support our comprehension of health and disease, including systemic 
conditions with cutaneous involvement.
RECENT FINDINGS: Lipids found on the skin surface, produced by both the host and 
resident microbes, maintain and regulate the skin microbiome and the epidermal 
barrier, whilst altered contributions from either source can be detrimental to 
skin health. The unique lipid composition of the epidermal barrier is essential 
for its function, and recent studies have expanded our understanding of 
epidermal ceramide production. This has been supported by improved models 
available for skin research, including organotypic skin models enabling in-vitro 
production of complex acylceramides for the first time, and model systems 
facilitating in-silico exploration of the lipid profile changes observed in 
clinical samples. Studies have revealed further involvement of lipid mediators 
such as eicosanoids in cutaneous inflammation, as well as immune regulation in 
both healthy and diseased skin.
SUMMARY: Skin lipids offer exciting opportunities as therapeutic targets for 
many conditions, whether through topical interventions or nutritional 
supplementation."

1138,"BACKGROUND: Knowing the variability of blood coagulation responses to liver 
damage of different origins can provide a key to curing liver tissues or to 
mitigating treatment side effects. The aim of the present work was to compare 
the changes in the main components of hemostasis under experimental drug-induced 
hepatosis and hepatitis in rats.
METHODS: We modeled diclofenac-induced hepatitis and tetracycline-induced 
hepatosis. Hemostasis response was gauged by measuring fibrinogen, factor X, 
protein C (PC), and prothrombin in plasma. The decarboxylated form of 
prothrombin was detected by measuring prothrombin index and ecamulin index. 
Platelet reactivity was studied using aggregometry.
RESULTS: Both hepatitis and hepatosis decreased the synthesis of fibrinogen, 
factor X, and prothrombin. However, protein carboxylation was not disrupted in 
hepatosis but was much impaired in hepatitis. PC decreased in both models as a 
consequence of its consumption possibly during inflammatory response. Platelet 
aggregation rate was lower in hepatosis but higher in hepatitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply the need for a thorough monitoring of the 
hemostasis system in liver diseases to avoid possible thrombotic complications. 
Its state indicates the disorder's rate and character."
1139,"Aim To examine a relation of thyroid function, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 
with left ventricular function measured through the left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods This prospective research 
involved 160 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patients 
were divided into those with normal thyroid hormone status (n=80) and those with 
hypothyroidism (newly diagnosed) (n=80). Inflammatory parameters and parameters 
of hormonal status were taken for analysis: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 
thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (FT4), and free 
triiodothyronine (FT3). All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiographic 
examination (TTE) five days upon admission, and left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) was analysed. Results Significant difference between the two 
groups was verified in values of T3, T4, erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, 
neutrophil, lymphocytes, NLR, C-reactive protein (CRP) and sedimentation rate. 
Patients with euthyroidism had a higher frequency of coronary single-vessel 
disease (p=0.035) and a significantly lower frequency of triple vessel disease 
(p=0.046), as well as a higher median value of LVEF (p=0.003). There was a 
significant correlation between LVEF with haemoglobin values (p=0.002), NLR 
(p=0.001), and CRP (p=001). Conclusion The altered status of the thyroid gland 
in acute myocardial infarction is associated with the severity of the coronary 
blood vessel lesion, LVEF and correlates with inflammatory response."
1140,"Contractile epithelial tubes are found in various organs, such as lung airways 
and blood capillaries. Their ability to sense luminal pressure and respond with 
adequate contractility is essential for their physiology, and its mis-regulation 
results in diseases such as asthma and hypertension. Here, we describe a 
mechanoresponsive regulatory pathway downstream of tissue stretching that 
controls contraction of the C. elegans spermatheca, a tubular structure where 
fertilization occurs. Using live-imaging, we show that ovulation-induced 
stretching of spermathecal cells leads to recruitment of the RhoGEF RHGF-1 to 
stress fibers, which activates RHO-1 and myosin II in a positive feedback loop. 
Through deletion analysis, we identified the PDZ domain of RHGF-1 as responsible 
for F-actin binding, and genetic epistasis analysis with the RhoGAP spv-1 
demonstrated that tension-dependent recruitment of RHGF-1 to F-actin is required 
for robust spermathecal contractility. Our study illustrates how 
mechanosensitive regulators of Rho GTPases provide epithelial tubes the ability 
to tune their contractility in response to internal pressure."
1141,"BACKGROUND: Starch-lipid complex is a new type of resistant starch, which is of 
great significance for the prevention of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Most 
of starch-lipid complexes usually need to be treated by heating in order to make 
them ideal for a variety of application and starch based foods are generally not 
edible without heat treatment process. However, the digestion and structural 
properties of starch-lipid complex will be changed after heating. In this study, 
microwave and conventional heating were used to treat debranched quinoa 
starch-oleic acid complexes (DQS-OA) with different water addition, and the 
effects of the two methods on the physicochemical, digestive and structural 
properties of DQS-OA were compared.
RESULTS: The results of in vitro digestibility showed that the resistant starch 
content (235.34-269.55 g kg-1 ) of the conventional heating-treated samples was 
significantly higher than that the microwave-treated samples (141.51-157.99 g 
kg-1 ). Moreover, after microwave treatment, the short-range molecular order and 
crystalline structure of DQS-OA were destroyed and the particle size became 
smaller. In contrast, the thermal stability, enthalpy and crystallinity of the 
complexes after conventional heating were improved. The ratio at 1047/1022 cm-1 
of complexes has also been increased.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that conventional water-bath heating was 
better than microwave heating in increasing the digestion resistance, improving 
the short-range and long-range molecular order and promoting the formation of 
DQS-OA. In addition, with the increase of water addition, the influence of 
microwave or water bath treatment on the properties of DQS-OA became greater.

1142,"IMPORTANCE: Pediatric emergency department (ED) visits for mental health crises 
are increasing. Patients who frequently use the ED are of particular concern, as 
pediatric mental health ED visits are commonly repeat visits. Better 
understanding of trends and factors associated with mental health ED revisits is 
needed for optimal resource allocation and targeting of prevention efforts.
OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in pediatric mental health ED visits and revisits 
and to determine factors associated with revisits.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, data were obtained from 
38 US children's hospital EDs in the Pediatric Health Information System between 
October 1, 2015, and February 29, 2020. The cohort included patients aged 3 to 
17 years with a mental health ED visit.
EXPOSURES: Characteristics of patients, encounters, hospitals, and communities.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a mental health ED revisit 
within 6 months of the index visit. Trends were assessed using cosinor analysis 
and factors associated with time to revisit using mixed-effects Cox proportional 
hazards regression.
RESULTS: There were 308 264 mental health ED visits from 217 865 unique 
patients, and 13.2% of patients had a mental health revisit within 6 months. 
Mental health visits increased by 8.0% annually (95% CI, 4.5%-11.4%), whereas 
all other ED visits increased by 1.5% annually (95% CI, 0.1%-2.9%). Factors 
associated with mental health ED revisits included psychiatric comorbidities, 
chemical restraint use, public insurance, higher area measures of child 
opportunity, and presence of an inpatient psychiatric unit at the presenting 
hospital. Patients with psychotic disorders (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; 95% CI, 
1.29-1.57), disruptive or impulse control disorders (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 
1.30-1.42), and neurodevelopmental disorders (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.30) were 
more likely to revisit. Patients with substance use disorders (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 
0.55-0.66) were less likely to revisit.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Markers of disease severity and health care access 
were associated with mental health revisits. Directing hospital and community 
interventions toward identified high-risk patients is needed to help mitigate 
recurrent mental health ED use and improve mental health care delivery."
1143,"IMPORTANCE: Real-world evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is needed to 
understand the prevalence of infection in the Japanese population.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct sentinel screening of the Japanese population to determine 
the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals, with 
complementary analysis for symptomatic patients as reported by active 
epidemiologic surveillance used by the government.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study of a sentinel 
screening program investigated approximately 1 million asymptomatic individuals 
with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 
February 22 and December 8, 2021. Participants included children, students, 
employed adults, and older individuals, as well as volunteers to broadly reflect 
the general Japanese population in the 14 prefectures of Japan that declared a 
state of emergency. Saliva samples and a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 
approximately 40 as standard in Japan were used. Polymerase chain reaction 
testing for symptomatic patients was separately done by public health 
authorities, and the results were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour, 
and Welfare of Japan to complement data on asymptomatic infections from the 
present study.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Temporal trends in positivity and prevalence 
(including surges of different variants) and demographic associations (eg, age, 
geographic location, and vaccination status) were assessed.
RESULTS: The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1 082 976 asymptomatic 
individuals (52.08% males; mean [SD] age 39.4 [15.7] years) was 0.03% (95% CI, 
0.02%-0.05%) during periods without surges and a maximum of 0.33% (95% CI, 
0.25%-0.43%) during peak surges at the Japanese standard Ct value of 
approximately 40; however, the positive rate would have been 10-fold less at a 
Ct value of 25 as used elsewhere in the world (eg, UK). There was an increase in 
patients with a positive PCR test result with a Ct value of 25 or 30 preceding 
surges in infection and hotspots of asymptomatic infections.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of asymptomatic 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population of Japan in 2021, as investigated 
by sentinel surveillance, a low rate of infection was seen in the Japanese 
population compared with reported levels elsewhere in the world. This finding 
provides real-world data on the state of infection in Japan."
1144,"IMPORTANCE: Despite access to routine laboratory evaluation, primary 
hyperparathyroidism (PHP) remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the consequences associated with missed diagnoses and 
prolonged time to diagnosis and treatment of PHP.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 
patients older than 40 years with 2 instances of hypercalcemia during 2010 to 
2020 and 3 years of follow-up. Patients were recruited from 63 health care 
organizations in the TriNetX Research Network. Data analysis was performed from 
January 2010 to September 2020.
EXPOSURES: Elevated serum calcium.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Existing symptoms and diagnoses associated with PHP 
(osteoporosis, fractures, urolithiasis, major depressive disorder, anxiety, 
hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, malaise or fatigue, joint pain or 
myalgias, constipation, insomnia, polyuria, weakness, abdominal pain, headache, 
nausea, amnesia, and gallstones) compared in patients deemed high-risk and 
without a diagnosis and matched controls, and those who experienced times from 
documented hypercalcemia to diagnosis and diagnosis to treatment within or 
beyond 1 year.
RESULTS: There were 135 034 patients analyzed (96 554 women [72%]; 28 892 Black 
patients [21%] and 88 010 White patients [65%]; 3608 Hispanic patients [3%] and 
98 279 non-Hispanic patients [73%]; mean [SD] age, 63 [10] years). Two groups 
without a documented diagnosis of PHP were identified as high risk: 20 176 
patients (14.9%) with parathyroid hormone greater than or equal to 50 pg/mL and 
24 905 patients (18.4%) with no parathyroid hormone level obtained or recorded 
explanation for hypercalcemia. High-risk patients experienced significantly 
increased rates of all associated symptoms and diagnoses compared with matched 
controls. Just 9.7% of those with hypercalcemia (13 136 patients) had a 
diagnosis of PHP. Compared with individuals who received a diagnosis within 1 
year of hypercalcemia, those whose workup exceeded 1 year had significantly 
increased rates of major depressive disorder, anxiety, hypertension, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease, malaise or fatigue, joint pain or myalgias, 
polyuria, weakness, abdominal pain, and headache at 3 years. The rate of 
osteoporosis increased from 17.1% (628 patients) to 25.4% (935 patients) over 
the study period in the group with delayed diagnosis. Among those with a 
diagnosis, 5280 patients (40.2%) underwent parathyroidectomy. Surgery beyond 1 
year of diagnosis was associated with significantly increased rates of 
osteoporosis and hypertension at 3 years after diagnosis compared with those 
treated within 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many patients were at high risk for PHP without a 
documented diagnosis. Complications in these patients, as well as those who 
received a diagnosis after prolonged workup or time to treatment, resulted in 
patient harm. System-level interventions are necessary to ensure proper 
diagnosis and prompt treatment of PHP."
1145,"IMPORTANCE: Peripheral neuropathies are common conditions and can result in 
numbness, paresthesia, motor deficits, and pain. There is increasing evidence 
for the use of biomarkers as clinical indicators of the presence, severity, and 
prognosis of nerve lesions; however, biomarker identification has largely been 
focused on disorders of the central nervous system, and less is known about 
their role in the peripheral nervous system.
OBJECTIVE: To assess blood-based biomarker concentrations associated with nerve 
involvement in patients with peripheral neuropathy compared with control 
participants.
DATA SOURCES: Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL were searched from inception to 
September 23, 2021.
STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies reporting on blood biomarkers in patients 
diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy were included. This review was 
preregistered on PROSPERO and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Data were 
abstracted by 1 investigator and independently reviewed by a second.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were meta-analyzed when at least 2 studies 
reported the same biomarker with comparable methodology. Fixed-effects models 
were used when only 2 studies were included; random-effects models were used 
when more than 2 studies were included.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome of interest was concentration of 
biomarkers.
RESULTS: This review included 36 studies reporting on 4414 participants, 
including 2113 control participants and 2301 patients with peripheral neuropathy 
with 13 distinct peripheral neuropathy diagnoses. Diabetic neuropathy was the 
most common neuropathy diagnosis (13 studies), followed by Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
disease (6 studies) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (6 studies). Overall, 16 
different blood-based biomarkers associated with nerve involvement were 
evaluated. The most used were neurofilament light chain, S100B, brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor, and neuron-specific enolase. Patients with peripheral 
neuropathy demonstrated significantly higher levels of neurofilament light chain 
compared with controls (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.82 
to 1.05]; P < .001). There were no significant differences in levels of S100B 
(SMD, 1.10 [95% CI, -3.08 to 5.28]; P = .38), brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(SMD, -0.52 [95% CI, -2.23 to 1.19]; P = .40), or neuron-specific enolase (SMD, 
-0.00 [95% CI, -1.99 to 1.98]; P = .10) in patients with peripheral neuropathy 
compared with control participants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis support the use of neurofilament light chain as a blood-based 
measure associated with the presence of neuronal injury in patients with 
peripheral neuropathy."
1146,"IMPORTANCE: Recent studies have highlighted an association between epilepsy and 
Parkinson disease (PD). The role of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) has not been 
explored.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between AEDs and incident PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nested case-control study started 
collecting data from the UK Biobank (UKB) in 2006, and data were extracted on 
June 30, 2021. Individuals with linked primary care prescription data were 
included. Cases were defined as individuals with a Hospital Episode Statistics 
(HES)-coded diagnosis of PD. Controls were matched 6:1 for age, sex, race and 
ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Prescription records were searched for AEDs 
prescribed prior to diagnosis of PD. The UKB is a longitudinal cohort study with 
more than 500 000 participants; 45% of individuals in the UKB have linked 
primary care prescription data. Participants living in the UK aged between 40 
and 69 years were recruited to the UKB between 2006 and 2010. All participants 
with UKB-linked primary care prescription data (n = 222 106) were eligible for 
enrollment in the study. Individuals with only a self-reported PD diagnosis or 
missing data for the matching variables were excluded. In total, 1477 
individuals were excluded; 49 were excluded due to having only self-reported PD, 
and 1428 were excluded due to missing data.
EXPOSURES: Exposure to AEDs (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and 
sodium valproate) was defined using routinely collected prescription data 
derived from primary care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Odd ratios and 95% CIs were calculated using 
adjusted logistic regression models for individuals prescribed AEDs before the 
first date of HES-coded diagnosis of PD.
RESULTS: In this case-control study, there were 1433 individuals with an 
HES-coded PD diagnosis (cases) and 8598 controls in the analysis. Of the 1433 
individuals, 873 (60.9%) were male, 1397 (97.5%) had their race and ethnicity 
recorded as White, and their median age was 71 years (IQR, 65-75 years). An 
association was found between AED prescriptions and incident PD (odds ratio, 
1.80; 95% CI, 1.35-2.40). There was a trend for a greater number of prescription 
issues and multiple AEDs being associated with a greater risk of PD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study, the first to systematically look at PD 
risk in individuals prescribed the most common AEDs, to our knowledge, found 
evidence of an association between AEDs and incident PD. With the recent 
literature demonstrating an association between epilepsy and PD, this study 
provides further insights."
1147,"BACKGROUND: Chronic liver disease has emerged as a leading cause of 
non-AIDS-related mortality in hepatitis C virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV)-coinfected patients. The relationship between CD4 cell count and 
HIV-related opportunistic infections and tumors has been well characterized; 
however, it is unclear whether CD4 cell count is associated with HCV-related 
hepatic events.
METHODS: This observational cohort study enrolled HCV/HIV-coinfected patients 
from the National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Program of China from 2004 to 
2019 in Guangzhou. The primary outcome was a composite of hepatic events, 
including cirrhosis complications, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 
liver-related mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Among the 793 patients, 43 developed hepatic events during a median 
follow-up of 6.7 years, including 35 cirrhosis complications, 13 HCC cases, and 
14 cases of liver-related mortality. The 5-year and 10-year cumulative 
incidences of hepatic events were 4.2% and 9.3%, respectively. Patients who 
developed hepatic events had a less satisfactory increase in CD4 cell count, 
lower peak CD4 (354.5/μL vs. 560.0/μL, P < 0.001), and lower percentage of peak 
CD4 > 500/μL (30.2% vs. 60.7%, P < 0.001) after the initiation of antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) than those who did not. The cumulative incidences of hepatic 
events were higher in patients with lower peak CD4 levels with adjusted odds 
ratios of 3.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-10.40), 2.25 (95% CI: 
0.87-5.86), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.35-2.74) for patients with peak CD4 at <200/μL, 
200-350/μL, and 351 to 500/μL, respectively, relative to those with peak CD4 > 
500/μL. Peak CD4 was negatively associated with the risk of hepatic events in a 
dose-response manner (P-value for trend = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Persistently low CD4 cell counts after ART are independently 
associated with a high risk of hepatic events in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients, 
highlighting the important role of immune reconstitution in improving liver 
outcomes."
1148,"BACKGROUND: The preferred therapeutic regimen for Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) 
is a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) plus azithromycin is the widespread 
alternative therapeutic regimen. The synergistic sulfonamides tablet contains 
TMP, sulfadiazine, and SMX and hypothetically could be used for TE treatment. 
This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of synergistic sulfonamides 
plus clindamycin (regimen B) with TMP-SMX plus azithromycin (regimen A) for the 
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) human immunodeficiency 
virus-associated TE.
METHODS: This was an open-labeled, multi-center randomized controlled trial 
recruited from 11 centers. Each recruited patient was randomly assigned to 
receive Regimen A or Regimen B for at least 6 weeks. The overall response was 
evaluated by assessment of the clinical response of TE-associated clinical 
features and the radiological response of TE-associated radiological findings. 
The overall response rate, clinical response rate, radiological response rate, 
and adverse events were assessed at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Death events were 
compared between the two regimens at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 91 AIDS/TE patients were included in the final analysis (44 
in regimen A vs. 47 in regimen B). The overall response rate, which refers to 
the combined clinical and radiological response, was 18.2% (8/44) for regimen A 
and 21.3% (10/47) for regimen B at week 6. The results of clinical response 
showed that, in comparison with regimen A, regimen B may perform better with 
regards to its effect on the relief of clinical manifestations (50.0% [22/44] 
vs. 70.2% [33/47], P = 0.049). However, no significant differences in 
radiological response, mortality events, and adverse events were found between 
the two regimens at week 6.
CONCLUSIONS: Synergistic sulfonamides plus clindamycin, as a novel treatment 
regimen, showed no significantly different efficacy and comparable safety in 
comparison with the TMP-SMX plus azithromycin regimen. In addition, the regimen 
containing synergistic sulfonamides may exhibit advantages in terms of clinical 
symptom alleviation.

1149,"BACKGROUND: Ubiquitination plays an essential role in many biological processes, 
including viral infection, and can be reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes 
(DUBs). Although some studies discovered that DUBs inhibit or enhance viral 
infection by various mechanisms, there is lack of information on the role of 
DUBs in virus regulation, which needs to be further investigated.
METHODS: Immunoblotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, in vivo/in vitro 
deubiquitination, protein immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and 
co-localization biological techniques were employed to examine the effect of 
ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3) on APOBEC3G (A3G) stability and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. To analyse the relationship between 
USP3 and HIV disease progression, we recruited 20 HIV-infected patients to 
detect the levels of USP3 and A3G in peripheral blood and analysed their 
correlation with CD4+ T-cell counts. Correlation was estimated by Pearson 
correlation coefficients (for parametric data).
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that USP3 specifically inhibits HIV-1 
replication in an A3G-dependent manner. Further investigation found that USP3 
stabilized 90% to 95% of A3G expression by deubiquitinating Vif-mediated 
polyubiquitination and blocking its degradation in an enzyme-dependent manner. 
It also enhances the A3G messenger RNA (mRNA) level by binding to A3G mRNA and 
stabilizing it in an enzyme-independent manner. Moreover, USP3 expression was 
positively correlated with A3G expression (r = 0.5110) and CD4+ T-cell counts 
(r = 0.5083) in HIV-1-infected patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that USP3 restricts HIV-1 viral infections by increasing 
the expression of the antiviral factor A3G. Therefore, USP3 may be an important 
target for drug development and serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against 
viral infections."
1150,"BACKGROUND: There are different definitions to identify/classify children with 
medical complexity (CMC). We aimed to investigate and describe the definitions 
used to classify CMC in epidemiological studies.
METHODS: PubMed, SciELO, LILACS, and EMBASE were searched from 2015 to 2020 
(last updated September 15th, 2020) for original studies that presented the 
definition used to classify/identify CMC in the scientific research method. We 
applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
methodology. From the included studies, the following were identified: first 
author, year of publication, design, population, study period, the definition of 
CMC used, limitations, and strengths.
RESULTS: Nine hundred and sixty-seven records were identified in the searched 
databases, and 42 met the inclusion criteria. Of the 42 studies included, the 
four most frequent definitions used in the articles included in this review were 
classification of CMC into nine diagnostic categories based on the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) (35.7%, 15 articles); update 
of the previous classification for ICD-10 codes with the inclusion of other 
conditions in the definition (21.4%, nine articles); definition based on a 
medical complexity algorithm for classification (16.7%, seven articles); and a 
risk rating system (7.1%, three articles).
CONCLUSIONS: CMC definitions using diagnostic codes were more frequent. However, 
several limitations were found in its uses. Our research highlighted the need to 
improve health information systems to accurately characterize the CMC population 
and promote the provision of comprehensive care."
1151,"BACKGROUND: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is one of the most common primary glomerular 
diseases worldwide, especially in young Asian adults. Long RNA H19 is associated 
with renal pathologies, such as renal cell injury; however, a connection between 
serum H19 expression and kidney disease progression has not been demonstrated.
METHOD: Our cohort consisted of 204 patients with IgAN. Serum H19 levels were 
determined with reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase between 1 May, 
2014 and 1 May, 2015. H19 levels were log-transformed and categorical variables 
were categorized according to cutoff points of a ROC curve. Restricted cubic 
spline and generalized estimating equation analyses were performed to determine 
the association between serum H19 and kidney disease progression.
RESULTS: H19 expression was significantly downregulated in patients with IgAN 
compared to healthy controls. Restricted cubic spline analyses showed that the 
relationship was negatively and linearly correlated (P for nonlinearly = 0.256). 
After adjusting for other potential clinical, pathologic, and treatment factors, 
H19 was found to be a protective factor for prognosis in IgAN (HR, 0.52; 95% CI 
0.32-0.84; P = 0.008). ROC curve analysis showed that the clinical value of 
lncRNA H19 with CKD and area under the ROC curve was 0.746 (95% CI 0.663-0.829; 
P < 0.001) of the clinical prognostic value of H19. Serum restricted cubic 
spline analyses showed that the relationship was negatively and linearly 
correlated (P for non-linearly = 0.256). H19 > 0.097 in patients in IgAN was 
associated with a reduction of the risk of kidney progression by approximately 
70% within 5 years compared to H19≤0.097 (HR, 0.30;95% CI 0.12-0.74; P = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: H19 is an independent protective factor, and a high level of H19 
often indicates better renal outcome within 5 years."
1152,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection is the most prevalent sexually 
transmitted bacterial disease worldwide whose greatest impact is on the female 
reproductive system. The objective was to assess the prevalence of Chlamydia 
infection in a large population of female patients from a private health service 
in São Paulo (Brazil), identifying the main age groups affected by the agent and 
the evolution of the prevalence.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted based on the results of all 
molecular biology tests. The tests were carried out between January 2005 and 
December 2015. The positivity of test results was determined by year and age 
group.
RESULTS: A total of 85,292 patients who performed 103,576 tests for Chlamydia 
were considered eligible for the statistical data. The overall prevalence of C. 
trachomatis infection in the study population was 2.2% (95% CI: 2.07-2.25). A 
higher prevalence of infection was observed in the ≤ 25 years and ≤ 30 years age 
groups, with rates of 6.0% (95% CI: 5.59-6.35) and 4.4% (95% CI: 4.08-4.50), 
respectively. There was a significant increase in the positivity of the exams 
over time, especially in the ≤ 35 years age group. The prevalence at 26-30 years 
was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.82-3.30); 31-35 years 1.7% (95% CI: 1.50-1.82); 36-40 years 
1.0% (95% CI: 0.86-1.16); 41-60 years 0.6% (95% CI: 0.50-0.70) and the 
prevalence at ≥ 61 years was 0.4% (95% CI: 0.11-0.75).
CONCLUSION: The screening of asymptomatic young women would have the potential 
to reduce infection, transmission, and sequelae of infection by this agent."
1153,"Peanut stem rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. is the most common disease of 
peanut worldwide and has become increasingly serious in recent years. This study 
is aimed at obtaining peanut endophytic bacteria with high 
antagonistic/protective effects against peanut stem rot. In total, 45 bacterial 
strains were isolated from healthy peanut plants from a severely impacted area. 
Of these, 6 exhibited antagonistic activity against S. rolfsii, including F-1 
and R-11 with the most robust activity with an inhibition zone width of 20.25 
and 15.49 mm, respectively. These two were identified as Bacillus sp. and 
Burkholderia sp., respectively, based on morphological, physiological, and 
biochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA sequencing. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first study to report the Burkholderia sp. antagonistic 
effect on S. rolfsii as a biological control agent for peanut stem rot. Their 
culture filtrates potently inhibited the hyphal growth, sclerotial formation, 
and germination of S. rolfsii. Also, the strain-produced volatile compounds 
inhibited the fungal growth. Pot experiments showed that F-1 and R-11 
significantly reduced the peanut stem rot disease with the efficacy of 77.13 and 
64.78%, respectively, which was significantly higher compared with carbendazim 
medicament (35.22%; P < 0.05). Meanwhile, F-1 and R-11 improved the activity of 
plant defense enzymes such as phenylalaninase (PAL), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), 
and peroxidase (POD) enhancing the systemic resistance of the peanut plants. 
This study demonstrated that Bacillus sp. F-1 and Burkholderia sp. R-11, with a 
strong antagonistic effect on S. rolfsii, can be potential biocontrol agents for 
peanut stem rot."
1154,"Myelodysplastic neoplasms, formerly known as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 
represent a group of clonal disorders characterized by a high degree of clinical 
and molecular heterogeneity, and an invariable tendency to progress to acute 
myeloid leukemia. MDS typically present in the elderly with cytopenias of 
different degrees and bone marrow dysplasia, the hallmarks of the disease. 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the sole curative approach to 
date. Nonetheless, given the disease's demographics, only a minority of patients 
can benefit from this procedure. Currently used prognostic schemes such as the 
Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (R-IPSS), and most recently the 
molecular IPSS (IPSS-M), guide clinical management by dividing MDS into two big 
categories: lower- and higher-risk cases, based on a cut-off score of 3.5. The 
main clinical problem of the lower-risk group is represented by the management 
of cytopenias, whereas the prevention of secondary leukemia progression is the 
goal for the latter. Herein, we discuss the non-transplant treatment of MDS, 
focusing on current practice and available therapeutic options, while also 
presenting new investigational agents potentially entering the MDS therapeutic 
arsenal in the near future."
1155,"Diabetes is a risk factor for greater severity of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is an independent predictor of 
critical illness, and it is reported to have a stronger association than 
absolute hyperglycemia. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of 
absolute hyperglycemia and SHR with the severity of COVID-19, since there are no 
studies investigating SHR in patients with COVID-19. We conducted a 
retrospective observational study on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the 
first months of the pandemic, regarding absolute hyperglycemia, SHR, and 
severity outcomes. Of the 374 patients, 28.1% had a previous diagnosis of type 2 
diabetes. Absolute hyperglycemia (64.8% versus 22.7%; p < 0.01) and SHR [1.1 
(IQR 0.9-1.3) versus 1.0 (IQR 0.9-1.2); p < 0.001] showed a statistically 
significant association with previous diabetes. Absolute hyperglycemia showed a 
significant association with clinical severity of COVID-19 (79.0% versus 62.7%; 
p < 0.001), need for oxygen therapy (74.8% versus 54.4%; p < 0.001), invasive 
mechanical ventilation (28.6% versus 11.6%; p < 0.001), and intensive care unit 
(30.3% versus 14.9%; p = 0.002), but not with mortality; by contrast, there was 
no statistically significant association between SHR and all these parameters. 
Our results are in agreement with the literature regarding the impact of 
absolute hyperglycemia on COVID-19 severity outcomes, while SHR was not a 
significant marker. We therefore suggest that SHR should not be evaluated in all 
patients admitted in the hospital for COVID-19, and we encourage the standard 
measures at admission of blood glucose and HbA1c levels."
1156,"Cyst infection is a frequent and serious complication of autosomal dominant 
polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Hematogenous spread via bacterial 
translocation in the intestine is considered to be the main cause, so intestinal 
flora may be involved. However, the exact role of the intestinal flora in cyst 
infection in ADPKD is unknown. We report a 66-year-old woman and a 56-year-old 
man with ADPKD who had severe hepatic cyst infection. We analyzed the microbiome 
of infected cyst content, feces, and saliva in these two patients. The 
microbiome of patient 1 showed various bacteria in an infected cyst, whereas 
that of patient 2 showed only one bacterium. In both patients, the composition 
of the microbiome of the cyst content was quite different from those of feces 
and saliva, and the main bacteria in the infected cyst content represented a 
small proportion of those in feces and saliva. Lactobacilli were not almost 
detected in the infected cyst content though some lactobacilli are endemic in 
the gastrointestinal tract and the saliva. The association between bacteria in 
cysts and those in feces or saliva remains uncertain, and further research on 
this topic is needed."
1157,"PURPOSE: Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated disease, 
and an endosonographic evaluation may help the diagnosis. The main objectives of 
this study were to measure the thickness of the oesophageal wall using a radial 
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), mucosa/submucosa (MSM), muscularis propria (MP) and 
mucosa to muscularis propria (MMP); to compare these measurements between 
patients with and without EoE; to correlate them with the Endoscopic Reference 
Score (EREFS); and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these measurements.
METHODS: Children and adolescents (aging from 4 to 17 years) were evaluated in 
this prospective cross-sectional study. A radial EUS at 12 MHz frequency was 
used, and EREFS was employed to grade macroscopic findings. Accuracy of the 
measurements for the diagnosis of EoE was assessed by receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: Twenty-six (19 M/7 F) patients (median age 10.83 years, range 
5.65-17.46) were evaluated. EoE was diagnosed in 6 patients. The mean (and SD) 
oesophageal wall thicknesses in the distal oesophagus in millimetres in groups 
with and without EoE, respectively, were: MSM 1.07 (0.44) and 1.11 (0.33); MP 
0.67 (0.25) and 0.60 (0.19); and MMP 1.73 (0.46) and 1.72 (0.32). 
Mid-oesophagus: MSM 1.16 (0.34) and 1.15 (0.34); MP 0.63 (0.16) and 0.60 (0.2); 
and MMP 1.79 (0.41) and 1.74 (0.34). In the ROC curve, the distal MP layer 
thickness presented better discriminative performance, with an area under the 
curve of 0.61 (95% CI 0.28-0.93) at 0.73 mm cut-off (66.67% sensitivity, 80% 
specificity, likelihood ratios of 3.33 for positive and 0.42 for negative test).
CONCLUSION: The evaluation of oesophageal thickness measurements by EUS is not 
useful for diagnosing EoE."
1158,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 on the 
effectiveness of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in patients with axial 
spondyloarthritis (axSpA).
METHODS: A total of 1109 patients with available HLA-B27 status (831 B27+ 
patients and 278 B27- patients) fulfilling the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis 
international Society classification criteria for axSpA from the prospective 
Swiss Clinical Quality Management Registry initiating a first TNFi were 
included. Drug retention was investigated with multiple adjusted Cox 
proportional hazard models with imputation of missing values. Multiple-adjusted 
logistic regression analyses were used to assess the proportion of patients 
reaching 50% reduction in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index 
(BASDAI50) at 1 year.
RESULTS: B27+ and B27- patients differed with regard to age, sex, BASDAI, 
C-reactive protein (CRP), body mass index, enthesitis, uveitis, and 
classification status. After adjustment for potential confounders for the 
relationship between HLA-B27 and drug effectiveness (sex and family history of 
spondyloarthritis), a higher risk of drug discontinuation was found in B27- 
patients (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.27-1.83). This difference decreased after additional 
adjustment for parameters which may act as mediators (HR 1.30, 95% CI 
1.30-1.55). Male sex and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were 
consistently associated with longer retention. Comparable results were obtained 
for BASDAI50 responses.
CONCLUSION: The HLA-B27 genotype is an important predictor of treatment 
effectiveness. Male sex and CRP seem, however, to better describe variability of 
response in individual patients. This data may help avoiding potential 
discrimination of B27- individuals with regard to TNFi initiation. Key Points • 
HLA-B27 is a predictor of effectiveness of TNF inhibitors in axial 
spondyloarthritis. • Variability of response in individual patients is better 
defined by sex and objective markers of disease activity, such as C-reactive 
protein."
1159,"Fusarium kalimantanense is a genetic lineage of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. 
cubense (Foc) and belongs to the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC). This 
pathogen is a causative agent of Panama disease, an infection that has caused 
damage to the banana crop worldwide. Bacillus sp. (LPPC170) showed preliminary 
antagonist activity against F. kalimantanense (LPPC130) in vitro tests from the 
cultivation of axenic culture and co-culture with inhibition of mycelial growth 
of phytopathogen of 41.23%. According to these findings, volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) emitted from Bacillus sp. were obtained by solid-phase 
microextraction and identified by gas chromatography coupled with a mass 
spectrometer (GC-MS). The multivariate data analysis tool (PLS-DA and Heatmap) 
identified short-chain organic acids as the main antagonistic VOCs responsible 
for inhibiting the mycelial growth of LPPC130. Acetic acid, propanoic acid, 
butanoic acid, valeric acid, and isovaleric acid exhibited a strong inhibitory 
effect on the mycelial growth of LPPC130, with inhibition of 20.68%, 33.30%, 
26.87%, 43.71%, and 53.10%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy revealed 
that VOCs caused damage to the vegetative and reproductive structures of the 
fungus. These results suggest Bacillus LPPC170 as an excellent biocontrol tool 
against the phytopathogen causative agents of Panama disease."
1160,"BACKGROUND: Characteristics of AL amyloidosis across Asia are not well-described 
in the literature. Thus, we overviewed the incidence and disease characteristics 
of AL amyloidosis in Korea.
METHODS: We collected medical records of 302 AL amyloidosis patients and 
compared survival outcomes by predominant treatment strategy and at four time 
points: 1995-2003, 2004-2008, 2009-2013, and 2014-2018.
RESULTS: The median age was 62 years (36-83). One hundred forty-one patients 
were classified as stage III (26.3%) or IV (47.9%). The patients diagnosed 
between 2014 and 2018 survived longer than those diagnosed at other time points 
due to the introduction of bortezomib (p < 0.01). In addition, patients who 
received upfront ASCT survived longer than those who received salvage ASCT or 
chemotherapy alone (p < 0.01). However, most of the 85 patients who experienced 
early death within 6 months were older than 75 years, had BMI less than 20, and 
had a high disease burden.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AL amyloid has increased and survival outcomes 
have improved gradually, most likely due to introduction of novel agents and 
upfront ASCT. However, not all patients are suitable for these potent treatment 
modalities, and avoiding early death within 6 months remains a challenge."
1161,"The rarity and biological heterogeneity of the peripheral T-cell lymphomas has 
made subtype- and biomarker-driven approaches challenging to realize and even 
more challenging to evaluate in clinical practice. Out of necessity, treatment 
of T-cell lymphomas has historically been derivative of other aggressive 
lymphomas, utilizing intensive combination chemotherapy programs in the upfront 
setting and non-overlapping cytotoxic regimens upon relapse. However, due to 
tremendous work in understanding the oncogenic basis of these varied diseases, 
an increasing exploration of rational, targeted therapies is underway. Still, 
clinical successes have at times lagged behind pathobiological realizations, and 
there is an evolving need for biologically based, subtype-specific strategies in 
the clinic. Herein we propose a framework for future success that relies upon 
optimizing standard therapy in populations known to benefit from combination 
chemotherapy, building upon CHOP (or CHOP-like) induction with the CHOP + X 
model, exploring the use of targeted platforms in the relapsed and refractory 
setting, and designing biomarker-informed clinical trials that target-specific 
subhistologies and unique molecular subsets."
1162,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a rare myeloproliferative disease in children. 
The primary cause of CML is the chimeric BCR::ABL1 gene in hematopoietic stem

Lately, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have replaced hematopoietic cell 
transplantation, which was previously considered the only curative therapy, as 
the first-line treatment for chronic-phase CML. However, the clinical efficacy 
of TKIs, including those effective in adult CML, has not been well-investigated 
in pediatric CML. This review describes the recommended TKI-based management 
strategies for pediatric CML according to the literature and guidelines. 
Furthermore, we discuss the prospects for TKI discontinuation to avoid important

1163,"The relationship between fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and disease prognosis in 
patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is unclear. This study aimed to 
clarify the relationship between HbF level and the prognosis of MDS. To this 
end, data from 217 patients diagnosed with MDS between April 2006 and August 
2020 at Ebina General Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The primary 
endpoint was leukemia-free survival (LFS) for 5 years after diagnosis. HbF 
levels were significantly higher in patients with MDS than in control patients 
without MDS (n = 155), with a cut-off value of 0.4%. Higher-risk patients had a 
similar prognosis regardless of HbF level, but lower-risk patients had longer 
LFS at intermediate HbF levels. Although prognosis based on pre-treatment HbF 
levels did not differ significantly among azacitidine-treated patients, 
prognosis tended to be better in lower-risk patients with intermediate HbF 
levels. Multivariate analysis showed that the intermediate HbF category 
correlated with LFS, independently of MDS lower-risk prognostic scoring system 
(LR-PSS)-related factors. This study is the first to assess the association 
between HbF levels and the new World Health Organization 2016 criteria for MDS, 
demonstrating the significance of HbF levels in the prognosis of MDS."
1164,"BACKGROUND: Mondia whitei root is often used in Africa as a local therapeutic 
agent for libido enhancement. The fractions of the M. whitei leaves (MWL) lack 
chemical characterization of their bioactive components and possible molecular 
targets. We characterized and investigated its molecular target as therapeutic 
agents in an in vitro and in silico assay. Mineral compositions, antioxidant, 
and GC-MS characterization were studied. The cytotoxicity effect was measured on 
HeLa and HT-29 cells by MTT assay. In silico potential inhibitors of Cathepsin B 
(CathB) as a cancer biomarker were determined.
RESULTS: The flame photometry produced marked Na+ and K+. GC-MS revealed 
eighteen bioactive components. The fractions (chloroformic 47.00, ethanolic 
45.52, and aqueous 40.13) of MWL caused a higher inhibition ratio compared to 
standards. The MWL showed a significant cytotoxic effect on the treated cell 
lines at concentrations of 150 and 200 μg/ml and 100, 150, and 200 μg/ml for 
HT-29 and HeLa cells, respectively. Ten bioactives (MWL 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 
15, 17, and 18) showed potential inhibition of CathB with binding affinities of 
-4.40 to -8.3 Kcal/Mol. However, MWL 4, 9, 14, and 17 which have higher binding 
affinities (-6.7, -7.1, -8.2, and -8.3, respectively) than the standard 
inhibitor (-6.5) were the lead molecules.
CONCLUSION: These chemical profiles and potential molecular targets unraveled in 
this study propose that MWL has a promising anticancer activity."
1165,"In early brain injury (EBI), oxidative stress occurs following subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH), and mitochondria are intricately linked to this process. SS31, 
a mitochondria-targeting antioxidative peptide, has been demonstrated to be 
beneficial for multiple diseases because of its powerful antioxidant and 
neuroprotective properties. Although our previous study revealed that SS31 was 
involved in the powerful antioxidant effect following SAH, the underlying 
molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the 
neuroprotective effects of SS31 by reversing mitochondrial dysfunction in EBI 
following SAH, via activating the Nrf2 signaling and PGC-1α pathways. Our 
findings confirmed that SS31 ameliorated SAH-triggered oxidative insult. SS31 
administration decreased redundant reactive oxygen species, alleviated lipid 
peroxidation, and elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Concomitant 
with the inhibited oxidative insult, SS31 dramatically attenuated neurological 
deficits, cerebral edema, neural apoptosis, and blood-brain barrier disruption 
following SAH. Moreover, SS31 remarkably promoted nuclear factor-erythroid 2 
related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear shuttle and upregulated the expression levels of 
heme oxygenase-1 and NADPH: quinine oxidoreductase1. Additionally, SS31 enhanced 
the expression levels of PGC-1α and its target genes, and increased the mtDNA 
copy number, promoting mitochondrial function. However, PGC-1α-specific 
inhibitor SR-18292 pretreatment dramatically suppressed SS31-induced Nrf2 
expression and PGC-1α activation. Furthermore, pretreatment with SR-18292 
reversed the neuroprotective and antioxidant roles of SS31. These significant 
beneficial effects were associated with the activation of the Nrf2 signaling and 
PGC-1α pathways and were antagonized by SR-18292 administration. Our findings 
reveal that SS31 exhibits its neuroprotective activity by reversing 
mitochondrial dysfunction via activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which could 
be mediated through PGC-1α activation."

Hospitalar de São João were enrolled and evaluated for sociodemographic and 
clinical characterization, beliefs and concerns about Diabetes Mellitus, as well 
as isCGM's perceptions. Intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring 
data were collected to characterize monitoring patterns and to measure isCGM's 
adherence-FL average of scans/day.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with a mean of 30.36 years (sd=11.35) participate 
in this study. A median of 7 scans/day was performed. The adherence predictors 
found was Age (β = 0.191, p = 0.006), Time in target (β = 0.530, p = 0.002), 
isCGM Necessity (β = 2.631, p = 0.048), Body Mass Index (β = -0.549, p = 0.017) 
and Sex (β = -3.996; p = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the relevance of glucose monitoring adherence 
in disease control and shows that males of younger ages, presenting with higher 
body mass index levels, lower time in target, and reporting lower isCGM 
necessity are less adherent to isCGM. Therefore, these patients should be 
closely followed and object of personalized strategies to promote treatment 
adherence."
1167,"Skeletal fragility with high risk of vertebral fractures (VFs) is an emerging 
complication of growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion. VFs often coexist with spine 
arthropathy and both clinical conditions negatively impact on quality of life of 
acromegalic subjects. Management of spine osteopathy and arthropathy in 
acromegaly could be challenging since both complications can persist or even 
progress after biochemical control of disease. This article analyzes the latest 
evidence about possible pathophysiological links between VFs and spine 
arthropathy in active and controlled acromegaly, as well as the diagnostic and 
therapeutic aspects concerning the holistic management of acromegalic 
osteo-arthropathy."
1168,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, an angiogenic factor in the maternal 
circulation, has been suggested to be related to preeclampsia. However, the 
findings from previous studies were inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a 
meta-analysis to assess the difference in circulating TGF-β1 levels between 
women with preeclampsia and normal pregnancies. Twenty-four studies including 
1748 women with PE and 1404 women with normal pregnancy were included in our 
study. The results showed that circulating TGF-β1 levels were not different 
before the time of active disease (standardized mean differences, - 0.46 [95% 
CI, - 0.16 to 0.15]; P = 0.000). At the time of active disease, women with 
preeclampsia (n = 1207) had higher circulating TGF-β1 levels than normotensive 
controls (n = 912; standardized mean differences, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35]; 
P = 0.000). Circulating TGF-β1 levels were higher in both early-onset/severe and 
late-onset/mild types of preeclampsia. No publication biases were found. We 
conclude that preeclamptic women have higher circulating TGF-β1 than those with 
normal pregnancy at the time of preeclampsia diagnosis."
1169,"Extraction and characterization of natural products provide the opportunity to 
expand our arsenal of drug candidates against a wide range of diseases including 
cancer and inflammatory disorders. Previous studies have shown bee venom to have 
immense potential as an anti-inflammatory drug candidate. In this study, we 
focused on the venom of Apis mellifera anatoliaca and characterized its content 
by HPLC. An in vitro inflammation model based on lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-stimulated mammalian macrophages was utilized to examine the venom's 
anti-inflammatory potential. Additionally, its antiproliferative activity was 
evaluated in vitro against a human glioblastoma cell line. Based on the TNF, 
IL6, GMCSF, and IL12p40 pro-inflammatory cytokine production level in 
LPS-induced macrophages, venom-treated groups showed substantial decrease in the 
inflammatory action compared to untreated LPS-stimulated macrophages. When the 
cells were analyzed for viability, the venom did not have any cytotoxic effect 
on the macrophages at the concentration ranges that were utilized. Moreover, 
IC50 value of the venom was above 60 µg/mL on glioblastoma cancer cell line. 
These results suggest that the Apis mellifera anatoliaca venom does not have 
anticancer drug candidate potential, whereas it can efficiently be used against 
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first study 
to specifically examine the effect of anti-inflammatory activity of Apis 
mellifera anatoliaca venom on macrophages."
1170,"The effect of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PGB02 isolated from buttermilk on 
serum cholesterol profile of normal and hypercholesterolemic mice was evaluated. 
Further changes in the expression of mice genes were determined. The 
hypercholesterolemia was induced in experimental mice by feeding high 
cholesterol and fat diet. Serum cholesterol parameters, physical parameters, 
cholic acid excretion, and cholesterol metabolism related gene expression 
analysis was carried out. L. plantarum PGB02 efficiently reduced total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol and improved HDL-cholesterol in 
hypercholesterolaemic mice. Body weight was reduced and fecal cholic acid 
increased in probiotic treatment groups. Gene expression analysis revealed that 
L. plantarum PGB02 up-regulated the expression of LDL receptors, CYP7A1, ABCA1, 
ABCG5, ABCG8, and down-regulated the expression of FXR and NPC1L1 genes. 
Summarizing the mechanism, L. plantarum PGB02 improved hypercholesterolemia by 
increasing bile acid synthesis and excretion, reducing exogeneous cholesterol 
absorption from the intestine, and increased LDL clearance through upregulation 
of LDL-receptors. The present study has given insight into the mechanism of 
serum cholesterol reduction by bile salt hydrolase positive L. plantarum PGB02 
in mice. L. plantarum PGB02 reduced the serum cholesterol level through 
increased bile acid synthesis and deconjugation and reduced absorption of 
cholesterol in the intestine. Isolate PGB02 shown cholesterol removal potential 
as good as statin."
1171,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a ubiquitous environmental persistent organic 
pollutant and a Group 1 carcinogen. Human exposure level of PCP was reported to 
be relatively higher in China than in many other countries, because sodium 
pentachlorophenate was abused as molluscicide in China. PCP can induce oxidative 
stress; however, the relationship of PCP exposure with oxidative stress 
biomarkers (OSBs) in human beings has rarely been documented. In this study, 404 
first-morning urine samples (including repeated samples in three days donated by 
74 participants) were collected from 128 healthy adults (general population 
without occupational exposure to PCP) in autumn and winter of 2018, 
respectively, in Wuhan, central China. Urinary concentrations of PCP and three 
select OSBs [including 8-OHG (abbreviation of 8-hydroxy-guanosine), 8-OHdG 
(8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), and 4-HNEMA (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal mercapturic 
acid), which reflect oxidative damage of RNA, DNA, and lipid, respectively] were 
determined. PCP was detectable in 100% of the urine samples (specific 
gravity-adjusted median concentration: 0.44 ng/mL; range: 0.02-14.2 ng/mL). 
Interday reproducibility of urinary PCP concentrations was excellent (intraclass 
correlation coefficient: 0.88) in three days. Significant differences in PCP 
concentrations were found among different age groups; the group of participants 
aged 20-45 y (median: 0.72 ng/mL) had higher concentrations than those in 
the elders (aged 45-60 y and > 60 y). Spatial disparity was observed in autumn, 
and urban residents had higher PCP concentrations than rural residents (median: 
0.60 vs. 0.31 ng/mL), whereas such disparity was not found in winter. There were 
no season-, sex-, or BMI-related differences between the corresponding 
subgroups. The urinary PCP concentrations were found to be associated with 
increases in 8-OHdG and 8-OHG rather than 4-HNEMA. An interquartile range 
increase in urinary PCP concentration was associated with a 23.5% (95% CI: 
9.18-39.6) increase in 8-OHdG and a 21.3% (95% CI: 9.18-32.4) increase in 8-OHG, 
implied that PCP exposure at environmental relevant dose might be associated 
with nucleic acid oxidative damage in the general population. This pilot study 
reported associations between PCP exposure and OSBs in human beings. Future 
studies are needed to elucidate the mediating roles of OSBs in the association 
between PCP exposure and certain adverse health outcomes."
1172,"Asthma is a common respiratory disease that is affected by air pollutants and 
meteorological factors. In this study, we developed models that predict the 
daily number of patients receiving treatment for asthma using air pollution and 
meteorological data. A neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) and 
fully connected (FC) layers was used. The daily number of asthma patients in the 
city of Seoul, the capital of South Korea, was collected from the National 
Health Insurance Service. The data from 2015 to 2018 were used as the training 
and validation datasets for model development. Unseen data from 2019 were used 
for testing. The daily number of asthma patients per 100,000 inhabitants was 
predicted. The LSTM-FC neural network model achieved a Pearson correlation 
coefficient of 0.984 (P < 0.001) and root mean square error of 3.472 between the 
predicted and original values on the unseen testing dataset. The factors that 
impacted the prediction were the number of asthma patients in the previous time 
step before the predicted date, type of day (regular day and day after a 
holiday), minimum temperature, SO2, daily changes in the amount of cloud, and 
daily changes in diurnal temperature range. We successfully developed a neural 
network that predicts the onset and exacerbation of asthma, and we identified 
the crucial influencing air pollutants and meteorological factors. This study 
will help us to establish appropriate measures according to the daily predicted 
number of asthma patients and reduce the daily onset and exacerbation of asthma 
in the susceptible population."
1173,"BACKGROUND: Management of recurrent rectovaginal fistula (rRVF) remains 
challenging despite the good results of graciloplasty reported in the 
literature. However, little is known about how to avoid a permanent stoma if 
graciloplasty fails. The aim of our study was to report the management of rRVF 
after failure of graciloplasty.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on consecutive patients with rRVF 
after failure of graciloplasty treated at our institution in January 
2005-December 2021.
RESULTS: There were 19 patients, with a median age at graciloplasty of 39 years 
(range 25-64 years). Etiologies of RVF were Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 10), 
postoperative (n = 5), post-obstetrical (n = 3), and unknown (n = 1). After 
failure of graciloplasty, 45 new procedures were performed, all of them with a 
covering stoma: trans-anal repairs (n = 31), delayed colo-anal anastomosis 
(DCAA) (n = 4), biological mesh interposition (n = 3), second graciloplasty 
(n = 3), stoma only (n = 2) and redo ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) 
(n = 2). One patient was not re-operated on and instead treated medically for 
CD. After a mean follow-up of 63 ± 49 months, success (i.e., absence of stoma or 
RVF) was obtained in 11 patients (58%): 4/4 DCAA (100%), 5/31 after local repair 
(16%), 1 after stoma creation alone (50%) and 1 after redo IPAA (50%). Second 
graciloplasty and biologic mesh interposition all failed. All 8 patients with 
failed intervention had CD.
CONCLUSIONS: In cases of rRVF after failed graciloplasty, reoperation is 
possible, although the chance of success is relatively low. The best results 
were obtained with DCAA. CD is a predictor of poor outcome."
1174,"Despite the widespread use of antibiotics, deep neck infections are still a 
relevant clinical problem and can cause severe and potentially life-threatening 
complications. Imaging plays a pivotal role into the clinical management of deep 
neck infections, allowing identification of the source of infections, definition 
of the precise extension of the disease and early diagnosis of local or distant 
complications. The complex anatomy of deep neck spaces may hide the actual 
extent of disease: the knowledge of neck anatomy enables radiologists to rapidly 
evaluate expected routes of spread of infections and to effectively communicate 
crucial information to surgeons. Computed Tomography is the most used imaging 
modality for assessing primary site of infection, extent of disease and local 
complications. Magnetic resonance imaging may be used as a second level imaging 
modality for individuating intracranial or spinal complications. The present 
work aims to review the imaging of deep neck spaces infections, focusing on 
relevant anatomy and clinical scenarios, underlining practical teaching points 
for each of them. Familiarity with deep neck spaces anatomy and knowledge of 
most common routes of spread of infections allow the radiologist to make a 
prompt diagnosis and to look for early signs of potential complications."
1175,"BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
and is associated with a decline in kidney function. However, its impact on 
patients without CKD has not been adequately elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to 
investigate the association between polypharmacy and the incidence of CKD.
METHODS: We conducted retrospective cohort study using 1221 participants who 
were enrolled in the Fukushima Cohort Study with one or more risk factors of 
CKD, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 
without proteinuria. Participants were categorized into three groups based on 
the number of medications: non-polypharmacy, 0-4 medications; polypharmacy, 5-9 
medications; and hyper-polypharmacy, ≥ 10 medications.
RESULTS: The median age was 62 years, 49% were men, the median eGFR was 
75.4 ml/min/1.73 m2, and the median number of medications was 5. Polypharmacy 
and hyper-polypharmacy were noted in 506 (41%) and 250 (20%) participants, 
respectively. During follow-up, 288 participants developed CKD and 67 
cardiovascular events were observed. Compared to the non-polypharmacy group, the 
hyper-polypharmacy group had a higher risk of CKD and cardiovascular events. The 
adjusted hazard ratios were 1.41 (95% CI1.01-1.99) and 2.24 (95% CI1.05-4.78) 
for the incidence of CKD and cardiovascular events, respectively. Sensitivity 
analyses yielded similar findings for the restricted cubic spline function 
models.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyper-polypharmacy is associated with a higher risk of CKD and 
cardiovascular events."
1176,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), 
nutritional status, and uremia management have been emphasized for bone 
management in hemodialysis patients. Nevertheless, valuable data on the 
importance of muscle mass in bone management are limited, including whether 
conventional management alone can prevent osteoporosis. Thus, the importance of 
muscle mass and strength, independent of the conventional management in 
osteoporosis prevention among hemodialysis patients, was evaluated.
METHODS: Patients with a history of hemodialysis 6 months or longer were 
selected. We assessed the risk for osteoporosis associated with calf 
circumference or grip strength using multivariable adjustment for indices of 
CKD-MBD, nutrition, and dialysis adequacy. Moreover, the associations between 
bone mineral density (BMD), calf circumference, grip strength, and bone 
metabolic markers were also evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were included. The odds ratios (95% confidence 
interval) for osteoporosis at the femoral neck were 1.25 (1.04-1.54, P < 0.05) 
and 1.08 (1.00-1.18, P < 0.05) per 1 cm shorter calf circumference or 1 kg 
weaker grip strength, respectively. Shorter calf circumference was significantly 
associated with a lower BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine (P < 0.001). 
Weaker grip strength was also associated with lower BMD at the femoral neck 
(P < 0.01). Calf circumference or grip strength was negatively correlated with 
bone metabolic marker values.
CONCLUSION: Shorter calf circumference or weaker grip strength was associated 
with osteoporosis risk and lower BMD among hemodialysis patients, independent of 
the conventional therapies."
1177,"BACKGROUND: High-risk screening for Fabry disease in dialysis patients is an 
effective means for reducing the number of undiagnosed cases. However, such 
screening has not been conducted in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Herein, we aimed to 
estimate the prevalence of Fabry disease among patients undergoing hemodialysis 
in Chiba Prefecture by high-risk screening using α-galactosidase A (αGal A) 
activity measurement, and examine the hemodialysis effect on αGal A activity.
METHODS: Patients who underwent maintenance hemodialysis at 25 facilities in 
Chiba Prefecture were recruited. The αGal A activity was measured using the 
dried blood spot (DBS) test as the first screening. If the enzyme activity was 
lower than the cut-off, the second screening was performed with the same method 
before and after dialysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 2924 patients (2036 men and 888 women) were included from 
which 94 cases (45 men and 48 women) showed decreased αGAL activity in the first 
screening and 3 (two men and one women) in the second screening. Genetic testing 
was performed in 3 patients, and the c.1078G > A mutation in GLA gene was 
detected in one male patient (0.03%). There has been a statistically significant 
decrease in αGal A activity of DBS at post-dialysis compared to that at 
pre-dialysis (20.5 ± 10.4 pmol/h/disk and 22.7 ± 11.5 pmol/h/disk, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Fabry disease among patients undergoing 
hemodialysis in Chiba Prefecture was estimated as 0.03%. This is the first time 
that dialysis has been shown to affect the αGal A activity."
1178,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of renal impairment in patients with cancer remains 
unclear. We aimed to clarify associations between various cancer sites and renal 
impairment.
METHODS: We reviewed data from 5674 patients aged ≥ 18 years receiving cancer 
treatment at a single hospital facility. The primary endpoints were the 
occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI), a 30% decrease in the estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or death. Survival time was defined as the 
time from study enrolment to AKI occurrence. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional 
hazard analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Hazard ratios (HRs) for AKI occurrence and a ≥ 30% decline in eGFR were 
significantly higher for kidney, urinary tract, pancreatic, liver, and 
gallbladder cancers than for colon cancer. Compared with colon cancer, digestive 
tract cancer showed a significantly higher HR for AKI occurrence alone. The HRs 
for a ≥ 30% decline in eGFR were significantly higher for patients aged 
71‒77 years or ≥ 78 years than for those aged < 68 years, and for patients with 
eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2 than for those with 
eGFR = 45‒59 mL/min/1.73 m2.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney, urinary, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic cancer are associated 
with a higher risk of AKI development and eGFR decrease than other cancers. 
Renal function changes should be more closely monitored in patients with these 
cancers."
1179,"BACKGROUND: Interstitial nephritis is a common cause of renal failure. 
Gallium-67 scintigraphy is reportedly useful for diagnosing interstitial 
nephritis; however, its ability to assess disease activity remains unknown. We 
aimed to analyze the relationship between the renal uptake of gallium-67 and the 
disease activity in interstitial nephritis.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who underwent 
gallium-67 scintigraphy at a hospital in Tokyo. The renal uptake adjusted for 
the soft tissues beneath the kidneys was semi-quantitatively evaluated. We 
compared the renal uptake levels between patients clinically diagnosed with and 
without interstitial nephritis. Among those undergoing renal biopsy, we 
evaluated the predictive ability of gallium-67 scintigraphy and analyzed the 
renal uptake levels regarding the disease activity through a histopathological 
analysis.
RESULTS: We included 143 patients; among them, 30, 17, and 96 patients were 
clinically diagnosed with interstitial nephritis, other kidney diseases, and 
non-kidney diseases, respectively. The renal uptake of gallium-67 was the 
highest among patients with interstitial nephritis. Among the 25 patients who 
underwent renal biopsy, 15 were pathologically diagnosed with interstitial 
nephritis. The renal uptake levels showed a high discriminative ability 
(C-statistic: 0.83). Furthermore, net reclassification improvement with the 
addition of gallium-67 scintigraphy to N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase for the 
prediction of interstitial nephritis was 1.14. Histopathological analysis 
revealed a positive correlation between renal uptake and inflammation in the 
cortex and peritubular capillaries.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the diagnostic value and potential usefulness 
of gallium-67 scintigraphy for evaluating interstitial nephritis."
1180,"Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been widely used in medicine such as imaging, 
drug delivery and therapeutics due to their multifunctional properties. 
Alterations in neuronal function may contribute to various neurological 
diseases. Transferrin plays a primary role in iron transportation and delivery 
and has recently been utilized for drug delivery to the brain. We have 
investigated effects of transferrin-conjugated GNPs (Tf-GNPs) on anxiety and 
locomotor behavior in vivo and also hippocampal neuronal activity ex vivo. 
Electrophysiological effects of Tf-GNP on hippocampal neurons were determined by 
patch clamp method. Fifteen male young adult C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided 
into three groups as control (200 µL PBS), GNP (bare GNP; 2.2 μg/g in PBS) and 
Tf-GNPs (2.2 μg/g Tf-GNP). Animals intraperitoneally received the respective 
treatments for seven consecutive days and were subjected to elevated plus maze 
(EPM) and open field tests (OFT). Ex vivo, firing frequency of the neurons 
significantly increased by GNP treatment (p < 0.001). In vivo, animals in Tf-GNP 
group showed significantly longer distance in open arms but significantly lower 
number of entries to the open arms in EPM (p < 0.05). Mice received bare GNPs 
had significantly higher locomotor activity in OFT (p < 0.05), while Tf-GNP did 
not alter the locomotor activity significantly (p = 0.051). Animals in Tf-GNP 
group spent significantly longer time in the peripheral zone in OFT (p < 0.05). 
The present findings have shown that Tf-GNP induces anxiety-like behavior 
without altering spontaneous firing rate of hippocampal neurons. We suggest that 
neurobiological effects of Tf-GNP should be pre-determined before using in 
medical applications."
1181,"Β-sitosterol is a phytosterol, documented to possess various activities 
including protection against inflammation, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. The 
current investigation was designed to explore the analgesic potential of 
β-sitosterol and the possible molecular mechanism involved in the observed 
effect. β-sitosterol was administered at varying doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg 
before subjecting the mice to acetic acid and formalin challenges. The number of 
writhings in acetic acid and the number of flinchings and foot tappings were 
quantified in the formalin test. For mechanistic studies, substance P 
(cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) stimulator) and L-Nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 
(nitric oxide synthetases (NOS) inhibitor) and L-arginine (nitric oxide 
precursor) were administered before β-sitosterol treatment. β-sitosterol (10, 
20, 40 mg/kg) treatment significantly reduced acetic acid-induced writhings and 
ameliorated the formalin-induced inflammatory phase dose-dependently. Whereas, 
40 mg/kg dose of β-sitosterol abrogated the formalin-induced neurogenic phase. 
Substance-P abrogated the effect of β-sitosterol in both neurogenic and 
inflammatory phases. Whereas, L-arginine only abrogated the inflammatory phase. 
In biochemical analysis, β-sitosterol treatment reduced the level of 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 
increased the level of reduced glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, L-arginine and 
substance-P abrogated the GSH increasing and TBARS lowering effect of 
β-sitosterol (40 mg/kg). Overall, the current study delineated that β-sitosterol 
may induce an anti-nociceptive effect via inhibiting the IL-6, oxidative stress, 
cyclo-oxygenase and nitric oxide."
1182,"The Berlin Grading System assesses clinical severity of moyamoya angiopathy 
(MMA) by combining MRI, DSA, and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC). Our 
aim was to validate this grading system using [15O]H2O PET for CVRC. We 
retrospectively identified bilateral MMA patients who underwent [15O]H2O PET 
examination and were treated surgically at our department. Each hemisphere was 
classified using the Suzuki and Berlin Grading System. Preoperative symptoms and 
perioperative ischemias were collected, and a logistic regression analysis was 
performed. A total of 100 hemispheres in 50 MMA patients (36 women, 14 men) were 
included. Using the Berlin Grading System, 2 (2.8%) of 71 symptomatic 
hemispheres were categorized as grade I, 14 (19.7%) as grade II, and 55 (77.5%) 
as grade III. The 29 asymptomatic hemispheres were characterized as grade I in 7 
(24.1%) hemispheres, grade II in 12 (41.4%), and grade III in 10 (34.5%) 
hemispheres. Berlin grades were independent factors for identifying hemispheres 
as symptomatic and higher grades correlated with increasing proportion of 
symptomatic hemispheres (p < 0.01). The Suzuki grading did not correlate with 
preoperative symptoms (p = 0.26). Perioperative ischemic complications occurred 
in 8 of 88 operated hemispheres. Overall, complications did not occur in any of 
the grade I hemispheres, but in 9.1% (n = 2 of 22) and 9.8% (n = 6 of 61) of 
grade II and III hemispheres, respectively. In this study, we validated the 
Berlin Grading System with the use of [15O]H2O PET for CVRC as it could stratify 
preoperative symptomatology. Furthermore, we highlighted its relevance for 
predicting perioperative ischemic complications."
1183,"PURPOSE: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world after 
cardiovascular disease. The present study aimed to investigate the affordability 
and physical access to chemotherapy drugs among patients with one of the three 
common cancers of the breast, stomach, and colon in the city of Mashhad, Iran, 
in 2021.
METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. Twenty drug stores 
including two public and 18 privates in Mashhad were evaluated. Data was 
collected by consistent stay in the drug stores or pharmacies. For each oncology 
medicine, selling price, lowest general price, and availability were 
investigated. Three approaches have been experimented to calculate the 
affordability of anticancer medicines in this study.
RESULTS: Out of 28 studied medicines from public and private drug stores, 15 
(53.5%) received very low, 8 (28.5%) relatively high, and 2 (7%) high access 
scores. The generic docetaxel brand's ultra-drug and trastuzumab (AryoTrust) 
were the most available drugs, but the doxorubicin (Ebewe), oxaliplatin (Mylan), 
and trastuzumab (Herceptin) were not available to the individuals with cancer. 
Also, the first approach (based on income decile) indicated that insured 
patients from all income deciles were able to pay the costs of the lowest price 
drugs of the DCF drug regimen, and if the patients were insured and belonged to 
the ninth income decile, they had the financial ability to buy drugs at the 
lowest price of the FLO drug regimen.
CONCLUSION: Unaffordability of cancer medicines can lead to treatment 
abandonment and increase inequality in access to healthcare services. Therefore, 
this requires immediate attention of policy makers to be planned in order to 
ensure to reducing the costs of medicines for patients and increasing patient 
access to anticancer medicines."
1184,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect worldwide and a 
main cause of perinatal and infant mortality. Our previous genome-wide 
association study identified 53 SNPs that associated with CHD in the Han Chinese 
population. Here, we performed functional screening of 27 orthologous genes in 
zebrafish using injection of antisense morpholino oligos. From this screen, 5 
genes were identified as essential for heart development, including iqgap2, 
ptprt, ptpn22, tbck and maml3. Presumptive roles of the novel CHD-related genes 
include heart chamber formation (iqgap2 and ptprt) and atrioventricular canal 
formation (ptpn22 and tbck). While deficiency of maml3 led to defective cardiac 
trabeculation and consequent heart failure in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, we 
found that maml3 mutants showed decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation which 
caused a reduction in cardiac trabeculae due to inhibition of Notch signaling. 
Together, our study identifies 5 novel CHD-related genes that are essential for 
heart development in zebrafish and first demonstrates that maml3 is required for 
Notch signaling in vivo."
1185,"Prostate cancer, one of the major causes of mortality globally is regarded as 
the second leading cause of mortality among men. It is known to affect the 
stromal cells surrounding it. Through the use of exosomes, the affected stromal 
cells can promote the growth and spread of the cancer. Exosomes are known to 
play a role not only in the development and progression of cancer but also 
contribute to the drug-resistance character of cancer cells. Recently, the 
discovery of the small non-coding RNAs or miRNA has attracted attention of 
cancer researchers as they can regulate the expression of different genes. 
Therefore, exosomal miRNA can be used as a novel and reliable biomarker for the 
diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. In addition, exosomal miRNAs can 
also be used as a potential treatment for prostate cancer. The goal of this 
review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current knowledge about the 
role of exosomal miRNAs in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer and 
their potential role in monitoring the disease."
1186,"This study assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practices of livestock farmers 
in Namibia's Khomas region and animal health practitioners (veterinarians and 
animal health technicians) in the whole country concerning neosporosis and 
toxoplasmosis. Structured questionnaires were used, and a total of 63 farmers 
and 51 animal health practitioners responded out of an estimated 560 farmers in 
the Khomas region and 300 veterinarians and veterinary technicians in the 
country. Only 15.9% of the livestock farmers (n = 63) had heard about 
neosporosis or toxoplasmosis or knew how animals get infected (p < 0.0001). Only 
5% of the farmers knew the risks associated with keeping dogs and cats 
concerning neosporosis and toxoplasmosis, respectively (p < 0.0001). None of the 
51 animal health practitioners routinely requested Neospora caninum or 
Toxoplasma gondii laboratory tests in cases of cattle, sheep or goat abortions. 
Although all animal health practitioners indicated they routinely interacted 
with livestock farmers, none regularly discussed neosporosis or toxoplasmosis. 
Only 3.9% of animal health practitioners (n = 51) indicated that they had ever 
discussed either neosporosis or toxoplasmosis at a farmers' gathering 
(p < 0.0001), and only 21.6% had talked to at least one cat owner about 
toxoplasmosis in the previous 12 months (p < 0.0001). The authors concluded that 
farmers in the Khomas region were generally unaware of neosporosis and 
toxoplasmosis but could change their attitudes and practices if educated. The 
animal health practitioners lacked a deeper understanding and appreciation of 
the two diseases, which is required to cultivate enough confidence to educate 
farmers. Sharing this research and other relevant information on the two 
diseases at farmers' meetings, veterinary congresses, journals and newsletters 
could help educate farmers and animal health practitioners. Such platforms are 
likely to succeed because both these groups use these forums to get new 
information."
1187,"This study aimed to examine the ability of serum total bilirubin (STB) to 
discriminate between complicated and uncomplicated paediatric acute appendicitis 
(PAA). We conducted a systematic review of the literature that involved an 
extensive search in the main databases of medical bibliography (Medline, PubMed, 
Web of Science, OVID, Scopus, Cochrane Library). Two independent reviewers 
selected the relevant articles based on the previously defined inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Methodological quality of the selected articles was assessed 
using the QUADAS2 index. Data extraction was performed by two independent 
reviewers. A synthesis of the results, a standardization of the metrics and a 
random-effect meta-analysis were performed. Between-study heterogeneity was 
assessed in subgroup analysis by study design. In addition, a diagnostic test 
accuracy (DTA) meta-analysis was performed. This review included 8 studies with 
data from 3634 participants aged between 0 and 18 years (2230 with uncomplicated 
PAA and 1404 with complicated PAA). The random-effects meta-analysis showed 
significantly higher mean STB in the complicated PAA group than in 
the uncomplicated PAA group (difference = 0.27; 95% CI 0.06-0.48) and high 
heterogeneity (I2 = 96%). In subgroup analyses by study design, the difference 
remained significant in prospective studies. The DTA meta-analysis resulted in 
an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.86) and pooled sensitivity and specificity of 
68.53% (95% CI 48.35%-83.51%) and 81.12% (95% CI 67.76%-89.78%), respectively. 
Mean values of STB are higher in children with complicated than uncomplicated 
acute appendicitis, and the diagnostic yield of STB seems to be high. Due to the 
high heterogeneity between studies, these results must be interpreted with 
caution."
1188,"PURPOSE: Existing biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk 
prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors 
for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.
METHODS: An animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR 
technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA 
sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of 
different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were 
subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes 
involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological 
function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and 
apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.
RESULTS: We identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis 
and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. 
Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes 
(RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was 
constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural 
network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified 
patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better 
prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction 
model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA 
successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated 
apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and 
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for 
metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications."
1189,"PURPOSE: Under the umbrella of social cognitive theory, we examined the 
influences of personal, environmental, and behavioral factors on adherence to 
healthy eating behaviors among colorectal cancer survivors.
METHODS: Based on Pluye and Hong's framework, a systematic mixed studies review 
was conducted. An extensive search strategy was applied in PubMed, Web of 
Science, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO (from date of record to 2022 January 22). 
The pillar integration process was employed to integrate the extracted data. The 
Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to appraise the quality of all retained 
studies.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies with a total sample size of 5106 were included in 
the analysis, with 15 quantitative studies, 12 qualitative studies, and 1 mixed 
method study. The critical appraisal showed that 22 of the 28 studies (79%) were 
rated with five stars, while 6 (21%) were rated with four stars. The personal 
factors influencing adherence to healthy eating behaviors among colorectal 
cancer survivors included outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, psychological 
factors, knowledge about healthy eating, demographic and disease 
characteristics, environmental factors incorporated outside information on 
healthy eating, power of surrounding people, social activities, cultural 
milieus, socioeconomic status, and education. The behavioral factors included 
self-regulation of diet, goals, and other behaviors closely related to healthy 
eating behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to healthy eating behaviors among colorectal cancer 
survivors was influenced collectively by personal factors, environmental factors 
and behavioral factors."
1190,"Deep space flight missions will expose astronauts to multiple stressors, 
including sleep fragmentation and space radiation. There is debate over whether 
sleep disruptions are an issue in deep space. While these stressors 
independently impair sensorimotor function, the combined effects on performance 
are currently unknown. String-pulling behavior involves highly organized 
bimanual reach-to-grasp and withdraw movements. This behavior was examined under 
rested wakeful conditions and immediately following one session of sleep 
fragmentation in Sham and irradiated rats 3 months after exposure (10 cGy 
4Helium or 5-ion simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation). Sleep fragmentation 
disrupted several aspects of string-pulling behavior, such that rats' ability to 
grasp the string was reduced, reach endpoint concentration was more variable, 
and distance traveled by the nose increased in the Y-range compared to rested 
wakeful performance. Overall, irradiated rats missed the string more than Sham 
rats 3 months post-exposure. Irradiated rats also exhibited differential 
impairments at 3 months, with additional deficits unveiled after sleep 
fragmentation. 4Helium-exposed rats took longer to approach the string after 
sleep fragmentation. Further, rats exposed to 4Helium traveled shorter withdraw 
distances 3 months after irradiation, while this only emerged in the other 
irradiated group after sleep fragmentation. These findings identify sleep 
fragmentation as a risk for fine motor dysfunction in Sham and irradiated 
conditions, in addition to radiation exposure. There may be complex temporal 
alterations in performance that are stressor- and ion-dependent. Thus, it is 
critical to implement appropriate models of multi-flight stressors and 
performance assessments in preparation for future deep space flight missions."
1191,"PURPOSE: This study aims to analyze the correlation between the prognosis of 
osteochondral lesions of the talus and patient age, gender, duration of illness, 
and injury location, surface area, depth, and volume.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 44 patients who underwent talus 
osteochondral transplantation in the Department of Foot and Ankle Surgery of our 
hospital between January 2017 and December 2020 was performed. The clinical 
medical records of the patients were collected, and the location of the 
osteochondral lesion of the talus was determined according to the nine-division 
method. The surface area, depth, and volume of the osteochondral lesion of the 
talus were measured using mimics software in all patients. The visual analog 
scale (VAS), the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), and the 
SF-36 quality of life questionnaire scores were evaluated before surgery and at 
the last follow-up, and correlation analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Of 44 patients, 30 were followed up with a mean period of 
24.33 ± 12.19 months. There were 18 men and 12 women, with an average age of 
40.73 ± 10.57 years and an average disease duration of 28.30 ± 21.25 months. The 
VAS, AOFAS, and SF-36 scores of all patients at the last follow-up were 
significantly better than those before surgery. The degree of post-operative 
symptom improvement was not correlated with age, sex, duration of illness, and 
injury location, surface area, depth, and volume.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis of osteochondral lesion of the talus is not related to 
patient age, gender, duration of disease, or injury location, surface area, 
depth, and volume."
1192,"The genes encoding the phosphate uptake system in Xanthomonas citri pv. glycines 
12-2 were previously found to be upregulated when in soybean leaves. This study 
thus explored the role of the phosphate uptake system on its virulence to 
soybean. While phoB and pstSCAB mutants were greatly impaired in both inciting 
disease symptoms and growth in soybean, the virulence and growth in soybean of a 
phoU mutant was not reduced when compared with the wildtype strain. The 
expression of phoB and pstSCAB was highly induced in phosphate-deficient media. 
In addition, the expression of phoB, assessed with a fusion to a promoterless 
ice nucleation reporter gene, was greatly increased in soybean leaves, 
confirming that the soybean apoplast is a phosphorus-limited habitat for X. 
citri pv. glycines. Global gene expression profiles of phoB and phoU mutants of 
X. citri pv. glycines conducted under phosphate limitation conditions in vitro 
using RNA-seq revealed that PhoB positively regulated genes involved in signal 
transduction, the xcs cluster type II secretion system, cell motility, and 
chemotaxis, while negatively regulating cell wall and membrane biogenesis, DNA 
replication / recombination and repair, and several genes with unknown function. 
PhoU also positively regulated the same genes involved in cell motility and 
chemotaxis. The severity of bacterial pustule disease was decreased in soybean 
plants grown under high phosphate fertilization conditions, demonstrating that 
high phosphate availability in soybean plants can affect infection by X. citri 
pv. glycines by modulation of the expression of phosphate uptake systems."
1193,"Cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet increased bioenergetic 
demands. Studies in cells and mice have highlighted the importance of oxidative 
metabolism and lipogenesis in prostate cancer, however, the metabolic landscape 
of human prostate cancer remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we 
performed radiometric (14C) and stable (13C) isotope tracing assays in 
precision-cut slices of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Glucose, glutamine, 
and fatty acid oxidation was variably upregulated in malignant PDXs compared to 
benign PDXs. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) and storage of free fatty acids into 
phospholipids and triacylglycerols were increased in malignant PDXs. There was 
no difference in substrate utilization between localized and metastatic PDXs and 
hierarchical clustering revealed marked metabolic heterogeneity across all PDXs. 
Mechanistically, glucose utilization was mediated by acetyl-CoA production 
rather than carboxylation of pyruvate, while glutamine entered the TCA cycle 
through transaminase reactions before being utilized via oxidative or reductive 
pathways. Blocking fatty acid uptake or fatty acid oxidation with 
pharmacological inhibitors was sufficient to reduce cell viability in 
PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs), whereas blockade of DNL, or glucose or glutamine 
oxidation induced variable and limited therapeutic efficacy. These findings 
demonstrate that human prostate cancer, irrespective of disease stage, can 
effectively utilize all metabolic substrates, albeit with marked heterogeneity 
across tumors. We also confirm that fatty acid uptake and oxidation are 
targetable metabolic dependencies in human prostate cancer. Implications: 
Prostate cancer utilizes multiple substrates to fuel energy requirements, yet 
pharmacological targeting of fatty acid uptake and oxidation reveals metabolic 
dependencies in localised and metastatic tumors."
1194,"PURPOSE: A multimodality approach is generally considered for pediatric 
low-grade gliomas (LGG); however, the optimal management remains uncertain. The 
objective of the study was to evaluate treatment outcomes of pediatric LGG, 
focusing on long-term survival and factors related to outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 77 pediatric LGG cases treated at Ramathibodi 
Hospital, Thailand between 2000 and 2018 was performed. The inclusion criteria 
were all pediatric LGG cases aged ≤ 15 years. Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas 
and spinal cord tumors were excluded.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 8.2 years (range, 0.6-19.7). The median 
age at diagnosis was 6.2 years (interquartile range, 3.6-11.4). Treatments 
modality included tumor surgery (93%), chemotherapy (40%), and radiation therapy 
(14%). The 10-year overall survival (OS) and 10-year progression-free survival 
were 94% and 59%, respectively, for the entire cohort. The 10-year OS was 100% 
in three subgroups of patients: pilocytic subtype, WHO grade 1 tumors, and 
recipient of gross total resection. After multivariable analysis, no tumor 
surgery had a significantly unfavorable influence on overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: With a multimodality approach, pediatric LGGs had excellent 
outcome. Gross total resection is the standard primary treatment. Chemotherapy 
is the alternative standard treatment in incomplete resection cases, 
unresectable patients, or patients with progressive disease. Radiation therapy 
should be reserved as a salvage treatment option because of late complications 
that usually affect patients' quality of life."
1195,"PURPOSE: Current management of pediatric intramedullary ependymoma is 
extrapolated from adult series since large studies in children are unavailable. 
This has led us to share our experience with this rare tumor and compare it to 
the literature and to review and highlight important aspects of current 
management and point out inconsistencies.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with intramedullary 
ependymoma managed at our institution between 2004 and 2021.
RESULTS: During the study period, 5 patients were treated for intramedullary 
ependymoma. Cases of myxopapillary ependymoma were excluded. The mean age of our 
cohort was 11.2 years. We identified 4 cases of grade II ependymoma and 1 case 
of grade III ependymoma. Gross tumor removal (GTR) was achieved in two patients 
(40%) of patients. One patient was treated with radiotherapy for recurrence and 
two patients received chemotherapy. There were no cases of recurrence among 
patients treated with GTR, but in all patients treated with STR. Eighty percent 
of patients either improved or stayed stable neurologically. During follow-up 
(mean 73 months), 2 patients died of disease.
CONCLUSION: GTR and tumor grade remain the key prognostic factor of long-term 
tumor-free survival. Many questions prevail regarding outcomes, correct use of 
adjuvant therapy, and prognostic factors."
1196,"IMPORTANCE: Family income is known to be associated with children's health; the 
association may be particularly pronounced among lower-income children in the 
US, who tend to have more limited access to health resources than their 
higher-income peers.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of family income with claims-based 
measures of morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents in 
lower-income families in the US enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health 
Insurance Program.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional analysis included 
795 000 participants aged 5 to 17 years enrolled in Medicaid (Medicaid Analytic 
eXtract claims, 2011-2012) living in families with income below 200% of the 
federal poverty threshold (American Community Survey, 2008-2013). Follow-up 
ended in December 2021.
EXPOSURES: Family income relative to the federal poverty threshold.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Record of International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision codes for an infection, mental health disorder, injury, asthma, 
anemia, or substance use disorder and death record within 10 years of 
observation (Social Security Administration death records through 2021).
RESULTS: Among 795 000 individuals in the sample (all statistics weighted: mean 
[SD] income-to-poverty ratio, 90% [53%]; mean [SD] age, 10.6 [3.9] years; 56% 
aged 10 to 17 years), 33% had a diagnosed infection, 13% had a mental health 
disorder, 6% had an injury, 5% had asthma, 2% had anemia, 1% had a substance use 
disorder, and 0.6% died between 2011 and 2021, with the mean (SD) age at death 
of 19.8 (4.2) years. For those aged 5 to 9 years, higher family income was 
associated with lower adjusted prevalence of all outcomes, except mortality: 
children in families with an additional 100% income relative to the federal 
poverty threshold had 2.3 (95% CI, 1.8-2.9) percentage points fewer infections, 
1.9 (95% CI, 1.5-2.2) percentage points fewer mental health diagnoses, 0.7 (95% 
CI, 0.5-0.8) percentage points fewer injuries, 0.3 (95% CI, 0.09-0.5) percentage 
points less asthma, 0.2 (95% CI, 0.08-0.3) percentage points less anemia, and 
0.06 (95% CI, 0.03-0.09) percentage points fewer substance use disorder 
diagnoses. Except for injury and anemia, the associations were more pronounced 
among those aged 10 to 17 years than those 5 to 9 years (P for interaction 
<.05). For those aged 10 to 17 years, an additional 100% income relative to the 
federal poverty threshold was associated with a lower 10-year mortality rate by 
0.18 (95% CI, 0.12-0.25) percentage points.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among children and adolescents in the US aged 5 to 17 
years with family income under 200% of the federal poverty threshold who 
accessed health care through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance 
Program, higher family income was significantly associated with a lower 
prevalence of diagnosed infections, mental health disorders, injury, asthma, 
anemia, and substance use disorders and lower 10-year mortality. Further 
research is needed to understand whether these associations are causal."
1197,"IMPORTANCE: Most studies of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 
genetics have used kidney specialty cohorts, focusing on PKD1 and PKD2. These 
can lead to biased estimates of population prevalence of ADPKD-associated gene 
variants and their phenotypic expression.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of ADPKD and contributions of PKD1, PKD2, 
and other genes related to cystic kidney disease in a large, unselected cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational study used 
an unselected health system-based cohort in central and northeast Pennsylvania 
with exome sequencing (enrolled from 2004 to 2020) and electronic health record 
data (up to October 2021). The genotype-first approach included the entire 
cohort and the phenotype-first approach focused on patients with ADPKD diagnosis 
codes, confirmed by chart and imaging review.
EXPOSURES: Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in PKD1, PKD2, and other genes 
associated with cystic kidney disease (ie, ALG8, ALG9, DNAJB11, GANAB, HNF1B, 
IFT140, SEC61B, PKHD1, PRKCSH, SEC63); likely pathogenic missense variants in 
PKD1 and PKD2.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genotype-first analysis: ADPKD diagnosis code 
(Q61.2, Q61.3, 753.13, 753.12); phenotype-first analysis: presence of a rare 
variant in PKD1, PKD2, or other genes associated with cystic kidney disease.
RESULTS: Of 174 172 patients (median age, 60 years; 60.6% female; 93% of 
European ancestry), 303 patients had ADPKD diagnosis codes, including 235 with 
sufficient chart review data for confirmation. In addition to PKD1 and PKD2, LOF 
variants in IFT140, GANAB, and HNF1B were associated with ADPKD diagnosis after 
correction for multiple comparisons. Among patients with LOF variants in PKD1, 
66 of 68 (97%) had ADPKD; 43 of 43 patients (100%) with LOF variants in PKD2 had 
ADPKD. In contrast, only 24 of 77 patients (31.2%) with a PKD1 missense variant 
previously classified as ""likely pathogenic"" had ADPKD, suggesting 
misclassification or variable penetrance. Among patients with ADPKD diagnosis 
confirmed by chart review, 180 of 235 (76.6%) had a potential genetic cause, 
with the majority being rare variants in PKD1 (127 patients) or PKD2 (34 
patients); 19 of 235 (8.1%) had variants in other genes associated with cystic 
kidney disease. Of these 235 patients with confirmed ADPKD, 150 (63.8%) had a 
family history of ADPKD. The yield for a genetic determinant of ADPKD was higher 
for those with a family history of ADPKD compared with those without family 
history (91.3% [137/150] vs 50.6% [43/85]; difference, 40.7% [95% CI, 
29.2%-52.3%]; P < .001). Previously unreported PKD1, PKD2, and GANAB variants 
were identified with pedigree data suggesting pathogenicity, and several PKD1 
missense variants previously reported as likely pathogenic appeared to be 
benign.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates substantial genetic and 
phenotypic variability in ADPKD among patients within a regional health system 
in the US."
1198,"BACKGROUND: Increasing antibiotic-resistant Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) 
strains complicate efforts to eradicate infection. In regions with high dual 
resistance to both clarithromycin and metronidazole, bismuth quadruple therapy 
is recommended. But, with lack of easy availability of bismuth, the 
(non-bismuth) concomitant and sequential regimens are used commonly as 
first-line therapy. Recent reports indicate suboptimal results with sequential 
therapy in such regions. We aimed to compare the efficacy of concomitant therapy 
vs. sequential therapy in the eradication of H. pylori in a region with high 
antibiotic resistance rates, and to compare adherence rates and adverse events 
with the regimens.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four consecutive H. pylori-infected patients 
(diagnosed using rapid urease test or urea breath test) were randomized to 
receive sequential or concomitant therapy for 10 days each. Four weeks after 
treatment completion, urea breath test was done to confirm eradication of the 
infection. Cure rates were compared between the two regimens and note was made 
of adherence rates and adverse events.
RESULTS: Concomitant therapy showed a statistically non-significant higher cure 
rate compared to sequential therapy in intention-to-treat (87.1% vs. 81.4%%, p = 
0.46) and per-protocol (94.7% vs. 83.9%, p = 0.07) analyses. Both the regimens 
were well tolerated and showed similar adherence rates (p = 1.00) and incidence 
of adverse events (p = 0.44).
CONCLUSION: In a region with high dual resistance, both concomitant and 
sequential therapy for H. pylori infection achieved eradication rates >80%, but 
concomitant therapy showed a statistically non-significant higher cure rate, 
with similar adherence and adverse event profiles."
1199,"PURPOSE: Meaning-making is fundamental to the cancer experience and 
communication within cancer care is saturated with metaphors. The objective of 
this study was to better understand the impact and function of war metaphors 
among patients with cancer.
METHODS: Patients at the Duke Cancer Center were purposively sampled for 
inclusion based on type and stage of their cancer. Each patient underwent a 
semi-structured interview to explore their use of metaphors in their lived 
experience with cancer. Qualitative interviews broadly explored two key areas of 
interest: (1) frequency and use of metaphors to describe cancer diagnosis, 
treatment, or survivorship; (2) function and impact of the war metaphor on the 
patient experience of cancer.
RESULTS: Fifteen participants with either breast, lung, or colorectal cancer 
were interviewed. Most patients used metaphor themes of journey, war, and 
mystery to describe their cancer. All patients with non-metastatic disease used 
war metaphors and described how these metaphors facilitated meaning-making by 
promoting positivity and situating cancer within a larger life story. The few 
patients who did not use war metaphors had metastatic disease, and they 
explained that war metaphors were unhelpful due to feeling a lack of control 
over their metastatic disease and outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The war metaphor should remain an integral part of cancer care. 
Disregarding war metaphors robs patients of an important framework for 
meaning-making-one that may promote strength, continuity, and resilience in 
navigating cancer."
1200,"Multiple symptom tracking applications (apps) were created during the early 
phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. While they provided crowdsourced information 
about the state of the pandemic in a scalable manner, they also posed 
significant privacy risks for individuals. The present study investigates the 
interplay between individual privacy attitudes and the adoption of symptom 
tracking apps. Using the communication privacy theory as a framework, it studies 
how users' privacy attitudes changed during the public health emergency compared 
to the pre-COVID times. Based on focus-group interviews (N=21), this paper 
reports significant changes in users' privacy attitudes toward such apps. 
Research participants shared various reasons for both increased acceptability 
(e.g., disease uncertainty, public good) and decreased acceptability (e.g., 
reduced utility due to changed lifestyle) during COVID. The results of this 
study can assist health informatics researchers and policy designers in creating 
more socially acceptable health apps in the future."
1201,"BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical approach with electrical 
stimulation of certain parts of the brain, which reduce Parkinson's disease (PD) 
symptoms. Since the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is the 
main pathophysiology of PD, we aimed to evaluate the association of response to 
DBS with preoperative dopamine transporter density (DAT) and its postoperative 
changes in PD patients who underwent the bilateral implantation of the 
electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN).
METHOD: A prospective evaluation of Parkinson's disease patients who underwent 
STN-DBS for 2 years was done. 99mTc-TRODAT-1 single-photon emission computed 
tomography (SPECT) scan and assessment of PD using unified Parkinson's disease 
rating scale (UPDRS) III were performed in both pre- and post-operation states. 
The correlation of response to DBS after 6 months was assessed with baseline 
findings and postoperative changes of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT parameters.
RESULTS: Compared to the preoperative state, UPDRS III scores and Levodopa 
equivalent daily dose (LEDD) were significantly decreased after DBS. However, in 
17 patients who underwent both pre-and post-operative 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT, no 
significant change was seen in any quantitative parameters, including right and 
left striatal-binding ratio (SBR) as well as striatal asymmetry index (SAI). No 
significant correlation was also found between the percent of UPDRS III change 
after DBS and values of preoperative SBRs. The percentage of LEDD reduction also 
showed no significant correlation with the preoperative state of 99 m-TRODAT-1 
SPECT.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the mechanism of DBS action is not 
accompanied by short-term compensation of DAT in basal ganglia in severely 
advanced PD."
1202,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: In pediatric populations, the epidemiology of facial trauma, 
their injury patterns, distribution, and outcomes are well known, However, 
little is known about the risk factors and impacts of minor and moderate facial 
injuries on in-hospital mortality among children in the United States of America 
(USA). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors 
for in-hospital mortality among pediatric patients following facial injuries in 
the USA.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with data from the 
National Trauma Data Bank's pediatric hospitalized patients (<18 years) with 
facial injuries (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 
802.00 to 802.9 and Tenth Revision codes S02.2 to S02.92) between January 01, 
2016-December 31, 2019. A multivariable logistic regression model was utilized 
to identify the risk factors for in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 61,294 pediatric patients (mean age 11.9 years, 69.6% males) 
were included in the analysis. The estimated prevalence of in-hospital mortality 
following facial injuries was 2.4% (n = 1480). In terms of mortality, compared 
to those who sustained minor facial injuries, patients with (1) moderate 
injuries had 43% higher odds (OR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.25-1.64, p < .0001), (2) 
serious injuries had seven times higher odds (OR = 7.81; 95% CI: 6.67-9.14, 
p < .0001), (3) severe injuries had 16 times higher odds (OR = 16.07; 95% CI: 
12.62-20.46, p < .0001), and (4) critical/maximum injury virtually unsurvivable 
had 145 times higher odds (OR = 145.24; 95% CI: 113.82-185.33, p < .0001) of 
death after controlling for age, race, insurance status, comorbidities, and 
hospital complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The severity of facial injury, age 5-17 years, uninsured status, 
and those with a mental/personality disorder were risk factors for in-hospital

population-level analysis. A better understanding of these risk factors is 
needed for clinical management of pediatric patients to prevent in-hospital 
mortality following facial injuries."
1203,"AIMS: To establish normal reference values of urine flow acceleration (Qacc ) in 
healthy children, as there is a lack of nomograms for normative reference values 
of Qacc by voided volumes in the pediatric population so far. Qacc might be an 
early indicator of autonomic neuropathy in children and adolescents.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from healthy children who underwent 
uroflowmetry between 1990 and 1992. Exclusion criteria were voided volume less 
than 20 ml, and postvoid residual more than 15%. Baseline characteristics and 
uroflowmetry parameters were collected from girls and boys aged between 6 and 18 
years. Voided volume, voiding time, time to maximum flow rate, and maximum and 
average flow rates of urine were measured, and Qacc was calculated. Postvoid 
bladder diameter was measured by ultrasonography and converted to volume.
RESULTS: Uroflowmetry parameters of 208 children (≤18 years old, 45.2% girls, 
mean age 9.68 ± 3.09 years) who performed 404 micturition were analyzed. Median 
voided volume, voiding time, time to Qmax , Qave , Qmax , Qacc , and postvoid 
residual volume were 130 [20-460] ml, 10 [3-56] s, 3 [1-14] s, 11.7 
[2.5-36.6] ml/s, 20.5 [5-50] ml/s, 6 [0.81-25] ml/s2 , and 1.83 [0-38.62] ml, 
respectively. Qacc nomograms were given in centile forms for girls and boys 
separately, which show an inversely proportional correlation between voided 
volumes.
CONCLUSIONS: These are the first nomograms for normative reference values of 
Qacc in the pediatric population (girls and boys separately) by voided volumes 
in centile forms. These may be useful to interpret abnormal Qacc values and 
diagnose lower urinary tract diseases over a wide range of voided volumes."
1204,"Advanced therapies have transformed the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; 
however, many patients fail to respond, highlighting the need for therapies 
tailored to the underlying cell and molecular disease drivers. The 
first-in-class oral molecule ABX464 (obefazimod), which selectively up-regulates 
miR-124, has demonstrated its ability to be a well-tolerated treatment with 
rapid and sustained efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we 
provide evidence that ABX464 impacts the immune system in vitro, in murine model 
of IBD, as well as in patients with UC. In vitro, ABX464 treatment up-regulated 
miR-124 and led to decreases in proinflammatory cytokines including IL17 and 
IL6, and in the chemokine CCL2. Consistently, miR-124 expression was upregulated 
in the rectal biopsies and blood samples of UC patients and a parallel reduction 
in Th17 cells and IL17a levels was observed in serum samples. In a mouse model 
of induced intestinal inflammation with dextran sulfate sodium, ABX464 reversed 
the increases in multiple proinflammatory cytokines in the colon and the 
upregulation of IL17a secretion in the mesenteric lymph nodes. By up-regulating 
miR-124, ABX464 acts as ""a physiological brake"" of inflammation which may 
explain the efficacy of ABX464 with a favorable tolerability and safety profile 
in UC patients."
1205,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) seriously threatens human health and generally 
results from dysfunction of relevant module molecules, which dynamically change 
with time and conditions, rather than that of an individual molecule. In this 
study, a novel network construction algorithm for identifying early warning 
network signals (IEWNS) is proposed for improving the performance of LUAD early 
diagnosis. To this end, we theoretically derived a dynamic criterion, namely, 
the relationship of variation (RV), to construct dynamic networks. RV infers 
correlation [Formula: see text] statistics to measure dynamic changes in 
molecular relationships during the process of disease development. Based on the 
dynamic networks constructed by IEWNS, network warning signals used to represent 
the occurrence of LUAD deterioration can be defined without human intervention. 
IEWNS was employed to perform a comprehensive analysis of gene expression 
profiles of LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The experimental results suggest that the 
potential biomarkers selected by IEWNS can facilitate a better understanding of 
pathogenetic mechanisms and help to achieve effective early diagnosis of LUAD. 
In conclusion, IEWNS provides novel insight into the initiation and progression 
of LUAD and helps to define prospective biomarkers for assessing disease 
deterioration."
1206,"Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The disease progression 
of sepsis is very fast, and there is a 7-9% increase in mortality every hour. 
Therefore, rapid and sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria is crucial for 
the timely treatment of sepsis as well as the reduction of mortality. Herein, we 
present a sensitive near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence identification and a rapid 
magnetic capture based on bioorthogonal nanoprobes for the detection of multiple 
bacteria in whole blood. The nanoprobes with NIR fluorescence/magnetic 
properties were modified with dibenzocyclooctyne groups and used to capture and 
recognize the bacteria via bioorthogonal reaction. The magnetic nanoprobes 
showed superparamagnetic properties with a saturation magnetization as high as 
63 emu/g. Through clicking with the azide groups inserted on the bacteria walls 
by metabolic engineering, the bioorthogonal magnetic nanoprobes allow fast and 
broad-spectrum capture of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The 
bioorthogonal NIR fluorescent nanoprobes with a maximum emission at 900 nm can 
effectively avoid background interference, further enabling sensitive 
identification of the bacteria in whole blood. The detection limit was as low as 
4 CFU/mL in less than 2.5 h and the nanoprobes were successfully applied to the 
detection of bacteria in blood samples from the patients with sepsis, showing 
the potential application in early sepsis diagnosis and clinical studies."
1207,"Cancer screening is invaluable for early detection of disease, including for 
breast and lung cancer. Through early detection, cancer treatment can be 
commenced prior to the development of advanced stage disease, significantly 
reducing morbidity and mortality. However, eligible patients may face barriers 
when accessing screening services, and some groups may be more 
disproportionately affected than others. This review aims to describe some of 
the most prominent barriers that at-risk populations may face when accessing 
image-based cancer screening services in Canada. Characterizing these barriers 
would be helpful in determining the best strategies to increase uptake to these 
screening services and, consequently, improve health equity."
1208,"Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is a nutritionally important fruit of high nutritive 
value, delicious in taste with an attractive aroma. Due to their antioxidant and 
therapeutic potential, mango fruits are receiving special attention in 
biochemical and pharmacognosy-based studies. Fruit quality determines consumer's 
acceptance, and hence, understanding the physiological, biochemical, and 
molecular basis of fruit development, maturity, ripening, and storage is 
essential. Transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and molecular genetic 
approaches have led to the identification of key genes, metabolites, protein 
candidates, and quantitative trait loci that are associated with enhanced mango 
fruit quality. The major pathways that determine the fruit quality include amino 
acid metabolism, plant hormone signaling, carbohydrate metabolism and transport, 
cell wall biosynthesis and degradation, flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis, 
and carotenoid metabolism. Expression of the polygalacturonase, cutin synthase, 
pectin methyl esterase, pectate lyase, β-galactosidase, and ethylene 
biosynthesis enzymes are related to mango fruit ripening, flavor, firmness, 
softening, and other quality processes, while genes involved in the MAPK 
signaling pathway, heat shock proteins, hormone signaling, and phenylpropanoid 
biosynthesis are associated with diseases. Metabolomics identified volatiles, 
organic acids, amino acids, and various other compounds that determine the 
characteristic flavor and aroma of the mango fruit. Molecular markers 
differentiate the mango cultivars based on their geographical origins. Genetic 
linkage maps and quantitative trait loci studies identified regions in the 
genome that are associated with economically important traits. The review 
summarizes the applications of omics techniques and their potential applications 
toward understanding mango fruit physiology and their usefulness in future mango 
breeding."
1209,"BACKGROUND: The most common operations performed for secondary 
hyperparathyroidism include subtotal parathyroidectomy (STPX) and total 
parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation (TPX + AT). We present a series of 
ESRD patients treated with total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation 
(TPX).
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of ESRD patients, age 18 years 
or older, with three or more glands resected on final pathology and follow-up 
parathyroid hormone levels obtained up to 1.5 years postoperatively. The primary 
endpoint was recurrence of hyperparathyroidism (defined as PTH > 500 pg/mL).
RESULTS: The incidence of recurrent hyperparathyroidism at 1.5 years was 5.9% 
(2/34). The incidence of persistent hyperparathyroidism at 1.5 years was 11.8% 
(4/34). In this series, no patients were hospitalized for symptomatic 
hypocalcemia or experienced pathologic bone fractures.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence rates are low with TPX. The most common cause of 
recurrent and persistent disease is resection of three rather than four glands. 
The known complications of TPX, pathologic fractures, and severe hypocalcemia, 
were not seen in this study."
1210,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the methods for the in-person assessment of the RISE FOR 
HEALTH (RISE) study, a population-based multicenter prospective cohort study 
designed to identify factors that promote bladder health and/or prevent lower 
urinary tract symptoms in adult women, conducted by the Prevention of Lower 
Urinary Tract Symptoms Research Consortium (PLUS).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A subset of RISE participants who express interest in the 
in-person assessment will be screened to ensure eligibility (planned n = 525). 
Eligible consenting participants are asked to complete 15 physical assessments 
in addition to height and weight, to assess pelvic floor muscle function, 
musculoskeletal (MSK) status, and pain, and to provide urogenital microbiome 
samples. Pelvic floor muscle assessments include presence of prolapse, strength, 
levator attachment integrity (tear) and myofascial pain. MSK tests evaluate core 
stability, lumbar spine, pelvic girdle and hip pain and function. Participants 
are asked to complete the Short Physical Performance Battery to measure balance, 
lower extremity strength, and functional capacity. All participants are asked to 
provide a voided urine sample and a vaginal swab for microbiome analyses; a 
subset of 100 are asked to contribute additional samples for feasibility and 
validation of a home collection of urinary, vaginal, and fecal biospecimens.
RESULTS: Online and in-person training sessions were used to certify research 
staff at each clinical center before the start of RISE in-person assessments. 
Standardized protocols and data collection methods are employed uniformly across 
sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The RISE in-person assessment is an integral portion of the overall 
population-based RISE study and represents an innovative approach to assessing 
factors hypothesized to promote bladder health and/or prevent lower urinary 
tract symptoms. Data collected from this assessment will be used to prioritize 
future research questions and prevention strategies and interventions. This 
description of the assessment methods is intended to provide methodologic 
transparency and inform other researchers who join efforts to understand and 
improve bladder health."
1211,"BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a cutaneous tumor with a high 
tendency to metastasize, and a significant proportion of patients have 
metastases at first presentation. This study aims to determine the value of 
baseline ultrasound (US) and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (18 FDG-PET/CT) imaging in both patients with 
clinically localized MCC (Stage I/II) and patients who present with palpable 
lymph nodes (Stage III).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort included 135 MCC patients who underwent 
baseline US (with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)) and/or FDG-PET/CT 
imaging between 2015 and 2021.
RESULTS: Of the 104 patients with clinically localized disease, 48% were 
upstaged to Stage III and 3% to Stage IV by imaging or sentinel lymph node 
biopsy (SLNB). FDG-PET/CT imaging identified regional metastases in 23%, while 
US with FNAC identified regional metastases in 19%. SLNB was performed in 56 
patients, of whom 57% were upstaged to Stage III. Of the 31 patients who 
presented with palpable lymph nodes, 16% were upstaged to Stage IV by FDG-PET/CT 
imaging.
CONCLUSION: Baseline imaging frequently upstages Stage I/II MCC patients to 
Stage III, both by US and FDG-PET/CT, Stage IV disease is rarely identified. 
Patients who present with palpable nodes are frequently upstaged to Stage IV by 
FDG-PET/CT imaging."
1212,"BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is associated with intestinal inflammation and 
dysbiosis. Previous studies have shown that probiotics are potential agents for 
treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Jiang-shui is a traditional 
fermented vegetable which are rich in lactic acid bacteria (LAB). But the 
preventive effect of LAB in Jiang-shui on IBD is not yet fully understood.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 38 LAB strains were isolated from Jiang-shui 
and Lactobacillus plantarum JS19 exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity 
among them. Our data indicate that oral administration of L. plantarum JS19 
significantly inhibited body weight loss, colon shortening and damage as well as 
reduced the disease activity index score in the mic with DSS-induced colitis. In 
addition, L. plantarum JS19 also alleviated inflammatory responses and oxidative 
stress through reducing lipid peroxidation, TNF-α expression and myeloperoxidase 
activity and enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activity. Importantly, L. 
plantarum JS19 significantly rebalanced DSS-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota.
CONCLUSION: L. plantarum JS19 may be used as a potential probiotic to prevent 
IBD, particularly ulcerative colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

1213,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous condition with multifactorial 
pathogenesis. We studied deeply phenotyped individuals with microbiota 
sequencing enrolled in the American Gut Project. The IBS subjects were matched 
by age, gender, body mass index, geography, and dietary patterns with non-IBS 
controls. A total of 942 subjects with IBS-Diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS-Constipation 
(IBS-C), unclassified IBS (IBS-U), and 942 non-IBS controls were included. We 
compared taxonomic and functional composition of gut microbiota based on 16S 
sequencing data and linked them with clinical characteristics and dietary 
factors. Subjects with IBS-D or IBS-U but not IBS-C showed significantly reduced 
bacterial diversity (Shannon; p < .01). Distinct bacterial signatures were 
associated with different IBS subtypes, and the related functional changes were 
related to IBS pathogenesis, such as the increased hydrogen sulfide production 
pathway in IBS-D and the increased palmitoleate biosynthesis pathway in IBS-C. 
IBS subjects with depression showed lower abundance of Bifidobacterium, 
Sutterella, Butyricimonas and higher abundance of Proteus than those without 
depression. The relative abundance of microbial short-chain fatty acid 
production pathways was significantly lower in IBS patients with depression than 
those without depression in all three subtypes. Female, younger age in IBS-D, 
and older age in IBS-C were associated with more severe microbiota dysbiosis, 
and distinct dietary factors had significant effects on the gut microbiota in 
different IBS subtypes. Our analysis identified the compositional uniqueness of 
gut microbiota in different IBS subtypes. Distinct associations of the gut 
microbiota with depression in IBS provide insights into shared pathways in 
disease pathogenesis. These findings highlight the importance of personalized 
gut microbiome modulation approaches in different subtypes for optimal 
therapeutic effects."
1214,"BACKGROUND: Compared to other sarcomas, myxoid liposarcoma (ML) is known to be 
radiosensitive, with improved oncologic outcomes. Although these tumors ""shrink"" 
following radiotherapy, there is a paucity of data examining the degree of 
radiosensitivity and oncologic outcome. The purpose of the study was to evaluate 
pre- and postradiotherapy tumor volume to determine if size reduction impacts 
outcome.
METHODS: We reviewed 62 patients with ML undergoing surgical resection combined 
with preoperative radiotherapy, with pre- and postradiotherapy MRI. This 
included 34 (55%) males, with a mean age of 47 ± 14 years. All tumors were deep 
to the fascia, and 12 (19%) patients had tumors with a >5% round-cell component.
RESULTS: The mean volume reduction was 54% ± 29%. Compared to patients with >25% 
volume reduction, patients with reduction ≤25% had worse 10-year disease 
specific survival (86% vs. 37%, p < 0.01), in addition to an increased risk of 
metastatic disease (HR 4.63, p < 0.01) and death due to disease (HR 4.52, 
p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Lack of volume reduction is a risk factor for metastatic disease and 
subsequent death due to disease in patients with extremity ML treated with 
combined preoperative radiotherapy and surgery. This data could be used to 
stratify patients for adjuvant therapies and follow-up intervals."
1215,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of Medicaid expansion on the 
surgical care of inflammatory bowel disease. We sought to determine whether 
Medicaid expansion is associated with improved postsurgical outcomes for 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing a colorectal resection.
METHODS: We performed a risk-adjusted difference-in-difference study examining 
postsurgical outcomes for patients ages 26 to 64 with Crohn's disease or 
ulcerative colitis undergoing a colorectal resection across 15 states that did 
and did not expand Medicaid before (2012-2013) and after (2016-2018) policy 
reform. Primary study outcomes included 30-day readmission and postoperative 
complication.
RESULTS: Study population included 11 394 patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease that underwent a colorectal resection. States that underwent Medicaid 
expansion were associated with a rise in Medicaid enrollment following policy 
reform (11.8% pre-Medicaid expansion vs 19.7% post-Medicaid expansion). 
Difference-in-difference analysis revealed a statistically significant lower 
odds of 30-day readmission in patients undergoing a colorectal resection in 
expansion states following policy reform relative to patients in nonexpansion 
states prior to reform (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.86). 
No changes in odds of postoperative complication were noted across expansion and 
nonexpansion states.
CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid expansion is associated with a rise in Medicaid enrollment 
in expansion states following policy reform. There were greater improvements in 
postoperative outcomes associated with patients in expansion states following 
policy reform relative to patients in nonexpansion states prior to reform, which 
may have been related to improved perioperative care and medical management."
1216,"BACKGROUND: Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and End Stage Kidney Disease 
(ESKD) are independent conditions associated with increased mortality and 
morbidity, however, whether ESKD is an independent risk factor for increased 
mortality in HIT admissions is not well studied. Therefore, we aimed to compare 
in-hospital mortality in HIT admissions based on their ESKD status.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of HIT hospitalizations aged 18 
and older using the 2016-2019 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.
RESULTS: From 2016 to 2019 we had 12,161 admissions for HIT among 28,484,087 
total hospitalizations. The annual incidence rate for HIT admissions per 100,000 
admissions were: 47, 46, 41.1, and 36.6, respectively (p<0.001) in 2016, 2017, 
2018, and 2019 respectively. Among HIT admissions, the mean age was 64.3 years, 
46.8% were females, 68% were Whites and 16% were Blacks. Black patients have a 
significantly higher likelihood of in-hospital mortality than White patients 
(aOR 1.25; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.48; p=0.007). Patients who didn't have any insurance 
or self-pay had higher mortality compared to Medicare (aOR 1.64; 95% CI: 1.13, 
2.38; p=0.009). ESKD status was not associated with higher or lower in-hospital 
mortality among HIT admissions (aOR 1.002; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.19; p=0.981) after 
adjusting for age, sex, race, and insurance status.
CONCLUSIONS: There are no higher or lower odds of in-hospital mortality in the 
ESKD subgroup in HIT admissions in adults. Decreasing incidence of HIT 
hospitalizations was seen over the years from 2016 to 2019. This article is

1217,"Dysregulation of the gut microbiota by environmental factors is associated with 
a variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases. In addition, 
naturally-occurring extracellular antibiotic resistance genes (eARGs) might 
directly enter the gut via the food chain. However, following gut microbiota 
exposure to eARGs, the ecological processes shaping the microbiota community 
assembly, as well as the interplay between the microbiota composition, metabolic 
function, and the immune responses, are not well understood. Increasing focus on 
the One Health approach has led to an urgent need to investigate the direct 
health damage caused by eARGs. Herein, we reveal the significant influence of 
eARGs on microbiota communities, strongly driven by stochastic processes. How 
eARGs-stimulate variations in the composition and metabolomic function of the 
gut microbiota led to cytokine responses in mice of different age and sex were 
investigated. The results revealed that cytokines were significantly associated 
with immunomodulatory microbes, metabolites, and ARGs biomarkers. Cytokine 
production was associated with specific metabolic pathways (arachidonic acid and 
tryptophan metabolic pathways), as confirmed by ex vivo cytokine responses and 
recovery experiments in vivo. Furthermore, the gut microbial profile could be 
applied to accurately predict the degree of intestinal inflammation ascribed to 
the eARGs (area under the curve = 0.9616). The present study provided a 
comprehensive understanding of the influence of an eARGs on immune responses and 
intestinal barrier damage, shedding light on the interplay between eARGs, 
microbial, metabolites, and the gut antibiotic resistome in modulating the human 
immune system."

woman with no significant past medical history. The patient was diagnosed with 
Achenbach syndrome, a rare condition that is generally considered transient and 
benign. The underlying pathophysiology of this condition is unclear, but may be 
related to transient subcutaneous ecchymosis, possibly from microtrauma. If the 
condition recurs, a workup can include laboratory tests for autoimmune diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis. Clinician awareness of this presentation may 
reduce patient anxiety and unnecessary testing."

1220,"Nanotechnology-based drug-free therapeutic systems utilizing external stimuli 
can avoid the inherent side effects of drugs and become an attractive 
therapeutic strategy. However, the cellular stress responses (CSR) are activated 
encounter with external stimuli, which greatly weaken the efficacy of the 
drug-free antitumor. Thus, we proposed a CSR regulation strategy and synthesized 
the glucose oxidase (GOx)-modified Cu3 BiS3 nanosheets (CBSG NSs) encapsulated 
by calcium carbonate (CBSG@CaCO3 ) as the novel drug-free nanoagent. The 
CBSG@CaCO3 not only cause external stimuli such as energy consumption and 
oxidative stress damage, but also can destroy the CSR mechanism to guarantee 
optimal efficacy of starvation-chemodynamic therapy. In tumor cells, the CaCO3 
shell layer of CBSG@CaCO3 is rapidly degraded, releasing the slowly degradable 
CBSG NSs with NIR-II photothermal propertie that accelerated the production of 
external stimuli under laser irradiation. Meanwhile, CaCO3 can block CSR to 
disrupt the adaptive viability of cancer cells by inhibiting expresstion of P27 
and NRF2. Importantly, the CSR regulation achieves selective treatment on tumor 
cells based on the difference in physiological conditions between cancer cells 
and normal cells. This drug-free cancer therapy with selectivity improves the 
problem of poor efficacy under the action of CSR, which offers a new avenue in 
the cancer-related disease treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

1221,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem, autosomal, recessive disease primarily 
affecting the lungs, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. Whilst there 
is increasing evidence of a microbial 'gut-lung axis' in chronic respiratory 
conditions, there has been limited analysis of such a concept in CF. We 
performed a comprehensive dietary and microbiota analysis to explore the 
interactions between diet, gastrointestinal microbiota, respiratory microbiota, 
and clinical outcomes in children with CF. Our results demonstrate significant 
alterations in intestinal inflammation and respiratory and gastrointestinal 
microbiota when compared to age and gender matched children without CF. We 
identified correlations between the gastrointestinal and respiratory microbiota, 
lung function, CF pulmonary exacerbations and anthropometrics, supporting the 
concept of an altered gut-lung axis in children with CF. We also identified 
significant differences in dietary quality with CF children consuming greater 
relative proportions of total, saturated and trans fats, and less relative 
proportions of carbohydrates, wholegrains, fiber, insoluble fiber, starch, and 
resistant starch. Our findings position the CF diet as a potential modulator in 
gastrointestinal inflammation and the proposed gut-lung axial relationship in 
CF. The dietary intake of wholegrains, fiber and resistant starch may be 
protective against intestinal inflammation and should be explored as potential 
therapeutic adjuvants for children with CF."
1222,"INTRODUCTION: Genetic associations for variants identified through genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) tend to be overestimated in the original discovery 
data set as, if the association was underestimated, the variant may not have 
been detected. This bias, known as winner's curse, can affect Mendelian 
randomization estimates, but its severity and potential impact are unclear.
METHODS: We performed an empirical investigation to assess the potential bias 
from winner's curse in practice. We considered Mendelian randomization estimates 
for the effect of body mass index (BMI) on coronary artery disease risk. We 
randomly divided a UK Biobank data set 100 times into three equally sized 
subsets. The first subset was treated as the 'discovery GWAS'. We compared 
genetic associations estimated in the discovery GWAS to those estimated in the 
other subsets for each of the 100 iterations.
RESULTS: For variants associated with BMI at P < 5 × 10-8 in at least one 
iteration, genetic associations with BMI were up to 5-fold greater in iterations 
in which the variant was associated with BMI at P < 5 × 10-8 compared with its 
mean association across all iterations. If the minimum P-value for association 
with BMI was P = 10-13 or lower, then this inflation was <25%. Mendelian 
randomization estimates were affected by winner's curse bias. However, bias did 
not materially affect results; all analyses indicated a deleterious effect of 
BMI on coronary artery disease risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Winner's curse can bias Mendelian randomization estimates, although 
its practical impact may not be substantial. If avoiding sample overlap is 
infeasible, analysts should consider performing a sensitivity analysis based on 
variants strongly associated with the exposure."
1223,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is 
unlikely to be a major transfusion-transmitted pathogen, however, convalescent 
plasma is a treatment option used in some regions. The risk of 
transfusion-transmitted infections can be minimised by implementing Pathogen 
Inactivation (PI), such as THERAFLEX MB-Plasma and THERAFLEX UV-Platelets 
systems. Here we examined the capability of these PI systems to inactivate 
SARS-CoV-2.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 spiked plasma units were treated using the 
THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system in the presence of methylene blue (~0.8 μmol/L; 
visible light doses: 20, 40, 60 and 120 [standard] J/cm2 ). SARS-CoV-2 spiked 
platelet concentrates (PCs) were treated using the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system 
(UVC doses: 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 [standard] J/cm2 ). Samples were taken 
prior to the first and after each illumination dose and viral infectivity was 
assessed using an immunoplaque assay.
RESULTS: Treatment of spiked plasma with the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system resulted 
in an average ≥5.03 log10 reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity at one third (40 
J/cm2 ) of the standard visible light dose. For the platelet concentrates (PCs), 
treatment with the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system resulted in an average ≥5.18 
log10 reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity at the standard UVC dose (0.2 J/cm2 ).
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was reduced in plasma and platelets 
following treatment with the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma and THERAFLEX UV-Platelets 
systems, to the limit of detection, respectively. These PI technologies could 
therefore be an effective option to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted 
emerging pathogens. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1224,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent work identified anti-GM2 and anti-GalNAc-GD1a IgG 
ganglioside antibodies as biomarkers in dogs clinically diagnosed with acute 
canine polyradiculoneuritis, in turn considered a canine equivalent of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome. This study aims to investigate the serum prevalence of 
similar antibodies in cats clinically diagnosed with immune-mediated 
polyneuropathies.
METHODS: The sera from 41 cats clinically diagnosed with immune-mediated 
polyneuropathies (IPN), 9 cats with other neurological or neuromuscular 
disorders (ONM) and 46 neurologically normal cats (CTRL) were examined for the 
presence of IgG antibodies against glycolipids GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b, 
GalNAc-GD1a, GA1, SGPG, LM1, galactocerebroside and sulphatide.
RESULTS: A total of 29/41 IPN-cats had either anti-GM2 or anti-GalNAc-GD1a IgG 
antibodies, with 24/29 cats having both. Direct comparison of anti-GM2 
(sensitivity: 70.7%; specificity: 78.2%) and anti-GalNAc-GD1a (sensitivity: 
70.7%; specificity: 70.9%) antibodies narrowly showed anti-GM2 IgG antibodies to 
be the better marker for identifying IPN-cats when compared to the combined ONM 
and CTRL groups (p=0.049). Anti-GA1 and/or anti-sulphatide IgG antibodies were 
ubiquitously present across all sample groups, whereas antibodies against GM1, 
GD1a, GD1b, SGPG, LM1 and galactocerebroside were overall only rarely observed.

1225,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide problem associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria carriage in selected 
populations.
METHODS: Data were collected from all patients under 18 years who met our 
internal guidelines from 2015-2016. They were screened for carbapenem-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), extended spectrum beta-actamase (ESBL), 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci (VRE). Indications for screening were non-resident non-Israeli 
patients (from the Palestinian Authority, Syria, and foreign patients), internal 
transfers from intensive care units, admission to high-risk departments, recent 
carriage of MDR bacteria, transfer from other hospitals, and recent 
hospitalization. Data were analyzed for MDR bacteria from at least one screening 
site (rectal, nasal, axillary, groin, throat). All data were analyzed per 
patient and per sample.
RESULTS: During the study period 185/2632 positive screening sets (7%) were 
obtained from 725 patients. Of these, 165 patients (22.7%) were positive for at 
least one pathogen. Significantly fewer Israeli residents (120/615, 19.5%) 
tested positive compared to non-Israeli residents (45/110, 40.9%; P < 0.001). 
Past MDR bacteria carriage was the only significant screening indication (25/61, 
41%; P < 0.001). CRE, VRE, MRSA, and ESBL prevalence rates were 0.6% (5/771), 
0.5% (3/560) 0.5%, 4.2% (37/888), and 33.7% (139/413), respectively. Among 
non-ESBL carriers, MRSA was predominant with 38 positive cultures (n=34).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-Israeli non-residents and patients with previous positive MDR 
screening are at higher risk for MDR bacteria. Indications used to identify 
high-risk patients for drug resistant pathogens were efficacious. More effort is 
needed to reduce excessive sampling."
1226,"BACKGROUND: Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a medical condition with high 
levels of morbidity and mortality. However, most patients suspected of AMI will 
eventually have a different diagnosis. Nevertheless, these patients have a high 
risk for co-morbidities.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze patients with suspected AMI with an alternative final 
diagnosis, and to evaluate a machine learning algorithm for prognosis prediction 
in this population.
METHODS: In a retrospective search, we retrieved patient charts of those who 
underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) for suspected AMI between 
January 2012 and December 2015. Non-AMI patients were defined as patients with 
negative CTA and a final clinical diagnosis other than AMI. Correlation of past 
medical history, laboratory values, and mortality rates were evaluated. We 
evaluated gradient boosting (XGBoost) model for mortality prediction.
RESULTS: The non-AMI group comprised 325 patients. The two most common groups of 
diseases included gastrointestinal (33%) and biliary-pancreatic diseases (27%). 
Mortality rate was 24.6% for the entire cohort. Medical history of chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) had higher risk for mortality (odds ratio 2.2). Laboratory 
studies revealed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) had the highest diagnostic 
ability for predicting mortality in the entire cohort (AUC 0.70). The gradient 
boosting model showed an area under the curve of 0.82 for predicting mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with suspected AMI with an alternative final diagnosis 
showed a 25% mortality rate. A past medical history of CKD and elevated LDH were 
associated with increased mortality. Non-linear machine learning algorithms can 
augment single variable inputs for predicting mortality."
1227,"BACKGROUND: The adherence to a narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) treatment plan 
is derived, in large part, from the patient's skin tolerance to the phototherapy 
dose. At present, the initial and first-month incremental phototherapy doses are 
determined prior to treatment initiation based on the patient's Fitzpatrick skin 
phototyping.
OBJECTIVES: To identify variables that predict adherence to NB-UVB first-month 
treatment dosage plan.
METHODS: Charts of 1000 consecutive patients receiving NB-UVB at a 
hospital-based phototherapy unit were retrospectively analyzed. We included 
patients receiving NB-UVB for atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, and 
mycosis fungoides. The first-month NB-UVB treatment plan was determined based on 
the patient's Fitzpatrick phototype. Adherence to treatment was defined as 
receiving at least 80% of the planned first-month cumulative dose. We compared 
adherent vs. non-adherent patient groups for age, sex, Fitzpatrick phototype, 
presence of freckles, nevus count category, and type of dermatological disease.
RESULTS: The study included 817 eligible patients, mean age 40 (2-95) years; 54% 
men; 32% had Fitzpatrick phototype I-II. Distribution by diagnosis was atopic 
dermatitis (29%), psoriasis (27%), vitiligo (23%), and mycosis fungoides (21%). 
Adherence to NB-UVB treatment plan was observed in 71% of patients. Adherence 
decreased with age, with 7% decrease per year (P = 0.03) and was higher among 
mycosis fungoides patients (77.3%) compared to all other diagnoses (69.8%; P = 
0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to NB-UVB treatment may be related to age and diagnosis. 
Fitzpatrick phototype-based first-month treatment plans should be modified 
accordingly."
1228,"BACKGROUND: Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common preventable cause 
of mental retardation and delayed growth in children. Several prenatal and 
environmental factors might be associated with the disease.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of permanent CH and 
transient congenital hypothyroidism (TCH) in Israel.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Israeli national newborn 
screening program database from 2011 to 2015. Chi-square and logistic regression 
were used to assess the association of the demographic and gestational factors 
with the CH and TCH.
RESULTS: Of the 889,033 live births screened between 2011 and 2015, 860 were 
diagnosed with CH (9.76 per 10,000 live births) and 298 with TCH (3.35 per 
10,000 live births). In multivariate analyses, CH was positively associated with 
female sex, gestational ages < 38 or > 39 weeks, birth weight < 3000 grams, and 
winter birth. A decreased risk of TCH was detected in Arabs and neonates from 
high socioeconomic areas. An increased risk was independently associated with 
gestational ages < 38 weeks, low birth weight, and winter birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Several demographic, gestational, and geographical factors are 
associated with the development of CH and TCH. Future studies are needed to 
further investigate the pathogenesis in Israel."
1229,"BACKGROUND: APOE genotype strongly affects plasma lipid levels and risk for 
cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. Studies of apo-e allelic and APOE 
genotype frequencies among several populations have revealed interesting ethnic 
variations that might affect cardiovascular morbidity and cognition 
deterioration.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate apo-e allelic frequency among Israeli newborns based on 
known variances in apo-e allelic frequencies in different countries.
METHODS: We examined 498 consecutive neonates born at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical 
Center. Umbilical cord blood was sampled for genotyping and lipids. Birth 
weights were recorded. Demographics and parental risk factors for 
atherosclerosis were obtained from the mothers.
RESULTS: Most parents were native-born Israelis. Other countries of origin of 
grandparents were Morocco, Russia, and Iraq. The prevalence of APOE genotypes in 
Israel is APOE 2/2: 1.4%, APOE 2/3: 8.2%, APOE 3/3: 77.7%, and APOE 4/4: 11.8%. 
There were no associations of APOE genotype with parental country of origin. 
However, there was a tendency for APOE 3/4 to be more frequent in newborns of 
parents of Asian and African origin. Genotype 3/3 was more frequent in newborns 
whose parents came from Europe and America (78%) compared to those from Asia or 
Africa (69%).
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to determine risk factors such as APOE genotype for 
evaluation of premature atherosclerosis. Determining genetic and environmental 
risk factors may facilitate earlier treatment and prevent heart and brain 
atherosclerosis. APOE genotypes did not appear to affect total cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or 
triglyceride levels in newborns."
1230,"BACKGROUND: School closures due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
outbreak affected students physically, socially, and psychologically with an 
increase in the number of children and adolescent presenting with anxiety, 
depression, and drug abuse.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on the mental health 
of minors during the pandemic period and to characterize the type and number of 
referrals to a regional psychiatric outpatient clinic.
METHODS: This study included 380 children evaluated in an outpatient child 
psychiatric clinic. They were divided into two groups: before the lockdowns 
(BLD) (n=248), from January 2019 to February 2020, and during the lockdowns (LD) 
(n=132), from March 2020 to April 2021.
RESULTS: When comparing the LD to BLD, there was increase in suicide attempts 
(9.8% vs. 2.8%) and in the use of psychotherapy (81% vs. 56%). There was a 
decrease in the diagnoses of behavior disorders (29.5% vs. 44.8%) and ADHD 
(29.5% vs. 50%); as well as a decrease in stimulant usage (22.7% vs. 38%). There 
was a statistically non-significant increase in the number of children with 
depression, anxiety, and drug-use disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Many children developed educational, social, emotional, and 
behavioral gaps during LD, and they lost skills to deal with everyday problems 
due to social isolation. It is important to follow the long-term impact of the 
lockdowns and social isolation."
1231,"OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive data synthesis of the clinical parameters that affect 
plasma EGFR mutation test results in non-small cell lung carcinoma is lacking. 
Although individual studies have suggested a variety of patient characteristics 
that can affect diagnostic accuracy, no unified conclusion has been reached.
METHODS: We analyzed 170 plasma EGFR mutation tests performed between 2015 and 
2021 at our institution and carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
identify clinical and imaging features that correlate with plasma EGFR mutation 
test sensitivity.
RESULTS: Data synthesis from 14 studies of 2,576 patients revealed that patients 
with stage IV disease had a significantly lower false-negative rate than those 
with stage I through III disease. For our institutional cohort, which consisted 
of 75 paired plasma and tissue tests that were assessable for diagnostic 
accuracy, the overall sensitivity was 70.59% (95% confidence interval, 
56.17%-82.51%). Patients who had distant metastases and more suspicious lymph 
nodes on imaging findings correlated with a low false-negative rate.
CONCLUSIONS: While interpreting plasma EGFR mutation results, extra caution 
should be exercised for patients with early-stage, localized disease to 
accommodate the possibility of false-negative results. These meta-analyses and 
clinical data may enable clinicians to make evidence-based judgments for 
individual patients."
1232,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an urgent public health threat due to the emergence of 
antibiotic resistance. As most isolates in the United States are susceptible to 
at least one antibiotic, rapid molecular antimicrobial susceptibility tests 
(ASTs) would offer the opportunity to tailor antibiotic therapy, thereby 
expanding treatment options. With genome sequence and antibiotic resistance 
phenotype data for nearly 20,000 clinical N. gonorrhoeae isolates now available, 
there is an opportunity to use statistical methods to develop sequence-based 
diagnostics that predict antibiotic susceptibility from genotype. N. 
gonorrhoeae, therefore, provides a useful example illustrating how to apply 
machine learning models to aid in the design of sequence-based ASTs. We present 
an overview of this framework, which begins with establishing the assay 
technology, the performance criteria, the population in which the diagnostic 
will be used, and the clinical goals, and extends to the choices that must be 
made to arrive at a set of features with the desired properties for predicting 
susceptibility phenotype from genotype. While we focus on the example of N. 
gonorrhoeae, the framework generalizes to other organisms for which large-scale 
genotype and antibiotic resistance data can be combined to aid in diagnostics 
development."
1233,"The landscape of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemiology and treatment 
is ever-changing, with the widespread and evolving use of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART). With timely ART, people living with HIV (PLWH) are nearing the life 
expectancies and the functionality of the general population; nevertheless, the 
effects of HIV and ART on cardiovascular health remain under investigation. The 
pathophysiology of HIV-related cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF) have 
historically been attributed to systemic inflammation and changes in 
cardiometabolic function and cardiovascular architecture. Importantly, newer 
evidence suggests that ART also plays a role in modulating the process of 
HIV-related cardiomyopathy and HF. In the short term, newer highly active ART 
(HAART) seems to have cardioprotective effects; however, emerging data on the 
long-term cardiovascular outcomes of certain HAART medications, i.e., protease 
inhibitors, raise concerns about the potential adverse effects of these drugs in 
the clinical course of HIV-related HF. As such, the traditional phenotypes of 
dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular systolic failure that are associated 
with HIV-related heart disease are incrementally being replaced with increasing 
rates of diastolic dysfunction and ischemic heart disease. Moreover, recent 
studies have found important links between HIV-related HF and other clinical and 
biochemical entities, including depression, which further complicate cardiac 
care for PLWH. Considering these trends in the era of ART, the traditional 
paradigms of HIV-related cardiomyopathy and HF are being called into question, 
as is the therapeutic role of interventions such as ventricular assist devices 
and heart transplantation. In all, the mechanisms of HIV-related myocardial 
damage and the optimal approaches to the prevention and the treatment of 
cardiomyopathy and HF in PLWH remain under investigation."
1234,"BACKGROUND: Neurofilament light (NfL) levels reflect inflammatory disease 
activity in multiple sclerosis (MS), but it is less clear if NfL also can serve 
as a biomarker for MS progression in treated patients without relapses and focal 
lesion accrual. In addition, it has not been well established if clinically 
effective treatment re-establishes an age and sex pattern for cerebrospinal 
fluid NfL (cNfL) as seen in controls, and to what degree levels are affected by 
disability level and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atrophy metrics.
METHODS: We included subjects for whom cNfL levels had been determined as per 
clinical routine or in clinical research, classified as healthy controls (HCs, n 
= 89), MS-free disease controls (DCs, n = 251), untreated MS patients (uMS; n = 
296), relapse-free treated MS patients (tMS; n = 78), and ProTEct-MS clinical 
trial participants (pMS; n = 41).
RESULTS: Using linear regression, we found a positive association between cNfL 
and age, as well as lower concentrations among women, in all groups, except for 
uMS patients. In contrast, disability level in the entire MS cohort, or T1 and 
T2 lesion volumes, brain parenchymal fraction, thalamic fraction, and cortical 
thickness in the pMS trial cohort, did not correlate with cNfL concentrations. 
Furthermore, the cNfL levels in tMS and pMS groups did not differ.
CONCLUSIONS: In participants with MS lacking signs of inflammatory disease 
activity, disease modulatory therapy reinstates an age and sex cNfL pattern 
similar to that of control subjects. No significant association was found 
between cNfL levels and clinical worsening, disability level, or MRI metrics."
1235,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an increasingly frequent 
disorder that is likely to become the third leading cause of morbidity 
worldwide. It significantly degrades the quality of life of patients affected 
and poses a significant financial burden to the healthcare systems providing 
treatment and rehabilitation. Consequently, our study's purpose was to compare 
conventional inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) with virtual (online) PR 
using a mobile phone application. During a three-month period, two groups of 
patients followed the research protocol by participating in a pulmonary 
rehabilitation program administered and supervised by a physical therapist five 
times per week. A number of respiratory variables were examined before and after 
the test. At the end of the study period, a total of 72 patients completed the 
rehabilitation in the inpatient group, respectively 58 in the online group. It 
was observed that post-test comparison between patients undergoing the 
traditional and online rehabilitation methods did not show any significant 
differences. However, the calculated mean differences between pre-test and 
post-test results were significantly higher in favor of the virtual method. The 
most significant variations were encountered in maximal inspiratory pressure 
(MIP) (6.6% vs. 8.5%, p-value &lt; 0.001), 6-min walking test (6MWT) (6.7% vs. 
9.4%, p-value &lt; 0.001), and COPD assessment test (CAT) values (4.8 vs. 6.2, 
p-value &lt; 0.001), respectively. However, the maximal expiratory pressure 
(MEP) variation was significantly higher in patients undergoing the traditional 
rehabilitation method, from an average of 4.1% to 3.2% (p-value &lt; 0.001). In 
this preliminary study, the online pulmonary rehabilitation program proved 
non-inferiority to the traditional method, with significantly better results in 
several measurements. Additional studies using larger cohorts of patients and 
longer exposure to the online rehabilitation program are required to validate 
these findings."
1236,"(1) Background: In spite of the undeniable clinical value of the index of 
microvascular resistance (IMR) in assessing the status of coronary 
microcirculation, its use globally remains very low. The aim of this study was 
to validate the novel single-view, pressure-wire- and adenosine-free 
angiographic microvascular resistance (AMR) index, having the invasive 
wire-based IMR as a reference standard. (2) Methods: one hundred and sixty-three 
patients (257 vessels) were investigated with pressure wire-based IMR. 
Microvascular dysfunction (CMD) was defined by IMR ≥ 25. AMR was independently 
computed from the diagnostic coronary angiography in a blinded fashion. (3) 
Results: AMR demonstrated a good correlation (r = 0.83, p &lt; 0.001) and 
diagnostic performance (AUC 0.94; 95% CI: 0.91 to 0.97) compared with wire-based 
IMR. The best cutoff value for AMR in determining IMR ≥ 25 was 2.5 mmHg*s/cm. 
The overall diagnostic accuracy of AMR was 87.2% (95% CI: 83.0% to 91.3%), with 
a sensitivity of 93.5% (95% CI: 87.0% to 97.3%), a specificity of 82.7% (95% CI: 
75.6% to 88.4%), a positive predictive value of 79.4% (95% CI: 71.2% to 86.1%) 
and a negative predictive value of 94.7% (95% CI: 89.3% to 97.8%). No difference 
in terms of CMD rate was described among different clinical presentations. (4) 
Conclusions: AMR derived solely from a single angiographic view is a feasible 
computational alternative to pressure wire-based IMR, with good diagnostic 
accuracy in assessing CMD."
1237,"The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in the retinal thickness and 
microvasculature based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) depending on 
baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 
bilateral pneumonia. The prospective study was carried out among 62 patients 
with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent ophthalmic examination after hospital 
discharge. They were divided into three groups depending on the oxygen 
saturation (SpO2) on admission: ≤90% (group 1), &gt;90% and ≤95% (group 2), and 
&gt;95% (group 3). The following parameters were assessed in the 
ophthalmological examination and correlated with the baseline SpO2: ganglion 
cell layer (GCL), the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in the macular area, RNFL 
in the peripapillary area, the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in superficial 
capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP), vessel density (VD) in 
SCP, in DCP, and in the choriocapillaris plexus (CC). Baseline saturation ≤90% 
in COVID-19 patients caused a decrease of VD in some areas of SCP and DCP and an 
increase in FAZ area in SCP and DCP. In the group of patients with SpO2 ≤ 90% 
statistically significant thinning of the retina in the inner superior ring 
(ISR) (p = 0.029), the inner temporal ring (ITR) (p = 0.34), the outer superior 
ring (OSR) (p = 0.012), and the outer temporal ring (OTR) (p= 0.004)] was 
observed. The statistically significant thickening of RNFL optic disc and 
thinning of RNFL retina in some macular areas in patients with SpO2 ≤ 90% were 
reported. The size of FAZ area in SCP and vessel density were significantly 
greater in some areas of SCP, DCP, and CC in patients with SpO2 ≤ 90% (p = 
0.025). Baseline oxygen saturation ≤90% has been found to influence the ocular 
parameters of OCT in COVID-19 patients. We noticed a widened FAZ zone in SCP and 
increased VD in some regions of the retina and choroid as a response to systemic 
hypoxia."
1238,"Personalized management of diseases by considering relevant patient features 
enables optimal treatment, instead of management according to an average 
patient. Precision management of hypertension is important, because both 
susceptibility to complications and response to treatment vary between 
individuals. While the use of genomic and proteomic personal features for 
widespread precision hypertension management is not practical, other features, 
such as age, ethnicity, and cardiovascular diseases, have been utilized in 
guidelines for hypertension management. In precision medicine, more 
blood-pressure-related clinical and physiological characteristics in the 
patient's profile can be utilized for the determination of the threshold of 
hypertension and optimal treatment. Several non-invasive and simple-to-use 
techniques for the measurement of hypertension-related physiological features 
are suggested for use in precision management of hypertension. In order to 
provide precise management of hypertension, accurate measurement of blood 
pressure is required, but the available non-invasive blood pressure measurement 
techniques, auscultatory sphygmomanometry and oscillometry, have inherent 
significant inaccuracy-either functional or technological-limiting the precision 
of personalized management of hypertension. A novel photoplethysmography-based 
technique for the measurement of systolic blood pressure that was recently found 
to be more accurate than the two available techniques can be utilized for more 
precise and personalized hypertension management."
1239,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the cardiometabolic risk of 
individuals who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequently 
admitted to a hospital in a major city in mainland Portugal.
METHODS: This is a retrospective exploratory study using a sample of 102 
patients, with data analysis including descriptive statistics, nonparametric 
measures of association between variables based on Spearman's rank-order 
correlation, a logistic regression model for predicting the likelihood that an 
individual might eventually pass away, and a multiple linear regression model to 
predict a likely increase in the number of days an infected patient remained in 
the hospital.
RESULTS: About 62.7% of the individuals required intensive care on the second 
day of hospitalization, remaining 14.2 days in the intensive care unit (ICU) on 
average. The likelihood that an individual might eventually pass away due to 
SARS-CoV-2 virus infection increases for the older than younger ones and 
increases even more if he/she suffers from cardiometabolic disorders such as 
obesity, especially cardiovascular disease. Older individuals and those with 
obesity and hypertension remained more days in the ICU.
CONCLUSIONS: A later age and the prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders 
severely affect the care pathway of individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 
virus."
1240,"Enthesitis is a common clinical feature of spondyloarthritis (SpA). For reliable 
assessment of enthesitis the Heel Enthesitis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring 
System (HEMRIS) was developed. The aims of this study were to evaluate changes 
in HEMRIS over time and to evaluate whether these changes correlated with 
changes in clinical parameters. This single-center observational study followed 
patients with SpA and psoriasis, regardless of presence of clinical heel 
enthesitis, for two years. Clinical evaluation and ankle MRIs were performed 
annually. Changes in HEMRIS were compared at one-year intervals using the 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The association between changes in the HEMRIS with 
changes in clinical parameters was evaluated using Spearman's correlation 
coefficient. In total, 38 patients were included. An increase in the 
inflammatory and structural HEMRIS was identified in, respectively, 12 (17.9%) 
and 4 (6.0%) patients in one-year intervals. We found non-significant changes in 
the HEMRIS during longitudinal follow-up. Changes in the HEMRIS did not 
correlate with changes in local or general disease activity. Our results show 
that MRI-findings of enthesitis assessed with HEMRIS changed in a small number 
of patients in a one-year interval in an observational setting. Changes in 
HEMRIS were not associated with changes in clinical disease activity."
1241,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) still remains a very useful diagnostic method in modern 
cardiology. Its broad availability, noninvasiveness and good sensitivity explain 
why it plays a capital role in the very beginning of the process of diagnosis 
for every patient, with or without cardiac-related complaints. For the 
practitioner, good training in ECG interpretation is mandatory. Sometimes, the 
ECG trace reveals particular aspects that may cause confusion and complicate 
decision-making. In this article, we present several less common situations 
underlying the general context and ECG features. The syndromes studied have a 
high pathological significance and may range from acute emergencies that call 
for a rapid therapeutical response to chronic syndromes that require prolonged 
observation, monitoring and risk stratification."
1242,"BACKGROUND: Pain is a traumatic experience for most patients on hemodialysis. In 
this trial, we compared prilocaine/lidocaine cream with piroxicam gel for pain 
reduction during arteriovenous fistula needling.
METHODS: This randomized double-blind crossover clinical trial was done at 
dialysis unit of a tertiary care hospital from June to August 2022. Adult 
patients, aged 18-75 years, on maintenance hemodialysis through an arteriovenous 
fistula were selected randomly. Pain severity during needling of fistula was 
assessed during initial two hemodialysis sessions without application of any 
drug. Patients were then randomized into two groups receiving 5% 
prilocaine/lidocaine cream or 0.5% piroxicam gel 1 h before the next two 
hemodialysis sessions. After a 7-day washout period, patients crossed over to 
other groups for another two hemodialysis sessions. Pain was assessed on all 
these occasions. Primary outcome was reduction in pain with each intervention.
RESULTS: There were 32 patients aged 46.44 ± 11.58 years. Pain intensity was 
6.69 ± 0.58, 3.13 ± 1.28, and 4.55 ± 1.95 without any medication, 
prilocaine/lidocaine cream and piroxicam gel respectively. There was greater 
pain reduction with prilocaine/lidocaine cream than piroxicam gel (3.56 ± 1.35 
vs 2.14 ± 1.78; p = 0.001). Local redness with prilocaine/lidocaine cream was 
reported by one (3.13%) patient, whereas no side effects were seen with 
piroxicam gel (p = 1.000).
CONCLUSION: Prilocaine/lidocaine cream provides better pain relief than 
piroxicam gel during arteriovenous fistula needling."
1243,"Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as an appealing source for 
surrogates to evaluate the disease status. Herein, we present a novel proteomic 
strategy to identify proteins and phosphoproteins from salivary EVs to 
distinguish oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients from healthy 
individuals and explore the feasibility to evaluate therapeutical outcomes. 
Bi-functionalized magnetic beads (BiMBs) with Ti (IV) ions and a lipid analog, 
1,2-Distearoyl-3-sn-glycerophosphoethanolamine (DSPE) are developed to 
efficiently isolate EVs from small volume of saliva. In the discovery stage, 
label-free proteomics and phosphoproteomics quantification showed 315 
upregulated proteins and 132 upregulated phosphoproteins in OSCC patients among 
more than 2,500 EV proteins and 1,000 EV phosphoproteins, respectively. We 
further applied targeted proteomics by coupling parallel reaction monitoring 
with parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (prm-PASEF) to measure panels of 
proteins and phosphoproteins from salivary EVs collected before and after 
surgical resection. A panel of 3 total proteins and 3 phosphoproteins, most of 
which have previously been associated with OSCC and other cancer types, show 
sensitive response to the therapy in individual patients. Our study presents a 
novel strategy to the discovery of effective biomarkers for non-invasive 
assessment of OSCC surgical outcomes with small amount of saliva. Significance 
Statement We reported here the first time to large-scale profile proteins and 
phosphoproteins in saliva extracellular vesicles (EVs) and demonstrate the 
feasibility of monitoring EV phosphoproteins to assess therapeutic outcomes with 
small amount of saliva. Salivary EVs were isolated by a novel bi-functionalized 
magnetic beads (BiMBs) with high efficiency and specificity, facilitating 
downstream proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses and longitudinal measurement 
of individual patients before and after oral surgery. This article is protected

1244,"BACKGROUND: Drowned victims possibly obtain various pathogens from drowning 
sites. Using drowned renal donors to expand the donor pool still lacks consensus 
due to the potential risk of disease transmission.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 38 drowned donor 
renal recipients in a large clinical center from August 2012 to February 2021. A 
1:2 matched cohort was generated with donor demographics, including age, gender, 
BMI, and ICU durations. Donor microbiological results, recipient perioperative 
infections, and early post-transplant and first-year clinical outcomes were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, drowned donors had significantly 
increased positive fungal cultures (36.84% vs.13.15%, p=0.039). Recipients in 
the drowned group had significantly higher rates of gram-negative bacteria (GNB) 
and multi-drug resistant GNB infections (23.68% vs.5.26%, 18.42% vs. 3.95%, both 
p<0.05). Other colonization and infections were also numerically more frequent 
in the drowned group. Drowned donor recipients receiving inadequate antibiotic 
prophylaxis had more perioperative bloodstream infections, higher DGF 
incidences, and more first-year respiratory tract infections and recipient loss 
than those receiving adequate prophylaxis (all p<0.05). Clinical outcomes were 
similar between the adequate group and the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Drowned donors could be suitable options under wide-spectrum and 
adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis."
1245,"Aberrant vascular remodeling contributes to the progression of many 
aging-associated diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), where 
heterogeneous capillary density, endothelial transcriptional alterations and 
increased vascular permeability correlate with poor disease outcomes. Thus, 
identifying disease-driving mechanisms in the pulmonary vasculature may be a 
promising strategy to limit IPF progression. Here, we identified Ccn3 as an 
endothelial-derived factor that is upregulated in resolving but not in 
persistent lung fibrosis in mice, and whose function is critical for vascular 
homeostasis and repair. Loss and gain of function experiments were carried out 
to test the role of CCN3 in lung microvascular endothelial function in vitro 
through RNAi and addition of recombinant human CCN3 protein, respectively. 
Endothelial migration, permeability, proliferation, and in vitro angiogenesis 
were tested in cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells. Loss of CCN3 
in lung ECs resulted in transcriptional alterations along with impaired wound 
healing responses, in vitro angiogenesis, barrier integrity as well as increased 
pro-fibrotic activity through paracrine signals, whereas the addition of 
recombinant CCN3 augmented endothelial function. Altogether, our results 
demonstrate that the matricellular protein CCN3 plays an important role in lung 
endothelial function and could serve as a promising therapeutic target to 
facilitate vascular repair and promote lung fibrosis resolution."
1246,"BACKGROUND: Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are a complex group of diseases, 
that lead to major economic losses in all wine producing countries. The 
investigation of biocontrol agents (BCAs) capable to forestall or at least 
minimize the development of GTDs has, recently, become a priority. Nursery 
experiments were set up to (i) assess the biocontrol effect of Trichoderma 
atroviride SC1 and Bacillus subtilis PTA-271, alone and in simultaneous 
application, against Botryosphaeria dieback (BOT) and black foot (BF) associated 
pathogens during the grapevine propagation process, and (ii) evaluate the 
success of the BCA inoculation during the grapevine propagation process, using 
qRT-PCR techniques.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated a significant reduction on the percentage of 
potentially infected plants and the percentage of fungal isolation from wood 
fragments of BOT and BF pathogens in nursery material treated with Ta SC1 and Bs 
PTA-271 respectively. In one of the experiments, the simultaneous treatments 
with Bs PTA-271 and Ta SC1 presented a reduction on both percentage, potentially 
infected plants and fungal isolation, from wood fragments of BOT and BF 
pathogens.
CONCLUSION: These biological treatments may be a relevant component of an 
integrated approach, using complementary management strategies to limit 
infection by GTDs pathogens, but further research is still needed to elucidate 
the effectiveness of Bs PTA-271 and the benefits to be simultaneously applied 
with Ta SC1 for the control of GTDs pathogens in nurseries. This article is

1247,"Cholera is an ancient disease that persists as an issue of public health in many 
conflict-affected countries worldwide. Cholera is a diarrheal infection caused 
by ingested water or food contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. On 10 
September 2022, the Ministry of Health in Syria declared a cholera outbreak. 
Poor water and sanitation systems, disease surveillance breakdown, the collapse 
of the health system, and deteriorated socioeconomic conditions are potential 
risk factors for the outbreak's spread. Identifying the context-related factors 
associated with the spread of disease is a core to developing practical response 
mechanisms. In this study, we suggested a multisectoral approach that addresses 
context-specific elements contributing to the cholera outbreak spread in Syria; 
public health determinants, geopolitics, risk factors, and pandemic fatigue."
1248,"Bacterial contamination of water and food is a grave health concern rendering 
humans quite vulnerable to disease(s), and proving, at times, fatal too. 
Exploration of the novel diagnostic tools is, accordingly, highly called for to 
ensure rapid detection of the pathogenic bacteria, particularly Escherichia 
coli. The current manuscript, accordingly, reports the use of 
silane-functionalized glass matrices and antibody-conjugated cadmium telluride 
(CdTe) quantum dots (QDs) for efficient detection of E. coli. Synthesis of QDs 
(size: 5.4-6.8 nm) using mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) stabilizer yielded stable 
photoluminescence (∼62%), corroborating superior fluorescent characteristics. A 
test sample, when added to antibody-conjugated matrices, followed by 
antibody-conjugated CdTe-MPA QDs, formed a pathogen-antibody QDs complex. The 
latter, during confocal microscopy, demonstrated rapid detection of the 
selectively captured pathogenic bacteria (10 microorganism cells/10 μL) with 
enhanced sensitivity and specificity. The work, overall, encompasses 
establishment and design of an innovative detection platform in microbial 
diagnostics for rapid capturing of pathogens in water and food samples."
1249,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a chronic disease of the apocrine bearing skin 
causing induration, pain, draining sinuses, and subcutaneous abscesses, 
significantly impairs patients' quality of life (QOL). Full-thickness excision 
followed by skin grafting of the involved area can be curative. Herein, we 
evaluated the impact of this surgical treatment on QOL and depression 
symptomatology. Adult patients (≥18 y) who consented to participate filled out 
the dermatology quality of life (DLQI) and the Patient History Questionnaire 
(PHQ-9) at consent and at one, six, and 12 months post-initial evaluation and 
surgery. Demographics, HS, admission, and operative information were collected. 
Sixteen patients were included. Subjects were mainly white (81.3 %) and female 
(56.3%) with a median age of 38.2 [Interquartile range: 34.2-54.5]; 62.5% were 
obese (BMI = 39.7 [28.4-50.6]). Half of the subjects presented with HS in 2 or 
more areas. Six patients were still undergoing surgeries at 6 months. One-, 
six-, and 12-month follow-up surveys were obtained from 14, 11, and 8 subjects 
for DQLI and from 14, 9, and 5 subjects for PHQ9. DLQI scores significantly 
decreased at 6-month compared to baseline indicative of QOL improvement (10 
[4-20] vs. 15.5 [12-21.8], p = 0.036). While not significant, PHQ9 scores tended 
to decrease. For those with the worst disease, DLQI significantly decreased at 
both six (p = 0.049) and 12 months (p = 0.047) compared to baseline. Despite a 
small sample size, our data suggest that aggressive surgical treatment improves 
the QOL of HS patients. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings."
1250,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been linked to an increased risk of osteoporosis 
as well as fractures. Patients diagnosed with RA had a 25% increased risk of 
osteoporotic fracture, according to a recent population-based cohort study that 
compared them to people without RA. Several studies have found a correlation 
between osteoporosis and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1, and 6. These cytokines play a 
crucial part in the process of bone resorption by boosting osteoclast activation 
and encouraging osteoclast differentiation. Based on the correlation between RA, 
osteoporosis, and inflammation, it is possible that systemic immunosuppression 
with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can help individuals with RA 
have a lower chance of developing osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. There 
is little information on how different DMARDs, biologic or non-biologic, affect 
RA patients' bone metabolism. In this study, we present an overview of the 
influence that targeted therapies, such as biologics, non-biologics, and small 
molecule inhibitors, have on bone homeostasis in RA patients."
1251,"INTRODUCTION: Intestinal fibrosis is a common complication of Inflammatory Bowel 
Disease (IBD) with no available drugs. The current therapeutic principle is 
surgical intervention as the core. Intestinal macrophages contribute to both the 
progression of inflammation and fibrosis. Understanding the role of macrophages 
in the intestinal microenvironment could bring new hope for fibrosis prevention 
or even reversal.
AREAS COVERED: This article reviewed the most relevant reports on macrophage in 
the field of intestinal fibrosis. The authors discussed current opinions about 
how intestinal macrophages function and interact with surrounding mediators 
during inflammation resolution and fibrostenotic IBD. Based on biological 
mechanisms findings, authors summarized related clinical trial outcomes.
EXPERT OPINION: The plasticity of intestinal macrophages allows them to undergo 
dramatic alterations in their phenotypes or functions when exposed to 
gastrointestinal environmental stimuli. They exhibit distinct metabolic 
characteristics, secrete various cytokines, express unique surface markers, and 
transmit different signals. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism through which 
the intestinal macrophages contribute to intestinal fibrosis remains unclear. It 
should further elucidate a novel therapeutic approach by targeting macrophages, 
especially distinct mechanisms in specific subgroups of macrophages involved in 
the progression of fibrogenesis in IBD."
1252,"BACKGROUND: Rapid development of downgaze palsy, the most specific symptom of 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), has been associated with shorter survival 
in small studies.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the progression rate of downgaze palsy and other 
disease features could predict survival if assessed soon after the onset of 
downgaze palsy in a large data set.
METHODS: We used a longitudinal database of 414 patients with probable 
PSP-Richardson syndrome from 1994 to 2020. The data set comprised demographics 
and, for each visit, 28 PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) items and PSP stage scores. We 
calculated the rate of progression of each PSPRS item as its item score when the 
downgaze item first reached 1 or more (on a 0-4 scale) divided by disease 
duration at that point. Multivariate Cox regression was applied to identify 
variables independently associated with survival. We also explored the 
progression pattern of total PSPRS and downgaze palsy scores with disease 
course.
RESULTS: Independently associated with shorter survival were older onset age and 
faster progression of downgaze palsy, dysphagia for liquids, difficulty in 
returning to seat, and PSP stage. Patients with survival duration within 1 year 
of the median survival (6.58 years) showed approximately linear progression of 
the PSPRS score and downgaze palsy score during years 2 through 6 of the disease 
course.
CONCLUSIONS: Older onset age and faster progression of downgaze palsy and 
several axial features are associated with shorter survival. The disease 
typically progresses in approximately linear fashion during years 2 through 6.

1253,"BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is usually diagnosed in children and young 
adults; limited data exist on late-onset forms.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to characterize the clinical and paraclinical 
presentations, therapeutic management, and outcomes in patients with late-onset 
WD.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with WD after age 40 years were identified from the 
French Wilson's Disease Registry (FWDR). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging 
findings and treatment were reported at diagnosis and last follow-up.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients were identified (median age: 49, range: 40-64) and 
placed in three groups according to their clinical presentation: neurological 
(n = 20, median diagnostic delay: 20 months), hepatic (n = 13, diagnostic delay: 
12 months), and family screening (n = 12), all confirmed genetically. Six 
neurological patients had an atypical presentation (1 torticollis, 2 writer's 
cramps, 2 functional movement disorders, and 1 isolated dysarthria), without 
T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
hyperintensities; 5 of 6 had no Kayser-Fleischer ring (KFR); 5 of 6 had liver 
involvement. In the neurological group, 84% of patients improved clinically, and 
1 developed copper deficiency. In the hepatic group, 77% had cirrhosis; 6 
patients required liver transplantation. In the screened group, 43% had mild 
liver involvement; 3 were not treated and remained stable; 24-h urinary copper 
excretion was normal in 33% of patients at diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: In the FWDR, late-onset forms of WD affect 8% of patients, mostly 
with neurological presentations. Thirty percent of the neurological forms were 
atypical (isolated long-lasting symptoms, inconspicuous brain MRI, no KFR). With 
personalized treatment, prognosis was good. This study emphasized that WD should 
be suspected at any age and even in cases of atypical presentation. © 2022 The

1254,"Cancer is the most prevalent disease of concern worldwide for several decades. 
Diverse therapeutic aspects are in applications to control this phenomenal 
disease and also for decennaries. Among many causes and consequences of cancer, 
senescence has gained much interest in recent times. Senescence, also termed 
aging, is the natural process that induces cancer in neighbouring cells through 
Senescence-Associated-Secretory Phenotypes (SASPs) production. As a cure or 
preventive measure of cancer progression, studies already light upon multiple 
proteins and their roles in associated pathways but the aspect of different 
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is emerging recently and is under extensive research. 
Different approaches toward controlling senescence and inhibiting senescent cell 
accumulation are other aspects of cancer procurement. Thus, the role of ncRNA 
molecules in senescence and aging is getting much more interest as an alternate 
therapy for cancer treatment. In this review, at first, the roles of different 
ncRNAs related to several cellular processes are described. Then we tried to 
highlight the roles of different non-coding RNAs in senescence-induced cancer 
formation that extends with increasing age and emphasized non-coding RNAs as a 
therapeutic target solely or in combination with small molecules where drugging 
of small molecules targeting these non-coding RNAs can control cancer 
development."
1255,"High blood concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) provoke various 
metabolic disorders and are associated with mammary tissue injury and decreased 
milk production in dairy cows. Nuciferine, an alkaloid found in Nelumbo nucifera 
leaves, has great potential for correcting lipid metabolism derangements and 
lipotoxicity. In this study, we evaluated the lipotoxicity induced by excessive 
NEFA in bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) and investigated whether 
nuciferine alleviates NEFA-induced lipotoxicity and the underlying molecular 
mechanisms. We found that excessive NEFA (1.2 and 2.4 mM) induced lipid 
accumulation, apoptosis, and migration ability impairment in bMECs, whereas 
nuciferine could ameliorate these disarrangements, as indicated by decreasing 
triglyceride content, protein abundance of SREBP-1c, cytoplasmic cytochrome c, 
and cleaved caspase-3 and increasing protein abundance of PPARα and migration 
ability. Moreover, nuciferine could reverse NEFA-induced LKB1/AMPK signaling 
inhibition, and the protective effect of nuciferine on lipotoxicity caused by 
NEFA was abrogated by AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin. Furthermore, transfection 
with LKB1 siRNA (si-LKB1) largely abolished the activation effect of nuciferine 
on AMPK. Overall, nuciferine can protect bMECs from excessive NEFA-induced lipid 
accumulation, apoptosis, and impaired migration by activating LKB1/AMPK 
signaling pathway."
1256,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare current treatment response rates with 
personalized Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (pTNT), against extended chemotherapy in 
the 'wait period' (xCRT) and standard chemoradiotherapy (sCRT) with adjuvant 
chemotherapy for rectal cancer.
METHODS: This was a multicentre retrospective cohort analysis. Consecutive 
patients with rectal cancer treated with pTNT over a 3.9-year period were 
compared to a historical cohort of patients treated with xCRT or sCRT as part of 
the published WAIT Trial. pTNT patients received 8 cycles mFOLFOX6 or 6 cycles 
CAPOX in the neoadjuvant setting (no adjuvant treatment). Patients in the WAIT 
Trial received either 3 cycles 5-FU/LV during the 10-week wait period after 
chemoradiotherapy or standard chemoradiotherapy, followed by adjuvant 
chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall complete response (oCR) rate 
defined as the proportion of patients who achieved either complete clinical 
response (cCR) or pathological complete response (pCR).
RESULTS: Of 284 patients diagnosed with rectal cancer during the 3.9-year 
period, 107 received pTNT. Forty of these were matched with 49 patients from the 
WAIT Trial (25 received xCRT and 24 received sCRT). There was a significant 
difference in oCR between the groups (pTNT n = 21, xCRT n = 6, sCRT n = 7, 
P = 0.043). Of the patients that underwent surgery, pCR occurred in 13 patients 
with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.415). There were no 
significant differences in 2-year disease-free survival or overall survival.
CONCLUSION: Compared with sCRT and xCRT, pTNT results in a significantly higher 
complete response rate which may facilitate organ preservation."
1257,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are accurate prognostic indicators and 
correlate with illness severity scores in critically ill dogs.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study from December 2016 to May 2017.
SETTING: ICU at a veterinary teaching hospital.
ANIMALS: Seventy-two client-owned dogs admitted to the ICU with CBCs and 
abbreviated and complete acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation 
(APPLEfast and APPLEfull ) scores were enrolled.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The NLR, PLR, APPLEfast , and APPLEfull scores 
were calculated for each patient on the day of admission. Patients were followed 
from admission to discharge, and diagnosis, survival, and length of 
hospitalization were recorded. The patient population was assessed as a whole 
and as subcategories of patients with neoplastic disease, infectious disease, 
sepsis, and severe hemorrhage. Dogs with nonseptic disease processes (n = 52) 
that died had a significantly higher median PLR (P = 0.04) of 441 (range: 
106-986) compared to those that survived with a median PLR of 217 (range: 
28.4-3225). The PLR was strongly predictive of ICU length of stay in dogs with 
severe hemorrhage (P = 0.03, Spearman's rho = 0.84). The NLR had a poor positive 
correlation with APPLEfull score (P = 0.04, Spearman's rho = 0.24), and PLR had 
a poor negative correlation with APPLEfast score (P = 0.02, Spearman's 
rho = -0.27).
CONCLUSIONS: The PLR correlated with ICU length of stay for patients with severe 
hemorrhage and with survival for patients with nonseptic disease processes. The 
PLR and NLR correlated with illness severity as measured by APPLE scores. Future 
studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further determine the merit of 
NLR and PLR as indicators of morbidity, mortality, and illness severity."
1258,"Findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomised placebo-controlled 
trial (RCT) were published at the beginning of this century. They suggested that 
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use increased the risk of cardiovascular 
disease and venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism and deep vein 
thrombosis The findings led to a decline in HRT prescriptions and negative 
publicity about the use of HRT for women with significant menopausal symptoms. 
Subsequent studies have shown that the risk of thrombosis with HRT relates to 
whether oestrogen is combined with a progestogen and the route of administration 
of oestrogen. In healthy women with no background medical problems, transdermal 
hormone replacement is not associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. 
However, much less is known about the safety of various HRT preparations in 
women with a high background risk of thrombosis. These cases can often be 
challenging for clinicians with uncertainties around testing for thrombophilia, 
use of anticoagulation and striking a balance between the risks and benefits of 
prescribing HRT. This article will review the mechanism of thrombosis with 
differing types of HRT and present the evidence from the relevant trials. The 
article will also present the evidence that specifically relates to women with a 
personal history of thrombosis or thrombophilia (heritable and acquired) to 
enable clinicians to better individualise the risk assessment for each woman 
requesting HRT and understand the role of thrombophilia screening or concomitant 
anticoagulation in such situations."
1259,"BACKGROUND: Interhospital care fragmentation, when a patient is readmitted to a 
different hospital than they were originally discharged from, occurs in 20%-25% 
of readmissions. Mode of transport to the hospital, specifically ambulance use, 
may be a risk factor for fragmented readmissions. Our study seeks to further 
understand the relationship between ambulance transport and fragmented 
readmissions in older adults, a population that is at increased risk for poor 
outcomes following fragmented readmissions.
METHODS: We analyzed inpatient claims from Medicare beneficiaries in 2018 who 
had a hospital admission for select Hospital Readmission Reduction Program 
Conditions (acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia) as well as dehydration, syncope, 
urinary tract infection, or behavioral issues. We evaluated the associations 
between ambulance transport and a fragmented readmission using logistic 
regression models adjusted for demographic, clinical, and hospital 
characteristics.
RESULTS: The study included 1,186,600 30-day readmissions. Of these, 46.8% 
(n = 555,847) required ambulance transport. In fully adjusted models, taking an 
ambulance to the readmission hospital increased the odds of a fragmented 
readmission by 38% (95% CI 1.32, 1.44). When this association was examined by 
readmission major diagnostic category (MDC), the strongest associations were 
seen for Factors Influencing Health Status and Other Contacts with Health 
Services (i.e., rehabilitation, aftercare) (AOR 3.66, 95% CI 3.11, 4.32), Mental 
Diseases and Disorders (AOR 2.69, 95% CI 2.44, 2.97), and Multiple Significant 
Trauma (AOR 2.61, 95% CI 1.56, 4.35). When the model was stratified by patient 
origin, ambulance use remained associated with fragmented readmissions across 
all locations.
CONCLUSIONS: Ambulance use is associated with increased odds of a fragmented 
readmission, though the strength of the association varies by readmission 
diagnosis and origin. Patient-, hospital-, and system-level interventions should 
be developed, implemented, and evaluated to address this modifiable risk factor."
1260,"BACKGROUND: Literature on the natural course of neuroinvasive West Nile virus 
(WNV) infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is sparse. In the 
setting of a 2021 WNV outbreak in Arizona, we reviewed our institution's 
experience with neuroinvasive WNV infection in patients with SOT.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified SOT recipients treated for neuroinvasive 
WNV at Mayo Clinic in Arizona from 2007 through 2021. Clinical manifestations, 
disease course, and outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 24 SOT recipients with WNV infection identified during the study 
period, 13 infections occurred in 2021. Most patients had gastrointestinal tract 
symptoms and fever at disease presentation. Five patients had cognitive 
impairment, and 14 initially or eventually had acute flaccid paralysis. 
Clinically significant deterioration occurred at a median of 4 (range, 1-11) 
days after hospital admission. Seventeen patients (71%) were transferred to the 
intensive care unit, with 15 requiring mechanical ventilation. Initial 
cerebrospinal fluid analysis mainly demonstrated a neutrophil-predominant 
pleocytosis. Almost all patients (n = 23) were treated with intravenous 
immunoglobulin alone or in combination with interferon alfa-2b. Sixteen patients 
had clinical improvement, 4 of whom recovered completely. Six patients died 
during hospitalization due to complications of neuroinvasive WNV infection. Two 
patients were discharged to hospice without clinical recovery. The overall 
30-day mortality rate was 36%.
CONCLUSION: Despite advances in supportive care, neuroinvasive WNV infection is 
associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in SOT recipients. Flaccid 
paralysis is an indicator of poor prognosis. This article is protected by

1261,"Background. Provisional side branch (SB) stenting strategy is the default 
approach for the majority of bifurcation lesions, but outcomes of SB is 
suboptimal. Though drug coated balloon (DCB) improving SB outcomes attracts an 
increasing attention, sequence of DCB hasn't yet been determined. We presented a 
novel hybrid strategy of DCB and stent for bifurcation lesions. Methods. With 
lesion preparation, DCB was persistently inflated in SB kissing with main branch 
(MB) stent deployment and balloon post-dilation of the bifurcation core. 
Proximal optimization technique was performed strictly not exceeding the 
bifurcation. Procedural and clinical adverse events were evaluated. Canadian 
Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina classification was assessed at baseline and 
clinical follow-up. Results. Fourteen patients undergoing the hybrid technique 
from August 2020 to July 2021 were enrolled. The technique was successfully 
performed in all patients without rewiring or SB compromise. Minimal lumen 
diameter of SB increased from 0.60 ± 0.40 mm to 2.1 ± 0.2 mm while the percent 
stenosis decreased from 72.4 ± 17.9% to 19.6 ± 4.7%. In addition, intravascular 
ultrasound indicated comparable stent symmetry index and incomplete stent 
apposition between proximal and distal segments of stent. No further 
intervention was performed, and mean fractional flow reserve of SB (n = 12) was 
0.88 ± 0.05. No major adverse cardiac events was noted in hospital and 12-month 
follow up. The mean CCS angina score was reduced by 84% (2.2 vs 0.4, p < .001). 
Conclusion. The hybrid strategy facilitates treatment of DCB and stent for 
bifurcation lesions, which appears to be feasible and acceptable in a short-term 
follow-up."
1262,"The Warburg effect suggests that upregulated glycolysis arising from high 
glucose uptake in cancer cells might be accompanied with suppressed 
mitochondrial respiration. However, recent studies have shown that the 
mitochondrial temperature in cancer cells could be relatively higher than that 
in normal cells, suggesting hyperactive mitochondrial respiration in cancer 
cells. However, hot mitochondria have not been reported in patients with cancer. 
Here, near-infrared small-molecule fluorescent probes TRNs are rationally 
designed with two ethyl amino groups as the temperature-sensitive moiety. 
Afterward, a mitochondrial targeting group is installed via ether bonds on TRN-8 
to build MTN. To the best of our knowledge, MTN is the near-infrared probe with 
the highest sensitivity for mitochondrial temperature. Moreover, it also 
displays high photostability, wide linearity, and high specificity. Using MTN, 
we can monitor the ups and downs of mitochondrial temperature in cancer cells 
upon the perturbations of mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, we demonstrate 
that the mitochondrial temperature in surgically resected human tumors is 
relatively higher than that in paracancerous tissues. Our results indicate that 
relatively hot mitochondria may exist in tumors from patients. We envisage that 
our study provides critical evidence for revisiting the Warburg effect and 
cancer metabolism."
1263,"BACKGROUND: Health and social care systems face difficulties in managing 
multimorbidity, disease burden and complex needs in long-term conditions such as 
Parkinson's disease.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a European understanding of how health 
and social care professionals can collaborate with stakeholders from different 
organizations and sectors to enhance the management of Parkinson's disease in a 
community setting by identifying the existing gaps in this process and how 
people with Parkinson's disease and their family carers could benefit from these 
partnerships.
METHODS: A mixed-methods sequential study was conducted in Denmark, Norway, 
Spain and the United Kingdom. The findings from the qualitative phase are 
presented. Individual semistructured interviews were analysed using Braun's and 
Clarke's thematic analysis. A meta-ethnography approach was used to analyse and 
synthesize cross-national findings.
RESULTS: A total of 41 healthcare professionals and 39 stakeholders from 
different disciplines and sectors were interviewed in the four countries. The 
participants acknowledged a lack of awareness of available resources and poor 
communication between the different support systems in the management of 
Parkinson's disease. To promote multiagency collaborations, the participants 
highlighted the need to organize services along the Parkinson's disease journey, 
patient involvement and strategic involvement of carers in organizing resources 
and Parkinson's disease care pathways. According to the participants, the 
benefits from multiagency partnerships could lead to an enhanced continuity of 
care and specialized knowledge, mobilization of resources in the community, 
personalized support and improved access to services.
CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers are called upon to create formal structures that 
facilitate multisectoral collaborations to promote an integrated system of care 
for the management of Parkinson's disease in the community. To address this 
challenge, we propose five strategies showing how organizations can work 
together to optimize the use of resources and enhance the management of 
Parkinson's disease throughout the illness trajectory.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Patient and Public Involvement groups made up of 
stakeholders, healthcare professionals, patients with Parkinson's disease and 
family carers participated in the design of the study, the development of the 
interview guides and the validation of the findings."
1264,"INTRODUCTION: Cholera remains a significant public health threat for many 
countries, and the severity largely varies by the population and local 
conditions that drive disease spread, especially in endemic areas prone to 
natural disasters and flooding. Epidemiological models can provide useful 
information to military planners for understanding disease spread within 
populations and the effectiveness of response options for preventing the 
transmission among deployed and stationed personnel. This study demonstrates the 
use of epidemiological modeling to understand the dynamics of cholera 
transmission to inform emergency planning and military preparedness in areas 
with highly communicable diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Areas with higher probability for a potential cholera 
outbreak in Haiti followed by a natural disaster were identified. The hotspots 
were then used to seed an extended compartmental model, EpiGrid, to simulate 
notional spread scenarios of cholera originating in three distinct areas in 
Haiti. Disease parameters were derived from the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, 
and disease spread was simulated over a 12-week period under uncontrolled and 
controlled spread.
RESULTS: For each model location, scenarios of mitigated (intervention with 30% 
transmission reduction via international aid) and unmitigated (without 
intervention) are simulated. The results depict the geographical spread and 
estimate the cumulative cholera infection for each notional scenario over the 
course of 3 months. Disease transmission differs considerably across origin site 
with an outbreak originating in the department of Nippes spanning the largest 
geographic area and resulting in the largest number of cumulative cases after 
12 weeks under unmitigated (79,518 cases) and mitigated (35,667 cases) spread 
scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: We modeled the notional re-emergence and spread of cholera 
following the August 2021 earthquake in Haiti while in the midst of the global 
COVID-19 pandemic. This information can help guide military and emergency 
response decision-making during an infectious disease outbreak and 
considerations for protecting military personnel in the midst of a humanitarian 
response. Military planners should consider the use of epidemiological models to 
assess the health risk posed to deployed and stationed personnel in high-risk

gene. Various studies have examined the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) susceptibility 
with contradictory results. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed 
to assess whether variants of this polymorphism increase the HNSCC risk or not.
RECENT FINDINGS: Thirty three studies consisting of 14282 subjects (6012 cases 
and 8270 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Variants of XRCC1 
Arg194Trp polymorphism were associated with increased HNSCC risk and the 
associations were significant based on heterozygous and dominant models 
(heterozygous model: OR = 1.182, 95%CI = 1.015-1.377, P = 0.032; homozygous 
model: OR = 1.274, 95%CI = 0.940-1.727, P = 0.119; dominant model: OR = 1.194, 
95%CI = 1.027-1.388, P = 0.021; recessive model: OR = 1.181, 95%CI = 
0.885-1.576, P = 0.119). There were significant associations between variants of 
this polymorphism and HNSCC risk based on Asian ethnicity under dominant model, 
hospital control source under different genetic models, PCR-RFLP genotyping 
method under dominant model and oral cavity tumor site under heterozygous and 
dominant models.
OBJECTIVE: The X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a DNA repair 
gene. Various studies have examined the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) susceptibility 
with contradictory results. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed 
to assess whether variants of this polymorphism increase the HNSCC risk or not.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literatures published till April 2022 was 
conducted using Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library 
and Embase databases. The heterogeneity was assessed with the I-Square 
statistic. A random effects model or fixed effects model was used to analyze the 
data. Data were reported by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The p value was considered significant if p < .05.
RESULTS: Thirty three studies consisting of 14 282 subjects (6012 cases and 8270 
controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Variants of XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism were associated with increased HNSCC risk and the associations were 
significant based on heterozygous and dominant models (heterozygous model: 
OR = 1.182, 95%CI = 1.015-1.377, p = .032; homozygous model: OR = 1.274, 
95%CI = 0.940-1.727, p = .119; dominant model: OR = 1.194, 95%CI = 1.027-1.388, 
p = .021; recessive model: OR = 1.181, 95%CI = 0.885-1.576, p = .119). There 
were significant associations between variants of this polymorphism and HNSCC 
risk based on Asian ethnicity under dominant model, hospital control source 
under different genetic models, PCR-RFLP genotyping method under dominant model 
and oral cavity tumor site under heterozygous and dominant models.
CONCLUSION: Variants of XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism were significantly 
associated with increased risk of HNSCC development based on heterozygous and 
dominant genetic models."
1266,"For stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a high risk of recurrence, 
intensified adjuvant chemotherapy can improve overall survival. We aimed to 
develop a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation marker model for predicting 
the relapse risk of stage III CRC patients. Differentially methylated markers 
identified between 53 normal mucosa samples and 165 CRC tissue samples, as well 
as between plasma samples from 75 stage I/II (early-stage) CRC patients and 55 
stage IV (late-stage) CRC patients, were analyzed using Student's t-tests. The 
overlapping methylation markers shared by plasma and tissue samples were used to 
establish a methylation marker model to evaluate the tumor burden in the 
peripheral blood of CRC patients by using the random forest method. This model 
was verified in the validation cohort (n= 44) and then applied to predict 
recurrence risk in 50 stage III CRC patients and monitor the clinical disease 
course in serial samples from 4 CRC patients. We built a five-marker-based ctDNA 
methylation model that had high sensitivity (84.21%) and specificity (84%) in 
identifying late-stage CRC in a validation cohort containing 24 stage I/II CRC 
patients and 20 stage IV CRC patients. The model achieved high sensitivity 
(87.5%) and specificity (94.12%) in predicting tumor relapse in an independent 
cohort of 50 stage III CRC patients and could be an independent recurrence risk 
factor for stage III patients (HR, 60.4; 95% CI: 7.68-397; P = 9.73e-5). 
Analysis of serial blood samples of CRC showed that the model could monitor 
disease relapse earlier than imaging examination and serum carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA) and so may provide an opportunity for the early adjustment of 
therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the model could potentially monitor the 
clinical course and treatment response dynamically. This article is protected by

1274,"CONTEXT: Gallic acid (GA) and lecithin showed important roles in antioxidant and 
drug delivery, respectively. A complex synthesized from GA and soybean lecithin 
(SL-GAC), significantly improved bioavailability of GA and pharmacological 
activities. However, the antioxidant activity of SL-GAC and its effect on 
iron-overload-induced liver injury remains unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the antioxidant properties of SL-GAC in vitro 
and in mice, and its remediating effects against liver injury by 
iron-overloaded.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro, free radical scavenging activity, lipid 
peroxidation inhibition, and ferric reducing power of SL-GAC were measured by 
absorbance photometry. In vivo, C57BL/6J mice were randomized into 4 groups: 
control, iron-overloaded, iron-overloaded + deferoxamine, and 
iron-overloaded + SL-GAC. Treatments with deferoxamine 
(150 mg/kg/intraperitioneally) and SL-GAC (200 mg/kg/orally) were given to the 
desired groups for 12 weeks, daily. Iron levels, oxidative stress, and 
biochemical parameters were determined by histopathological examination and 
molecular biological techniques.
RESULTS: In vitro, SL-GAC showed DPPH and ABTS free radicals scavenging activity 
with IC50 values equal to 24.92 and 128.36 μg/mL, respectively. In C57BL/6J 
mice, SL-GAC significantly reduced the levels of serum iron (22.82%), liver iron 
(50.29%), aspartate transaminase (25.97%), alanine transaminase (38.07%), gamma 
glutamyl transferase (42.11%), malondialdehyde (19.82%), total cholesterol 
(45.96%), triglyceride (34.90%), ferritin light chain (18.51%) and transferrin 
receptor (27.39%), while up-regulated the levels of superoxide dismutase 
(24.69%), and glutathione (11.91%).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings encourage the use of SL-GAC to treat liver injury 
induced by iron-overloaded. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to 
validate its potential in clinical medicine."
1275,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) played essential roles in nearly every biological 
process and disease. Many algorithms were developed to distinguish lncRNAs from 
mRNAs in transcriptomic data and facilitated discoveries of more than 600 000 of 
lncRNAs. However, only a tiny fraction (<1%) of lncRNA transcripts (~4000) were 
further validated by low-throughput experiments (EVlncRNAs). Given the cost and 
labor-intensive nature of experimental validations, it is necessary to develop 
computational tools to prioritize those potentially functional lncRNAs because 
many lncRNAs from high-throughput sequencing (HTlncRNAs) could be resulted from 
transcriptional noises. Here, we employed deep learning algorithms to separate 
EVlncRNAs from HTlncRNAs and mRNAs. For overcoming the challenge of small 
datasets, we employed a three-layer deep-learning neural network (DNN) with a 
K-mer feature as the input and a small convolutional neural network (CNN) with 
one-hot encoding as the input. Three separate models were trained for human (h), 
mouse (m) and plant (p), respectively. The final concatenated models 
(EVlncRNA-Dpred (h), EVlncRNA-Dpred (m) and EVlncRNA-Dpred (p)) provided 
substantial improvement over a previous model based on support-vector-machines 
(EVlncRNA-pred). For example, EVlncRNA-Dpred (h) achieved 0.896 for the area 
under receiver-operating characteristic curve, compared with 0.582 given by 
sequence-based EVlncRNA-pred model. The models developed here should be useful 
for screening lncRNA transcripts for experimental validations. EVlncRNA-Dpred is 
available as a web server at 
https://www.sdklab-biophysics-dzu.net/EVlncRNA-Dpred/index.html, and the data 
and source code can be freely available along with the web server."
1276,"Viral infection involves a large number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) 
between the virus and the host, and the identification of these PPIs plays an 
important role in revealing viral infection and pathogenesis. Existing 
computational models focus on predicting whether human proteins and viral 
proteins interact, and rarely take into account the types of diseases associated 
with these interactions. Although there are computational models based on a 
matrix and tensor decomposition for predicting multi-type biological interaction 
relationships, these methods cannot effectively model high-order nonlinear 
relationships of biological entities and are not suitable for integrating 
multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel computational framework, 
LTDSSL, to determine human-virus PPIs under different disease types. LTDSSL 
utilizes logistic functions to model nonlinear associations, sets importance 
levels to emphasize the importance of observed interactions and utilizes sparse 
subspace learning of multiple features to improve model performance. 
Experimental results show that LTDSSL has better predictive performance for both 
new disease types and new triples than the state-of-the-art methods. In 
addition, the case study further demonstrates that LTDSSL can effectively 
predict human-viral PPIs under various disease types."

requires automated segmentation of cartilage volumes. Two main limitations arise 
in the development of hospital- or population-specific Deep Learning (DL) models 
for image segmentation: specialized knowledge and specialized hardware. We

1281,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to protect against fatty 
liver diseases, but the mechanism is still not clear. Menstrual blood-derived 
endometrial stem cells (MenSCs) are a substantial population of MSCs that can be 
obtained in a noninvasive manner. In the present study, we investigated the 
therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of MenSC transplantation in mouse 
models of diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The results 
revealed that MenSCs markedly promoted hepatic glycogen storage and attenuated 
lipid accumulation after transplantation. We further identified Rnf186 as a 
novel regulator involved in MenSC-based therapy for NAFLD mice. Rnf186 
deficiency substantially inhibited high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and 
abnormal hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in mice. Mechanistically, Rnf186 
regulated glucose and lipid metabolism through the AMPK-mTOR pathway. More 
importantly, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is identified as the key functional 
cytokine secreted by MenSCs and decreases the expression of hepatic Rnf186. HGF 
deficient MenSCs can't attenuate glucose and lipid accumulation after 
transplantation in NAFLD mice. Collectively, our results provide preliminary 
evidence for the protective roles of HGF secreted by MenSCs in fatty liver 
diseases through downregulation of hepatic Rnf186 and suggest that MenSCs or 
Rnf186 may be an alternative therapeutic approach/target for the treatment of 
NAFLD."
1282,"BACKGROUND: The benefits of physical activity are well-documented, and the 
prevalence of physical inactivity is high in older patients with chronic 
diseases. This study aimed to investigate the impact of an aerobic exercise 
intervention based on the capacity, opportunity, motivation-behavior (COM-B) 
model on physical activity and health-related outcomes in this population.
METHODS: Thirty-five participants were randomly assigned to the intervention 
group (IG) for an exercise intervention based on the COM-B model, and 33 were 
assigned to the control group (CG) for usual care. Physical activity levels, 
daily steps and bone mineral density T-value, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, 
subendocardial myocardial viability rate, central arterial pressure, growth 
index, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, ankle-arm index were measured at 
baseline, during the 12-week intervention, and after the 12-week follow-up.
RESULTS: Compared with the CG and pre-intervention, total physical activity in 
the IG increased significantly (P < 0.05); however, after the 12-week follow-up, 
total physical activity decreased. At the same time, the average daily steps of 
the elderly in both groups increased. Compared with the CG, at the 12-week 
follow-up, the bone mineral density T-value in the IG was significantly improved 
(P < 0.05). Compared with the pre-intervention values, during the 12-week 
intervention, bone mineral density T-value, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, 
subendocardial myocardial viability rate and central arterial pressure were 
significantly improved (P < 0.05); after the 12-week follow-up, brachial-ankle 
pulse wave velocity and ankle-arm index were significantly improved (P < 0.05). 
No statistically significant changes in the growth index were detected, 
independent of the group and time.
CONCLUSION: Theory-based exercise interventions can change the physical 
inactivity behavior of older people with chronic diseases, effectively promoting 
physical activity and improves bone mineral density T-value, controls body 
weight, and reduces cardiovascular risk and physiological indicators related to 
atherosclerosis. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; ••: ••-••."
1283,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Melasma is a refractory skin disease due to its 
complex pathogenesis and difficult treatment. Studies have found that human 
umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUCMSC-Exos) could serve 
as a novel cell-free therapeutic strategy in regenerative and esthetic medicine. 
It could potentially treat melasma, but the skin barrier is a challenge. In this 
study, we aim to explore the safety and efficacy of hUCMSC-Exos in the treatment 
of melasma and the means to promote its percutaneous penetration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the animal study about the effect of penetration, 
percutaneous penetration of PKH67-labeled hUCMSC-Exos was studied under 
microneedles, 1565 nm nonablative fractional laser (NAFL), and a plasma named 
Peninsula Blue Aurora Shumin Master (PBASM) treatments, observed by confocal 
laser scanning microscopy. In the clinical application study, 60 patients with 
melasma treated in our department were divided into four groups. NAFL combined 
with normal saline treatment was used for Group A. Microneedles, NAFL, and PBASM 
combined with hUCMSC-Exos treatments were used for Groups B, C, and D, 
respectively. Each patient received four treatments at 1-month intervals. 
Assessments were done using the degree of pain posttreatment, melasma area and 
severity score, improvement rate, physician global assessment score, 
satisfaction, and complications.
RESULTS: In the animal study about the effect of penetration, hUCMSC-Exos can 
penetrate the deep dermis under microneedles, NAFL, and PBASM treatments. In the 
clinical application study, compared with Group A, Groups B, C, and D showed 
significantly improved therapeutic effect and patient satisfaction (p < 0.05), 
and there was no significant difference among Groups B, C, and D.(p > 0.05). 
Patients in Group B reported higher pain levels than those in the other three 
groups (p < 0.05); the treatment experience of patients in Group D was better.
CONCLUSION: hUCMSC-Exos can improve the symptoms of melasma safely and 
effectively. Compared with microneedles, NAFL and PBASM can also achieve a good 
effect toward promoting penetration. These findings are worthy of exploration 
and clinical application."
1284,"BACKGROUND: A neurodevelopmental disease, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurs 
in males three times more commonly than girls. Higher prenatal testosterone 
exposure may result in autistic-like behaviour in boys, according to earlier 
research. It is unclear how fetal testosterone affects the development of 
autism. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal testosterone 
exposure in an animal model may result in autistic behaviors by modifying 
seratonin, dopamine, IGF-1, and oxytocin levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Group 1 (control, n = 6) and Group 2 (testosterone 
undecanoate, n = 6) of female rats were randomly assigned. For two to three days 
during the oestrus cycle, female rats were housed with a reproductive male 
(three females/one male). On the tenth day of gestation, rats in Group 1 
received 1 ml/kg% 0.9 NaCl saline whereas rats in Group 2 received 250 mg/kg 
testosterone undecanoate. Until weaning on postnatal day 21 (P21), the mothers 
were permitted to care for their pups. On P21, 40 littermates-10 male and female 
for control, 10 male and female from mothers that exposed to testosterone-were 
arbitrarily split up and housed. On P50, these mature rats were tested for their 
behavior. The rats were then sacrificed. The brain tissue was subjected to 
histological examinations as well as biochemical tests for homovanillic acid 
(HVA), 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), oxytocin and Insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1).
RESULTS: The groups differed significantly in the behavioral examinations 
(three-chamber social test, passive avoidance learning analysis, open field 
test), with the testosterone-exposed groups exhibiting autistic symptoms to a 
higher extent. When compared to the control groups, testosterone exposure caused 
significant histological changes in the hippocampus CA1 and CA3 areas, including 
gliosis and cell death of neurons. In the testosterone-exposed groups, HVA, 
5-HIAA and IGF-1 tissue expressions in the brain elevated whereas oxytocin 
levels reduced. These findings point to a potential connection between 
neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD and exposure to testosterone during 
gestation.
CONCLUSION: Overall, we revealed that prenatal testosterone exposure led to 
autistic traits by elevating seratonin, dopamine, and IGF-1 levels while 
lowering oxytocin levels."
1285,"Emergence of various circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) promotes 
the identification of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines and broadly neutralizing 
antibodies (bNAbs). Here, to characterize monoclonal antibodies cross-reactive 
against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and to search the criterion for bNAbs 
against all emerging SARS-CoV-2, we isolated several SARS-CoV-1-cross-reactive 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from a wildtype SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donor. 
These antibodies showed broad binding capacity and cross-neutralizing potency 
against various SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 
(Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), but failed to efficiently neutralize Omicron 
variant and its sublineages. Structural analysis revealed how Omicron 
sublineages, but not other VOCs, efficiently evade an antibody family 
cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-1 through their escape mutations. Further 
evaluation of a series of SARS-CoV-1/2-cross-reactive bNAbs showed a negative 
correlation between the neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-1 and 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Together, these results suggest the necessity of 
using cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron as criteria 
for rational design and development of potent pan-sarbecovirus vaccines and 
bNAbs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1286,"PURPOSE: Acetylcarnitine can be assessed in vivo using proton MRS (1 H-MRS) with 
long TEs and this has been previously applied successfully in muscle. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate a 1 H-MRS technique for liver acetylcarnitine 
quantification in healthy humans before and after l-carnitine supplementation.
METHOD: Baseline acetylcarnitine levels were quantified using a STEAM sequence 
with prolonged TE in 15 healthy adults. Using STEAM with four different TEs was 
evaluated in phantoms. To assess reproducibility of the measurements, five of 
the participants had repeated 1 H-MRS without receiving l-carnitine 
supplementation. To determine if liver acetylcarnitine could be changed after 
l-carnitine supplementation, acetylcarnitine was quantified 2 h after 
intravenous l-carnitine supplementation (50 mg/kg body weight) in the other 10 
participants. Hepatic lipids were also quantified from the 1 H-MRS spectra.
RESULTS: There was good separation between the acetylcarnitine and fat in the 
phantoms using TE = 100 ms. Hepatic acetylcarnitine levels were reproducible 
(coefficient of reproducibility = 0.049%) and there was a significant 
(p < 0.001) increase in the relative abundance after a single supplementation of 
l-carnitine. Hepatic allylic, methyl, and methylene peaks were not altered by 
l-carnitine supplementation in healthy volunteers.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that our 1 H-MRS technique could be used to 
measure acetylcarnitine in the liver and detect changes following intravenous 
supplementation in healthy adults despite the presence of lipids. Our techniques 
should be explored further in the study of fatty liver disease, where 
acetylcarnitine is suggested to be altered due to hepatic inflexibilities."
1287,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived liver organoids serve as 
models of organogenesis, disease, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. 
Prevailing methods for generating organoids rely on Matrigel, whose 
batch-to-batch variability and xenogeneic source pose challenges to mechanistic 
research and translation to human clinical therapy. In this report, we 
demonstrate that self-assembled Matrigel-free iPSC-derived organoids developed 
in rotating wall vessels (RWVs) exhibit greater hepatocyte-specific functions 
than organoids formed on Matrigel. We show that RWVs produce highly-functional 
liver organoids in part by eliminating the need for Matrigel, which has adverse 
effects on hepatic lineage differentiation. RWV liver organoids sustain durable 
function over long-term culture and express a range of mature functional genes 
at levels comparable to adult human liver, while retaining some fetal features. 
Our results indicate that RWVs provide a simple and high-throughput way to 
generate Matrigel-free liver organoids suitable for research and clinical 
applications."
1288,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as its prevention and control 
measures, seriously affected the people's livehood, which may have affected the 
body's level of vitamin D (VD). This study aimed to investigate the effect of 
the COVID-19 pandemic on the VD status of children in Zhengzhou, China. In this 
study, we included 12,272 children in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 
16,495 children in 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) to examine the changes in 
VD levels and deficiency rates among children before and during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Total VD levels in 2020 were significantly higher than those in 2019 
(26.56 (18.15, 41.40) ng/ml vs. 25.98 (17.92, 40.09) ng/ml, P < 0.001). Further 
analysis revealed that during the COVID-19 pandemic control period in 2020, the 
VD levels in February, March, and April were lower than those in the same months 
of 2019, while the VD deficiency rates were significantly higher. Additionally, 
our data revealed that VD levels decreased significantly with age. Among 
children older than 6 years, the VD deficiency rate exceeded 50%. These results 
indicate that we should pay close attention to VD supplementation during the 
COVID-19 pandemic control period and in children older than 6 years of age. This

1289,"INTRODUCTION: Rectoperineal congenital anorectal malformations (CARMs) are 
diagnosed by examining the perineum, combined with electric stimulation (ES) of 
the anal sphincter performed under anesthesia. This procedure may be troublesome 
because it is based on the observed contractibility of the sphincter. We aimed 
to add 3-dimensional high-resolution anorectal manometry (3D-HRAM) to the 
procedure and to assess its value for diagnosing rectoperineal forms of CARM.
METHODS: We prospectively included 66 patients younger than 24 months who 
presented with constipation and were suspected of CARM, idiopathic constipation, 
or Hirschsprung disease. The patients were assessed between 2015 and 2021 at 
University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands. All patients underwent 
3D-HRAM, followed by the standard diagnostic procedure for either CARM or 
Hirschsprung disease.
RESULTS: Of the 51 patients who underwent both 3D-HRAM and ES, we observed that 
patients with rectoperineal CARM revealed a pressure gap along the anterior part 
of the anal sphincter. Based on this observation, we diagnosed 35 patients with 
CARM. Subsequently, all 35 diagnoses were confirmed with ES. Sixteen patients 
were diagnosed as not having CARM, 100% of whom were in agreement with the gold 
standard-ES. Both the specificity and sensitivity of 3D-HRAM for diagnosing 
rectoperineal CARM were 100%.
DISCUSSION: We consider 3D-HRAM a reliable tool for diagnosing and excluding 
rectoperineal CARM. Using this method in patients suspected of CARM might keep 
infants from undergoing unnecessary interventions requiring anesthetics, such as 
ES. By providing objective insight into the functional capabilities of the anal 
sphincter, anorectal manometry adds to the diagnosis."
1290,"BACKGROUND: Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is responsible for a considerable 
disease burden but is widely heterogeneous. The lack of a comprehensive 
prognostic instrument covering the entire MVP spectrum, encompassing the 
quantified consequent degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR), hinders clinical 
management and therapeutic trials.
METHODS: The new Mitral Regurgitation International Database Quantitative 
(MIDA-Q) registry enrolled 8187 consecutive patients (ages 63±16 years, 47% 
women, follow-up 5.5±3.3 years) first diagnosed with isolated MVP, without or 
with DMR quantified prospectively (measuring effective regurgitant orifice [ERO] 
and regurgitant volume) in routine practice of 5 tertiary care centers from 
North America, Europe, and the Middle East. The MIDA-Q score ranges from 0 to 15 
by accumulating guideline-based risk factors and DMR severity. Long-term 
survival under medical management was the primary outcome end point.
RESULTS: MVP was associated with DMR absent/mild (ERO <20 mm2) in 50%, moderate 
(ERO 20-40 mm2) in 25%, and severe or higher (ERO ≥40 mm2) in 25%, with mean ERO 
24±24 mm2, regurgitant volume 37±35 mL. Median MIDA-Q score was 4 with a wide 
distribution (10%-90%; range, 0-9). MIDA-Q score was higher in patients with 
EuroScore II ≥1% versus <1% (median, 7 versus 3; P < 0.0001) but with wide 
overlap (10%-90%; range, 4-11 versus 0-7) and mediocre correlation (R2 0.18). 
Five-year survival under medical management was strongly associated with MIDA-Q 
score, 97±1% with score 0, 95±1% with score 1 to 2, 82±1% with score 3 to 4, 
67±1% with score 5 to 6, 60±1% with score 7 to 8, 44±1% with score 9 to 10, 
35±1% with score 11 to 12, and 5±4% with MIDA-Q score ≥13, with hazard ratio 
1.31 [1.29-1.33] per 1-point increment. Excess mortality with higher MIDA-Q 
scores persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and EuroScore II (adjusted 
hazard ratio, 1.13 [1.11-1.15] per 1-point increment). Subgroup analysis showed 
persistent association of MIDA-Q score with mortality in all possible subsets, 
in particular, with EuroScore II<1% (hazard ratio, 1.08 [1.02-1.14]) or ≥1% 
(hazard ratio, 1.11 [1.08-1.13]) and with no/mild DMR (hazard ratio, 1.14 
[1.10-1.19]) or moderate/severe DMR (hazard ratio, 1.13 [1.10-1.16], all per 
1-point increment with P<0.0001). Nested-model and bootstrapping analyses 
demonstrated incremental prognostic power of MIDA-Q score (all P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This large, international cohort of isolated MVP, with prospective 
DMR quantification in routine practice, demonstrates the wide range of risk 
factor accumulation and considerable heterogeneity of outcomes after MVP 
diagnosis. The MIDA-Q score is strongly, independently, and incrementally 
associated with long-term survival after MVP diagnosis, irrespective of 
presentation, and is therefore a crucial prognostic instrument for risk 
stratification, clinical trials, and management of patients diagnosed with all 
forms of MVP."
1291,"Right ventricular clot-in-transit (CIT) is a rare finding in venous 
thromboembolic disease and carries a high mortality rate. Its optimal treatments 
have yet to be established in the literature. Here we describe the usage of a

successfully retrieve a CIT from the right ventricle of a patient with 
coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome on veno-veno 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation."
1292,"PURPOSE: Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) are well placed to deliver physical 
activity advice but this is currently not routine clinical practice. Increasing 
evidence demonstrates physical activity can improve quality-of-life for people 
affected by cancer, enable behaviour change, improve survival and reduce 
long-term treatment effects. We aimed to understand AHPs' current knowledge and 
practice in advising about physical activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: AHPs' self-reported knowledge, competency and training 
needs in managing physical effects of cancer, and the merits of physical 
activity data were collected via an online survey. The survey link was cascaded 
electronically to all NHS and NHS-affiliated AHPs working across several generic 
and non-cancer-specific healthcare interfaces across one city in England.
RESULTS: Eighty AHPs responded. Forty-one percent of AHPs had patients with 
current or past diagnoses of cancer. Overall, AHPs reported low confidence in 
giving physical activity advice, with physiotherapists the most confident. 60% 
of respondents identified training needs concerning the impact of cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the merits of physical activity for people affected by 
cancer is clearly evidenced, low levels of AHP confidence and competence in 
discussing this topic limit patients' awareness and access to services. 
Addressing this confidence and competence has potential to improve patient 
outcome."
1293,"Terpenoid glycosides have significant curative effects on many kinds of 
diseases. Most of these compounds are derived from medicinal plants. 
Glycosylation is a key step in the biosynthesis of medicinal terpenoids. In 
plants, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-dependent glycosyltransferases comprise a 
large family of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of sugars from donor to 
acceptor to form various bioactive glycosides. In recent years, numerous 
terpenoid UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) have been cloned and characterized in 
medicinal plants. This article reviews the typical characteristics and evolution 
of terpenoids-related UGTs in plants and summarizes the advances and research 
strategies of terpenoid UGTs in medicinal plants over the past 20 years. This 
paper provides a reference for the study of glycosylation of terpenoid skeletons 
and the biosynthetic pathways for medicinal terpenoids in plants."
1294,"Artificial enzymes have demonstrated therapeutic benefit against diverse 
malignant tumors, yet their antitumor potencies are still severely compromised 
by non-selective catalysis, low atomic utilization efficiency, and undesired 
off-target toxicity. Herein, we report that the peroxidase-like biomineralized 
copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages 
(CuCH-NCs) act as a pH-activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor-selective and 
synergistic chemodynamic/chemo-immunotherapy against aggressive triple-negative 
breast cancers (TNBCs). These CuCH-NCs show pH-sensitive Cu2+ release, which 
spontaneously undergoes glutathione (GSH)-mediated reduction into Cu+ species 
for catalyzing the evolution of H2 O2 into hydroxyl radicals in a 
single-atom-like manner to cause chemodynamic cell injury, and simultaneously 
activates non-toxic disulfiram to cytotoxic complex for yielding selective 
chemotherapeutic damage via blocking cell proliferation and amplifying cell 
apoptosis. CuCH-NCs exhibit considerable tumor-targeting capacity with deep 
penetration depth, thus affording preferable efficacy against orthotopic breast 
tumors through synergistic chemodynamic/chemotherapy, together with good in vivo 
safety. Moreover, CuCH-NCs arouse distinct immunogenic cell death effect and 
upregulate PD-L1 expression upon disulfiram combination, and thus synergize with 
anti-PD-L1 antibody to activate adaptive and innate immunities, together with 
relieved immunosuppression, finally yielding potent antitumor efficacy against 
both primary and metastatic TNBCs. These results provide insights into smart and 
high-performance proenzymes for synergistic therapy against aggressive cancers.

1295,"Persistent Hypoglossal Artery (PHA) is an embryological vascular variation 
mostly originating from the internal carotid artery. The presence of PHA has 
been associated with the incidence of some diseases such as cerebral ischemia, 
atherosclerosis, and aneurysm. Here, a very rare case of PHA that was discovered 
incidentally by Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) in Turkey is reported. 
Endovascular stenting was not performed for this patient. Also, its clinical 
importance is discussed."
1296,"Objectives: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique to assess 
motor system function which has been used extensively in amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS). Information on the changes during disease progression is 
scarce. We aimed to collect this information in a single source. Methods: 
Literature search tools and personal searching were used to find relevant data. 
Results: In ALS, 1. Motor threshold tends to increase in hand muscles over 
disease progression. 2. Central motor conduction time is not a sensitive 
measurement. 3. Motor evoked potential amplitude decreases, in particular in 
lower limbs. 4. Primary peak from the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) reduces 
in amplitude and synchronicity, but longer duration. 5. Inhibitory responses 
using PSTH are more pronounced over the disease course. 6. In hand muscles 
central silent period (CSP) is shorter early in the disease but increases with 
time. 7. Short inhibitory cortical interval (SICI) is abnormal in the very early 
disease stage and shows greater abnormality over time. 8. Area and volume in 
cortical maps of hand muscle decrease markedly with disease progression. 
Discussion: TMS studies evaluating changes over time in ALS suggest that 
measuring interneuronal inhibitory dysfunction is a promising method to track 
progression but motor amplitude and cortical maps should be investigated 
further. Conclusions: Available TMS studies quantifying central motor 
dysfunction are insufficient to propose a single physiological measurement for 
evaluating progression in ALS."
1297,"Up to 50% of patients treated with curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer 
will develop recurrence, contributing to the dismal survival associated with 
this disease. Regional recurrence may represent disease that is not yet widely 
metastatic and may therefore be amenable to more-aggressive treatment. We sought 
to assess all patients treated with curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer 
who developed regional recurrence. We retrospectively identified all patients 
who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma at a single institution from January 2000 to August 
2019. In total, 1626 patients were included in the study cohort. As of June 
2022, 595 patients had disease recurrence, which was distant or systemic in 435 
patients (27%), regional in 125 (7.7%), and local in 35 (2.2%). On multivariable 
analysis, neoadjuvant chemoradiation with a total radiation dose <45 Gy (hazard 
ratio [HR], 3.5 [95% CI, 1.7-7.3]; P=0.001), pathologic node-positive disease 
(HR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-3.0]; P=0.003), and lymphovascular invasion (HR, 1.6 [95% 
CI, 1.0-2.5]; P=0.049) were predictors of isolated nodal recurrence, whereas 
increasing age (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]; P=0.001) and increasing number of 
excised lymph nodes (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]; P=0.021) were independently 
associated with decreased risk of regional recurrence. Patients treated with a 
combination of local and systemic therapies had better survival outcomes than 
patients treated with systemic therapy alone (P<0.001). In patients with 
recurrence of esophageal cancer limited to regional lymph nodes, salvage 
treatment may be possible. Higher radiation doses and more-extensive 
lymphadenectomy may reduce the risk of regional recurrence. This article is

1298,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated mental disorders have been attributed to 
the excessive accumulation of hemodialysis-resistant indoxyl-3-sulfate (I3S) in 
the brain. I3S not only induces oxidative stress but is also a potent endogenous 
agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Here, we investigated the role 
of AhR in CKD-induced brain disorders using a 5/6 nephrectomy-induced CKD mouse 
model, which showed increased I3S concentration in both blood and brain, anxiety 
and impaired novelty recognition, and AhR activation in the anterior cortex. 
GFAP+ reactive astrocytes were increased accompanied with the reduction of 
glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) on perineuronal astrocytic processes (PAPs) in 
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in CKD mice, and these alterations were 
attenuated in both neural lineage-specific and astrocyte-specific Ahr 
conditional knockout mice (nAhrCKO and aAhrCKO). By using chronic I3S treatment 
in primary astrocytes and glia-neuron (GN) mix cultures to mimic the CKD brain 
microenvironment, we also found significant reduction of GLT1 expression and 
activity in an AhR-dependent manner. Chronic I3S treatment induced AhR-dependent 
pro-oxidant Nox1 and AhR-independent anti-oxidant HO-1 expressions. Notably, AhR 
mediates chronic I3S-induced neuronal activity enhancement and synaptotoxicity 
in GN mix, not neuron-enriched cortical culture. In CKD mice, neuronal activity 
enhancement was observed in ACC and hippocampal CA1, and these responses were 
abrogated by both nAhrCKO and aAhrCKO. Finally, intranasal AhR antagonist 
CH-223191 administration significantly ameliorated the GLT1/PAPs reduction, 
increase in c-Fos+ neurons, and memory impairment in the CKD mice. Thus, 
astrocytic AhR plays a crucial role in the CKD-induced disturbance of 
neuron-astrocyte interaction and mental disorders."
1299,"Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, must first be converted to its 
toxigenic form and cross the sugar-rich mucus barrier before it can cause 
disease, but whether these hurdles are linked is unclear. In this issue, Wang 
et al (2022) provide new evidence that mucus O-glycans directly prevent 
toxigenic conversion and virulence factor expression in V. cholerae."
1300,"OBJECTIVES: Fetal blood circulation may be modified in congenital heart disease 
(CHD). This retrospective analysis was performed to study whether the type of 
CHD is associated with specific placental pathology.
METHODS: 3 types of CHD based on presumed proportion of placental and systemic 
blood distribution in fetal circulation were analyzed: Group 1: 89 cases with 
low placental blood content (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, transposition of 
great arteries, coarctation of aorta), Group 2: 71 placentas with intermediate 
placental and systemic blood content due to increased intracardiac blood mixing 
(tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, double inlet/outlet ventricle), and 
Group 3: 24 placentas with high placental blood content (tricuspid or pulmonary 
atresia, Ebstein anomaly). Frequencies of 27 independent clinical and 47 
placental phenotypes of 184 placentas in those three groups were statistically 
compared.
RESULTS: The most advanced gestational age at delivery, and large vessel 
(global) fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM) were most common in Group 1, while 
macerated stillbirths, neonatal mortality, abnormal amniotic fluid volume 
(oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios), other congenital anomalies, distal villous 
lesions of FVM, placental edema and amnion nodosum were most common in Groups 2 
and 3, although the frequencies of placental lesions were statistically not 
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Left heart obstructive lesions potentially associated with brain 
maldevelopment show increase in lesions of global FVM (in aggregate and 
individually fetal vascular ectasia, stem vessel obliteration and intramural 
fibrin deposition) as may be seen in umbilical cord compromise. CHD with 
increased intracardiac blood mixing or with right heart defects is associated 
with average preterm gestational age at delivery and placental lesions of distal 
villous FVM, villous edema and amnion nodosum."
1301,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed (1) to evaluate the agreement between two methods (equation 
and bio-impedance analysis [BIA]) to estimate skeletal muscle mass (SMM), and 
(2) to assess if SMM was associated with all-cause mortality risk in individuals 
across different geographical sites in Peru.
METHODS: We used data from the CRONICAS Cohort Study (2010-2018), a 
population-based longitudinal study in Peru to assess cardiopulmonary risk 
factors from different geographical settings. SMM was computed as a function of 
weight, height, sex and age (Lee equation) and by BIA. All-cause mortality was 
retrieved from national vital records. Cox proportional-hazard models were 
developed and results presented as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CI).
RESULTS: At baseline, 3216 subjects, 51.5% women, mean age 55.7 years, were 
analyzed. The mean SMM was 23.1 kg (standard deviation [SD]: 6.0) by Lee 
equation, and 22.7 (SD: 5.6) by BIA. Correlation between SMM estimations was 
strong (Pearson's ρ coefficient = 0.89, p<0.001); whereas Bland-Altman analysis 
showed a small mean difference. Mean follow-up was 7.0 (SD: 1.0) years, and 
there were 172 deaths. In the multivariable model, each additional kg in SMM was 
associated with a 19% reduction in mortality risk (HR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.75-0.88) 
using the Lee equation, but such an estimate was not significant when using BIA 
(HR=0.98; 95% CI: 0.94-1.03). Compared to the lowest tertile, subjects at the 
highest SMM tertile had a 56% reduction in risk of mortality using the Lee 
equation, but there was no such association when using BIA estimations.
CONCLUSION: There is a strong correlation and agreement between SMM estimates 
obtained by the Lee equation and BIA. Howevers, an association between SMM and 
all-cause mortality exists only when the Lee equation is used. Our findings call 
for appropriate use of approaches to estimate SMM, and there should be a focus 
on muscle mass in promoting healthier ageing. This article is protected by

1302,"Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is a major cause of childhood morbidity. 
Mono-allelic mutations in Trim71, a conserved stem-cell-specific RNA-binding 
protein, cause CH; however, the molecular basis for pathogenesis mediated by 
these mutations remains unknown. Here, using mouse embryonic stem cells as a 
model, we reveal that the mouse R783H mutation (R796H in human) alters Trim71's 
mRNA substrate specificity and leads to accelerated stem-cell differentiation 
and neural lineage commitment. Mutant Trim71, but not wild-type Trim71, binds 
Lsd1 (Kdm1a) mRNA and represses its translation. Specific inhibition of this 
repression or a slight increase of Lsd1 in the mutant cells alleviates the 
defects in stem cell differentiation and neural lineage commitment. These 
results determine a functionally relevant target of the CH-causing Trim71 mutant 
that can potentially be a therapeutic target and provide molecular mechanistic 
insights into the pathogenesis of this disease."
1303,"Paneth cells are versatile secretory cells located in the crypts of Lieberkühn 
of the small intestine. In normal conditions, they function as the cornerstones 
of intestinal health by preserving homeostasis. They perform this function by 
providing niche factors to the intestinal stem cell compartment, regulating the 
composition of the microbiome through the production and secretion of 
antimicrobial peptides, performing phagocytosis and efferocytosis, taking up 
heavy metals, and preserving barrier integrity. Disturbances in one or more of 
these functions can lead to intestinal as well as systemic inflammatory and 
infectious diseases. This review discusses the multiple functions of Paneth 
cells, and the mechanisms and consequences of Paneth cell dysfunction. It also 
provides an overview of the tools available for studying Paneth cells."
1304,"Young adults (YA) represent a minority among recipients of allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In order to describe the 
outcome of YA following HSCT in Germany, 9299 patients who were registered with 
the German Registry for Stem Cell Transplantation were included in this 
retrospective analysis of the years 1998-2019. The impact of the variables, such 
as patient age and sex, sex differences, stem cell source, donor type, 
conditioning, year of HSCT, the diagnosis, and the achieved remission status 
were tested in univariable and multivariable analysis for overall, event-free 
and relapse-free survival as well as for the cumulative incidences of 
non-relapse and therapy-related mortality. Altogether, the outcome of YA after 
HSCT improved over time and was determined by the underlying disease, the age at 
disease onset, stem cell source, and donor type. Patients were most likely to 
die from relapse, and survival of HSCT recipients after 10 years was reduced by 
more than half in comparison to the general population of YA. Deeper 
understanding of modifiable risk factors may be gained by studies comparing the 
outcome of YA post-HSCT with that of children, adolescents and elderly patients. 
A deliberate and strong patient selection may further improve mortality rates."
1305,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are contingent upon clinical manifestations 
and serological markers. However, researchers are struggling to find biomarkers 
with higher sensitivity and specificity. DNA methylation has been the most 
studied epigenetic feature in SLE. So, in this study, we performed a systematic 
review of studies about DNA methylation alterations in SLE patients compared to 
healthy controls.
METHODS: By searching PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to July 2022, all 
case-control studies in which DNA methylation of specific genes was assessed by 
a non-high-throughput technique and passed the quality of bias assessment were 
included.
RESULTS: In total, 44 eligible studies underwent a data extraction process. In 
all, 3471 SLE patients and 1028 healthy individuals were included. Among the 
studies that reported the patients' gender (n = 2853), 89.41% were female and 
10.59% were male. Forty studies have been conducted on adult patients. The 
number of works on fractionated and unfractionated blood cells was almost equal. 
In this regard, 22 studies were conducted on whole blood or peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells and two studies on unfractionated white blood cells. Sorted 
blood cells were biological sources in 20 studies. The most investigated gene 
was IFI44L. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic power of methylation levels 
were only reported for IFI44L in five studies. The most employed methylation 
profiling method was bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction. The 
correlation between methylation patterns and clinical parameters was explored in 
22 studies, which of them 16 publications displayed a remarkable association 
between DNA methylation status and clinical indices.
CONCLUSIONS: The methylation status of some genes especially IFI44L, FOXP3, and 
MX1 has been suggested as promising SLE biomarkers. However, given the 
conflicting findings between studies because of potential confounders such as 
different sample types, methylation profiling methods, and ethnicity as well as 
shared DNA methylation patterns of SLE and other autoimmune diseases, DNA 
methylation biomarkers are currently not reliable diagnostic biomarkers and do 
not represent surrogate markers of SLE disease activity. Future investigations 
on a larger scale with the discarding of limitations of previous studies would 
probably lead to a consensus."
1306,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
have been successively concluded. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) PET in diagnosing AD and early prediction of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) converting to AD. By pooling studies from different centers to 
explore in-depth whether diagnostic performance varies by population type, 
radiotracer type, and diagnostic approach, thus providing a more comprehensive 
theoretical basis for the subsequent widespread application of Aβ PET in the 
clinical setting.
METHODS: Relevant studies were searched through PubMed. The pooled 
sensitivities, specificities, DOR, and the summary ROC curve were obtained based 
on a Bayesian random-effects model.
RESULTS: Forty-eight studies, including 5967 patients, were included. Overall, 
the pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and AUC of Aβ PET for diagnosing AD 
were 0.90, 0.80, 35.68, and 0.91, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that Aβ 
PET had high sensitivity (0.91) and specificity (0.81) for differentiating AD 
from normal controls but very poor specificity (0.49) for determining AD from 
MCI. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.84 and 0.62, respectively, 
for predicting the conversion of MCI to AD. The differences in diagnostic 
efficacy between visual assessment and quantitative analysis and between 11 
C-PIB PET and 18 F-florbetapir PET were insignificant.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall performance of Aβ PET in diagnosing AD is favorable, 
but the differentiation between MCI and AD patients should consider that some 
MCI may be at risk of conversion to AD and may be misdiagnosed. A multimodal 
diagnostic approach and machine learning analysis may be effective in improving 
diagnostic accuracy."

1308,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the population status of selenium in 
Colombia and other associated factors.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study, in population of urban or rural origin (n=412). 
Main outcome measures were: median serum selenium, thyrotropin, the prevalence 
of and positivity of anti-thyroid peroxidase, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-TSH 
receptor.
RESULTS: This study found that 96.6% of the subjects had normal selenium levels, 
and no significant associations were found between the population median of 
selenium and overweight/obesity, sociodemographic variables, age, goiter, and 
thyroid antibody positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia, the population status of selenium is normal, and the 
geological characteristics may contribute to the state of selenium in this 
population. However, additional studies are required to evaluate the content of 
selenium in plants and other foods."

cells, where BACH2 was first shown to play an important role in the immune 
system. In B cells, BACH2 orchestrates the gene regulatory network that promotes 
class-switch and affinity-maturation of antibodies and simultaneously represses 
plasma-cell differentiation. In this context, BACH2 regulates gene expression by 
modulating chromatin organization, cooperatively with other transcription 
factors and chromatin regulators, such as IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) 
and PC4 (positive coactivator 4), respectively. In addition, our recent 
observation raises the possibility that BACH2 has diverse functions, such as 
those in gene activation. Since dysfunction of BACH2 leads to the onset of human 
immune deficiencies, revealing new functions of BACH2 may give a cue to solve 
how BACH2 contributes to preventing these diseases."
1310,"Lumbar interbody fusion (LIF) is an excellent treatment option for a number of 
lumbar diseases. LIF can be performed through posterior, transforaminal, 
anterior, and lateral or oblique approaches. Each technique has its own pearls 
and pitfalls. Through LIF, segmental stabilization, neural decompression, and 
deformity correction can be achieved. Minimally invasive surgery has recently 
gained popularity and each LIF procedure can be performed using minimally 
invasive techniques to reduce surgery-related complications and improve early 
postoperative recovery. Despite advances in surgical technology, surgery-related 
complications after LIF, such as pseudoarthrosis, have not yet been overcome. 
Although autogenous iliac crest bone graft is the gold standard for spinal 
fusion, other bone substitutes are available to enhance fusion rate and reduce 
complications associated with bone harvest. This article reviews the surgical 
procedures and characteristics of each LIF and the osteobiologics utilized in 
LIF based on the available evidence."
1311,"AIMS: The amount and pattern of cigarette and alcohol consumption are highly 
associated with cardiovascular risk. The aim of the present study was the 
assessment of changes in arterial stiffness and classical risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease after alcohol withdrawal and detoxification in persons 
with alcohol use disorder.
METHODS: Two hundred and forty-one individuals (men and women) participated in 
the investigation. The photoplethysmographic method was applied to assess 
arterial stiffness in three stages within 6 weeks. Participants were divided 
into subgroups based on age and sex. Analyses were performed using analysis of 
variance with repeated measures.
RESULTS: Different variations in time of stiffness index (SI) and reflection 
index (RI) values were recorded. Some increases in triglycerides, total 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and a decrease in high-density lipoproteins 
were observed in all analyzed groups. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(DP) changed significantly during the 3 weeks of the study only in a group of 
younger men. The SI is correlated with age and gender. No correlation of RI with 
sex was found; however, RI was strongly correlated with age, pulse and DP.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented study shows that some groups of patients (older women 
and younger men) after detoxification may be particularly vulnerable to vascular 
system disorders, i.e. arterial stiffness, making it suggested to include 
additional observation during therapy."
1312,"Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most prevalent ocular diseases but has 
limited treatment options. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR), a major chloride channel that stimulates fluid secretion in the ocular 
surface, may pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for DED. Herein, we 
report the optimization of Cact-3, a potent CFTR activator with poor solubility, 
to 16d, a potent CFTR activator with suitable solubility for eye drop 
formulation. Notably, 16d was well distributed in target tissues including 
cornea and conjunctiva with minimal systemic exposure in rabbit. Topical ocular 
instillation of 16d significantly enhanced tear secretion and improved corneal 
erosion in a mouse model of DED. In addition, 16d significantly reduced mRNA 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-17, and TNF-α and 
MMP2 in cornea and conjunctiva of DED mice."
1313,"BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used drugs for 
gastric-acid-related diseases, which may have an impact on the gut microbiome. 
We aimed to evaluate the associations of PPI use with risks of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: We analysed the associations of PPI use with risks of coronary artery 
disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and 
all-cause mortality in 19,229 adults with T2D using data from the UK Biobank 
study.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 10.9-11.2 years, we documented a total of 
2,971 CAD, 1,827 MI, 1,192 HF, and 738 stroke cases, along with 2,297 total 
deaths. PPI use was significantly associated with higher risks of CAD (HR, 1.27; 
95% CI, 1.15-1.40), MI (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.18-1.52), HF (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 
1.16-1.57) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.16-1.45). No significant 
association was observed between PPI use and stroke (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 
0.90-1.36). The results were consistent in the subgroup analyses stratified by 
factors including indications of PPI, anti-diabetic medication use, and 
antiplatelet drug use. Analyses in a 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort of PPI 
users versus non-users yielded similar results.
INTERPRETATION: Our data suggested that PPI use was associated with higher risks 
of CVD events and mortality among patients with T2D. The benefits and risks of 
PPI use should be carefully balanced among patients with T2D, and monitoring of 
adverse CVD events during PPI therapy should be enhanced."
1314,"BACKGROUND: IFNL4 genetic variants that are strongly associated with clearance 
of hepatitis C virus have been linked to risk of certain opportunistic 
infections (OIs) and cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma, cytomegalovirus 
infection, and herpes simplex virus infection. As the interferon (IFN) λ family 
plays a role in response to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, IFNL4 
genotype might affect risk for a wide range of OIs/cancers.
METHODS: We examined associations between genotype for the functional IFNL4 
rs368234815 polymorphism and incidence of 16 OIs/cancers among 2310 men with 
human immunodeficiency virus (2038 white; 272 black) enrolled in the Multicenter 
AIDS Cohort Study during 1984-1990. Our primary analyses used Cox proportional 
hazards models adjusted for self-reported racial ancestry to estimate hazard 
ratios with 95% confidence intervals, comparing participants with the genotypes 
that generate IFN-λ4 and those with the genotype that abrogates IFN-λ4. We 
censored follow-up at the introduction of highly effective antiretroviral 
therapies.
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant association between IFNL4 
genotype and the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma (hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% confidence 
interval, .76-1.11]), cytomegalovirus infection (0.94 [.71-1.24]), herpes 
simplex virus infection (1.37 [.68-2.93]), or any other OI/cancer. We observed 
consistent results using additive genetic models and after controlling for CD4 
cell count through time-dependent adjustment or restriction to participants with 
a low CD4 cell count.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of associations between IFNL4 genotype and these 
OIs/cancers provides evidence that this gene does not affect the risk of disease 
from opportunistic pathogens."
1315,"The kidney tubule consists of a single layer of epithelial cells supported by 
the tubular basement membrane (TBM), a thin layer of specialized extracellular 
matrix (ECM). The mechanical properties of the ECM are important for regulating 
a wide range of cell functions including proliferation, differentiation and cell 
survival. Increased ECM stiffness plays a role in promoting multiple 
pathological conditions including cancer, fibrosis and heart disease. How 
changes in TBM mechanics regulate tubular epithelial cell behavior is not fully 
understood. Here we introduce a cell culture system that utilizes in 
vivo-derived TBM to investigate cell-matrix interactions in kidney proximal 
tubule cells. Basement membrane mechanics was controlled using genipin, a 
biocompatibility crosslinker. Genipin modification resulted in a dose-dependent 
increase in matrix stiffness. Crosslinking had a marginal but statistically 
significant impact on the diffusive molecular transport properties of the TBM, 
likely due to a reduction in pore size. Both native and genipin-modified TBM 
substrates supported tubular epithelial cell growth. Cells were able to attach 
and proliferate to form confluent monolayers. Tubular epithelial cells polarized 
and assembled organized cell-cell junctions. Genipin modification had minimal 
impact on cell viability and proliferation. Genipin stiffened TBM increased gene 
expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines and altered gene expression for N-cadherin, 
a proximal tubular epithelial specific cell-cell junction marker. This work 
introduces a new cell culture model for cell-basement membrane mechanobiology 
studies that utilizes in vivo-derived basement membrane. We also demonstrate 
that TBM stiffening affects tubular epithelial cell function through altered 
gene expression of cell-specific differentiation markers and induced increased 
expression of pro-fibrotic growth factors."
1316,"OBJECTIVES: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) with prognosis in various 
infectious diseases. For fractured patients admitted to the intensive care units 
(ICU), an accurate and fast appraisal is essential. To investigate the 
association between RDW and prognosis in fractured patients admitted to the ICU 
utilizing the MIMIC-III database.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort from the MIMIC III database from 2001 and 2012 
was constructed. RDW and other information were collected with in-hospital 
mortality as the primary outcome and 90-day mortality and hospital and intensive 
care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) as secondary outcomes. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression models with propensity score inverse 
probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to investigate the 
prognostic value of RDW. A nomogram was built with significant prognostic 
factors to predict in-hospital mortality, and the performance of the nomogram 
was evaluated and compared with other severity assessment scores. Subgroup 
analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 2721 fracture patients admitted to the ICU were identified. 
After IPTW, the group with higher RDW was significantly associated with elevated 
in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.19-2.37), 90-day mortality (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04-1.86), prolonged hospital 
LOS (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03-1.50), and ICU LOS significantly (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 
1.05-1.53) in the multivariate logistics model. The nomogram showed optimal 
discriminative ability and predictive accuracy with an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.77.
CONCLUSION: RDW independently predicted in-hospital mortality, 90-day mortality, 
and hospital and ICU LOS in fractured patients admitted to ICU. The nomogram 
including RDW could also be a promising tool with potential clinical benefits."
1317,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this case series was to collect preliminary data on 
safety and efficacy of treating cats suffering from refractory feline chronic 
gingivostomatitis with a single intravenous therapy of cryopreserved 
placenta-derived mesenchymal stromal cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We planned the prospective inclusion of cats suffering 
from refractory chronic gingivostomatitis in three veterinary clinics. All cats 
received a single infusion of 10×106 cryopreserved cells. Follow-up evaluations 
were done at day 15 and at 2-, 3- and 6-months following infusion. Clinical 
disease severity was evaluated by dental specialists using a published 
stomatitis disease activity index scoring system coupled with an owners' 
assessment questionnaire.
RESULTS: All eight cats attended all follow up visits. Cryopreserved 
ready-to-use placenta-derived cells administered systemically were safe and 
resulted in notable clinical improvement in all cats as reported by stomatitis 
disease activity index scoring and owner's survey.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Infusion of cryopreserved freshly thawed placenta-derived 
mesenchymal stromal cells appears to promote clinical and consequently 
behavioural benefits in cats with refractory chronic gingivostomatitis after 
having undergone full-mouth or premolar-molar tooth extraction. Future 
randomised studies are required to confirm safety and efficacy of this 
treatment."
1318,"During nervous system development, neurons send out axons, which must navigate 
large distances to reach synaptic targets. Axons grow out sequentially. The 
early outgrowing axons, pioneers, must integrate information from various 
guidance cues in their environment to determine the correct direction of 
outgrowth. Later outgrowing follower axons can at least in part navigate by 
adhering to pioneer axons. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the right side of the 
largest longitudinal axon tract, the ventral nerve cord, is pioneered by the AVG 
axon. How the AVG axon navigates is only partially understood. In this study we 
describe the role of two members of the IgCAM family, wrk-1 and rig-5, in AVG 
axon navigation. While wrk-1 and rig-5 single mutants do not show AVG navigation 
defects, both mutants have highly penetrant pioneer and follower navigation 
defects in a nid-1 mutant background. Both mutations increase the fraction of 
follower axons following the misguided pioneer axon. We found that wrk-1 and 
rig-5 act in different genetic pathways, suggesting that we identified two 
pioneer-independent guidance pathways used by follower axons. We assessed 
general locomotion, mechanosensory responsiveness and habituation to determine 
whether axonal navigation defects impact nervous system function. In rig-5 nid-1 
double mutants we found no significant defects in free movement behaviour, 
however a subpopulation of animals shows minor changes in response duration 
habituation after mechanosensory stimulation. These results suggest that 
guidance defects of axons in the motor circuit do not necessarily lead to major 
movement or behavioural defects, but impact more complex behavioural modulation."
1319,"BACKGROUND: Current imaging modalities underestimate the severity of 
intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). High resolution vessel wall imaging 
(HR-VWI) MRI is a powerful tool in characterizing plaques. We aim to show that 
HR-VWI MRI is more accurate at detecting and characterizing intracranial plaques 
compared to digital subtraction angiography (DSA), time-of-flight (TOF) MRA, and 
computed tomography angiogram (CTA).
METHODS: Patients with symptomatic ICAD prospectively underwent 7T HR-VWI. We 
calculated: degree of stenosis, plaque burden (PB), and remodeling index (RI). 
The sensitivity of detecting a culprit plaque for each modality as well as the 
correlations between different variables were analyzed. Interobserver agreement 
on the determination of a culprit plaque on every imaging modality was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 44 patients underwent HR-VWI. Thirty-four patients had CTA, 
18 TOF-MRA, and 18 DSA. The sensitivity of plaque detection was 88% for DSA, 78% 
for TOF-MRA, and 76% for CTA. There's significant positive correlation between 
PB and degree of stenosis on HR-VWI MRI (p < 0.001), but not between PB and 
degree of stenosis in DSA (p = 0.168), TOF-MRA (p = 0.144), and CTA (p = 0.253). 
RI had a significant negative correlation with degree of stenosis on HR-VWI MRI 
(p = 0.003), but not on DSA (p = 0.783), TOF-MRA (p = 0.405), or CTA 
(p = 0.751). The best inter-rater agreement for culprit plaque detection was 
with HR-VWI (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The degree of stenosis measured by intra-luminal techniques does 
not fully reflect the true extent of ICAD. HR-VWI is a more accurate tool in 
characterizing atherosclerotic plaques and may be the default imaging modality 
in clinical practice."
1320,"While multiple mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the therapeutic 
effect of lymph node (LN) yield in patients with urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) 
undergoing radical cystectomy (RC), the effect of stage migration, commonly 
known as the Will Rogers effect, is often discounted. We reviewed the National 
Cancer Database for patients with UCC undergoing RC with pathologically 
node-negative (pN0) disease from 2004 to 2016. We tested for an adjusted 
association between LN yield and overall survival using multivariable Cox 
proportional-hazard models. Median survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. We identified 19 939 patients with pN0 UCC treated with RC. After 
adjustment, patients in the highest quantile for LN yield (≥26 LNs) had a 34% 
lower risk of death in comparison to patients in the lowest quantile (≤5 LNs). 
As we increased the threshold for LN yield for dichotomization from >5 to >15 to 
>25 LNs, median survival increased from 83 to 95 to 103 mo. The pN0 group with 
higher LN yield appeared to live longer in this analysis owing to the 
mathematical artifact of how patients are indexed. Resection of a greater number 
of negative LNs will lead to higher fidelity for pN0 cohorts being evaluated, as 
the likelihood of contamination by pN+ cases that were missed will be lower.
PATIENT SUMMARY: A strategy to dissect a high number of lymph nodes in patients 
undergoing removal of their bladder for bladder cancer can be associated with 
side effects, and the benefit in terms of cancer control or survival remains 
uncertain. Urologists and their patients should engage in shared decision-making 
and consider the risks and benefits of more extensive lymph node dissection 
during surgery."
1321,"BACKGROUND: In cardiac rehabilitation programs, cardiorespiratory fitness is 
commonly estimated (eCRF) from the maximum workload achieved on a graded 
exercise test. This study compared four well-established eCRF equations in their 
ability to predict mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: A total of 7269 individuals with CVD were studied (81% male; age 
59.4 ± 10.3yr). eCRF was calculated using equations from the American College of 
Sports Medicine, Bruce et al., the Fitness Registry and the Importance of 
Exercise International Database, and McConnell and Clark. The eCRF from each 
equation was compared with a RMANOVA. Cox proportional hazard models assessed 
the relationship between the eCRF equations and mortality risk. The predictive 
ability of the models was compared using the concordance index.
RESULTS: There were 284 deaths (85% male) over a follow-up period of 
5.8 ± 2.8yr. Although differences in eCRF were observed between each equation 
(P < 0.05), the eCRF from each of the four equations was predictive of mortality 
(P < 0.05). The concordance index values for each of the models were the same 
(0.77) indicating similar predictive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The four well-established eCRF equations did not differ in their 
ability to predict mortality in patients with CVD, indicating any could be used 
for this purpose. However, the differences in eCRF from each of the equations 
suggest potential differences in their ability to guide clinical care and should 
be the focus of future research."
1322,"As a crucial food crop, potatoes are highly consumed worldwide, while they are 
also susceptible to being infected by diverse diseases. Early detection and 
diagnosis can prevent the epidemic of plant diseases and raise crop yields. To 
this end, this study proposed a weakly-supervised learning approach for the 
identification of potato plant diseases. The foundation network was applied with 
the lightweight MobileNet V2, and to enhance the learning ability for minute 
lesion features, we modified the existing MobileNet-V2 architecture using the 
fine-tuning approach conducted by transfer learning. Then, the atrous 
convolution along with the SPP module was embedded into the pre-trained 
networks, which was followed by a hybrid attention mechanism containing channel 
attention and spatial attention submodules to efficiently extract 
high-dimensional features of plant disease images. The proposed approach 
outperformed other compared methods and achieved a superior performance gain. It 
realized an average recall rate of 91.99% for recognizing potato disease types 
on the publicly accessible dataset. In practical field scenarios, the proposed 
approach separately attained an average accuracy and specificity of 97.33% and 
98.39% on the locally collected image dataset. Experimental results present a 
competitive performance and demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the 
proposed approach."
1323,"In 2020 the world faced with a pandemic spread that affected almost everything 
of humans' social and health life. Regulations to decrease the epidemiological 
spread and studies to produce the vaccine of SARS-CoV-2 were on one side a hope 
to return back to the regular life, but on the other side there were also 
notable criticism about the vaccines itself. In this study, we established a 
fractional order differential equations system incorporating the vaccinated and 
re-infected compartments to a SIR frame to consider the expanded and detailed 
form as an SVIIvR model. We considered in the model some essential parameters, 
such as the protection rate of the vaccines, the vaccination rate, and the 
vaccine's lost efficacy after a certain period. We obtained the local stability 
of the disease-free and co-existing equilibrium points under specific conditions 
using the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion and the global stability in using a suitable 
Lyapunov function. For the numerical solutions we applied the Euler's method. 
The data for the simulations were taken from the World Health Organization (WHO) 
to illustrate numerically some scenarios that happened."
1324,"This article's main contributions are twofold: 1) to demonstrate how to apply 
the general European Union's High-Level Expert Group's (EU HLEG) guidelines for 
trustworthy AI in practice for the domain of healthcare and 2) to investigate 
the research question of what does ""trustworthy AI"" mean at the time of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we present the results of a post-hoc 
self-assessment to evaluate the trustworthiness of an AI system for predicting a 
multiregional score conveying the degree of lung compromise in COVID-19 
patients, developed and verified by an interdisciplinary team with members from 
academia, public hospitals, and industry in time of pandemic. The AI system aims 
to help radiologists to estimate and communicate the severity of damage in a 
patient's lung from Chest X-rays. It has been experimentally deployed in the 
radiology department of the ASST Spedali Civili clinic in Brescia, Italy, since 
December 2020 during pandemic time. The methodology we have applied for our 
post-hoc assessment, called Z-Inspection®, uses sociotechnical scenarios to 
identify ethical, technical, and domain-specific issues in the use of the AI 
system in the context of the pandemic."
1325,"The idea of cancer immunotherapy has spread, and it has made tremendous progress 
with the advancement of new technology. Immunotherapy, which serves to assist 
the natural defenses of the body in eradicating cancerous cells, is a remarkable 
achievement that has revolutionized both cancer research and cancer treatments. 
Currently, the use of stem cells in immunotherapy is widespread and shares a 
special characteristic, including cancer cell migration, bioactive component 
release, and immunosuppressive activity. In the context of cancer, mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) are rapidly being identified as vital stromal regulators of 
tumor progression. MSCs therapy has been implicated in treating a wide range of 
diseases, including bone damage, autoimmune diseases, and particularly 
hematopoietic abnormalities, providing stem cell-based therapy with an extra 
dimension. Moreover, the implication of MSCs does not have ethical concerns, and 
the complications known in pluripotent and totipotent stem cells are less common 
in MSCs. MSCs have a lot of distinctive characteristics that, when coupled, make 
them excellent for cellular-based immunotherapy and as vehicles for gene and 
drug delivery in a variety of inflammations and malignancies. MSCs can migrate 
to the inflammatory site and exert immunomodulatory responses via cell-to-cell 
contacts with lymphocytes by generating soluble substances. In the current 
review, we discuss the most recent research on the immunological characteristics 
of MSCs, their use as immunomodulatory carriers, techniques for approving MSCs 
to adjust their immunological contour, and their usages as vehicles for 
delivering therapeutic as well as drugs and genes engineered to destroy tumor 
cells."
1326,"The pathophysiological importance of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cell cytokines in 
pathological pain has been highly debated in recent decades. However, the 
analgesic strategy targeting individual cytokines still has a long way to go for 
clinical application. In this review, we focus on the contributions of Th1 
cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and 
IL-13) in rodent pain models and human pain-related diseases. A large number of 
studies have shown that Th1 and Th2 cytokines have opposing effects on pain 
modulation. The imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines might determine the final 
effect of pain generation or inhibition. However, increasing evidence indicates 
that targeting the individual cytokine is not sufficient for the treatment of 
pathological pain. It is practical to suggest a promising therapeutic strategy 
against the combined effects of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. We summarize the current 
advances in stem cell therapy for pain-related diseases. Preclinical and 
clinical studies show that stem cells inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and 
release enormous Th2 cytokines that exhibit a strong analgesic effect. 
Therefore, a shift of the imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines induced by stem 
cells will provide a novel therapeutic strategy against intractable pain. Thus, 
it is extremely important to reveal the cellular and molecular mechanisms of 
stem cell-mediated analgesia. The efficiency and safety of stem cell therapy 
should be carefully evaluated in animal models and patients with pathological 
pain."
1327,"COVID-19, which primarily affects the pulmonary system, turned out to be a 
global pandemic, whereas the effects on other systems are still unknown. 
SARS-CoV-2, binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the 
lungs, causing pneumonia-like symptoms. The same ACE receptors are also present 
in organs other than the lungs. Therefore, there is a need to study the impact 
of coronavirus on other human body organs. Recently, UK Biobank reports on the 
genetic risk factor of the virus attack. A double mutation in the apolipoprotein 
E (APOE4) allele has shown a significant role in COVID-19. The same APOE4 
mutation has already been proven to hold a key role in developing early-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). Despite this data, Alzheimer's disease is believed 
to be a comorbidity of COVID-19. Previous virus attacks on the same viral 
family, Coronaviridae, produced neurological effects like neurodegeneration, 
neuronal inflammation, and other central nervous system-related dysfunctions. 
Since the long-term implications of COVID-19 are unknown, more research into the 
impact of the virus on the central nervous system is needed. Both COVID-19 and 
AD share a common genetic factor, so that AD patients may have a greater risk of 
SARS-CoV-2. Here, in this review, we have briefly discussed the role of APOE4 in 
the pathogenesis of AD and SARS-CoV-2, along with their treatment strategy, 
current scenario, and possible future directions."
1328,"Since late 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused 
considerable mortality worldwide. This pandemic raised concerns and provoked 
research on the diagnosis and treatment of viruses-based diseases. The accurate 
diagnosis of a virus requires high specificity and sensitivity. Piezoelectric 
sensors are analytical devices that work on mass-sensitivity-based 
micromechanical transducers. The change in the mass by the interaction between 
biological elements and the frequency is recorded by measuring the alternate 
current and voltage. In addition to diagnosis, antiviral intervention strategies 
for mitigating various viral diseases are required. Nanomaterials-based 
antiviral therapy is efficient, particularly with carbon/metal/metal oxide 
(organic/inorganic) nanoparticles. Metal/metal oxide nanoparticles, such as gold 
(Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), zinc oxide (ZnO), magnesium oxide 
(MgO), carbon dots (CDs), and carbon quantum dots (CQDs), are promising 
candidates for antiviral therapy. This review discusses the piezoelectric 
sensors used to detect various viruses, including COVID-19, and the various 
organic and inorganic nanoparticles involved in the antiviral therapy."
1329,"BACKGROUND: Many medications have different pharmacokinetics in children than in 
adults. Knowledge about the safety and efficacy of medications in children 
requires research into the pharmacokinetic profiles of children's medicines. By 
analysing registered clinical trial records, this study determined how 
frequently pharmacokinetic data is gathered in paediatric drug trials.
METHODS: We searched for the pharmacokinetic data from clinical trial records 
for preterm infants and children up to the age of 16 from January 2011 to April 
2022. The records of trials involving one or more drugs in preterm infants and 
children up to the age of 16 were examined for evidence that pharmacokinetic 
data would be collected.
RESULTS: In a total of 1483 records of interventional clinical trials, 136 
(9.17%) pharmacokinetic data involved adults. Of those 136 records, 60 (44.1%) 
records were pharmacokinetics trials involving one or more medicines in children 
up to the age of 16. 20 (33.3 %) in America, followed by 19 (31.6 %) in Europe. 
Most trials researched medicines in the field of infection or parasitic diseases 
20 (33.3%). 27 (48.2%) and 26 (46.4%) trials investigated medicines that were 
indicated as essential medicine.
CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetic characteristics of children's drugs need to be 
better understood. The current state of pharmacokinetic research appears to 
address the knowledge gap in this area adequately. Despite slow progress, 
paediatric clinical trials have experienced a renaissance as the significance of 
paediatric trials has gained international attention. The outcome of paediatric 
trials will have an impact on children's health in the future. In recent years, 
the need for greater availability and access to safe child-size pharmaceuticals 
has received a lot of attention."
1330,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects the world's aging population, is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disease requiring markers or tools to accurately 
and easily diagnose and monitor the process accurately and easily.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, serum Sirtuin-1(SIRT-1), High Mobility Group Box 1 
(HMGB1), Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR4), Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB), 
Interleukine-6 (IL-6), Amyloid βeta-42 (Aβ-42), and p-tau181 levels in patients 
diagnosed with AD according to NINCS-ADRA criteria were studied. We investigated 
the inflammatory pathways that lead to progressive neuronal loss and highlight 
their possible relationship with dementia severity in the systemic circulation.
METHODS: Patients over 60 years of age were grouped according to their Standard 
Mini Mental Test results, MRI, and/or Fludeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography or according to their CT findings as Control n:20; AD n:32; Vascular 
Dementia (VD) n:17; AD + VD; n=21. Complete blood count, Glucose, Vitamin B12, 
Folic Acid, Enzymes, Urea, Creatinine, Electrolytes, Bilirubin, and Thyroid 
Function tests were evaluated. ELISA was used for the analysis of serum SIRT1, 
HMGB1, TLR4, NF-kB, IL-6, Aβ-42, and p-tau181 levels.
RESULTS: Levels of serum Aβ-42, SIRT1, HMGB1, and IL-6 were significantly higher 
(p˂0.001, p<0.01, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively), and TLR4 levels were 
significantly lower (p˂0.001) in the dementia group than in the control group. 
No significant difference was observed between dementia and control groups for 
serum NF-kB and p-tau181 levels.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the levels of the Aβ42, SIRT 1, HMGB1, and 
TLR4 pathways are altered in AD and VD. SIRT 1 activity plays an important role 
in the inflammatory pathway of dementia development, particularly in AD."
1331,"BACKGROUND: In most patients with frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD), the 
degenerative process begins between the ages 45 and 65 years; onset younger than 
45 years is relatively rare and considered very early onset FTLD (VEO-FTLD).
OBJECTIVE: To delineate the clinical, genetic, and pathological features of 
VEO-FTLD.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out in PubMed and Embase 
from inception to September 2021. Patients diagnosed with definite FTLD with 
onset before age 45 years were included. Patients lacking detailed clinical data 
or both genetic and neuropathological data were excluded. Phenotypic, genotypic, 
and pathological data were extracted for further analyses.
RESULTS: Data from 110 patients with VEO-FTLD, reported in a cumulative 70 
publications, were included. Age of onset was 35.09 ± 7.04 (14-44) years. 
Sixty-seven patients were reported age at death of 42.12 ± 7.26 (24-58) years, 
with a disease course lasting 8.13 ± 4.69 (1-20) years. Behavioural variant 
frontotemporal dementia (104/110, 94.5%) was the most common clinical subtype, 
often manifesting as disinhibition (81.8%) and apathy (80.9%), and frequently 
accompanied by a cognitive deficit (90.9%) and parkinsonism (37.3%). Familial 
aggregate was high (familial vs sporadic, 73/37, 66.4%); most patients carried 
MAPT gene mutations (72.9% familial, 40% sporadic), followed by C9 (18.8% 
familial, 10.0% sporadic), TARDBP (2.1% familial), and VCP (2.1% familial). The 
most common neuropathology subtype was tau (43.5%), followed by 
ubiquitin-positive (24.6%), FUS (20.3%), and TDP 43 (2.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: VEO-FTLD may have unique clinical, genetic, and neuropathological 
markers and should be considered in young patients with psycho-behavioral 
symptoms."
1332,"BACKGROUND: p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is abnormally expressed in glioma, but 
its roles and mechanisms in glioma remain unclear. This study aims to explore 
the effects of PAK1 inhibition on the proliferation, migration and invasion of 
glioma cells.
METHODS: Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) 
incorporation and colony formation assays were performed to evaluate the effects 
of PAK1 inhibition on the proliferation of glioma cells. The cell cycle 
distribution and apoptosis rate of glioma cells were explored by flow cytometry. 
Wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to investigate the effects of 
PAK1 inhibition on glioma cell migration and invasion. The orthotopic xenograft 
glioma model was used to probe the effect of PAK1 silencing on glioma tumor 
formation.
RESULTS: PAK1 inhibition arrested cells at the G1 phase and induced apoptosis of 
glioma cells. Moreover, the knockdown of PAK1 decreased the protein expression 
levels of MDM2, p38, p-p38, cyclin D1, CDK4, Bcl-2, MMP2, MMP9, and cofilin but 
increased the protein levels of p53, Bax, p21 and cleaved caspase-3. A xenograft 
glioma model confirmed that the silencing of PAK1 repressed the formation of 
tumors induced by U87 cell transplantation.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that PAK1 inhibition impedes the proliferation, 
migration, and invasion of glioma cells."
1333,"We report the histopathological, immunohistochemical (IHC), and molecular 
findings in 3 patients with adult pancreatoblastoma, including 2 with autopsy 
features. The tumors were located in the tail and body of the pancreas, and the 
2 autopsy examinations revealed liver and lung metastases. Histopathologically 
the neoplasms were composed of solid epithelial elements with nested or 
trabecular growth patterns, fibrous stroma, and squamoid clusters. Keratin 19 
was positive mainly in squamoid corpuscles, and trypsin or chymotrypsin was 
positive in the acinar component. Neuroendocrine differentiation was observed in 
all tumors, and nuclear β-catenin expression in 2 tumors. Despite nuclear 
β-catenin expression, CTNNB1 mutation was found only in tumor 2. APC mutation 
was detected in tumor 1, and SMAD4 as well as MEN1 mutations in tumor 3. This 
last tumor also revealed chromosomal instability with many chromosomal losses 
and gains. The follow-up showed regional or distant metastases in all patients. 
Two patients died of disease after 3 and 26 months of follow-up and 1 patient is 
alive with no evidence of disease 6 years and 2 months after surgery. Adult 
pancreatoblastoma can display genetic heterogeneity, diverse histological 
appearance, and overlapping IHC findings. As a result, the differential 
diagnosis with other adult pancreatic tumors, such as acinar cell carcinoma, 
neuroendocrine neoplasm, solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, and mixed tumors may be 
challenging, especially when dealing with limited tumor tissue. The 
identification of squamoid corpuscles is essential for diagnosis. Although 
molecular findings might provide useful information, the integration of 
clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings is essential in 
pancreatoblastoma diagnosis."
1334,"Background: Methylated SEPT9 (mSEPT9) has a role in the occurrence and 
development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we studied the significance 
of plasma mSEPT9 for predicting prognosis-associated pathological parameters in 
patients with HCC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 205 subjects, 
including 111 HCC patients, 53 patients with at-risk liver disease (ARD) and 41 
healthy donors (HDs). Analysis of plasma mSEPT9 was performed using 
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Levels of mSEPT9 among different 
groups were compared using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test or a one-way 
ANOVA test. Correlations between pretreatment plasma mSEPT9 and 
clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed using the Chi-square. 
Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors related to 
microvascular invasion (MVI). Performance of variables for MVI prediction was 
evaluated by receiver operating characteristics curve. Results: A specific 
increase of plasma mSEPT9 in HCC was found when compared with ARD and HDs (HCC 
vs ARD, P  =  1.1  ×  10-5 and HCC vs HDs, P  =  3.7  ×  10-10). Pretreatment 
plasma mSEPT9 was significantly correlated tumor number (P  =  .004), tumor size 
(P  =  4.6  ×  10-5), MVI (P  =  .002) and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 
(P  =  .012). Levels of plasma mSEPT9 correlated significantly with Ki67 
expression in tumor (r  =  0.356, P  =  1.3  ×  10-4). Univariate and 
multivariate analyses showed that plasma mSEPT9 and serum protein induced by 
vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) were independent predictors for 
MVI. A combination of these 2 markers exhibited a larger areas under the curve 
(areas under the curve [AUC]  =  0.72) than mSEPT9 or PIVKA alone (AUC  =  0.67 
and 0.65), especially in early-stage HCC. Conclusions: Plasma mSEPT9 is a 
promising noninvasive biomarker for predicting MVI and tumor proliferation in 
HCC. Integration plasma mSEPT9 detection into clinical settings might facilitate 
the patient management."
1335,"OBJECTIVE: To establish a predictive model for poor prognosis after incomplete 
revascularization (ICR) in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease 
(MVD).
METHODS: Clinical data of 757 patients with MVD and ICR after percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) in the Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical 
University from January 2020 to August 2021 were retrospectively collected. The 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method was used to 
screen variables, and multivariate logistic regression was used to establish a 
predictive model. An independent cohort was used to validate the model. The 
C-statistic was used to verify and evaluate the discriminative ability of the 
model; the calibration curve was drawn, and the decision curve analysis (DCA) 
was performed to evaluate the calibration degree, the clinical net benefit, and 
the practicability of the model.
RESULTS: The predictive factors included female, age, unconjugated bilirubin, 
uric acid, low-density lipoprotein, hyperglycemia, total occlusion, and severe 
tortuosity lesion on coronary angiography. The C-statistic of the training and 
validation sets were 0.628 and 0.745, respectively. The statistical value of the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test for the calibration curve of the training and validation 
sets were 5.27(P = 0.873) and 6.27 (P = 0.792), respectively. DCA showed that 
the model was clinically applicable when the predicted probability value of 
major adverse cardiovascular events(MACEs) ranged from 0.07 to 0.68.
CONCLUSIONS: We established a predictive model for poor prognosis after ICR in 
patients with MVD. The predictive and calibration ability and the clinical net 
benefit of the predictive model were good, indicating that it can be used as an 
effective tool for the early prediction of poor prognosis after ICR in patients 
with MVD."
1336,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the characteristics of venous 
thromboembolic disease (VTE) in Korean to Caucasian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: XALIA-LEA and XALIA were phase IV non-interventional 
prospective studies with identical designs that investigated the effect of 
rivaroxaban versus standard anticoagulation for VTE. Koreans accounted for the 
largest proportion of the overall enrolled population of XALIA-LEA. However, in 
the XALIA study, most patients were Caucasian. Therefore, Korean data from 
XALIA-LEA and Caucasian data from XALIA were used in this study. This study 
compared the clinical characteristics and primary outcomes of the XALIA program, 
including major bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: The Korean population was older, was less obese, and had more active 
cancer at baseline than the Caucasian population. Provoked VTE was more common 
in the Korean population. Interestingly, Koreans showed less accompanying 
thrombophilia than Caucasians, and factor V Leiden mutations were not detected. 
Korean analyses comparing the effects of rivaroxaban and standard 
anticoagulation with primary outcomes showed a lower incidence of major 
bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all-cause mortality with rivaroxaban. Similar 
results were obtained in the propensity score matching analysis.
CONCLUSION: Characteristic differences were found between Korean and Caucasian 
VTE patients. Despite these ethnic differences, the effectiveness and safety of 
rivaroxaban therapy in these patients were consistent."
1337,"With multiple waves and variants, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic has affected routine vaccination programs globally. Its impact is also 
visible in Pakistan as routine health services continue to be disrupted. 
Consequently, thousands of children have emerged as vulnerable in the face of 
vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), which have already started causing 
outbreaks in the country. Infections with polio and measles have been 
significantly reported, especially during the last few years. This reemergence 
of both diseases is posing great challenges for the country at local, national, 
and global levels. These impacts are being multiplied by the 2022 flooding - 
called ""super floods"" - in the country. Hence, relevant stakeholders, such as 
the Pakistani government and the World Health Organization (WHO), need to 
revisit the entire vaccination program to address and resolve issues occurring 
at the management or local levels. It is highly important to pay attention to 
the context that provides a fertile ground to negatively affect vaccine uptake."
1338,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic wounds are a major drain on healthcare resources and can 
lead to substantial reductions in quality of life for those affected. Moreover, 
they often precede serious events such as limb amputations and premature death. 
In the long run, this burden is likely to escalate with an ageing population and 
lifestyle diseases such as obesity. Thus far, the identification of beneficial 
therapeutics against chronic wounds have been hindered by the lack of an ideal 
chronic wound animal model. Although animal models of delayed healing have been 
developed, none of these models fully recapitulate the complexity of the human 
chronic wound condition. Furthermore, most animals do not develop chronic 
wounds. Only the thoroughbred racehorse develops chronic ulcers.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, the different characteristics of chronic wounds 
that highlight its complexity are described. In addition, currently available 
models reflecting different aspects of chronic wound pathology and their 
relevance to human chronic wounds are discussed. This article concludes by 
listing relevant features representative of an ideal chronic wound model. 
Additionally, alternative approaches for the development of chronic wound models 
are discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: Delayed models of healing, including the streptozotocin diabetic 
model, skin flap model and magnet-induced IR models have emerged. While these 
models have been widely adopted for preclinical therapeutic testing, their 
relevance towards human chronic wounds remains debatable. In particular, current 
delayed healing models often fail to fully incorporate the key characteristics 
of chronic ulcers. Ultimately, more representative models are required to 
expedite the advancement of novel therapeutics to the clinic."
1339,"Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, with a 
5-year survival rate of about 10%. Early warning signs and symptoms of 
pancreatic cancer are vague or nonexistent, and most patients are diagnosed in 
Stage IV, when surgery is not an option for about 80%-85% of patients. For 
patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer, current conventional treatment 
modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) have suboptimal efficacy. 
Tumor progression is closely associated with the tumor microenvironment, which 
includes peripheral blood vessels, bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells, 
fibroblasts, immune cells, signaling molecules, and extracellular matrix. Tumor 
cells affect the microenvironment by releasing extracellular signaling 
molecules, inducing peripheral immune tolerance, and promoting tumor 
angiogenesis. In turn, the immune cells of the tumor affect the survival and 
proliferation of cancer cells. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are key cellular 
components in the tumor microenvironment and exert immunosuppressive functions 
by producing cytokines, recognizing other immune cells, and promoting tumor 
growth and metastasis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are the main regulator 
of the tumor immune response and a key target for tumor treatments. Since the 
combination of RT and immunotherapy is the main strategy for the treatment of 
pancreatic cancer, it is very important to understand the immune mechanisms 
which lead to MDSCs generation and the failure of current therapies in order to 
develop new target-based therapies. This review summarizes the research advances 
on the role of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the progression of pancreatic 
cancer and its treatment application in recent years."
1340,"Differences in gene-wide DNA methylation of the Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)-associated genes BIN1, HLA-DRB5, SORL1, SLC24A4, and ABCA7 are reported to 
be associated with AD in post-mortem brain samples. We investigated whether the 
same associations could be found in leukocytes collected pre-mortem. Using 
cohort data of 544 Swedish twins (204 dementia diagnoses), we replicated the 
findings in HLA-DRB5 and SLC24A4 at P < 0.05. However, co-twin control analyses 
indicated that the associations were partly explained by familial confounding. 
Thus, DNA methylation differences in HLA-DRB5 and SLC24A4 are present in both 
neuronal cells and leukocytes, and not fully explained familial factors."
1341,"Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common disease in the aging population and 
immunocompromised individuals, with a lifetime risk of 20%-30% that increases 
with age. HZ is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), 
which remains latent in the spinal dorsal root ganglia and cranial sensory 
ganglia after resolution of the primary VZV infection. The main focus of HZ 
management is rapid recovery from VZV infection as well as the reduction and 
prevention of zoster-associated pain (ZAP) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The 
use of antivirals against VZV is essential in the treatment of HZ. However, 
limited antivirals are only licensed clinically for the treatment of HZ, 
including acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, brivudine, and amenamevir. 
Fortunately, some new antivirals against different types of Herpesviridae have 
been investigated and suggested as novel drugs against VZV. Therefore, this 
review focuses on discussing the difference in efficacy and safety in the 
currently licensed antivirals for the treatment of HZ, the applicability of 
future novel antivirals against VZV, and the preventive or therapeutic effects 
of these antivirals on ZAP or PHN."
1342,"OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study examined how families share information and 
feelings about advanced pediatric cancer from the perspective of both parents 
and children, as well as how these perspectives vary by child developmental 
stage.
METHODS: Participants (24 mothers, 20 fathers, 23 youth [children and 
adolescents]) were from a larger longitudinal study at an academic pediatric 
hospital. Eligible youth had advanced cancer (physician-estimated prognosis of 
<60%, relapse, or refractory disease), were aged 5-19 years (>8 years old to 
participate independently), had an English-speaking parent, and lived within 140 
miles of the hospital. Interviews were completed at enrollment and asked how 
families share information and emotions about the child's cancer as a family.
RESULTS: Saturation was reached at 20 interviews for mothers, fathers, and 
youth. Analyses revealed 4 major themes: (A) parents managing cancer-related 
information based on child age/developmental stage and processing styles of 
family members; (B) parents withholding poor prognosis information and emotions 
to maintain positivity; (C) lack of personal and familial emotion sharing; and 
(D) emotion sharing among their family and externally. Both parents and youth 
endorsed themes A, C, and D, but only parents endorsed theme B. Adolescents 
endorsed more themes than children. Parents of children (as opposed to 
adolescents) endorsed theme A more.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Although both parents and youth with advanced cancer 
were generally willing to talk about treatment, emotions were not consistently 
shared. Perspectives varied depending on the child's developmental stage. 
Clinicians should assess parent and child information and emotion-sharing needs 
and provide individualized support to families regarding communication about 
advanced cancer."
1343,"BACKGROUND: Long-term symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection are a major 
concern, yet their prevalence is poorly understood.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study comparing adults with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID+) with adults who tested negative (COVID-), enrolled 
within 28 days of an FDA-approved SARS-CoV2 test result for active symptoms. 
Sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection (assessed 
with the CDC Person Under Investigation Symptom List), and symptoms of 
post-infectious syndromes (i.e., fatigue, sleep quality, muscle/joint pains, 
unrefreshing sleep, and dizziness/fainting, assessed with CDC Short Symptom 
Screener for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) were assessed 
at baseline and 3 months via electronic surveys sent via text or email.
RESULTS: Among the first 1,000 participants, 722 were COVID + and 278 were 
COVID-. Mean age was 41.5 (SD 15.2); 66.3% were female, 13.4% were Black, and 
15.3% were Hispanic. At baseline, SARS-CoV-2 symptoms were more common in the 
COVID + group than the COVID - group. At 3-months, SARS-CoV-2 symptoms declined 
in both groups although were more prevalent in the COVID + group: upper 
respiratory symptoms/head/eyes/ears/nose/throat (HEENT; 37.3% vs 20.9%), 
constitutional (28.8% vs 19.4%), musculoskeletal (19.5% vs 14.7%), pulmonary 
(17.6% vs 12.2%), cardiovascular (10.0% vs 7.2%), and gastrointestinal (8.7% vs 
8.3%); only 50.2% and 73.3% reported no symptoms at all. Symptoms of 
post-infectious syndromes were similarly prevalent among the COVID + and 
COVID - groups at 3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of COVID + participants, as compared with 
one-quarter of COVID - participants, had at least one SARS-CoV-2 symptom at 3 
months, highlighting the need for future work to distinguish Long COVID."
1344,"BACKGROUND: Manually segmenting cardiac structures is time-consuming and 
produces variability in MRI assessments. Automated segmentation could solve 
this. However, current software is developed for adults without congenital heart 
defects (CHD).
PURPOSE: To evaluate automated segmentation of left ventricle (LV) and right 
ventricle (RV) for pediatric MRI studies.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective comparative study.
POPULATION: Twenty children per group of: healthy children, LV-CHD, tetralogy of 
Fallot (ToF), and univentricular CHD, aged 11.7 [8.9-16.0], 14.2 [10.6-15.7], 
14.6 [11.6-16.4], and 12.2 [10.2-14.9] years, respectively.
SEQUENCE/FIELD STRENGTH: Balanced steady-state free precession at 1.5 T.
ASSESSMENT: Biventricular volumes and masses were calculated from a short-axis 
stack of images, which were segmented manually and using two fully automated 
software suites (Medis Suite 3.2, Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands and SuiteHeart 
5.0, Neosoft LLC, Pewaukee, USA). Fully automated segmentations were manually 
adjusted to provide two further sets of segmentations. Fully automated and 
adjusted automated segmentation were compared to manual segmentation. 
Segmentation times and reproducibility for each method were assessed.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Bland Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients 
(ICC) were used to compare volumes and masses between methods. Postprocessing 
times were compared by paired t-tests.
RESULTS: Fully automated methods provided good segmentation (ICC > 0.90 compared 
to manual segmentation) for the LV in the healthy and left-sided CHD groups (eg 
LV-EDV difference for healthy children 1.4 ± 11.5 mL, ICC: 0.97, for Medis and 
3.0 ± 12.2 mL, ICC: 0.96 for SuiteHeart). Both automated methods gave larger 
errors (ICC: 0.62-0.94) for the RV in these populations, and for all structures 
in the ToF and univentricular CHD groups. Adjusted automated segmentation agreed 
well with manual segmentation (ICC: 0.71-1.00), improved reproducibility and 
reduced segmentation time in all patient groups, compared to manual 
segmentation.
DATA CONCLUSION: Fully automated segmentation eliminates observer variability 
but may produce large errors compared to manual segmentation. Manual adjustments 
reduce these errors, improve reproducibility, and reduce postprocessing times 
compared to manual segmentation. Adjusted automated segmentation is reasonable 
in children with and without CHD.

TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2."
1345,"Cognitive Reserve (CR) is a theoretical construct that influences the onset and 
course of cognitive and structural changes that occur with aging and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). There is a paucity of research that examines the 
relationship of CR and brain volumes in amnestic (aMCI) and nonamnestic (naMCI) 
separately. This study is a retrospective chart review of MCI patients who 
underwent neuropsychological evaluation and brain MRI with NeuroReader™ (NR). NR 
is an FDA-cleared software that standardizes MRI volumes to a control sample. 
Classifications of aMCI and naMCI were based on Petersen criteria. CR was 
measured as education, occupation, and word reading. Data analysis included 
bivariate correlations between CR, neuropsychological test scores, and NR-brain 
volumes by MCI subtype. The Benjamini-Hochberg method corrected for multiple 
comparisons. The sample included 91 participants with aMCI and 41 with naMCI. 
Within naMCI, positive correlations were observed between CR and whole brain 
volume, total gray matter, bifrontal, left parietal, left occipital, and 
bilateral cerebellum. Within aMCI, no significant correlations were observed 
between CR and brain volumes. Positive correlations with CR were observed in 
language, attention, and visual learning in both aMCI and naMCI groups. The 
current study adds to the minimal literature on CR and naMCI. Results revealed 
that CR is associated with volumetrics in naMCI only, though cognitive findings 
were similar in both MCI groups. Possible explanations include heterogeneous 
disease pathologies, disease stage, or a differential influence of CR on 
volumetrics in MCI. Additional longitudinal and biomarker studies will better 
elucidate this relationship."
1346,"BACKGROUND: Many biomarkers show high diagnostic values for diabetic kidney 
disease (DKD), but fewer studies focus on the predictive assessment of DKD 
progression by blood and urinary biomarkers.
AIM: This study aims to find powerful risk predictors and identifying biomarkers 
in blood and urine for DKD progression.
METHODS: A total of 117 patients with type 2 DKD including early and advanced 
stages and their laboratory parameters were statistically assessed. A receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the 
significance of discriminating between early and advanced DKD, and the 
predictive power for advanced DKD was analyzed by regression analysis and 
trisector grouping.
RESULTS: N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase-creatine (NAG/CR) level in advanced DKD 
was statistically higher than that in early DKD (p < 0.05), and there was a 
higher incidence of advanced DKD (72% vs. 56%) and high odds ratio (OR: 3.917, 
95% CI: 1.579-10.011) of NAG/CR with ≥2.79 U/mmol compared with <2.79 U/mmol 
(p < 0.05). NAG/CR ratio also showed a higher area under the ROC curve of 0.727 
(95% CI: 0.616-0.828, p = 0.010) with a high sensitivity (0.75) and a moderate 
specificity (0.66) when 1.93 U/mmol was set as the optimal cutoff value. The 
adjusted-multivariable analysis revealed that NAG/CR had an OR of 1.021 (95% CI: 
1.024-1.038) and 2.223 (95% CI: 1.231-4.463) based on a continuous and 
categorical variable, respectively, for risk of advanced DKD. Moreover, the 
prevalence of advanced DKD exhibited an increasing tendency by an increment of 
the trisector of NAG/CR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that NAG/CR ratio is an independent predictor 
for advanced DKD, and it also can be used as a powerful identifying marker 
between early and advanced DKD."
1347,"BACKGROUND: Inconsistent observations of pupillary response and blink change in 
response to different specific tasks raise questions regarding the relationship 
between eye measures, task types and working memory (WM) models. On the one 
hand, studies have provided mixed evidence from eye measures about tasks: pupil 
size has mostly been reported to increase with increasing task demand while this 
expected change was not observed in some studies, and blink rate has exhibited 
different trends in different tasks. On the other hand, a WM model has been 
developed to integrate a component to reconcile recent findings that the human 
motor system plays an important role in cognition and learning. However, how 
different tasks correlate with WM components has not been experimentally 
examined using eye activity measurements.
AIMS: The current study uses a four-dimensional task load framework to bridge 
eye measures, task types and WM models.
SAMPLE: Twenty participants (10 males, 10 females; Age: M = 25.8, SD = 7.17) 
above 18 years old volunteered. All participants had normal or corrected to 
normal vision with contact lenses and had no eye diseases causing obvious 
excessive blinking.
METHODS: We examined the ability of pupil size and blink rate to index low and 
high levels of cognitive, perceptual, physical and communicative task load. A 
network of the four load types and WM components was built and analysed to 
verify the necessity of integrating a physical task-related component into the 
WM model.
RESULTS: Results demonstrate that pupil size can index cognitive load and 
communicative load but not perceptual or physical load. Blink rate can index the 
level of cognitive load but is best at discriminating perceptual tasks from 
other types of tasks. Furthermore, pupil size measurement of the four task types 
was explained better during structural and factor analysis by a WM model that 
integrates a movement-related component.
CONCLUSIONS: This research provides new insights into the relationship between 
eye measures, task type and WM models and provides a comprehensive understanding 
from which to predict pupil size and blink behaviours in more complex and 
practical tasks."
1348,"Pediatric oncology and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients are 
facing many gastrointestinal side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, 
vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea. International guidelines advise early enteral 
tube feeding as the first option of nutritional support in children undergoing 
myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. When using enteral 
feeding tubes for nutritional purposes as well as drug administration, some 
pharmaceutical, nursing, and technical issues have to be taken into account. 
Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone, widely used because of its broad spectrum 
antimicrobial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. However, its 
co-administration with polyvalent cations (as present in enteral feeding) makes 
the absorption of ciprofloxacin more difficult and may alter the pharmacokinetic 
parameters. Literature data are conflicting on how long the enteral feeding 
should be discontinued for patients receiving ciprofloxacin via an enteral 
feeding tube, ranging from 2 h before to 6 h after the administration of 
ciprofloxacin. Our research question was guided by challenges and concerns of 
nurses about the delay time between ciprofloxacin administration and restart of 
the enteral feeding without compromising the nutritional intake of the children. 
Our guideline was adapted, nurses were instructed accordingly, and patient 
leaflets with correct information were created."

DATA SUMMARY: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are orally administered highly 
selective RET inhibitors approved by the FDA following the accelerated approvals 
granted due to the pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials which evaluated 
selpercatinib and pralsetinib, respectively. Both drugs have shown efficacy for 
brain metastases and are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 through hepatic 
metabolism. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects of selpercatinib were 
hypertension, increased ALT level, and increased AST level while for 
pralsetinib, it was neutropenia, hypertension, and anemia. The safety profile 
shows similarities in severity and tolerability but additional monitoring for QT 
prolongation in patients on selpercatinib is recommended, compared to the risks 
of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis for patients on pralsetinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the increased use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib has led 
to the implementation of these drugs in the clinical practice of healthcare 
professionals such as pharmacists."
1350,"BACKGROUND: Cyclin E1 (CCNE1) is a potential predictive marker and therapeutic 
target in tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Smaller studies have 
revealed unfavorable associations for CCNE1 amplification and CCNE1 
overexpression with survival, but to date no large-scale, histotype-specific 
validation has been performed. The hypothesis was that high-level amplification 
of CCNE1 and CCNE1 overexpression, as well as a combination of the two, are 
linked to shorter overall survival in HGSC.
METHODS: Within the Ovarian Tumor Tissue Analysis consortium, amplification 
status and protein level in 3029 HGSC cases and mRNA expression in 2419 samples 
were investigated.
RESULTS: High-level amplification (>8 copies by chromogenic in situ 
hybridization) was found in 8.6% of HGSC and overexpression (>60% with at least 
5% demonstrating strong intensity by immunohistochemistry) was found in 22.4%. 
CCNE1 high-level amplification and overexpression both were linked to shorter 
overall survival in multivariate survival analysis adjusted for age and stage, 
with hazard stratification by study (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08-1.47, 
p = .034, and HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.32, p = .015, respectively). This was 
also true for cases with combined high-level amplification/overexpression 
(HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47, p = .033). CCNE1 mRNA expression was not 
associated with overall survival (HR, 1.00 per 1-SD increase; 95% CI, 0.94-1.06; 
p = .58). CCNE1 high-level amplification is mutually exclusive with the presence 
of germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants and shows an inverse association to RB1 
loss.
CONCLUSION: This study provides large-scale validation that CCNE1 high-level 
amplification is associated with shorter survival, supporting its utility as a 
prognostic biomarker in HGSC."
1351,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has had destructive influences on social and economic 
systems as well as many aspects of human life. In this study, we aimed to 
estimate the economic effects of COVID-19 at the individual and societal levels 
during a fiscal year. This cost of illness analysis was used to estimate the 
economic burden of COVID-19 in Iran. Data of the COVID-19 patients referred to 
the hospitals affiliated to Bushehr University of Medical Sciences in 2021 were 
collected through the Hospital Information System (HIS). The study methodology 
was based upon the human capital approach and bottom-up technique. The COVID-19 
pandemic has resulted in 9711 confirmed hospital cases and 717 deaths in Bushehr 
province during the study period. The direct and indirect costs were estimated 
to be $1446.06 and $3081.44 per patient. The economic burden for the province 
and country was estimated to be $43.97 and $2680.88 million. The results showed 
that the economic burden of this disease particularly premature death costs is 
remarkably high. Therefore, in order to increase the resiliency of the health 
system and the stability in service delivery, preventive-oriented strategies 
have to be more seriously considered by policymakers."
1352,"BACKGROUND: Congenital coagulation factor VII (FVII) deficiency is a rare, 
autosomal-recessive haemorrhagic disorder with an estimated incidence of 
1:500,000. This disorder is caused by mutations in the F7 gene.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we report a pedigree of congenital FVII deficiency. The 
proband was a 30-year-old female with severely low FVII activity and a history 
of menorrhagia and epistaxis since her childhood who was subsequently diagnosed 
with congenital compound heterozygous FVII deficiency. A genetic study revealed 
a novel combination of compound heterozygous mutations (c.64G 〉 A, p.Gly22Ser 
and c.1027G 〉 A, p.Gly343Ser). Her father and older son had the c.64G 〉 A, 
p.Gly22Ser (heterozygous) mutation. Her mother and younger son had the c.1027G 〉 
A, p.Gly343Ser (heterozygous) mutation. The predicted results of PolyPhen-2 and 
MutationTaster indicated that these mutations were probably damaging and 
disease-causing, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified a novel combination of genetic 
mutations that could expand the mutant library and help in elucidating the 
pathogenesis of hereditary human coagulation FVII deficiency. A novel 
combination of compound heterozygous mutations was reported for the first time 
in Chinese individuals."
1353,"BACKGROUND: Reports of cerebrovascular ischemia and stroke occurring as 
predominant neurological sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), are increasingly evident within the literature. While various 
pathophysiological mechanisms have been postulated, including 
hypercoagulability, endothelial invasion, and systemic inflammation, discrete 
mechanisms for viral neurotropism remain unclear and controversial.
OBSERVATIONS: The authors present a unique case study of a 64-year-old male with 
acute COVID-19 infection and acute worsening of previously stable cerebral 
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a rare heritable arteriopathy due to mutation in 
the Notch3 gene, which is critical for vascular development and tone. Delayed 
cranial neuropathies, brainstem fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal, and 
enhancement of olfactory and vagus nerves on magnetic resonance neurography in 
this patient further support viral neurotropism via cranial nerves in addition 
to cerebral vasculature.
LESSONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case in the literature 
that not only demonstrates the consequences of COVID-19 infection in a patient 
with altered cerebrovascular autoregulation such as CADASIL but also highlights 
the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for (1) cranial nerves as a mode of entry to the 
central nervous system and (2) vessels as a cause of cerebrovascular ischemia."
1354,"BACKGROUND: Some spinal hemangioblastomas (HBLs) resemble spinal vascular 
malformations. Intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) secondary to spinal 
HBL has rarely been reported.
OBSERVATIONS: A 67-year-old man with a prolonged von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) 
history presented with sudden headache and vomiting. Cranial and cervical 
computed tomography (CT) revealed severe infratentorial, supratentorial, and 
cervical SAH. Cranial CT angiography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 
mismatch in hemorrhage and intracranial tumor localization, with no vascular 
lesions that could lead to intracranial SAH. Cervical CT angiography revealed 
abnormal blood vessels originating from 5 spinal tumors suspected to be HBLs. We 
considered that the SAH was caused by venous reflex from vascular 
malformation-like spinal HBLs. Transarterial embolization (TAE) of the feeding 
artery of HBLs was performed to improve symptoms and reduce rebleeding risk. 
Nine months after TAE, angiography showed no venous reflux into the intracranial 
space. Ten months later, the authors excised the T1-2 tumor because the patient 
complained of progressive paralysis of the right upper extremity.
LESSONS: In HBL with prolonged VHL, intracranial hemorrhage due to venous 
regurgitation via a mimicked vascular malformation may occur. Reducing venous 
reflux with TAE may improve symptoms and prevent rebleeding."
1355,"Members of the Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs) species complex have recently been 
reported to cause bacterial wilt on southern highbush (SHB) blueberries in 
Florida (Norman et al. 2018), a disease first reported on blueberry (northern 
highbush; Vaccinium corymbosum) in New Jersey (Patel et al. 2013). SHB 
blueberries are widely grown in the southern United States, and SHB cultivars 
represent the majority of the blueberry acreage in Georgia - the U.S. state with 
the largest blueberry acreage (NASS 2022). In Fall 2020, three-year old SHB 
plants (cv. 'Indigocrisp') showing leaf bronzing, wilting, and dieback were 
collected from two field sites in Clinch County, GA. At these locations, 
numerous plants were rapidly dying, with symptoms appearing to have spread down 
rows. Plant material tested positive using the ImmunoStrip® for Rs (Agdia, Inc., 
Elkhart, IN). From one location, the remaining sample was submitted to 
USDA-APHIS Select Agent Services who determined that Rs was present but a select 
agent (Rs Race 3, Biovar 2) was not. Following this, six adjacent, symptomatic 
SHB plants were collected from the same field location. These plants tested 
positive using the ImmunoStrip® for Rs, and red-pigmented mucoid colonies 
typical of Rs formed within 48 h at 28°C on triphenyltetrazolium chloroide (TZC) 
isolation medium (Kelman 1954). DNA was extracted from pure Rs cultures using 
the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Doyle and Doyle 1987) and 
tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers pairs AMB013/AMB014 (Fegan 
and Prior 2005) and ENDO-F/ENDO-R (Ji et al. 2007) were used to amplify 558 nt 
and 843 nt portions of the 16S rRNA region and Rs endoglucanase gene, 
respectively. Resulting amplicons were purified using an E.Z.N.A.® Cycle Pure 
Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA), Sanger sequenced in both directions (Eurofins 
Genomics, Louisville, KY), and compared to publicly available Rs sequences in 
Genbank. The 16 rRNA sequence from all obtained isolates (accession ON938207) 
had 100% identity to Rs strain CFBP2957 (FP885897), while the endoglucase 
sequence (ON938206) had 100% identity to phylotype IIa, sequevar 5 Rs strain 
CIP-426 (MF461810) and phylotype IIa, sequevar 39 Rs strain 19-058 (MT314067), 
among others. To fulfill Koch's postulates, an isolate ('Ral21-1') was grown on 
TZC medium for 48 h at 28°C and suspended in 8.5 g/L NaCl at 1 x 108 CFU/ml. 
Five young, tissue cultured SHB plants (cv. 'Kestrel') in 25 cm pots were 
drenched with 50 ml of Rs suspension. For six weeks, plants were maintained in 
the greenhouse at 21-32°C. Typical bacterial wilt symptoms (leaf 
bronzing/scorching) developed in all inoculated plants, and infections were 
confirmed using Immunostrip®. Rs was reisolated and confirmed via PCR and 
sequencing as previously described. While Ralstonia has been known to cause 
disease on numerous crops in Georgia, this represents a first report of 
bacterial wilt in Georgia blueberries. Relative to rabbiteye blueberries (V. 
virgatum), recent reports suggest that SHB are much more susceptible to 
bacterial wilt (Conner et al. 2022). Accordingly, given the transition from 
rabbiteye to SHB within Georgia's blueberry production region over the past two 
decades and the ability of Rs to spread easily in water, soil, or via infected 
plant material, the presence of this disease within the state represents a 
significant threat to blueberry production. Additional characterization of 
Ralstonia isolates from Georgia may help assess the risk of future outbreaks."
1356,"Tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) are an important cash crop and are cultivated 
worldwide for their commercial value (Palanisamy et al. 2014). Tea gray blight 
is an important tea plant disease as it can cause a decline in tea quality and 
reduce yields by 20-30% (Sanjay et al. 2008). In August 2018, a disease survey 
was conducted on 400 ha of organic tea plantations in the Pu'er area of Yunnan 
Province (22.48° N, 100.58° E). The survey found that widespread disease was 
causing damage to 40% of the tea plantations and that the most seriously 
affected tea variety was Yunkang No. 10, which had an average disease incidence 
of 30-35%. The affected leaves grew small yellow-green spots on their tips or 
margins in the early stage that expanded into round or irregular brown spots 
with distinct concentric whorls and black conidial disks arranged in whorls when 
the humidity was high (Fig. 1A-B), which is consistent with tea gray blight 
disease (Zheng et al. 2021). Twenty-four diseased leaf samples were collected 
from four different tea plantations and transported to the Pu-Erh Tea Research 
Laboratory. Leaves with disease spots were cut into 4 mm ×4 mm square pieces, 
surface-sterilized with 75% alcohol for 1 min, disinfected with 1% sodium 
hypochlorite for 3 min, and washed thrice with sterile water. The tissue pieces 
were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates containing 100 µg ml-1 of 
chloramphenicol (Wang et al. 2021). After 3 d of culturing in the dark at 28 C, 
twenty pure cultures with similar morphology were obtained, and two 
representative isolates were selected and transferred into new PDA media. After 
7 d, circular fungal colonies with dense aerial mycelium produced black, wet 
spore masses that grew on the PDA media (Fig. 1C-D). The conidia were 
spindle-shaped with four septa, measuring 25.0 (21.0-26.0) × 6.0 (4.5-7.0) µm 
(n=15). The conidia had three median cells, two of which were dark brown in 
color with unclear separations, with a single basal hyaline appendage 3.8 
(3.5-4.5) µm (n=30) in length and 2-3 apical hyaline appendages 31 (27-35) µm in 
length (n=30) (Fig. 1E), similar to the conidial characteristics of 
Neopestalotiopsis piceana (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2014). Two isolates were 
selected for DNA extraction. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, 
partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-α) gene, and partial 
β-tubulin (tub2) gene were amplified using the ITS1F-ITS4 primer set (White et 
al 1990), the EF-1α-F and EF-1α-R primer sets (Li et al. 2018), and the tub1 and 
tub2 primers, respectively (Chauhan et al. 2007). The ITS (OP535632 to 
OP535632), tef1-α (OP589285,OP589287), and tub2 (OP589286,OP589288) sequences 
were submitted to NCBI GenBank. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis 
demonstrated that these sequences were 100% similar to those of N. piceana 
isolates available in GenBank. The sequences were compared using the Mafft 
software package, and sequences with the same ID were concatenated using 
scripts. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MEGA 
(ver. 5.1) software package based on the concatenated sequences (ITS, tef1-α, 
and tub2). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that C-5 and B-3 showed 95% bootstrap 
support with N. piceana isolates in references (Fig. 2). According to the 
morphology and molecular characterization, C-5 and B-3 were identified as N. 
piceana. Pathogenicity tests on these two isolates were conducted using 36 
healthy tea plants. The leaves were scratched slightly with sterile toothpick 
tips, after which pathogen cakes (6 mm diameter) were placed on the wounds with 
the mycelial side facing down and covered with sterile absorbent cotton to 
maintain a moist environment. Control leaves were wounded and covered with 
sterile PDA plugs (three replicates per treatment, three plants per replicate). 
Seven days later, the inoculated leaves exhibited similar symptoms observed 
under natural conditions, whereas the control leaves exhibited no symptoms. The 
same isolates as the introduced strains were isolated from the diseased tea 
leaves, completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report 
of N. piceana causing gray blight on tea leaves in China. These results provide 
valuable information for the prevention and management of gray blight on tea 
leaves. References: Chauhan, J. B., et al. 2007. Indian J Biotechnol. 6: 404-406

1357,"Papaya sticky disease (PSD) is a major virus disorder of papaya (Carica papaya). 
The disease is characterized by fruit damage caused by the oxidation of 
spontaneously exuded latex. In Brazil, PSD is caused by the co-infection of two 
viruses, papaya meleira virus (PMeV), a toti-like virus, and papaya meleira 
virus-2 (PMeV-2), an umbra-like virus. The disorder has also been reported in 
Mexico and more recently in Australia, but the presence of both PMeV and PMeV-2 
in symptomatic plants has been documented only in Brazil. In 2021, two-year-old 
papaya plants (cv. Passion Red) exhibiting PSD-like symptoms were observed in 
Santa Elena province, Ecuador. Molecular tests of leaf tissue and fruit latex 
from symptomatic plants failed to detect PMeV. However, papaya virus Q (PpVQ), 
an umbra-like virus related to but distinct from PMeV-2, and a novel virus, 
tentatively named papaya sticky fruit-associated virus (PSFaV), were found in 
the symptomatic samples. PSFaV shares 56% nucleotide identity with the genome of 
PMeV, suggesting that PSD symptoms can be caused by 'couples' of viruses related 
to but distinct from PMeV (a toti-like virus) and PMeV-2 (an umbra-like virus). 
This review discusses the history and epidemiology of PSD and the genomic 
features of newly discovered virus 'couples' involved in this syndrome. Given 
the unusual etiology of PSD which involves distinct virus species, the 
importance of implementing proper diagnostic approaches for PSD is highlighted."
1358,"Accumulation of neurotoxic protein aggregates is the pathological hallmark of 
neurodegenerative disease. Proper clearance of these waste metabolites is an 
essential process for maintaining brain microenvironment homeostasis and may 
delay or even halt the onset and progression of neurodegeneration. Vascular 
endothelial cells regulate the molecular exchange between the circulation and 
brain parenchyma, thereby protecting the brain against the entry of xenobiotics 
and decreasing the accumulation of neurotoxic proteins. In this review, we 
provide an overview of cerebrovascular endothelial cell characteristics and 
their impact on waste metabolite clearance. Lastly, we speculate that molecular 
changes in cerebrovascular endothelial cells are the drivers of 
neurodegenerative diseases."
1359,"BACKGROUND: Injuries are a leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits 
among older adults, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias (ADRD) may be at particular risk. We compared injury-related ED use 
among assisted living (AL) residents with and without ADRD and assessed 
differences in the risk of injury-related ED visits among individuals with ADRD 
residing in ALs with memory care designation versus general AL.
METHODS: Using Medicare claims, we identified a cohort of fee-for-service 
beneficiaries who lived in AL in 2018 and resided in one of 20 states with 
site-specific information on memory care designation (n = 116,754). Outcomes 
included all injury-related ED visits and injury-related ED visits resulting in 
hospitalization in the calendar year 2018. We fit multilevel models of the 
association between ADRD and outcomes, adjusting for resident demographic 
characteristics and chronic conditions, license type characteristics, and AL 
characteristics, with random intercepts at the AL and license type levels. Among 
residents with ADRD, we examined whether memory care licensure was associated 
with injury-related ED visits.
RESULTS: The adjusted risk of injury-related ED use during the year was 20.1% 
(95% CI: 19.6%, 20.6%) for residents with ADRD compared to 16.1% for residents 
without ADRD (95% CI: 15.7%, 16.5%; p < 0.001). The adjusted risk of 
injury-related ED use ending in hospitalization was 4.9% (95% CI: 4.6%, 5.1%) 
for AL residents with ADRD and 3.9% for residents without ADRD (95% CI: 3.8%, 
4.1%; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in injury-related ED 
visits between residents with ADRD in ALs with memory care designation and 
residents in general AL.
CONCLUSIONS: Injury-related ED visits are common among AL residents with ADRD 
and residents in memory care, but residents in memory care AL experienced 
similar risks of injury as those in general AL. Further research should identify 
modifiable factors that can prevent injury among AL residents with ADRD."
1360,"Adrenal cortical cancer has a relatively low incidence, but a dismal 5-year 
survival rate. Surgical intervention is the gold standard of care today. In 
spite of this progress, patients continue to have a dismal outlook. The results 
of this study demonstrate that kinin superfamily (KIF) has strong ties to many 
different types of cancers. However, their prognostic and immune cell 
infiltration of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) remain unclear. Multiple 
databases were searched for information on the transcription level of KIFs, its 
correlation with clinical data of ACC patients, patients' overall survival (OS), 
first progression survival (FPS), and progression free interval (PFI). Its role 
and association with immune cells were also investigated. We observed an 
increase in the expression of KIF4A, KIF11, KIF20A, and KIF22. There was a 
strong correlation between them and the advancedness of ACC tumors. Parallel to 
this, KIFs are connected to the concepts of operating systems, distributed file 
systems, and partitioned file systems. Similarly, we found five key genes, PRC1, 
PLK1, KIF23, KIFC1, and KIF5A, through data analysis, all of which participate 
in multiple cellular pathways. Both KIF4A and KIF11 expression levels were 
marginally positively correlated with immune infiltration. Because KIF4A, KIF11, 
KIF20A, and KIF22 are involved in multiple ACC processes and can influence the 
onset and progression of ACC, they provide a mechanistically grounded framework 
for diagnosing and managing the disease."
1361,"BACKGROUND: Despite considerable recent reductions in antimicrobial use, the UK 
gamebird industry continues to struggle with production diseases during the 
rearing season, necessitating significant antibiotic use. This observational 
study investigated the presence of genes conferring resistance to β-lactam 
antibiotics within industry-reared pheasants and red-legged partridges in the 
UK.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from 60 pooled caecal samples collected from 
gamebirds at routine postmortem examinations during the rearing season. Genes 
encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) were detected by PCR and the 
corresponding alleles were determined.
RESULTS: Over half (53%) of the samples harboured genes encoding blaTEM 
resistance, with blaSHV identified in 20% of samples. The blaTEM gene was more 
common on sites with higher antibiotic use, whereas blaSHV was predominantly 
found in birds younger than 5 weeks. Genotyping of the identified resistance 
genes revealed the presence of blaTEM-1 , blaSHV-1 and blaSHV-11 alleles.
LIMITATIONS: This was a small-scale study conducted at four sites in southern 
England.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of the presence of ESBL genes in gamebirds, 
highlighting the need for further research into antimicrobial resistance in UK 
gamebirds."
1362,"It has great significance in profiling specific proteins throughout for better 
understanding of complex pathological processes and in-depth pharmacological 
studies. In this work, an efficient protein profiling strategy was developed 
based on the specific protein-drug interaction. Sofosbuvir (SOF), as a 
first-line drug for the treatment of hepatitis C, was modified onto the surface 
of nanoparticles through stable chemical bonds to fabricate a novel magnetic 
separation material denoted as Fe3O4@SiO2@PAA@SOF. With sequence coverage as the 
screening parameter, nine proteins were profiled from fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
of which eight were liver related. Similarly, the strategy was applied to 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient serum. Eight proteins were profiled and 
all of them were liver related, demonstrating the superb specificity and 
selectivity of this strategy for profiling liver-related proteins by virtue of 
protein-SOF interaction. When serum proteins from HCC patients were compared to 
those from healthy people, one unique differential protein (D3DQX7) was 
profiled, which was liver related and was a potential target for ameliorating 
liver diseases. For further research, this material design concept and protein 
profiling strategy can be extended to employ other drugs for corresponding 
studies. Sofosbuvir, as a therapeutic drug for liver diseases, was modified onto 
the surface of magnetic nanoparticles to fabricate the specific selective 
separation material (Fe3O4@SiO2@PAA@SOF). Based on protein-SOF interaction, the 
material was applied to adsorb specific proteins from different serum samples. 
After MS analysis, specific proteins, most of which were liver related, were 
successfully profiled from FBS and HCC patient serum, fully demonstrating the 
superb specificity and selectivity of this protein profiling strategy."
1363,"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a frequent event in patients 
undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and is 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to eventual progress to 
end-organ disease. Letermovir prophylaxis for CMV infections has become a 
standard of care in adult HCT recipients due to its efficacy and high 
tolerability. However, it is not yet approved for paediatric patients.
OBJECTIVE: In a retrospective single-centre observational study we evaluated the 
use of letermovir for prophylaxis or pre-emptive treatment of cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) infection in seropositive paediatric HCT recipients receiving the compound 
outside of clinical trials. The primary endpoint was CMV reactivation requiring 
a change of medication.
METHODS: A total of 17 patients (seven female/ten male; median age 12.2 
[range 3.5-19] years, median body weight 39.5 [range 15-63] kg; median follow-up 
time 463.7 [range 41-1022] days) were identified who were started on oral (14) 
or intravenous (3) followed by oral (2) letermovir shortly after neutrophil 
engraftment at doses determined on the basis of age, weight, and concomitant 
cyclosporine use.
RESULTS: Five patients had no evidence of viral replication (prophylactic use), 
while 12 patients had varying extents of viral replication (pre-emptive 
therapy). A change of therapy was required in one patient due to a sustained 
increase in CMV viral load, and in two patients, letermovir was stopped without 
later reactivation after initiation of palliative care for recurrent leukaemia. 
Of the 14 patients who completed treatment, 3 had evidence of transient viral 
replication after end of treatment that required no further antiviral treatment. 
No patients (of 17) discontinued letermovir due to an adverse event.
CONCLUSION: Letermovir was effective in controlling CMV infection in 
seropositive paediatric allogeneic HCT recipients and was overall well 
tolerated. Pending completion of the still ongoing paediatric investigation 
plans, letermovir will be an important adjunct to our options for control of 
infectious complications in this special population."
1364,"Metalloproteinases cleave transmembrane proteins that play critical roles in 
inflammation and cancers. Metalloproteinases include a disintegrin and 
metalloprotease (ADAM), which we previously examined using a fluorescence assay 
system, and described their association with resistance to systemic therapy in 
cancer patients. There are also many reports on the relation between ADAM 
expression and the prognosis of patients with gastroenterological chronic 
inflammatory diseases and cancers. Inhibiting their immunomodulating activity in 
chronic inflammation restores innate immunity and potentially prevents the 
development of various cancers. Among the numerous critical immune 
system-related molecules, we focus on major histocompatibility complex class I 
polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), MICB, intracellular adhesion molecule 
(ICAM)-1, TNF-α, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and Notch. This review summarizes our 
current understanding of the role of ADAMs in gastroenterological diseases with 
regard to the immune system. Several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 
inhibitors of ADAMs have been identified, and potential therapies for targeting 
ADAMs in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and cancers are 
discussed. Some ongoing clinical trials for cancers targeting ADAMs are also 
introduced."
1365,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the survival impacts of pretreatment cancerous 
stenosis on patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC).
METHODS: The clinicopathologic characteristics of patients who underwent surgery 
for EC between January 2010 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. 
Esophageal stenosis was defined as present when a thin endoscope could not be 
passed through the tumor site. The impacts of stenosis on overall survival (OS) 
and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were evaluated using Cox hazards analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 496 EC patients in this study, 51 (10.3 %) had pretreatment 
esophageal stenosis. Stenosis was associated with lower body mass index (P < 
0.001) and higher pStage (P < 0.001). The 3-year OS rate for the patients with 
stenosis was significantly poorer than for the patients without stenosis (40.2 % 
vs 69.6 %; hazard ratio [HR], 2.19; P < 0.001). The survival outcomes, 
especially CSS, for the patients with stenosis were significantly poorer than 
for the patients without stenosis for both pStage II-III (P = 0.009) and pStage 
IV (P = 0.006) disease. The OS and CSS curves were well stratified by the 
presence of stenosis even in early-stage (pStage II) patients (P = 0.04 and P < 
0.01, respectively). Multivariable analysis showed esophageal stenosis, pStage 
III-IV disease, and non-curative resection to be independently associated with 
poor OS (HR, 1.61; P = 0.02) and poor CSS (HR,1.67; P = 0.02). Higher pStage was 
an independent predictor of poor CSS for patients without stenosis, but not for 
those with stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal carcinoma patients with pretreatment stenosis had 
significantly poorer survival outcomes, especially poorer CSS, than those 
without stenosis in both early- and advanced-stage diseases."
1366,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer surgery outcomes benefit from higher hospital 
volumes. Despite the evidence, organization of national health care often is 
complex and depends on various factors. The volume-outcome results of this 
population-based study supported national health policy measures regarding 
concentration of esophageal resections in Belgium.
METHODS: The Belgian Cancer Registry (BCR) database was linked to administrative 
data on cancer treatment. All Belgian patients with newly diagnosed esophageal 
cancer in 2008-2018 undergoing resection were allocated to the hospital at which 
surgery was performed. The study assessed hospital volume association with 
90-day mortality and 5-year overall survival, classifying average annual 
hospital volume of resections as low (LV, <6), medium (MV, 6-19), or high (HV, 
≥20) and as a continuous covariate in the regression models.
RESULTS: The study included 4156 patients who had surgery in 79 hospitals (2 HV 
hospitals [37% of all surgeries], 12 MV hospitals [30% of all surgeries], and 65 
LV hospitals [33% of all surgeries]). Adjusted 90-day mortality in HV hospitals 
was lower than in LV hospitals (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21-0.65; p = 
0.001). Case-mix adjusted 5-year survival was superior in HV versus LV (hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31-0.60; p < 0.001). The continuous model 
demonstrated a lower 90-day mortality (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23-0.71; p = 0.002) 
and a superior 5-year survival (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.63; p < 0.001) in 
hospitals with volumes of 40 or more resections annually.
CONCLUSION: Population-based data from the BCR confirmed a strong volume-outcome 
association for esophageal resections. Improved 5-year survival in centers with 
annual volumes of 20 or more resections was driven mainly by the achievement of 
superior 90-day mortality. These findings supported centralization of esophageal 
resections in Belgium."
1367,"This article focuses on the role of radiotherapy in the management of 
meningioma, in the definitive and adjuvant setting and across the spectrum of 
meningioma grade. Treatment paradigms, informed by clinical evidence, are 
discussed. Notably, we focus on the impact of radiotherapy on normal brain 
tissues and neurocognitive function, particularly the dose-dependent changes in 
white matter and cerebral cortex thickness. Novel imaging techniques have 
allowed the identification of microstructural changes to eloquent white matter, 
cortex, and subcortical regions as biomarkers for understanding RT-induced 
changes in cognitive functioning. Deficits in multiple domains including 
attention, memory, language and executive function can become more pronounced 
following radiation. Longitudinal assessment with imaging and neurocognitive 
testing pre- and post-radiation have allowed correlation between dose to 
specific regions of the brain and decline in associated domains of 
neurocognitive function. These findings suggest incorporation of areas at higher 
risk for neurocognitive sequelae into precision radiation planning. Volumetric 
arc therapy, advanced planning with cortical sparing, proton therapy and 
stereotactic radiosurgery are reviewed as options for delivering therapeutic 
dose to target volumes while minimizing risk to adjacent sensitive regions. The 
treatment of meningioma is an evolving area, with improving outcomes for higher 
grade disease in modern trials, where care must be taken to maximize both 
disease control as well as quality of life for patients."
1368,"PURPOSE: To empirically assign severity levels (e.g., mild, moderate) to four 
relatively new patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for adults with 
acquired cognitive/language disorders. They include the Communicative 
Participation Item Bank, the Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure, and 
Neuro-QoL's item banks of Cognitive Function (v2.0) and Ability to Participate 
in Social Roles and Activities (v1.0).
METHOD: We conducted 17 focus groups that comprised 22 adults with an acquired 
cognitive/language disorder from stroke, Parkinson's disease, or traumatic brain 
injury; 30 care partners of an adult with an acquired cognitive/language 
disorder; and 42 speech-language pathologists who had experience 
assessing/treating individuals with those and other cognitive/language 
disorders. In a small, moderated focus-group format, participants completed 
""PROM-bookmarking"" procedures: They discussed hypothetical vignettes based on 
PROM item responses about people with cognitive/language disorders and had to 
reach consensus regarding whether their symptoms/function should be categorized 
as within normal limits or mild, moderate, or severe challenges.
RESULTS: There was generally good agreement among the stakeholder groups about 
how to classify vignettes, particularly when they reflected very high or low 
functioning. People with aphasia described a larger range of functional 
communication challenges as ""mild"" compared to other stakeholder types. Based on 
a consensus across groups, we present severity levels for specific score ranges 
for each PROM.
CONCLUSION: Standardized, stakeholder-informed severity levels that aid 
interpretation of PROM scores can help clinicians and researchers derive better 
clinical meaning from those scores, for example, by identifying important 
clinical windows of opportunity and assessing when symptoms have returned to a 
""normal"" range."
1369,"PURPOSE: Little is known about the impact of co-morbidities on health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) for people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We 
aimed to investigate the relative contribution of co-morbidities to HRQoL of 
people with IPF.
METHODS: N = 157 participants were recruited from the Australian IPF Registry 
(AIPFR). Health state utilities (HSUs), and the super-dimensions of physical and 
psychosocial scores were measured using the Assessment of Quality of 
Life-8-Dimensions (AQoL-8D). The impact of co-morbidities on HRQoL was 
investigated using linear regression and general dominance analyses.
RESULTS: A higher number of co-morbidities was associated with lower HSUs (p 
trend = 0.002). Co-morbidities explained 9.1% of the variance of HSUs, 16.0% of 
physical super-dimensional scores, and 4.2% of psychosocial super-dimensional 
scores. Arthritis was associated with a significant reduction on HSUs 
(β =  - 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.16 to - 0.02), largely driven by 
reduced scores on the physical super-dimension (β =  - 0.13, 95% CI - 0.20 
to - 0.06). Heart diseases were associated with a significant reduction on HSUs 
(β =  - 0.09, 95% CI - 0.16 to - 0.02), driven by reduced scores on physical 
(β =  - 0.09, 95% CI - 0.16 to - 0.02) and psychosocial (β = -0.10, 95% 
CI - 0.17 to - 0.02) super-dimensions.
CONCLUSIONS: Co-morbidities significantly impact HRQoL of people with IPF, with 
markedly negative impacts on their HSUs and physical health. A more holistic 
approach to the care of people with IPF is important as better management of 
these co-morbidities could lead to improved HRQoL in people with IPF."
1370,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that 
even at very low levels can cause cancer by increasing the activity of tumor 
cells and suppressing the immune system. There is also little information on 
OCPs and survival after diagnosis. The aim of this study was to monitor the 
concentration of OCPs in the blood serum of cancer patients and its relationship 
with their socio-demographic characteristics and ultimately that impact on 
survival time and hazard ratio (HR). This cross-sectional study included 89 
diagnosed patients with cancer in Isfahan, Iran. 12 types of OCPs were measured 
in serum by gas chromatography (7GC) with an electron capture detector and 
equipped with mass spectrometer (MS). Also, participants' questionnaire was 
completed to collect information. T-test, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests were used 
to evaluate the association between serum levels of OCPs and quantitative and 
qualitative information of patients. Survival analysis was also examined based 
on Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox model. The mean of total OCPs in 
patients' serum was calculated to be 1.82 ± 1.36 μg/L. Concentration of 2,4' DDE 
had a significant relationship with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (P < 0.05). In 
addition, gender revealed a significant correlation in estimating survival time 
(P < 0.05). Non-exposure to OCPs showed a positive effect on increasing the life 
expectancy of patients. Lindane and endosulfan increased the risk of death by 
16% and 37%, respectively, with insignificant P value (P > 0.05). The findings 
of the present study showed adverse effects of OCPs on patients' survival time 
and increased mortality of HR. Moreover, as the first research conducted in the 
study area, it is suggested management of environmental, individual and social 
factors that could be influenced the biological accumulation of OCPs in humans 
and cause health promotion."
1371,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the major diseases that endangers human health. It 
is widely reported that enriched environment (EE) can improve the neurological 
function in different brain injury models. Recently, relevant researches have 
indicated that MAPK pathway is closely related to the inflammatory response in 
nervous system related diseases. However, whether pre exposure to EE (EE 
pretreatment) has a preventive effect, and its mechanism are not clear. 
Therefore, this study aimed to determine the possible benefits and related 
mechanisms of EE in preventing brain injury after acute ischemia-reperfusion.
METHODS: Adult Sprague Dawley rats were kept in enriched or standardized 
environments for 21 days. Then the middle cerebral artery of rats was occluded 
for one hour and 30 min, and then reperfusion was performed. Then their 
neurological deficit score was evaluated. Cerebral edema, along with ELISA and 
protein quantities of p38MAPK, JNK, ERK, IL-1β, TNF-α, and co-localization of 
Iba1 were assessed. Changes in neuroinflammation and apoptosis were also 
detected in the penumbra cortex.
RESULTS: Our research showed that EE pretreatment significantly alleviated acute 
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. Including the reduction of brain 
edema and apoptosis, and the improvement of neurological scores. In addition, 
the protein level of p38MAPK was significantly down regulated in EE pretreatment 
group, and the downstream protein STAT1 had the same trend. In addition, 
immunofluorescence results showed that Iba1 in EE pretreatment group decreased, 
the ELISA results showed that the classical proinflammatory cytokines increased 
significantly, while anti-inflammatory cytokines in EE pretreatment group 
increased, and the same results were obtained by Western blot analysis.
CONCLUSION: On the whole, our research demonstrated that EE pretreatment can 
have a protective effect on the organism by inhibiting the p38 MAPK/STAT1 
pathway. Thus, EE can be one of the most promising means of disease prevention. 
Secondly, p38MAPK/STAT1 pathway may be a latent target for the prevention of 
acute ischemic stroke."
1372,"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a 
potentially curative therapy for malignant hematologic disorders. Novel 
anti-infection agents have successfully decreased the risk of fatal infections 
post-HSCT in recent years, but the relapse of primary disease and 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remain the major causes of death for transplant 
recipients, and significantly deteriorate the quality of life. Thus, it is 
crucial to maintain the immune homeostasis in transplant recipients and balance 
the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and GVHD.
METHODS: We reviewed the recently published literatures on immune checkpoint 
(IC) and targeted agents in relapse and GVHD after allogeneic HSCT RESULTS: 
Emerging data suggest that IC is an attractive target to modulate immune 
responses, and accumulating evidences of IC-targeted agents have been published 
for the treatment of malignancies and autoimmune disorders. The unique mechanism 
of IC-targeted agents, which affects the immune homeostasis of the transplant 
recipient by modulating alloreactivity, minimizes the risk of organ toxicity and 
immunosuppression associated with conventional therapy CONCLUSION: There is an 
increase in literature reporting the application of immune checkpoint-targeted 
agents in HSCT settings, and an overview will benefit further exploration in 
this field."
1373,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is often most recognized for motor symptoms but 
associated non-motor symptoms such as sexual dysfunction can significantly 
impact quality of life. This condition involves a hormonal disruption and has a 
predilection for male patients, yet there are no formal guidelines for screening 
or management of sexual health pathology in these patients. While prior 
publications have addressed the presence of sexual dysfunction (SD) among men 
with PD, there has been a paucity of work examining the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and the interplay between dopamine, 
prolactin (PRL), and testosterone. This review provides an overview of data 
extracted from the existing peer-reviewed literature regarding hormonal and 
sexual health changes in men with PD and the impact of dopaminergic and/or 
androgen replacement therapy. Furthermore, while some research suggests that PD 
patients are at higher risk for prolactin elevation and testosterone deficiency, 
heterogeneity of the data limits extrapolation. Additionally, data related to 
pharmacologic optimization of the HPG axis in this patient population is 
similarly limited. Prospective studies are needed to better characterize the 
hormonal pathophysiology of PD as it relates to sexual dysfunction such that men 
at risk can be effectively identified so as to offer interventions that may 
improve quality of life."
1374,"BACKGROUND: Targeted gene inactivation (TGI) is a widely used technique for the 
study of genes' functions. There are many different methods for TGI, however, 
most of them are so complicated and time-consuming. New promising genetic 
engineering tools are developing for this purpose. In the present study, for the 
first time we disrupted a virulence gene from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi 
(S. Typhi), located in the bacterial chromosome using CRISPR/Cas9 system and 
homology directed repair (HDR).
METHODS: For this aim, pCas9 plasmid containing Cas9 enzyme and required 
proteins for homology directed recombination was transferred to S. Typhi by 
electroporation. On the other hand, a specific guide RNA (gRNA) was designed 
using CRISPOR online tool. Synthetic gRNA was cloned into pTargetF plasmid. 
Also, a DNA fragment (HDR fragment) was designed to incorporate into the 
bacterial chromosome following the cleavage of the bacterial genome by Cas9 
enzyme. pTargetF containing gRNA and HDR fragment were co-transferred to S. 
Typhi containing pcas9 plasmid. The transformed bacteria were screened for 
recombination using PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing.
RESULTS: The results of PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing showed the 
successful recombination of S. Typhi, in which the gidA gene is disrupted.
CONCLUSION: In the present study we aimed to develop a rapid and robust method 
for targeted gene inactivation in a bacterial species, S. Typhi. This procedure 
can be exploited for disruption of other Salmonella as well as other bacteria's 
genes."
1375,"The Semantic Association Test assesses several aspects of Semantic Memory 
(Categorical, Encyclopedic, Functional, and Visual Encyclopedic associations: 
CAs, EAs, FAs and VEAs), using a picture-to-picture matching paradigm. Normative 
data were collected from a group of 329 healthy participants (178 females) with 
mean 51.1 (range 20-90) years of age and mean 11.89 (range 5-19) years of 
education. Raw scores of healthy participants, pre-calculated correction factors 
for age and educational level, and Equivalent Scores are provided. The SAT was 
validated in a sample of 139 left brain-damaged persons with aphasia (PWA). Both 
groups (healthy participants and PWA) scored worse in the CA and EA conditions. 
The performance of the PWA group was overall defective, and global aphasics 
scored worse than persons with other types of aphasia. However, several PWA did 
not show impairments in the SAT. Dissociations were also found, with individual 
PWA showing defective performance confined to a single category. These results 
present the SAT as a tool that is useful to detect impairments of visual 
Semantic Memory, providing normative data from healthy participants and a 
validation study in PWA."
1376,"Despite improvement of current treatment strategies and novel targeted drugs, 
relapse and treatment resistance largely determine the outcome for acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) patients. To identify the underlying molecular characteristics, 
numerous studies have been aimed to decipher the genomic- and transcriptomic 
landscape of AML. Nevertheless, further molecular changes allowing malignant 
cells to escape treatment remain to be elucidated. Mass spectrometry is a 
powerful tool enabling detailed insights into proteomic changes that could 
explain AML relapse and resistance. Here, we investigated AML samples from 47 
adult and 22 pediatric patients at serial time-points during disease progression 
using mass spectrometry-based in-depth proteomics. We show that the proteomic 
profile at relapse is enriched for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and subunits 
of the respiratory chain complex, indicative of reprogrammed energy metabolism 
from diagnosis to relapse. Further, higher levels of granzymes and lower levels 
of the anti-inflammatory protein CR1/CD35 suggest an inflammatory signature 
promoting disease progression. Finally, through a proteogenomic approach, we 
detected novel peptides, which present a promising repertoire in the search for 
biomarkers and tumor-specific druggable targets. Altogether, this study 
highlights the importance of proteomic studies in holistic approaches to improve 
treatment and survival of AML patients."
1377,"PURPOSE: Characteristic features of amyloid-PET (A), tau-PET (T), and FDG-PET 
(N) can serve for the A/T/N classification of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent 
studies showed that the early, perfusion-weighted phases of amyloid- or tau-PET 
recordings serve to detect cerebrometabolic deficits equally to FDG-PET, 
therefore providing a surrogate of neuronal injury. As such, two channels of 
diagnostic information can be obtained in the setting of a single PET scan. 
However, there has hitherto been no comparison of early-phase amyloid- and 
tau-PET as surrogates for deficits in perfusion/metabolism. Therefore, we 
undertook to compare [18F]flutemetamol-amyloid-PET and [18F]PI-2620 tau-PET as 
""one-stop shop"" dual purpose tracers for the detection of neurodegenerative 
disease.
METHODS: We obtained early-phase PET recordings with [18F]PI-2620 (0.5-2.5 min 
p.i.) and [18F]flutemetamol (0-10 min p.i.) in 64 patients with suspected 
neurodegenerative disease. We contrasted global mean normalized images (SUVr) in 
the patients with a normal cohort of 15 volunteers without evidence of increased 
pathology to β-amyloid- and tau-PET examinations. Regional group differences of 
tracer uptake (z-scores) of 246 Brainnetome volumes of interest were calculated 
for both tracers, and the correlations of the z-scores were evaluated using 
Pearson's correlation coefficient. Lobar compartments, regions with significant 
neuronal injury (z-scores <  - 3), and patients with different neurodegenerative 
disease entities (e.g., Alzheimer's disease or 4R-tauopathies) served for 
subgroup analysis. Additionally, we used partial regression to correlate 
regional perfusion alterations with clinical scores in cognition tests.
RESULTS: The z-scores of perfusion-weighted images of both tracers showed high 
correlations across the brain, especially in the frontal and parietal lobes, 
which were the brain regions with pronounced perfusion deficit in the patient 
group (R = 0.83 ± 0.08; range, 0.61-0.95). Z-scores of individual patients 
correlated well by region (R = 0.57 ± 0.15; range, 0.16-0.90), notably when 
significant perfusion deficits were present (R = 0.66 ± 0.15; range, 0.28-0.90).
CONCLUSION: The early perfusion phases of [18F]PI-2620 tau- and 
[18F]flutemetamol-amyloid-PET are roughly equivalent indices of perfusion defect 
indicative of regional and lobar neuronal injury in patients with various 
neurodegenerative diseases. As such, either tracer may serve for two diagnostic 
channels by assessment of amyloid/tau status and neuronal activity."
1378,"BACKGROUND: Recently, molecular tumour boards (MTBs) have been integrated into 
the clinical routine. Since their benefit remains debated, we assessed MTB 
outcomes in the Comprehensive Cancer Center Ostbayern (CCCO) from 2019 to 2021.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 251 patients were included. Targeted sequencing 
was performed with PCR MSI-evaluation and immunohistochemistry for PD-L1, Her2, 
and mismatch repair enzymes. 125 treatment recommendations were given (49.8%). 
High-recommendation rates were achieved for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
(20/30, 66.7%) and gastric adenocarcinoma (10/16, 62.5%) as opposed to 
colorectal cancer (9/36, 25.0%) and pancreatic cancer (3/18, 16.7%). MTB 
therapies were administered in 47 (18.7%) patients, while 53 (21.1%) received 
alternative treatment regimens. Thus 37.6% of recommended MTB therapies were 
implemented (47/125 recommendations). The clinical benefit rate 
(complete + partial + mixed response + stable disease) was 50.0% for MTB and 
63.8% for alternative treatments. PFS2/1 ratios were 34.6% and 16.1%, 
respectively. Significantly improved PFS could be achieved for 
m1A-tier-evidence-based MTB therapies (median 6.30 months) compared to 
alternative treatments (median 2.83 months; P = 0.0278).
CONCLUSION: The CCCO MTB yielded a considerable recommendation rate, 
particularly in cholangiocarcinoma patients. The discrepancy between the 
low-recommendation rates in colorectal and pancreatic cancer suggests the 
necessity of a weighted prioritisation of entities. High-tier recommendations 
should be implemented predominantly."
1379,"Emerging evidence has proved that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in 
pathogenic processes. They are regarded as promising biomarkers for diagnosis 
due to covalently closed loop structures. As opposed to traditional experiments, 
computational approaches can identify circRNA-disease associations at a lower 
cost. Aggregating multi-source pathogenesis data helps to alleviate data 
sparsity and infer potential associations at the system level. The majority of 
computational approaches construct a homologous network using multi-source data, 
but they lose the heterogeneity of the data. Effective methods that use the 
features of multi-source data are considered as a matter of urgency. In this 
paper, we propose a model (CDHGNN) based on edge-weighted graph attention and 
heterogeneous graph neural networks for potential circRNA-disease association 
prediction. The circRNA network, micro RNA network, disease network and 
heterogeneous network are constructed based on multi-source data. To reflect 
association probabilities between nodes, an edge-weighted graph attention 
network model is designed for node features. To assign attention weights to 
different types of edges and learn contextual meta-path, CDHGNN infers potential 
circRNA-disease association based on heterogeneous neural networks. CDHGNN 
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy. Edge-weighted 
graph attention networks and heterogeneous graph networks have both improved 
performance significantly. Furthermore, case studies suggest that CDHGNN is 
capable of identifying specific molecular associations and investigating 
biomolecular regulatory relationships in pathogenesis. The code of CDHGNN is 
freely available at https://github.com/BioinformaticsCSU/CDHGNN."
1380,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 disease-related coagulopathy and thromboembolic 
complication, an important aspect of the disease pathophysiology, are frequent 
and associated with poor outcomes, particularly significant in hospitalized 
patients. Undoubtedly, anticoagulation forms a cornerstone for the management of 
hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but the appropriate dosing has been inconclusive 
and a subject of research. We aim to review existing literature and compare 
safety and efficacy outcomes of prophylactic and therapeutic dose 
anticoagulation in such patients.
METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy 
and safety of prophylactic dose anticoagulation when compared with therapeutic 
dosing in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, 
EMBASE and COCHRANE databases from 2019 to 2021, without any restriction by 
language. We screened records, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in 
the studies. RCTs that directly compare therapeutic and prophylactic 
anticoagulants dosing and are not placebo-controlled trials were included. 
Analyses of data were conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model 
(DerSimonian-Laird analysis). The study is registered with PROSPERO 
(CRD42021265948).
RESULTS: We included three studies in the final quantitative analysis. The 
incidence of thromboembolic events in therapeutic anticoagulation was lower in 
comparison with prophylactic anticoagulation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 
and reached statistical significance [RR 1·45, 95% CI (1.07, 1.97) I2 -0%], 
whereas major bleeding as an adverse event was found lower in prophylactic 
anticoagulation in comparison with therapeutic anticoagulation that was 
statistically significant [RR 0·42, 95% CI(0.19, 0.93) I2 -0%].
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that therapeutic dose anticoagulation is more 
effective in preventing thromboembolic events than prophylactic dose but 
significantly increases the risk of major bleeding as an adverse event. So, the 
risk-benefit ratio must be considered while using either of them."
1381,"BACKGROUND: Global or untargeted metabolomics is widely used to comprehensively 
investigate metabolic profiles under various pathophysiological conditions such 
as inflammations, infections, responses to exposures or interactions with 
microbial communities. However, biological interpretation of global metabolomics 
data remains a daunting task. Recent years have seen growing applications of 
pathway enrichment analysis based on putative annotations of liquid 
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) peaks for functional 
interpretation of LC-MS-based global metabolomics data. However, due to 
intricate peak-metabolite and metabolite-pathway relationships, considerable 
variations are observed among results obtained using different approaches. There 
is an urgent need to benchmark these approaches to inform the best practices.
RESULTS: We have conducted a benchmark study of common peak annotation 
approaches and pathway enrichment methods in current metabolomics studies. 
Representative approaches, including three peak annotation methods and four 
enrichment methods, were selected and benchmarked under different scenarios. 
Based on the results, we have provided a set of recommendations regarding peak 
annotation, ranking metrics and feature selection. The overall better 
performance was obtained for the mummichog approach. We have observed that 
a ~30% annotation rate is sufficient to achieve high recall (~90% based on 
mummichog), and using semi-annotated data improves functional interpretation. 
Based on the current platforms and enrichment methods, we further propose an 
identifiability index to indicate the possibility of a pathway being reliably 
identified. Finally, we evaluated all methods using 11 COVID-19 and 8 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) global metabolomics datasets."
1382,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) show high efficiency in a small fraction of 
advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, personalized immune subtypes have not 
been developed for the prediction of ICI efficiency in GC. Herein, we identified 
Pan-Immune Activation Module (PIAM), a curated gene expression profile (GEP) 
representing the co-infiltration of multiple immune cell types in tumor 
microenvironment of GC, which was associated with high expression of 
immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. We also identified 
Pan-Immune Dysfunction Genes (PIDG), a conservative PIAM-derivated GEP 
indicating the dysfunction of immune cell cooperation, which was associated with 
upregulation of metastatic programs (extracellular matrix receptor interaction, 
TGF-β signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and calcium signaling) but 
downregulation of proliferative signalings (MYC targets, E2F targets, mTORC1 
signaling, and DNA replication and repair). Moreover, we developed 
'GSClassifier', an ensemble toolkit based on top scoring pairs and extreme 
gradient boosting, for population-based modeling and personalized identification 
of GEP subtypes. With PIAM and PIDG, we developed four Pan-immune Activation and 
Dysfunction (PAD) subtypes and a GSClassifier model 'PAD for individual' with 
high accuracy in predicting response to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in advance GC 
(AUC = 0.833). Intriguingly, PAD-II (PIAMhighPIDGlow) displayed the highest 
objective response rate (60.0%) compared with other subtypes (PAD-I, 
PIAMhighPIDGhigh, 0%; PAD-III, PIAMlowPIDGhigh, 0%; PAD-IV, PIAMlowPIDGlow, 
17.6%; P = 0.003), which was further validated in the metastatic urothelial 
cancer cohort treated with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) (P = 0.018). In all, we 
provided 'GSClassifier' as a refined computational framework for GEP-based 
stratification and PAD subtypes as a promising strategy for exploring ICI 
responders in GC. Metastatic pathways could be potential targets for GC patients 
with high immune infiltration but resistance to ICI therapy."
1383,"Many roles of human platelets in health and disease are linked to their ability 
to transport and secrete a variety of small molecules and proteins carried in 
dense (δ-) and α-granules. Determination of granule number and content is 
important for diagnosis of platelet disorders and for studies of platelet 
structure, function, and development. We have optimized methods for detection 
and localization of platelet proteins via antibody and lectin staining, imaging 
via structured illumination laser fluorescence microscopy (SIM), and 
three-dimension (3D) image analysis. The methods were validated via comparison 
with published studies based on electron microscopy and high-resolution 
fluorescence microscopy. The α-granule cargo proteins thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), 
osteonectin (SPARC), fibrinogen (FGN), and Von Willebrand factor (VWF) were 
localized within the granule lumen, as was the proteoglycan serglycin (SRGN). 
Colocalization analysis indicates that staining with fluorescently labeled wheat 
germ agglutinin (WGA) allows detection of α-granules as effectively as

antibodies. RAB27B was observed to be concentrated at dense granules, allowing 
them to be counted via visual scoring and object analysis. We present a workflow 
for counting dense and α-granules via object analysis of 3D SIM images of

1384,"AIM: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of lateral violence (LV) 
experienced by nursing students during their internship, explore the difference 
between professional identity and professionalism among nursing students who had 
or had not experienced LV and analyse the mediating effect of professional 
identity on the relationship between LV and professionalism.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was used.
METHODS: An online anonymous survey was distributed to nursing students 
(N = 298) in Jiangsu province, China from June to July 2021. The questionnaire 
consisted of sections on lateral violence, professional identity and nursing 
professionalism.
RESULTS: Approximately 49.7% of the nursing students experienced LV behaviour 
during the internship period. Students who experienced LV had lower professional 
identity and professionalism than those who did not. Among the students, LV was 
negatively correlated with professional identity (r = -0.333, p < 0.001) and 
professionalism (r = -0.418, p < 0.001). The relationship effect of LV on 
nursing professionalism was partly mediated by professional identity.
CONCLUSION: Nearly half of the nursing students suffered from LV in the 
workplace, and this condition remarkably influenced nursing professionalism 
through professional identity. Both quantitative and qualitative studies are 
needed to investigate the factors that influence LV development in detail."
1385,"INTRODUCTION: Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of 
inflammatory and/or fibrotic conditions with variable outcome and often a dismal 
prognosis. Since many ILDs are progressive in nature, monitoring of signs and 
symptoms of progression is essential to inform treatment decisions and patient 
counseling. Monitoring of ILDs is a multimodality process and includes all 
aspects of the disease e.g., measurement of pulmonary function and exercise 
capacity, symptom registration and quality of life (QoL), imaging, comorbidities 
and/or involvement of other organs to assess disease activity, symptom burden, 
treatment effects, adverse events, the need for supportive and palliative care, 
and lung transplantation.
AREAS COVERED: For this narrative review, we searched the PUBMED database to 
identify articles relevant for monitoring ILDs, including pulmonary function 
tests, exercise capacity, imaging, telemedicine, symptoms and QoL.
EXPERT OPINION: Due to the high heterogeneity of the ILDs and their disease 
course, an individualized multimodality approach must be applied. There is no 
evidence for the optimal interval of monitoring.Future strategies include use of 
telemedicine for home monitoring of lung function and symptoms, use of 
artificial intelligence to support automatized guidance of patients, 
computerized evaluation of ILD changes on imaging, and new imaging tools with 
less radiation dosage."
1386,"Synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has emerged as a favorable therapeutic 
approach to fight cancer. However, design of an effective photothermal 
immunotherapy system to suppress tumor growth and simultaneously inhibit tumor 
metastases continues to be a challenge. Here a dual toll-like receptor agonists 
delivery system CPG@Au NRs/m-R848 for combined photothermal immunotherapy of 
melanoma is developed. CPG@Au NRs/m-R848 displays strong antitumor effects by 
promoting maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and reprogramming of M2 
macrophages into M1 phenotype. Moreover, immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by 
photothermal ablation of Au NRs could synergistically produce in situ 
vaccination effect with CPG ODN and R848, generating systemic and lasting 
antitumor immunity. It is further proved that CPG@Au NRs/m-R848 treatment 
inhibits tumor growth in bilateral B16F10 tumors model by eliciting CD8+ T cell 
response. Overall, this work suggests that this strategy hold great potential in 
tumor immunotherapy by regulating tumor-associated macrophage polarization, 
triggering DCs maturation and inducing ICD."
1387,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a complex disease with a multifactorial 
etiology. As the leading cause of intestinal morbidity and mortality among 
premature infants, many resources are being dedicated to neonatal care and 
molecular targets in the newborn intestine. However, NEC is heavily influenced 
by maternal and perinatal factors as well. Given its nature, preventive 
approaches to NEC are more likely to improve outcomes than new treatment 
strategies. Therefore, this review focuses on maternal, environmental, and 
racial factors associated with the development of NEC, with an emphasis on those 
that may be modifiable to decrease the incidence of the disease."
1388,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is a severe gastrointestinal disease of the infant. It 
most commonly targets those that are born prematurely. NEC has been associated 
with initiation of feeds and in most cases, it can be managed with antibiotics 
and bowel rest. However, in up to half of the cases, intestinal perforation, 
peritonitis, and failure of medical treatment will require surgical 
intervention. The following review will discuss the surgical approach to 
managing NEC, based on an updated review of practice patterns and recently 
published literature."
1389,"Organs and tissues are subjected to numerous alterations during aging, as a 
result of complex biochemical changes. Aging is certainly associated with the 
accumulation of ""antiaging"" and ""proaging"" factors in the systemic circulation. 
The effects of young blood on rejuvenation of regenerative capacity suggest the 
existence of multiple ""proyouthful"" factors, such as growth differentiation 
factor 11 (GDF11), in the young blood of animals. GDF11 is a member of the 
transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) superfamily of cytokines, and appears to 
be a critical rejuvenation factor in aging organs. In the context of aging, 
GDF11 promotes vascular and neural plasticity of the central nervous system. 
Parabiosis, the surgical linking of circulations between old and young mice, was 
employed to identify GDF11 as an antihypertrophic factor that appears to 
rejuvenate the aging murine heart. Current theories suggest that GDF11 in young 
blood has beneficial effects on cognitive and cardiovascular functions and wound 
healing. The cellular mechanisms of GDF11 in cardiovascular, neurological, skin 
and skeletal muscle diseases are not clearly defined, but evidence indicates 
that it may function as a proneurogenic and proangiogenic drug. GDF11 binds and 
activates specific receptor complexes, which transmit signals by two procedures: 
the TGFβ-Smad pathway and the bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-Smad pathway. GDF11 
is perhaps only the first in a series of circulating molecules that will be 
found to influence the aging of different tissues, and it may be a potential 
candidate for therapeutic intervention against angiogenesis-related disorders."
1390,"The ε4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest and most common 
genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the mechanism of 
conveyed risk is incompletely understood, promotion of inflammation, 
dysregulated metabolism, and protein misfolding and aggregation are contributors 
to accelerating disease. Here we determined the concurrent effects of systemic 
metabolic changes and brain inflammation in young (3-month-old) and aged 
(18-month-old) male and female mice carrying the APOE4 gene. Using functional 
metabolic assays alongside multivariate modeling of hippocampal cytokine levels, 
we found that brain cytokine signatures are predictive of systemic metabolic 
outcomes, independent of AD proteinopathies. Male and female mice each produce 
different cytokine signatures as they age and as their systemic metabolic 
phenotype declines, and these signatures are APOE genotype dependent. Ours is 
the first study to identify a quantitative and predictive link between systemic 
metabolism and specific pathological cytokine signatures in the brain. Our 
results highlight the effects of APOE4 beyond the brain and suggest the 
potential for bi-directional influence of risk factors in the brain and 
periphery."
1391,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is becoming more prevalent in the end-stage renal disease 
population. Bariatric surgery (BS) is increasingly considered as an approach to 
become eligible for kidney transplant (KT) or reduce obesity-related 
morbidities.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the short- and long-term outcomes of patients who 
underwent both BS and KT and to determine the optimal timing of BS.
METHODS: Patients who underwent both KT and BS between January 2000 and December 
2020 were included and stratified according to the sequence of the 2 operations. 
The primary outcomes were patient and graft survival. The secondary outcomes 
were postoperative complications and efficacy of weight loss.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included in the KT first group and 34 in the 
BS first group. Death-uncensored graft survival in the KT first group was 
significantly higher than in the BS first group (90.9% versus 71.4%, P = .009), 
without significant difference in patient survival and death-censored graft 
survival (100% versus 90.5%, P = .082; 90.9% versus 81.0%, P = .058). There was 
no significant difference in 1-year total weight loss (1-yr TWL: median 
[interquartile range {IQR}], 36.0 [28.0-42.0] kg versus 29.6 [21.5-40.6] kg, P = 
.424), 1-year percentage of excess weight loss (1-yr %EWL: median [IQR], 74.9 
[54.1-99.0] versus 57.9 [47.5-79.4], P = .155), and the incidence of 
postoperative complications (36.4% versus 50.0%, P = .316) between the KT first 
and BS first groups.
CONCLUSION: Both pre- and posttransplant BS are effective and safe. Different 
conditions of each transplant candidate should be considered in detail to 
determine the optimal timing of BS."
1392,"Menopause is not only the end of reproductive life, it is also related to 
diseases such as hyperlipidaemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 
osteoporosis and breast cancer. Traditional epidemiological studies have found 
that heredity is the main determinant of age at natural menopause (ANM). Early 
studies on genetic factors were limited to candidate gene studies. Menopause age 
is not inherited by a single gene, but is the result of multiple gene effects. 
With the development of genomic technology, the Reproductive Genetics Consortium 
conducted several genome-wide association studies on ANM in people of European 
descent, and found that defects in DNA damage repair pathways were the main 
genetic mechanism. In recent years, due to the ethnic heterogeneity of ANM, 
there has been further development of global studies into multi-ethnic and 
trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies. Further genetic and 
epidemiological studies, including polygenetic score and genetic mechanism 
research, should be conducted to investigate the pathogenesis and mechanism with 
respect to menopause and its related diseases."
1393,"BACKGROUND: Although androgen receptor-targeted agents prolong the lives of 
patients with metastatic prostate cancer, patients develop therapy resistance 
and most ultimately succumb to the disease. The PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway has been 
associated with the development of resistance, raising the possibility that 
pathway inhibitors may produce a clinical benefit. This open-label phase Ib 
study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary 
clinical activity of adding capivasertib - a potent, selective inhibitor of 
AKT1/2/3 - to approved abiraterone acetate therapy.
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer who had undergone at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy received 
abiraterone acetate 1000 mg (orally administered once daily), plus oral 
prednisone 5 mg (twice daily) with capivasertib 400 mg (orally, twice daily, 
with an intermittent schedule of 4 days on, 3 days off).
RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. The most frequent adverse 
events (all grade) were diarrhea (30%), anemia (26%), asthenia (22%), and nausea 
(22%). The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were acute kidney 
injury (19%), hyperglycemia (7%), rash (7%), abdominal pain (7%), and asthenia 
(7%). Capivasertib and abiraterone PK were consistent with previously reported 
results from monotherapy dosing. Nine participants (33%) showed a 20% or greater 
decrease in prostate-specific antigen during study treatment.
CONCLUSION: The combination of capivasertib and abiraterone acetate had an 
acceptable tolerability profile consistent with the known profile of each agent. 
These data support further evaluation of capivasertib and abiraterone acetate in 
patients with advanced prostate cancer."
1394,"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the 
involvement of exocrine glands with dryness of mouth and eyes as typical 
clinical manifestations, and may also have extra-glandular organ involvement. 
Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common type of adult-onset muscular 
dystrophy, which can lead to progressive muscle weakness and myotonia. The 
coexistence of pSS with DM1 was rarely reported. We here report a Chinese female 
pSS patient with progressive type II respiratory failure as a major 
manifestation and finally diagnosed with DM1 by genetic testing."
1395,"Aging is a major risk factor for common neurodegenerative diseases. Although 
multiple molecular, cellular, structural, and functional changes occur in the 
brain during aging, the involvement of caveolin-2 (Cav-2) in brain ageing 
remains unknown. We investigated Cav-2 expression in brains of aged mice and its 
effects on endothelial cells. The human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs) showed decreased THP-1 adhesion and infiltration when treated with 
Cav-2 siRNA compared to control siRNA. In contrast, Cav-2 overexpression 
increased THP-1 adhesion and infiltration in HUVECs. Increased expression of 
Cav-2 and iba-1 was observed in brains of old mice. Moreover, there were fewer 
iba-1-positive cells in the brains of aged Cav-2 knockout (KO) mice than of 
wild-type aged mice. The levels of several chemokines were higher in brains of 
aged wild-type mice than in young wild-type mice; moreover, chemokine levels 
were significantly lower in brains of young mice as well as aged Cav-2 KO mice 
than in their wild-type counterparts. Expression of PECAM1 and VE-cadherin 
proteins increased in brains of old wild-type mice but was barely detected in 
brains of young wild-type and Cav-2 KO mice. Collectively, our results suggest 
that Cav-2 expression increases in the endothelial cells of aged brain, and 
promotes leukocyte infiltration and age-associated neuroinflammation."
1396,"Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have great 
potential in applications such as regenerative medicine, cardiac disease 
modeling, and in vitro drug evaluation. However, hPSC-CMs are immature, which 
limits their applications. During development, the maturation of CMs is 
accompanied by a decline in their proliferative capacity. This phenomenon 
suggests that regulating the cell cycle may facilitate the maturation of 
hPSC-CMs. Aurora kinases are essential kinases that regulate the cell cycle, the 
role of which is not well studied in hPSC-CM maturation. Here, we demonstrate 
that CYC116, an inhibitor of Aurora kinases, significantly promotes the 
maturation of CMs derived from both human embryonic stem cells (H1 and H9) and 
iPSCs (induced PSCs) (UC013), resulting in increased expression of genes related 
to cardiomyocyte function, better organization of the sarcomere, increased 
sarcomere length, increased number of mitochondria, and enhanced physiological 
function of the cells. In addition, a number of other Aurora kinase inhibitors 
have also been found to promote the maturation of hPSC-CMs. Our data suggest 
that blocking aurora kinase activity and regulating cell cycle progression may 
promote the maturation of hPSC-CMs."
1397,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is a dynamic process that increases with ageing, while it 
remains unclear whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk algorithm could 
predict life course dynamic frailty trajectories, for example, the longitudinal 
patterns of how frailty evolves with time. We intended to examine the predictive 
utility of the Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation 2 (SCORE2) algorithm for life 
course accelerated frailty and physical function decline, in comparison with the 
precedent SCORE algorithm.
METHODS: Longitudinal data regarding accumulation of deficits frailty index (FI) 
and physical function (grip strength, gait speed, peak expiratory flow and timed 
chair rises) were drawn from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and 
Health and Retirement Study (HRS), two nationally representative cohorts with 
community-dwelling adults aged ≥50 years. SCORE and SCORE2 were calculated at 
baselines following European Society of Cardiology guidelines. A group-based 
trajectory modelling approach was used for identifying potential life course 
frailty trajectories, based on 14- and 12-year FI data in the ELSA and HRS. 
Modified Poisson regression and linear mixed model were applied for analysing 
associations between SCORE2 with accelerated frailty trajectory and physical 
function decline, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
analysis was conducted to evaluate predictive utility for accelerated frailty 
increase trajectory of SCORE and SCORE2, with the area under the curve (AUC) 
compared using the paired DeLong's test.
RESULTS: A total of 4834 participants from the ELSA and 7815 participants from 
the HRS were included (mean age: 64.0 ± 9.2 and 65.4 ± 9.9 years; men: 44.3% and 
41.4%, respectively). Three frailty trajectories were consistently identified in 
both cohorts: (1) stable frailty increase (n = 3026 in ELSA and 4004 in HRS); 
(2) moderate frailty increase (n = 1325 in ELSA and 2955 in HRS); (3) 
accelerated frailty increase (n = 483 in ELSA and 856 in HRS). Each 10% 
increment in SCORE2 risk was associated with the higher risk of accelerated 
frailty increase (risk ratio [RR]: 3.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] [3.22, 
3.98], P < 0.001 in ELSA; RR: 1.61, 95% CI [1.56, 1.67], P < 0.001 in HRS) and 
faster declines in all physical function measurements. SCORE2 algorithm showed 
good accuracy for predicting accelerated frailty increase (area under the curve 
[AUC] in ELSA: 0.759; HRS: 0.744), with better performance than the SCORE (AUC 
in ELSA: 0.729; HRS: 0.700) in both cohorts (P < 0.001 for comparison).
CONCLUSIONS: SCORE2 algorithm could serve good utility for predicting life 
course accelerated frailty increase and physical function decline among 
community-dwelling non-frail adults aged ≥50 years."
1398,"Wildlife trade is a key driver of extinction risk, affecting at least 24% of 
terrestrial vertebrates. The persistent removal of species can have profound 
impacts on species extinction risk and selection within populations. We draw 
together the first review of characteristics known to drive species use - 
identifying species with larger body sizes, greater abundance, increased rarity 
or certain morphological traits valued by consumers as being particularly 
prevalent in trade. We then review the ecological implications of this 
trade-driven selection, revealing direct effects of trade on natural selection 
and populations for traded species, which includes selection against desirable 
traits. Additionally, there exists a positive feedback loop between rarity and 
trade and depleted populations tend to have easy human access points, which can 
result in species being harvested to extinction and has the potential to alter 
source-sink dynamics. Wider cascading ecosystem repercussions from trade-induced 
declines include altered seed dispersal networks, trophic cascades, long-term 
compositional changes in plant communities, altered forest carbon stocks, and 
the introduction of harmful invasive species. Because it occurs across multiple 
scales with diverse drivers, wildlife trade requires multi-faceted conservation 
actions to maintain biodiversity and ecological function, including regulatory 
and enforcement approaches, bottom-up and community-based interventions, captive 
breeding or wildlife farming, and conservation translocations and trophic 
rewilding. We highlight three emergent research themes at the intersection of 
trade and community ecology: (1) functional impacts of trade; (2) altered 
provisioning of ecosystem services; and (3) prevalence of trade-dispersed 
diseases. Outside of the primary objective that exploitation is sustainable for 
traded species, we must urgently incorporate consideration of the broader 
consequences for other species and ecosystem processes when quantifying 
sustainability."

1404,"BACKGROUND: Febrile seizure (FS) is one of the most common neurological 
manifestations of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in children. We compared 
the clinical characteristics of FSs between the patients with and without 
COVID-19 during the pandemic period of COVID-19.
METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included patients aged 
0-18 years who visited the pediatric emergency department (ED) with FS from 
January 1, 2022, to April 30, 2022.
RESULTS: A total of 186 patients visited the pediatric ED with FS during the 
study period: 123 (66.1%) were positive for COVID-19 and 63 (33.9%) were 
negative. Patients with COVID-19 were predominantly male (70.7% vs. 50.8%, 
P=0.007) and older (2.4 vs. 1.8 years, P=0.005) than those without COVID-19. A 
higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 were of atypical age (age >5 years 
or <6 months) than those without COVID-19 (26.8% vs. 9.5%, P=0.006). This was 
especially true for those aged >5 years (22% vs. 4.8%, P=0.003). Patients with 
COVID-19 had a higher probability of multiple episodes of convulsion within 24 h 
than those without COVID-19 (10.6% vs. 1.6%, P=0.037). Among patients with 
COVID-19, males had a shorter fever-to-seizure duration than females (3 h vs. 
6.5 h, P=0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FS with COVID-19 tend to be predominantly male and 
have older age of onset than those without COVID-19. Because of the atypical age 
of onset and probability of multiple convulsion episodes, vigilance for FS is 
needed in patients with COVID-19, especially males."
1405,"Cardiovascular diseases have been the leading cause of death worldwide during 
the past several decades. Cell loss is the main problem that resulted in cardiac 
dysfunction and further mortality. Cell therapy aiming to replenish the lost 
cells is proposed to treat cardiovascular diseases especially ischemic heart 
diseases which lead to a big portion of cell loss. Due to the direct injection's 
low cell retention and survival ratio, cell therapy using biomaterials as cell 
carriers attracts more and more attention because of their promotion of cell 
delivery and maintenance at the aiming sites. In this review, we systematically 
summarized the three main factors involved in cell therapy for myocardial tissue 
regeneration: cell sources (somatic cells, stem cells and engineered cells), 
chemical components of cell carriers (natural materials, synthetic materials and 
electroactive materials), and categories of cell delivery materials (patches, 
microspheres, injectable hydrogels, nanofiber and microneedles, etc.). An 
introduction of the methods including magnetic 
resonance/radionuclide/photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging for tracking the 
behavior of transplanted cells in vivo is also included. Current challenges of 
biomaterials-based cell therapy and their future directions are provided to give 
both beginners and professionals a clear view of the development and future 
trends in this area. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1406,"Though most known for heartburn and regurgitation, gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (GERD) is attributed to countless atypical, extra-esophageal (EE) 
manifestations like cough and throat clearing. While GERD has been studied 
extensively, the relationship between reflux character and symptom manifestation 
remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine proximal reflux 
frequency and its relationship with typical or atypical symptoms. 540 (75.1% 
female, 24.9% male) pH-impedance monitoring studies from the last 3-years were 
divided by symptom indication and retrospectively reviewed for proximal reflux 
frequency, total acid exposure time, mean nocturnal baseline impedance, and 
total reflux episodes in both abnormal and normal, and borderline studies. 
Baseline characteristics were also collected. Both total reflux events and mean 
proximal reflux frequency were found to differ significantly between those with 
typical versus atypical symptoms. Total reflux events [median (IQR)] were 43.5 
(24.0-74.0) in typical patients and 35.0 (20.0-57.0) in atypical patients 
(P-value 0.0369). Proximal reflux frequency [median (IQR)] was 12.0 (4.0-19.0) 
typical and 7.0 (3.0-17.0) atypical (P-value 0.0348). Results for exclusively 
abnormal studies also favored typical patients but not significantly. Baseline 
characteristics and use of gastric acid control did not differ significantly. 
Proximal reflux frequency was observed to increase among those with typical GERD 
symptoms. Total acid reflux events were also significantly higher on average 
with typical patients. Our findings that proximal reflux frequency is reduced in 
patients with atypical symptoms compared with patients with typical symptoms 
suggest that proximal reflux exposure may play a significant role in the symptom 
presentation of typical classic heartburn and regurgitation symptoms. The 
differential diagnosis for atypical EE symptoms is vast and can be 
multifactorial. Our results indicate proximal reflux events may contribute to 
atypical EE symptoms less than previously reported."
1407,"Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a safe and effective minimally invasive 
treatment for achalasia. Postoperative reflux rates remain high. The functional 
luminal imaging probe (FLIP) allows intraoperative measurement of lower 
esophageal distensibility during POEM. In theory, this enables a tailoring of 
myotomies to ensure adequate distensibility while minimizing postoperative 
reflux risk. Two prospectively collected POEM databases were analyzed from two 
UK tertiary upper GI centers. The operators in each center used FLIP 
measurements to ensure adequate myotomy. Outcome measures included Eckardt score 
(where <3 indicated clinical success) and proton-pump inhibitor use (PPI), 
collected at the first postoperative appointment. Length of stay was recorded as 
were complications. In all, 142 patients underwent POEM between 2015 and 2019. 
Overall, 90% (128/142) had postoperative Eckardt scores of <3 at 6 weeks. 
Clinical success improved to 93% (66/71) in the latter half of each series with 
a significantly higher rate of complete symptom resolution (53 versus 26%, 
P = 0.003). In all, 79% of the poor responders had previous interventions 
compared with 55% of responders (P = 0.09). Median post-myotomy distensibility 
index was 4.0 mm2/mmHg in responders and 2.9 in nonresponders (P = 0.16). 
Myotomy length of <7 cm was associated with 93% clinical success and 40% post op 
PPI use compared with 60% PPI use with longer myotomies. There were two type 
IIIa, two type IIIb, and one IV Clavien-Dindo complications. This is the largest 
series of endoluminal functional lumen imaging probe (EndoFLIP)-tailored POEM in 
the UK to date. The shorter myotomies, allowed through EndoFLIP tailoring, 
remained clinically effective at 6 weeks. Complete symptom response rates 
improved in the latter half of each series. More data will be needed from 
high-volume collaborations to decipher optimal myotomy profiles based on 
EndoFLIP parameters."
1408,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in patients who have undergone 
lung transplantation and is associated with poorer outcomes, but guidelines are 
lacking to direct management strategies in this population. We assessed the 
diagnostic yield of impedance metrics compared to pH-metry alone for detecting 
GERD among lung transplant recipients and evaluated their association with 
clinical outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive 
patients who underwent lung transplantation. Demographic data, acid exposure 
time (AET), number of reflux episodes, mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI), 
post-reflux swallowing-induced peristaltic wave index (PSPWI), and clinical 
outcomes including mortality were collected. The relationship between GERD 
metrics and clinical outcomes was assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and 
Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Of the 76 patients studied, 29 (38%) had 
GERD based on abnormal AET after lung transplantation. One (1.3%) patient had 
GERD based on elevated number of reflux episodes and abnormal distal MNBI 
detected GERD in 19 (26%) patients, resulting in 62% sensitivity and 94% 
specificity. Two (2.6%) patients had normal PSPWI. Patients with low distal MNBI 
had significantly decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at 
3-year posttransplant compared to those without low distal MNBI (P = 0.03). 
Three-year survival was significantly worse among patients with elevated AET 
(66.7% vs. 89.1%, P = 0.03) but not with low distal MNBI (68.4% vs. 84.3%, 
P = 0.18). Abnormal AET is more sensitive for detecting GERD than other reflux 
metrics studied and is associated with survival, suggesting pH-metry alone may 
be sufficient to guide GERD management after lung transplant."
1409,"Since the early 1970s, the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has 
undergone a major transformation. Initially based on only two drugs, an 
anthracycline and cytosine arabinoside, the aim of therapy was to achieve a 
haematological response allowing patients to recover and go home. Back in those 
early days, cure was not a realistic expectation. Treatment was analogous to a 
heart attack; upon recovery and a short respite, recurrence and death inevitably 
followed. Over the subsequent decades, slow but remarkable progress was made 
such that a subgroup of young adults could become long-term survivors. This 
astonishing feat was achieved initially without the use of new drugs. Supportive 
care played a major role with the widespread availability of platelet 
transfusions and improved antimicrobial therapy, particularly antifungal. No 
less important was the better use of existing drugs and the development of 
allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation. While initially the focus was on 
maximal tolerated therapy, an understanding of the immunologic role of 
allogeneic transplantation, better genetic characterization of the biology of 
the disease, advanced tools for detection of minimal disease as well as the 
recent development of new drugs changed the focus to a more refined approach 
targeting patients who are more likely to respond. Clearly, the historical 
paradigm where the term AML was generic and applicable to all patients requires 
a rethinking from the traditional therapeutic demarcations of therapy into 
phases of induction, consolidation and maintenance. These evolving new concepts 
and paradigm will be herein considered."
1410,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal codominant hereditary 
illness marked by the heightened risk of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease and high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). FH 
patients can have homozygous or heterozygous variants. This condition has been 
linked to variations in the genes for the LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B, 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9), and LDLR adaptor protein 1. 
Drugs such as statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors are currently widely 
available, allowing for the theoretical normalization of plasma LDL-C levels 
mostly in patients with heterozygous FH. However, homozygous FH patients usually 
have a poor response to traditional lipid-lowering therapy and may have a poor 
prognosis at a young age. LDL apheresis and novel pharmacological therapies such 
as microsomal transfer protein inhibitors or anti-angiopoietin-like protein 3 
monoclonal antibodies are extremely expensive and unavailable in most regions of 
the world. Therefore, the unmet need persists for these patients. In this 
review, we discuss the numerous gene delivery, gene editing, and stem cell 
manipulation techniques used in this study to correct FH-causing LDLR gene 
variations in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Finally, we looked at a variety of 
studies that corrected genetic defects that caused FH using the ground-breaking 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing technology."
1411,"Lung transplantation is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage lung 
disease. COVID-19 has been associated with a severe and rapid decline in 
pulmonary function, in which case lung transplantation has been described to be 
effective. We herein describe nine patients who underwent lung transplantation 
for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, of whom six were bridged with 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The median time of pre-operative 
observation periods was 54 days to ensure no lung function recovery and the time 
to wean off ECMO was 3 days. Patients had comparable short-term survival 
outcomes to non-COVID-19 lung transplant recipients at our institution during 
the same time period. Lung transplantation for COVID-19-associated lung disease 
is feasible with comparable short-term outcomes and may liberate patients from 
extracorporeal supports."
1412,"BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether skin biomarkers collected in infancy can 
predict the onset of atopic dermatitis (AD), and be used in future prevention 
trials to identify children at risk.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine whether skin biomarkers can predict atopic 
dermatitis during the first 2 years of life.
METHODS: 300 term and 150 preterm children were enrolled at birth and followed 
for AD until the age of 2 years. Skin tape strips were collected at 0-3 days and 
2 months of age and analyzed for selected immune and barrier biomarkers. Hazard 
ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using Cox-regression was calculated 
for the risk of AD.
RESULTS: The 2-year prevalence of AD was 34.6% (99/286) and 21.2% (25/118) among 
term and preterm children, respectively. Skin biomarkers collected at birth did 
not predict AD. Elevated TARC/CCL17-levels collected at 2 months of age 
increased the overall risk of AD (HR 2.11; 95% CI 1.36-3.26; P=0.0008) and 
moderate-to-severe AD (HR 4.97; 95% CI 2.09-11.80; P=0.0003). Interleukin (IL)-8 
and IL-18 predicted moderate-to-severe AD. Low filaggrin degradation product 
levels increased the risk of AD (HR 2.04; 95% CI 1.32-3.15; P=0.001). Elevated 
biomarker levels at 2 months predicted AD at other skin sites and many months 
after collection.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that non-invasively collected skin biomarkers of 
barrier and immune pathways can precede the onset of AD."
1413,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The etiology of acute severe non-A-E hepatitis in children 
still remains unclear. We aimed to describe occurrence and outcome of pediatric 
patients with acute severe hepatitis in North-West Germany over a period of more 
than 30 years and to compare the features to the cases of the current endemic.
METHODS: Analysed were all cases of acute severe hepatitis in childhood as 
defined by WHO at Hannover Medical School from 1990 and at the University 
Hospital of Essen from 2009 to 16 May 2022. We separated a historic cohort 
(1990-2018) and compared it to recent cases (2019-2022).
RESULTS: After application of exclusion criteria, 107 patients with acute severe 
hepatitis were identified (2.32 cases/centre/year). Annual incidence per centre 
rose significantly from 2.2 (historic cohort until 2018) to 4.25/centre/year 
(from 2019, p=0.002). 75.7 % presented with jaundice, 51.4% in context of 
infection. Two cases of Adenovirus were proven (2004/2016), other pathogens 
detected were HHV-6 (4), CMV, HSV, EBV(3). 69 patients (64.5%) met criteria of 
pediatric acute liver failure, 44 needed liver transplantation. Patients of the 
current cohort, patients with infection, gastrointestinal symptoms and higher 
ALT had a better chance of transplant-free survival, whereas hepatic 
encephalopathy, higher INR and bilirubin predicted a poor outcome. 25 patients 
developed hepatitis associated aplastic anemia. 19 patients (17.8 %) died.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute non-A-E-hepatitis in children is a rare but severe entity, 
often leading to acute liver failure. Clinical presentation in our current 
cohort resembles 2022 NAEH cases, and outcome has improved compared to historic 
controls. The rising incidence in our centres since 2019 without adenoviral 
infection, shortly before and during SARS-CoV-2-pandemia, indicates other 
potential triggers than Adenovirus for comparable NAEH cases.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: As the current epidemic of severe acute 
non-A-E-hepatitis cases in children highlights our limited understanding in the 
field, we aim to improve clinicians´ comprehension and ultimately their clinical 
management of this disease by the description of current cases, characterisation 
of the presentation over time, and definition of similarities and discrepancies, 
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data show a rising incidence of 
comparable non-A-E-hepatitis cases since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
without association to adenoviral infections, possibly suggesting the recently 
described accumulation of Adenovirus infections in relationship to hepatitis as 
a new trigger for a known phenomenon, rather than a new disease entity. 
Therefore, the role of protective isolation and subsequent lack of contact to 
trivial infections in children during the pandemic should be the subject of 
further examinations. We expect our data to contribute to a better understanding 
of severe acute hepatitis in childhood, an increased vigilance for this 
potentially lethal disease beyond the current epidemic, and ultimately improved 
clinical diagnosis and care."
1414,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Comparative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 
patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
(TDF) versus entecavir (ETV) remains controversial. This individual patient data 
(IPD) meta-analysis aimed to compare HCC risk between the two drugs and identify 
any subgroup of patients who may benefit more from one treatment than the other.
METHODS: Published meta-analyses, electronic databases and congress proceedings 
were searched to identify eligible studies through January 2021. We compared HCC 
risk between the two drugs using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model 
with anonymised IPD from treatment-naïve CHB patients receiving TDF or ETV for 
≥1 year. Treatment effect consistency was explored in propensity score matching 
(PSM), weighting (PSW) and subgroup analyses for age, sex, hepatitis B e-antigen 
(HBeAg) positivity, cirrhosis, and diabetes status.
RESULTS: We included 11 studies from Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong involving 
42,939 patients receiving TDF (n=6,979) or ETV (n=35,960) monotherapy. Patients 
receiving TDF had significantly lower HCC risk: adjusted HR 0.77 (95% CI 
0.61-0.98; p=0.03). Lower HCC risk with TDF was consistently observed in PSM (HR 
0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.88; p<0.01) and PSW (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67-1.03; p=0.10) 
analyses and in all subgroups, with statistical significance in the ≥50 years of 
age (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58-1.00; p<0.05), male (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.96; 
p=0.02), HBeAg-positive (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.97; p=0.03), and non-diabetic 
(HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-1.00; p<0.05) subgroups.
CONCLUSION: TDF was associated with significantly lower HCC risk than ETV in CHB 
patients, particularly those with HBeAg positivity. Longer follow-up may be 
needed to better define incidence differences between the treatments in various 
subgroups.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Previous aggregate data meta-analyses have reported 
inconsistent conclusions on the relative effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) in reducing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
risk in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This individual patient data 
meta-analysis on 11 studies involving 42,939 patients from Korea, Taiwan, and 
Hong Kong suggested that TDF-treated patients have a significantly lower HCC 
risk than ETV-treated patients, which was observed in all subgroups of clinical 
interest and by different analytical methodologies. These findings may have to 
be taken into account by healthcare providers when determining the optimal 
course of treatment for patients with CHB and may be considered in ensuring that 
treatment guidelines for CHB remain pertinent."
1415,"Mycobacterium chimaera colonizes water-based heater-cooler units (HCUs), from 
which it can spread to patients during surgery. Vermamoeba vermiformis is a 
free-living waterborne amoeba, which was consistently present within HCUs and we 
hypothesized that these amoebae can be involved in the persistent presence of M. 
chimaera. In an in vitro disinfection model, increased survival of M. chimaera 
was observed after chlorine exposure in the presence of V. vermiformis. Confocal 
microscopy demonstrated the intracellular presence of M. chimaera in V. 
vermiformis. This way V. vermiformis can contribute to the persistent presence 
of M. chimaera in HCUs. Cleaning and disinfection protocols should take this 
phenomenon into account."
1416,"The status of lymph node involvement is a major component of the tumor, node, 
metastasis (TNM) staging system. The N categories for lung cancer have remained 
unchanged since the 4th edition of the TNM staging system, partly because of 
differences in nodal mapping nomenclature, partly because of insufficient 
details to verify possible alternative approaches for staging. In preparation 
for the rigorous analysis of the International Association for the Study of Lung 
Cancer (IASLC) database necessary for the 9th edition TNM staging system, 
members of the N-Descriptors Subcommittee of the IASLC Staging and Prognostic 
Factors Committee reviewed the evidence for alternative approaches to 
categorizing the extent of lymph node involvement with lung cancer which is 
currently based solely on the anatomic location of lymph node metastasis. We 
reviewed the literature focusing on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to 
stimulate dialogue and mutual understanding among subcommittee members engaged 
in developing the 9th edition TNM staging system for lung cancer, which has been 
proposed for adoption by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for 
International Cancer Control in 2024. The discussion of the range of possible 
revision options for the N categories, including the pros and cons of counting 
lymph nodes, lymph node stations or lymph node zones also provides transparency 
to the process, explaining why certain options may be discarded, others deferred 
for future consideration. Finally, we provide a preliminary discussion of the 
future directions that the N-Descriptors Subcommittee might consider for the 
10th edition and beyond."
1417,"INTRODUCTION: In situ reconstruction (ISR) with autologous veins is the 
preferred method in infectious native aortic aneurysms (INAA) or vascular 
(endo)graft infection (VGEI). However, access to biological substitutes can 
prove difficult and lacks versatility. This study evaluates survival and freedom 
from reinfection after ISR of INAA/VGEI using the Antimicrobial InterGard 
Synergy graft combining silver and triclosan.
METHODS: From February 2014 to April 2020, 86 Antimicrobial grafts were 
implanted for aortic infection. The diagnosis of INAA/VGEI and reinfection was 
established based on the MAGIC criteria. Survival was analyzed using the 
Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank p-values.
RESULTS: The Antimicrobial graft was implanted in 32 cases of INAA, 28 of VGI, 
and 26 of VEI. Median age was 69.0 (IQR: 62.0;74.0), with a history of coronary 
artery disease (n=21; 24.4%), chronic kidney disease (n=11; 12.8%), cancer 
(n=21; 24.4%), and immunosuppression (n=27; 31.4%). Imaging showed infiltration 
(n=14; 16.3%), air (n=10; 11.6%), and rupture (n=16; 18.6% including 22 
aorto-enteric fistulae (AEnF)). Symptoms included fever (n=37; 43.0%), shock 
(n=11; 12.8%), and pain (n=47; 54.7%). Repair was undertaken through a midline 
laparotomy in 75 cases (87.2%) and coeliac cross-clamping in 19 (22.1%), 
supra-renal in 26 (30.2%), plus celiac trunk (n=3), mesenteric (n=5), renal 
(n=13) or hypogastric (n=4) artery reconstruction and omental flap coverage 
(n=41; 48.8%). For AEnF, the gastrointestinal tract was repaired using direct 
suture (n=14; 16.3%) or resection-anastomosis (n=8; 9.3%). Causative organisms 
were identified in 74 patients (86.0%), with polymicrobial infection in 32 
(37.2%) and fungal co-infection in 7 (8.1%). Thirty-day and in-hospital 
mortality were 14.0% and 22.1% (n=12 and 19 respectively, 3 INAA (9.4%), 7 VGI 
(25.0%) and 9 VEI (34.6%)). Seventy patients (81.4%) had a post-operative 
complication, 44 (51.2%) of whom returned to the operative room. The 1 and 
2-year survival rates were 74.0% (95%CI: 63.3-82.1) and 69.8% (95%CI: 
58.5-78.5). Survival was significantly better for INAA vs VGEI (p=.01) and worse 
for AEnF (p=.001). Freedom from reinfection was 97.2% (95%CI: 89.2-99.3) and 
95.0% (95%CI: 84.8-98.4) with 6 reinfections (7.0%) requiring 2 radiological/6 
surgical drainage and 2 graft removals. Primary patency was 88.0% (95%CI: 
78.1-93.6) and 79.9% (95%CI: 67.3-88.1) with no significant difference between 
INAA and VGEI (p=.16).
CONCLUSION: ISR of INAA or VGEI with the Antimicrobial graft showed encouraging 
early mortality, comparable to the rates found in femoral vein (9-16%) and 
arterial allograft (8-28%) studies, as well as mid-term reinfection. The highest 
in-hospital mortality was noted for VEI including nearly 50% of AEnF."
1418,"OBJECTIVES: The reverse fragility index (RFI) describes the number of event 
conversions needed to convert a statistically non-significant dichotomous 
outcome to significant. The objective of this study was to assess the RFI of 
vascular surgery randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing endovascular vs. 
open surgery in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), carotid 
artery stenosis (CAS), and peripheral artery disease (PAD).
METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase were searched for RCTs investigating AAA, CAS, or 
PAD with statistically non-significant binary primary outcomes. The primary 
outcome of this study was the median RFI. Calculation of the RFI was done by 
creating two-by-two contingency tables and subtracting events from the group 
with fewer events while adding non-events to the same group until a two-tailed 
Fisher exact test produced a statistically significant result (p≤0.05).
RESULTS: Of 4187 articles, 49 studies reporting 103 different primary endpoints 
were included. The overall median RFI was 7 (IQR 5, 13). The specific RFIs for 
AAA, CAS, and PAD were 10 (6-15.5), 6 (5-9.5), and 7 (5.5 -10) respectively. 42 
(47%) endpoints had a loss to follow-up greater than RFI, of which 10 (24%) were 
AAA trials, 23 (55%) CAS trials, and 9 (21%) PAD trials. Pearson correlation 
demonstrated a significant positive relationship between a study's RFI to the 
impact factor of its publishing journal (r=0.38 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.54], p<0.01), 
length of follow-up (r=0.43 [95% CI: 0.26 to 0.58], p<0.01), and sample size (r 
= 0.28, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.45, p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: A small number of events (median 7) were required to change the 
outcome of negative RCTs from statistically non-significant to significant with 
47% of studies missing data that could have reversed the finding of its primary 
outcome. Reporting of the RFI relative to the loss-to-follow-up may be of 
benefit in future trials and provide confidence towards the robustness of 
P-value."
1419,"Information about biotic interactions (e.g. competition, predation, parasitism, 
diseases, mutualism, allelopathy) is fundamental to better understand species 
distribution and abundance, ecosystem functioning, and ultimately guide 
conservation efforts. However, conservation planning often overlooks these 
important interactions. Here, we aim to demonstrate a new framework to include 
biotic interactions into Marxan. For that, we use freshwater mussels and fish 
interaction (as mussels rely on fishes to complete their life cycle) in the 
Douro River basin (Iberian Peninsula) as a case study. While doing that, we also 
test the importance of including biotic interactions into conservation planning 
exercises, by running spatial prioritisation analysis considering either: 1) 
only the target species (the freshwater mussels); 2) freshwater mussels and 
their obligatory hosts (freshwater fishes); 3) freshwater mussels, fishes and 
their interactions. With this framework we found that biotic interactions tend 
to be underrepresented when the data on both freshwater mussels and fishes is 
not simultaneously included in the spatial prioritisation. Overall, the priority 
areas selected across all scenarios are mostly located in the western part of 
the Douro River basin, where most freshwater mussels and fishes still occur. 
Given the low overlap of priority areas identified here and the current Natura 
2000 network, our approach may be useful for establishing (or enlarging) 
protected areas, especially in light of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. 
Also, this work may provide guidance for future habitat restoration and 
management of main threats to freshwater biodiversity."
1420,"BACKGROUND: Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) can enhance local tumor regression, 
but its survival benefits compared to intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT) 
followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) remain unclear.
METHODS: This is a secondary comparison between 607 patients treated with 
intensified 5-FU/Oxaliplatin neoadjuvant CRT and adjuvant CT within the 
experimental arm of the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 phase III trial, and 306 patients treated 
with TNT within the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 phase II trial. Comparison between 
clinical-pathological characteristics, surgical quality, and post-surgical 
complications were analyzed using the Pearson's Chi-squared or Mann-Whitney U 
test. Oncological outcome was examined with log-rank, Gray's test, and 
multivariate cox regression. In addition, further subgroup analyses and 
propensity score matching were performed to optimize the balance of baseline 
covariates. Findings Patients treated with CRT followed by consolidation CT had 
a significantly higher rate of pathological complete remission (pCR) compared to 
patients treated within the experimental arm of the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial (25.3% 
vs 17.3%, P=0.04). Post-surgical complications were less common in the 
CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial. After a median follow-up of 46 months, clinical outcome 
did not differ significantly in the overall cohort, in any subgroup or after 
propensity score matching. In multivariate analysis, disease-free survival (DFS) 
was similar between the experimental arm of the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial and 
treatments arms of the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial (vs arm A: HR 0.92 [95% CI 
0.62-1.37], P=0.69; vs arm B: HR 1.06 [95% CI 0.72-1.58], P=0.76). 
Interpretation Notwithstanding the limitations of intertrial comparison, TNT did 
not improve long term oncological outcome in our study compared to the 
intensified neoadjuvant CRT and adjuvant CT treatment in the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 
trial. Improved response rates after TNT offers an attractive option to explore 
organ preservation in selective patients with locally advanced rectal cancer."
1421,"Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBE) has been extensively used in the treatment of 
diseases due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory 
effects. In aquaculture, GBE is widely used as a feed additive, which is 
important to enhance the immunity of aquatic animals. The current study 
evaluated the effects of adding GBE to the diet of Penaeus vannamei (P. 
vannamei) under intensive aquaculture. The GBE0 (control group), GBE1, GBE2, and 
GBE4 groups were fed a commercial feed supplemented with 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 
g/kg GBE for 21 days, respectively. The results showed that dietary GBE could 
alleviate hepatopancreas tissue damage and improve the survival rate of shrimp, 
and dietary 2 g/kg GBE could significantly increase the total hemocyte count 
(THC), the hemocyanin content, the antioxidant gene's expression, and the 
activity of their encoded enzymes in P. vannamei. Furthermore, transcriptome 
data revealed that immunity-related genes were upregulated in the GBE2 group 
compared with the GBE0 group after 21 days of culture. Drug 
metabolism-cytochrome P450, sphingolipid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, 
glycerolipid metabolism, fat digestion and protein digestion and absorption 
pathways were significantly enriched, according to KEGG results. Surprisingly, 
all of the above KEGG-enriched pathways were significantly upregulated. These 
findings demonstrated that supplementing P. vannamei with 2 g/kg GBE improved 
its environmental adaptability by improving immunity, lipid metabolism, and 
detoxification. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of 
dietary GBE on the intensive aquaculture of P. vannamei was conducted to provide 
a reference for the healthy culture of P. vannamei."
1422,"Lysosomes are specialized organelles with an acidic pH that act as recycling 
hubs for intracellular and extracellular components. They harbour numerous 
different hydrolytic enzymes to degrade substrates like proteins, peptides, and 
glycolipids. Reduced catalytic activity of lysosomal enzymes can cause the 
accumulation of these substrates and loss of lysosomal integrity, resulting in 
lysosomal dysfunction and lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Post-mitotic 
cells, such as neurons, seem to be highly sensitive to damages induced by 
lysosomal dysfunction, thus LSDs often manifest with neurological symptoms. 
Interestingly, some LSDs and Parkinson's disease (PD) share common cellular 
pathomechanisms, suggesting convergence of aetiology of the two disease types. 
This is further underlined by genetic associations of several lysosomal genes 
involved in LSDs with PD. The increasing number of lysosome-associated genetic 
risk factors for PD makes it necessary to understand functions and interactions 
of lysosomal proteins/enzymes both in healthy and disease states, thereby 
holding the potential to identify new therapeutic targets. In this review, we 
highlight genetic and mechanistic interactions between the complex lysosomal 
network, LSDs and PD, and elaborate on methodical challenges in lysosomal 
research."
1423,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a surge of Same Day Discharge (SDD) for 
total joint arthroplasty. However, SDD may not be beneficial for all patients. 
Therefore, continued investigation into the safety of SDD is necessary, as well 
as risk stratification for improved patient outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined 31,851 elective SDD hip and 
knee arthroplasties from 2016 to 2020 in a large national database. Logistic 
regression models were used to identify patient variables and preoperative 
comorbidities that contribute to postoperative complication or readmission with 
SDD. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
calculated.
RESULTS: SDD increased from 1.4% in 2016 to 14.6% in 2020. SDD is associated 
with lower odds of readmission (AOR: 0.994, CI: 0.992-0.996) and postoperative 
complication (AOR: 0.998, CI: 0.997-1.000). Patients who have pre-operative 
dyspnea (AOR: 1.03, CI: 1.02-1.04, p < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD, AOR: 1.02, CI: 1.01-1.03, p = 0.002), and hypoalbuminemia (AOR: 
1.02, CI: 1.00-1.03, p < 0.001) had higher odds of postoperative complication. 
Patients who had pre-operative dyspnea (AOR: 1.02, CI: 1.01-1.03), hypertension 
(AOR: 1.01, CI: 1.01-1.03, p = 0.003), chronic corticosteroid use (AOR: 1.02, 
CI: 1.01-1.03, p < 0.001), bleeding disorder (AOR: 1.02; CI: 1.01-1.03, p < 
0.001), and hypoalbuminemia (AOR: 1.01, CI: 1.00-1.02, p = 0.038) had higher 
odds of readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: SDD is safe with certain comorbidities. Preoperative screening for 
cardiopulmonary comorbidities (e.g., dyspnea, hypertension, and COPD), chronic 
corticosteroid use, bleeding disorder, and hypoalbuminemia may improve SDD 
outcomes."
1424,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4/IL-5/IL-13 play an important 
role in pathogenesis of type 2 conditions, including asthma. Dupilumab, a human 
monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for IL-4/IL-13, 
inhibiting signaling. In phase 2b (P2B) (NCT01854047) and phase 3 VENTURE 
(NCT02528214), dupilumab reduced annualized severe exacerbations rates (AER), 
improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and was generally well 
tolerated in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe or 
oral-corticosteroid (OCS)-dependent severe asthma.
OBJECTIVE: Post-hoc assessment of dupilumab efficacy vs placebo in P2B and 
VENTURE in patients stratified by allergic status.
METHODS: Allergic asthma was defined as total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) ≥30 
IU/mL and ≥1 perennial aeroallergen-specific IgE ≥0.35 kU/L at baseline. AER, 
pre-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1, FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, asthma 
control (5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ-5]), health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL; Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ]), type 2 biomarkers, 
specific IgE, and OCS reduction (VENTURE only) were assessed.
RESULTS: In patients with allergic asthma, dupilumab (P2B: pooled 200/300mg; 
VENTURE: 300mg) every 2 weeks vs placebo reduced AER (P2B: -60%, P<.01; VENTURE: 
-72%, P<.001), and, in P2B, increased pre-BD FEV1 (P<.01) and FEV1/FVC (P<.05). 
In both studies, dupilumab significantly improved asthma control and HRQoL and 
reduced most type 2 biomarkers. Dupilumab significantly reduced OCS use in 
VENTURE. Similar benefits were observed in patients without evidence of allergic 
asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: Dupilumab significantly reduced AER and improved lung function and 
asthma control and HRQoL in patients with or without evidence of allergic 
asthma."
1425,"BACKGROUND: Comorbidities in severe asthma are common and contribute to disease 
burden. The severe asthma phenotype and treatment response can be impacted by 
comorbid conditions. Real-world data on the use of mepolizumab in severe 
eosinophilic asthma (SEA) in the presence of comorbidities is needed to inform 
clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of comorbid conditions on baseline 
phenotype in patients with SEA and assess the mepolizumab treatment effect by 
comorbidity status in SEA.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in the Australian Mepolizumab Registry (n=309) were 
classified into subgroups defined by the presence or absence of comorbidities, 
including nasal polyps, aspirin exacerbated airway disease, asthma-chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO), fungal sensitisation and 
obesity. Patient baseline characteristics were compared, and the impacts of 
comorbidity on phenotype, identified by differences in patient age and/or 
baseline biomarker levels and/or asthma severity, were assessed. The mepolizumab 
treatment effects on clinical and biological outcomes at 12 months were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Across comorbidity subgroups, mepolizumab reduced the rate of 
clinically significant exacerbations (range 47-77%), maintenance oral 
corticosteroid use (dose reduction 4.2-13.3 mg/day), and improved symptom 
control (Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 score 1.9-2.4 point reduction) and lung 
function (mean 3.4-9.3 post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory 
volume in 1s). Peripheral blood eosinophils were reduced (mean 480-780 
cells/μL). Comorbidities (nasal polyps, obesity, ACO and fungal sensitisation) 
modified the baseline phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Mepolizumab treatment is associated with comparable clinical 
improvements in in patients with SEA and comorbidities. Mepolizumab effectively 
minimizes the disease impact and corticosteroid burden in patients with SEA."
1426,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder 
characterised by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the 
nigrostriatal tract. The identification of disease-modifying therapies is the 
Holy Grail of PD research, but to date no drug has been approved as such a 
therapy. A possible reason is the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity of PD 
patients, which can generate confusion in the interpretation of results or even 
mask the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention. This heterogeneity should be 
taken into account in clinical trials, stratifying patients by their expected 
response to drugs designed to engage selected molecular targets. In this 
setting, stratification methods (clinical and genetic) should be supported by 
biochemical phenotyping of PD patients, in line with the deep phenotyping 
concept. Collection, from single patients, of a range of biological samples 
would streamline the generation of these profiles. Several studies have proposed 
biochemical characterisations of patient cohorts based on analysis of blood, 
cerebrospinal fluid, urine, stool, saliva and skin biopsy samples, with 
extracellular vesicles attracting increasing interest as a source of biomarkers. 
In this review we report and critically discuss major studies that used a 
biochemical approach to stratify their PD cohorts. The analyte most studied is 
α-synuclein, while other studies have focused on neurofilament light chain, 
lysosomal proteins, inflammasome-related proteins, LRRK2 and the urinary 
proteome. At present, stratification of PD patients, while promising, is still a 
nascent approach. Deep phenotyping of patients will allow clinical researchers 
to identify homogeneous subgroups for the investigation of tailored 
disease-modifying therapies, enhancing the chances of therapeutic success."
1427,"OBJECTIVES: Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy (DAT) for common 
infectious diseases may be an effective strategy to tackle antimicrobial 
resistance. Shorter DAT have been proven safe and effective for 
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), cellulitis, and cholangitis.
METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter quality-control study medical records of 
770 patients hospitalized with CAP, cellulitis and cholangitis at three tertiary 
care hospitals in Switzerland during 2017-2018 were randomly selected. 
Appropriateness of antibiotic treatment duration was assessed according to 
international and local guidelines.
RESULTS: Records of 271, 260 and 239 patients with CAP, cellulitis, and 
cholangitis were included, respectively. Median DAT was seven days (IQR 6-9), 
ten days (IQR 8-13) and nine days (IQR 6-13) in CAP, cellulitis and cholangitis, 
respectively. DAT longer than recommended by local and international guidelines 
was observed in in 32% and 37% of CAP patients, 23% and 70% of cellulitis 
patients, and 33% and 37% of cholangitis patients, respectively. Positive blood 
cultures [odds ratio (OR) 2.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-4.34)], 
infectious diseases consultation [OR 1.79 (95% CI 1.05-2.78)], impaired renal 
function [OR 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) per one ml/min/1.73m2 increase in estimated 
glomerular filtration rate] and a higher degree of inflammation on admission [OR 
1.0 (95% CI 1.001-1.005) per 10 mg/L increase in C-reactive protein] were 
independently associated with a DAT longer than recommended in international 
guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: DAT exceeded recommendations in a significant proportion of 
patients with mostly community-acquired infections."
1428,"Background / Objective: C-C-chemokine receptors (CCRs) are expressed on a 
variety of immune cells and play an important role in many immune processes, 
particularly leukocyte migration. Comprehensive preclinical research 
demonstrated CCR2/CCR5-dependent pathways as pivotal for the pathophysiology of 
severe COVID-19. Here we report human data on use of a chemokine receptor 
inhibitor in patients with COVID-19.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interim results of a 2:1 randomised, placebo-controlled, 
investigator-initiated trial on the CCR2/CCR5-inhibitor Cenicriviroc (CVC) 150 
mg BID orally for 28 days in hospitalised patients with moderate to severe 
COVID-19 are reported. The primary endpoint is the subject's responder status 
defined by achieving grade 1 or 2 on the 7-point ordinal scale of clinical 
improvement on day 15.
RESULTS: Of the 30 patients randomised, 18 were assigned to receive CVC and 12 
placebo. Efficient CCR2- and CCR5 inhibition was demonstrated through CCL2 and 
CCL4 elevation in CVC-treated patients (485% and 80% increase on day 3 compared 
to baseline, respectively). In the mITT population, 82.4% of patients (14/17) in 
the CVC group met the primary endpoint, as did 91.7% (11/12) in the 
placebo-group (OR 0.5, 95%, CI 0.04-3.41). One patient treated with CVC died of 
progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the remaining had a 
favourable outcome. Treatment with CVC was overall well tolerated, with most 
adverse events (AEs) being grade I or II and resolving spontaneously.
CONCLUSION: Our interim analysis provides proof-of-concept data on CVC for 
COVID-19 patients as intervention to inhibit CCR2/CCR5. Further studies are 
warranted to assess its clinical efficacy."

1430,"Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and leading cause 
of infant mortality, yet molecular mechanisms explaining CHD remain mostly 
unknown. Sequencing studies are identifying CHD candidate genes at a brisk rate 
including MINK1, a serine/threonine kinase. However, a plausible molecular 
mechanism connecting CHD and MINK1 is unknown. Here, we reveal that mink1 is 
required for proper heart development due to its role in left-right patterning. 
Mink1 regulates canonical Wnt signaling to define the cell fates of the Spemann 
Organizer and the Left-Right Organizer, a ciliated structure that breaks 
bilateral symmetry in the vertebrate embryo. To identify Mink1 targets, we 
applied an unbiased proteomics approach and identified the high mobility group 
architectural transcription factor, Hmga2. We report that Hmga2 is necessary and 
sufficient for regulating Spemann's Organizer. Indeed, we demonstrate that Hmga2 
can induce Spemann Organizer cell fates even when β-catenin, a critical effector 
of the Wnt signaling pathway, is depleted. In summary, we discover a 
transcription factor, Hmga2, downstream of Mink1 that is critical for the 
regulation of Spemann's Organizer, as well as the LRO, defining a plausible 
mechanism for CHD."
1431,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Underwater endoscopic mucosal resection (UEMR) is an 
alternative procedure to conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (CEMR) to 
treat large nonpedunculated colorectal polyps (LNPCL). In this multicenter 
randomized clinical trial, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of UEMR 
versus CEMR on LNPCL.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial from 
February 2018 to February 2020 in 11 hospitals in Spain. A total of 298 patients 
(311 lesions) were randomized to the UEMR (n=149) and CEMR (n=162) groups. The 
main outcome was the lesion recurrence rate in at least one follow-up 
colonoscopy. Secondary outcomes included technical aspects, en bloc resection 
rate, R0 and adverse events, among others.
RESULTS: There were no differences in the overall recurrence rate [9.5% UEMR vs. 
11.7% CEMR; absolute risk difference -2.2% (CI 95%: -9.4% to 4.9%)]. However, 
considering the polyp sizes between 20 and 30 mm, the recurrence rate was lower 
for UEMR [3.4% UEMR vs. 13.1% CEMR; absolute risk difference -9.7% (CI 95%: 
-19.4% to 0%)]. The R0 resection showed the same tendency, with significant 
differences favoring UEMR only for polyps between 20 and 30 mm. Overall, UEMR 
was faster and easier to perform than CEMR. Importantly, both techniques were 
equally safe.
CONCLUSIONS: UEMR is a valid alternative to CEMR of LNPCL and could be 
considered the first option of treatment for lesions between 20-30 mm due to its 
higher en bloc and R0 resection rates."
1432,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interventions for malignant small bowel obstruction (MSBO) 
may be limited by extent of peritoneal disease, rendering surgical or 
traditional endoscopic methods (i.e. luminal stenting or decompressive 
gastrostomy) unfeasible. We demonstrate the novel use of endoscopic ultrasound 
(EUS)-guided lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) for enterocolonic bypass in 
patients with MSBO who are deemed high risk for surgery.
METHODS: Across 3 tertiary US centers, a retrospective series of consecutive 
patients underwent attempt at EUS-guided enterocolostomy (EUS-EC) for palliation 
of acute SBO due to malignant causes. Technique and devices utilized were 
described, and patient demographics and outcome data were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 10 patients were included, of whom 9 (90.0%) were men, with 
median age 64.5 +/- 14.0 years, and 1.5 +/- 2.1 years post-diagnosis. Technical 
success was achieved in 8 of 10 patients (80.0%) and clinical success in 7 of 10 
(70.0%), with a single major adverse event (10.0%) of aspiration. Median time 
until resumption of oral intake was 1.0 day post-procedure (range 0-8 days), 
with interval to discharge home of 6.5 days, and survival 57.0 days.
CONCLUSIONS: EUS-EC is a new alternative for palliation of acute SBO due to 
advanced malignant disease when conservative measures fail and other surgical or 
endoscopic options are not possible. Additional larger studies with longer 
duration of follow-up are needed to further define efficacy and safety of this 
approach."
1433,"Blood-based biomarkers for amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau show good 
diagnostic accuracies and agreements with their corresponding CSF and 
neuroimaging biomarkers in the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration [A/T/(N)] framework 
for Alzheimer's disease. However, the blood-based neurodegeneration marker 
neurofilament light is not specific to Alzheimer's disease while total-tau shows 
lack of correlation with CSF total-tau. Recent studies suggest that blood 
total-tau originates principally from peripheral, non-brain sources. We sought 
to address this challenge by generating an anti-tau antibody that selectively 
binds brain-derived tau and avoids the peripherally expressed 'big tau' isoform. 
We applied this antibody to develop an ultrasensitive blood-based assay for 
brain-derived tau, and validated it in five independent cohorts (n = 609) 
including a blood-to-autopsy cohort, CSF biomarker-classified cohorts and memory 
clinic cohorts. In paired samples, serum and CSF brain-derived tau were 
significantly correlated (rho = 0.85, P < 0.0001), while serum and CSF total-tau 
were not (rho = 0.23, P = 0.3364). Blood-based brain-derived tau showed 
equivalent diagnostic performance as CSF total-tau and CSF brain-derived tau to 
separate biomarker-positive Alzheimer's disease participants from 
biomarker-negative controls. Furthermore, plasma brain-derived tau accurately 
distinguished autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative 
diseases (area under the curve = 86.4%) while neurofilament light did not (area 
under the curve = 54.3%). These performances were independent of the presence of 
concomitant pathologies. Plasma brain-derived tau (rho = 0.52-0.67, P = 0.003), 
but not neurofilament light (rho = -0.14-0.17, P = 0.501), was associated with 
global and regional amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts. These 
results were further verified in two memory clinic cohorts where serum 
brain-derived tau differentiated Alzheimer's disease from a range of other 
neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and 
atypical parkinsonian disorders (area under the curve up to 99.6%). Notably, 
plasma/serum brain-derived tau correlated with neurofilament light only in 
Alzheimer's disease but not in the other neurodegenerative diseases. Across 
cohorts, plasma/serum brain-derived tau was associated with CSF and plasma AT(N) 
biomarkers and cognitive function. Brain-derived tau is a new blood-based 
biomarker that outperforms plasma total-tau and, unlike neurofilament light, 
shows specificity to Alzheimer's disease-type neurodegeneration. Thus, 
brain-derived tau demonstrates potential to complete the AT(N) scheme in blood, 
and will be useful to evaluate Alzheimer's disease-dependent neurodegenerative 
processes for clinical and research purposes."
1434,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance is embedded 
in clinical IBD practice, a subset of patients still develops advanced neoplasia 
(AN; high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and/or CRC). We aimed to assess the impact of 
surveillance quality on AN risk in IBD.
METHODS: In this multi-center case-control study, we searched the Dutch 
nationwide pathology databank to identify IBD cases with AN, and controls with 
indefinite or low-grade dysplasia. The surveillance colonoscopy preceding the 
index lesion (first IND/LGD or AN) was used to assess the impact of surveillance 
quality. We assessed intervals, bowel preparation, cecal intubation and absence 
of inflammation as primary quality indicators. In addition, we assessed 
chromo-endoscopy, endoscopist expertise, hospital setting and biopsy strategy. 
Associations of quality indicators with AN risk were determined with 
multivariable logistic regression analyses with Firth's correction.
RESULTS: We included 137 cases and 138 controls. Delayed intervals (58.2% vs 
39.6%) and active inflammation (65.3% vs 41.8%) were frequently present in cases 
and controls and were associated with AN (delayed interval: adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR) 2.00, 95% CI 1.07-3.81, p=0.03; active inflammation: aOR 2.46, 95% CI 
1.33-4.61, p<0.01). Surveillance compliant with primary quality indicators was 
associated with a reduced AN risk (aOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, p=0.03), similar 
to chromo-endoscopy (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.89, p=0.01). Other indicators were 
not significantly associated with AN.
CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance compliant with primary quality indicators is 
associated with a reduced colitis-associated AN risk. Delayed surveillance 
intervals and active inflammation were associated with an increased AN risk. 
This underlines the importance of procedural quality, including endoscopic 
remission to optimize the effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance."
1435,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are no studies or recommendations on optimal monitoring 
strategies for patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Our objective was 
to develop guidance on how to monitor EoE patients in routine clinical practice, 
on the basis of available clinical evidence and expert opinion.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary, international group of EoE experts identified the 
following important three questions during several consensus meetings: why, by 
what means and when to monitor EoE patients. A steering committee was named and 
three teams were formed to review literature and to formulate statements for 
each topic. In a Delphi survey a level of agreement of ≥75% was defined as 
threshold value for acceptance. In a final conference, results were presented, 
critical points and comments on the statements were discussed and statements 
were rephrased/rewritten if necessary.
RESULTS: 18 EoE experts (14 adult and pediatric gastroenterologists, 2 
pathologists and 2 allergists) with a median of 21.7 years in clinical practice, 
mostly academic or university- based, completed the Delphi survey, which 
included 11 statements and a proposed algorithm for monitoring EoE patients. 
Each statement attained ≥75% agreement. Participants discussed and debated 
mostly about the statement concerning surveillance intervals for EoE patients 
with stable disease.
CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that effective maintenance treatment probably 
reduces the development of EoE complications, and regular, structured and under 
certain conditions individualized clinical follow-up is recommended to assess 
disease activity while opening a window to monitoring side-effects, adjusting 
therapy and encouraging adherence to treatment. Follow-up should comprise 
symptom assessment and periodic or repeated endoscopy with histological 
assessment in specific EoE settings."
1436,"BACKGROUND: Technological advances in analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal 
serum have allowed expanded prenatal screening possibilities for fetal 
aneuploidies. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the assay is 
partly dependent on the amount of cell-free DNA present in the maternal 
circulation. Thus, it is important to understand what fetal and maternal factors 
influence the level of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation. Maternal 
heparin use has been associated with an increase in non-reportable cell-free DNA 
results due to a low fetal fraction, in some, but not all, previous studies. In 
addition, there are likely additional factors that affect cell-free DNA that 
remain uncharacterized OBJECTIVE: To determine if heparins, low-dose aspirin, 
and maternal clinical factors affect the rate of non-reportable cell-free DNA 
testing results.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed using pregnant people 
receiving cell-free fetal DNA testing from Jan 1 2014 - Jun 30 2018. Data were 
collected on patient demographics, medical comorbidities, medication use, and 
cell-free DNA test results. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed 
to determine which factors were independently associated with the rate of 
non-reportable results.
RESULTS: From an original sample of 1,117 pregnant people, 743 met inclusion 
criteria. Maternal weight (OR 1.02), heparin use (OR 12.06), aspirin use (OR 
4.70), chronic hypertension (OR 5.26), pre-gestational diabetes (OR 2.46), and 
autoimmune disease (OR 3.59) were significantly associated with increased rate 
of non-reportable results in the univariate analysis. The association was also 
present for maternal weight (OR 1.02), heparin use (OR 21.87),and aspirin use 
(OR 2.85) in the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The previously seen association between maternal heparin use and an 
increase in non-reportable cell-free DNA results was confirmed. There also 
appears to be an increase in non-reportable results in pregnant people taking 
low dose aspirin, which has not been previously described. Providers should 
consider the impact of these medications when counseling patients on prenatal 
genetic screening options."
1437,"PURPOSE: Dignity is a basic human right that is related to psychological 
distress factors in patients with cancer such as depression and demoralization. 
Hence, the dignity issue is of great importance to healthcare professionals. The 
present study aimed to advise healthcare professionals regarding the related 
distress factors of dignity in patients with cancer by investigating its 
relationship with patients' demographics, disease characteristics, and 
psychological distress.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study design. A convenience sample of 267 
patients with cancer from a medical center were recruited into this study. Each 
patient completed demographics and disease characteristics questionnaires, the 
Patient Dignity Inventory Mandarin Version (PDI-MV), the Demoralization Scale 
Mandarin Version (DS-MV), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data 
were analyzed with SPSS 22.0 software.
RESULTS: Dignity was significantly correlated with age, demoralization and 
depression. Cancer patients aged 65 or above were more likely to have a lower 
sense of dignity. In the present study, the sensitivity and specificity of the 
Patient Dignity Inventory Mandarin Version for demoralization (DS-MV≥30) were 
84.8% and 79.1% and for depression (PHQ-9≥10) were 73.8% and 70.9% in cancer 
patients with an aggregate score of 35 or above.
CONCLUSIONS: Dignity is significantly correlated with personal demographic 
characteristics and psychological distress in patients with cancer. The results 
provide reference data for healthcare professionals to understand and enable 
dignity in patients with cancer and aid in the development of methods that 
promote their dignity."
1438,"BACKGROUND: There has been a revolution in the management of type B aortic 
dissection (TBAD) over the last two decades due to the increasing development of 
endovascular techniques, with the prime example being thoracic endovascular 
aortic repair (TEVAR). However, many controversies concerning the use of TEVAR 
in TBAD exist. For instance, there is little available evidence suggesting any 
differences in demographics, disease characteristics, intervention 
technicalities and clinical outcomes between males and females as well as 
different ethnicities when undergoing TEVAR for TBAD, both in the short and 
long-term. Also, there is no risk prediction model/tool available.
AIMS: The objective of this international study is to describe and delineate the 
disparities between male and female patients of different ethnicities in terms 
of demographics, disease and interventional characteristics, and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: Over 17 years a total of 58 TBAD patients were admitted to two tertiary 
vascular centres and treated using TEVAR. Mortality, post-operative 
complications and reintervention data were recorded for the first 30 days after 
the procedure as well as during follow-up. Follow-up for all patients lasted 
until the study endpoint or until a patient's death. Data was analysed 
retrospectively using IBM SPSS 26 for Windows.
RESULTS: Mean age was similar between the two groups, with the majority of 
patients in both being Caucasian. More than half of the males had complicated 
TBAD, whilst the majority of females were classed as having uncomplicated 
disease. The most commonly utilised proximal and distal landing zone for the 
TEVAR stent-graft was zone 2 and zone 4, respectively. The mean proximal stent 
diameter was significantly larger in males compared to females (p=0.004). The 
difference in mean distal diameter between the two groups was insignificant 
(p=0.721). The mean total stent coverage of the thoracic aorta was 251.3 mm in 
male patients compared to 291.2 mm in females (p=0.203). A total of 32 patients 
underwent adjunctive procedures. Seven (17%) of the males had one or more 
post-operative complications compared to 2 (12%) females. Nine (22%) males 
underwent a reintervention procedure post-TEVAR compared to only 1 (6%) female 
(p=0.136). Overall, males had a mortality rate of 24% (n=10) compared to 41% of 
females (n=7) (p=0.201). Estimated survival of males and females post-TEVAR was 
80.4 ± 9.6 months and 69.7 ± 14.4 months (p=0.428). For the total population, 
the number of stent-grafts was inversely correlated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Despite the favourable clinical outcomes achieved by TEVAR in TBAD, 
there remains a grey area concerning its management. Thus, it is important to 
perform risk stratification of individual patients using their demographics and 
comorbidities, particularly scrutinizing gender and ethnic origin when 
considering intervention for TBAD to achieve optimum results."
1439,"Leishmaniasis is an enigmatic disease that has very restricted options for 
chemotherapy and none for prophylaxis. As a result, deriving therapeutic 
principles for curing the disease has been a major objective in Leishmania 
research for a long time. Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that lives within 
macrophages by subverting or switching cell signaling to the pathways that 
ensure its intracellular survival. Therefore, three groups of molecules aimed at 
blocking or eliminating the parasite, at least, in principle, include blockers 
of macrophage receptor- Leishmania ligand interaction, macrophage-activating 
small molecules, peptides and cytokines, and signaling inhibitors or activators. 
Macrophages also act as an antigen-presenting cell, presenting antigen to the 
antigen-specific T cells to induce activation and differentiation of the 
effector T cell subsets that either execute or suppress anti-leishmanial 
functions. Three groups of therapeutic principles targeting this sphere of 
Leishmania-macrophage interaction include antibodies that block pro-leishmanial 
response of T cells, ligands that activate anti-leishmanial T cells and the 
antigens for therapeutic vaccines. Besides these, prophylactic vaccines have 
been in clinical trials but none has succeeded so far. Herein, we have attempted 
to encompass all these principles and compose a comprehensive review to analyze 
the feasibility and adoptability of different therapeutics for leishmaniasis."

1442,"OBJECTIVE: Establishing a prognostic model for endometrial cancer (EC), that 
individualizes risk and management plan per patient and disease characteristics.
METHODS: this is multicentre retrospective study conducted in 9 European 
gynaecologic cancer centres. Women with confirmed EC between January 2008 to 
December 2015 were included. Demographics, disease characteristics, management, 
and follow-up information were collected. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 and 5 years comprise the primary outcomes of 
the study. Machine learning algorithms were applied to patient and disease 
characteristics. Model I: pre-treatment model. Calculated probability was added 
to management variables (model II: treatment model), and the second calculated 
probability was added to perioperative and postoperative variables (model III).
RESULTS: Out of 1,150 women, 1,144 were eligible for 3-year survival analysis 
and 860 for 5-year survival analysis. Model I, II, and III accuracies of 
prediction of 5-year CSS were 84.88%/85.47% (in train and test sets), 
85.47%/84.88% and 87.35%/86.05%, respectively. Model I predicted 3-year CSS at 
an accuracy of 91.34%/87.02%. Accuracy of model I, II and III in predicting 
5-year DFS were 74.63%/76.72%, 77.03%/76.72%, and 80.61%/77.78%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Endometrial Cancer Individualised Scoring System (ECISS) is a novel 
machine learning tool assessing patient-specific survival probability with high 
accuracy."

1444,"Strongyloidiasis in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is poorly understood. There have been 
limited surveys describing the levels of endemicity in some regions of PNG, but 
in the Western Province, its occurrence and level of burden are unknown. This 
study aimed to determine the seroepidemiology of Strongyloides spp. 
seropositivity within a community located in the Balimo region of the Western 
Province. Plasma samples were collected from 120 adult participants and were 
subjected to anti-IgG Strongyloides spp. serological testing. Logistical 
regression analyses were performed to identify relationships between 
strongyloidiasis and attributes of sociodemography. In this cross-sectional 
cohort study, 22.5% (27/120; 95% CI: 15.9-30.8%) of participants were 
seropositive for strongyloidiasis. Participants with higher body mass indices 
were less likely to be seropositive for Strongyloides spp. infection (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.85, P value = 0.008), and in the multivariable analysis, increasing 
units of age (adjusted OR [aOR] = 0.93, P value = 0.048) and participants ≤ 40 
years old were associated with a decreased likelihood of Strongyloides spp. 
seropositivity (aOR = 0.07, P value = 0.034). The results from this study 
indicate that the occurrence of strongyloidiasis is high in the Western

V Prasad Eye Institute between May and August 2021. Diagnosed clinically and 
radiologically, 24 patients with ROM were included in the study. Deep nasal 
swabs or endoscopically collected nasal swabs or orbital tissues were submitted 
for microbiological evaluation and in vitro susceptibility testing by microbroth 
dilution for natamycin, amphotericin B, caspofungin, posaconazole, ketoconazole, 
and voriconazole. Cultures were processed by 28S ribosomal DNA polymerase chain 
reaction and molecular sequencing. A portion of orbital tissues was also sent 
for histopathological evaluation. The age of the patients ranged from 27 to 75 
(mean 48.58 ± 14.09) years and the majority (79%) were male. Nineteen patients 
were known to be diabetic prior to developing ROM and 18 patients had recovered 
from active COVID-19 infection. Thirteen patients had a history of 
hospitalization during COVID-19 infection and eight received steroids. Of the 24 
samples, microbiological evaluation identified Rhizopus arrhizus in 12, Rhizopus 
microsporus in 9, Lichtheimia ramosa in 2, and Rhizopus delemar in 1. Twelve 
isolates were tested for antifungal susceptibility and all were susceptible to 
natamycin and amphotericin B. The susceptibility to posaconazole was high, with 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) < 2 µg/mL for 10/12 (84%) isolates, 
whereas the MIC of other drugs varied. Histopathological examination of tissues 
showed acute fulminant disease, granuloma formation, and vascular invasion by 
the fungal pathogens in these specimens. Rhizopus arrhizus was predominantly 
associated with ROM and most isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B and 
posaconazole. Further studies are needed to corroborate the findings and explain 
possible underlying links."
1446,"Chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne alphavirus, causes acute febrile illness 
with polyarthralgia. Groups at risk for severe disease include neonates, people 
with underlying medical conditions, and those aged ≥ 65 years. Several 
chikungunya vaccines are in late clinical development with licensure expected in 
the United States during 2023. We administered a questionnaire to randomly 
selected households in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) to assess interest in a 
hypothetical chikungunya vaccine. Estimates were calibrated to age and sex of 
USVI population, and univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. Of 
966 participants, 520 (adjusted 56%, 95% CI = 51-60%) were interested in 
receiving the vaccine. Of 446 participants not interested in vaccination, 203 
(adjusted 47%, 95% CI = 41-52%) cited safety concerns as the reason. Educational 
efforts addressing vaccine safety concerns and risk factors for severe disease 
would likely improve vaccine acceptability and uptake among those most at risk."
1447,"Yaws is a chronic, highly contagious skin and bone infection caused by Treponema 
pallidum subspecies pertenue, usually affecting children in impoverished and 
remote communities. Yaws lesions have thick yellow crusts on pink papillomas 
that ulcerate and leave deep scars. Yaws cases were confirmed in the Liguasan 
Marsh, Mindanao Island group, Southern Philippines, in 2017, but there were no 
cases confirmed in the Luzon and Visayas Island groups. We aimed to detect at 
least one active or latent yaws case in the island groups of Luzon and Visayas. 
Active yaws surveillance was conducted by inviting healthcare providers to 
report yaws suspects. Five remote villages were included in the case detection 
surveys: three in Luzon and two in the Visayas Island groups. Two indigenous 
peoples communities were included: Aetas of Quezon and Dumagat/Remontados of 
Rizal provinces. Trained field personnel conducted free skin check-ups of 
children, household contacts, and community members. Yaws suspects underwent 
point-of-care serologic tests for T. pallidum and nontreponemal antibodies. A 
total of 239 participants were screened for skin diseases, and 103 had serologic 
tests. Only the Aetas of Quezon province, Luzon, had confirmed yaws cases. 
Nineteen cases (54.3%) were detected among 35 Aetas: five active yaws (four 
children, one adult), two latent yaws (adults), and 12 past yaws (1 child, 11 
adults). An 8-year-old boy had yaws with skeletal deformities. We report the 
first yaws cases among the Aetas of Quezon, Luzon Island group. Active yaws 
surveillance and case detection in remote areas and among indigenous peoples 
should continue."
1448,"West Nile virus (WNV) is prevalent in the United States but shows considerable 
variation in transmission intensity. The purpose of this study was to compare 
patterns of WNV seroprevalence in avian communities sampled in Atlanta, Georgia 
and Chicago, Illinois during a 12-year period (Atlanta 2010-2016; Chicago 
2005-2012) to reveal regional patterns of zoonotic activity of WNV. WNV 
antibodies were measured in wild bird sera using ELISA and serum neutralization 
methods, and seroprevalence among species, year, and location of sampling within 
each city were compared using binomial-distributed generalized linear 
mixed-effects models. Seroprevalence was highest in year-round and 
summer-resident species compared with migrants regardless of region; species 
explained more variance in seroprevalence within each city. Northern cardinals 
were the species most likely to test positive for WNV in each city, whereas all 
other species, on average, tested positive for WNV in proportion to their sample 
size. Despite similar patterns of seroprevalence among species, overall 
seroprevalence was higher in Atlanta (13.7%) than in Chicago (5%). Location and 
year of sampling had minor effects, with location explaining more variation in 
Atlanta and year explaining more variation in Chicago. Our findings highlight 
the nature and magnitude of regional differences in WNV urban ecology."
1449,"Nontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous environmental bacteria that 
frequently cause disease in persons with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). The risks for 
NTM infection vary geographically. Detection of high-risk areas is important for 
focusing prevention efforts. In this study, we apply five cluster detection 
methods to identify counties with high NTM infection risk. Four clusters were 
detected by at least three of the five methods, including twenty-five counties 
in five states. The geographic area and number of counties in each cluster 
depended upon the detection method used. Identifying these clusters supports 
future studies of environmental predictors of infection and will inform control 
and prevention efforts."
1450,"In 2018, a disease characterized by splenic hemorrhage and necrosis killed ducks 
in a duck farm in Guangxi province, China. A duck reovirus strain was isolated 
from the tissues of the dead ducks by inoculating duck embryos and BHK-21 cells. 
Electron microscopy of the cultured the isolate showed that the viral particles 
were nearly round in shape and approximately 70 nm in diameter, and they were 
designated DRV-GL18. Sequence analysis showed that the GL18 strain viral genome 
was 23,419 nt in length and had 10 dsRNA segments. Phylogenetic analysis of cDNA 
amplicons of segments encoding the protein σC which are outer capsid proteins 
showed that the isolate belongs to the branch of the epidemic strains of duck 
reovirus. The Recombination Detection Program (RDP) and SimPlot program analyses 
suggested potential genetic recombination events in the M2 segments. 
Pathogenicity experiments revealed that GL18 produced severe hemorrhaging in 
livers and necrosis in the spleen of infected SPF ducklings. A death rate of 50% 
in the experimental ducklings was calculated during the first 7 d, and the rest 
of the ducklings were observed to undergo spleen necrosis. These data suggested 
that GL18 is a duck reovirus isolate with severer pathogenicity, and it could be 
a candidate for development of vaccine. This is the first reported isolation of 
duck reovirus from mature ducks."
1451,"INTRODUCTION: Despite aggressive surgical care and systemic therapy, patients 
with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have a poor prognosis. Recent 
studies show that racial disparities in outcome also exist. We sought to 
investigate the association lymph node (LN) metastases had with survival between 
Black and White patients with PDAC after resection.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 226 PDAC patients who underwent resection at 
a single institution from 2010 to 2018 was performed with attention to LN 
metastasis and patient race. The number of patients who received chemotherapy 
was also evaluated.
RESULTS: One Hundred Seventy Five (77.4%) PDAC patients were White and 51 
(22.6%) were Black. 130 (59.3%) patients had LN metastasis (LN+). LN+ and LN- 
groups were similar in race (P = 0.93), sex (P = 0.10) and age at the time of 
diagnosis (P = 0.45). Patients with LN + disease were more likely to present 
with larger tumors (3.4 versus 2.8 cm, P = 0.02) and higher T status 
(P = 0.001). White and Black patients had similar rates of LN metastasis (59% 
versus 58.8%, P = 1.0). The median survival for LN- Black and White patients 
were similar (43.2 versus 30.2 mo, P = 0.82). LN + Black patients trended 
towards receiving more systemic therapy than White LN + patients (55% versus 
42%, P = 0.10). The median survival for LN + Black patients was significantly 
less than LN + White patients (17.5 versus 24.6 mo, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Black LN + PDAC patients have an inferior survival rate after 
resection when compared to their White counterparts. Our disparity in outcome 
cannot be solely explained by a difference in systemic treatment. Further 
investigation is warranted to determine racial differences in tumor biology or 
response to chemotherapy."
1452,"Childhood dementias are a group of over 100 rare and ultra-rare pediatric 
conditions that are clinically characterized by chronic global neurocognitive 
decline. This decline is associated with a progressive loss of skills and 
shortened life expectancy. With an estimated incidence of one in 2800 births and 
less than 5% of the conditions having disease-modifying therapies, the impact is 
profound for patients and their families. Traditional research, care, and 
advocacy efforts have focused on individual disorders, or groups classified by 
molecular pathogenesis, and this has established robust foundations for further 
progress and collaboration. This review describes the shared and 
disease-specific clinical changes contributing to childhood dementia and 
considers these as potential indicators of underlying pathophysiologic 
processes. Like adult neurodegenerative syndromes, the heterogeneous phenotypes 
extend beyond cognitive decline and may involve changes in eating, motor 
function, pain, sleep, and behavior, mediated by physiological changes in neural 
networks. Importantly, these physiological phenotypes are associated with 
significant carer stress, anxiety, and challenges in care. These phenotypes are 
also pertinent for the development of therapeutics and optimization of best 
practice management. A collective approach to childhood dementia is anticipated 
to identify relevant biomarkers of prognosis or therapeutic efficacy, streamline 
the path from preclinical studies to clinical trials, increase opportunities for 
the development of multiple therapeutics, and refine clinical care."
1453,"Aggregated α-synuclein, a major constituent of Lewy bodies plays a crucial role 
in the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies (SPs) such as Parkinson's disease 
(PD). PD is affected by the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, and 
recently both active and passive immunotherapies targeted against α-synuclein 
are being trialed as potential novel treatment strategies. Specifically, 
dendritic cell-based vaccines have shown to be an effective treatment for SPs in 
animal models. Here, we report on the development of adoptive cellular therapy 
(ACT) for SP and demonstrate that adoptive transfer of pre-activated T-cells 
generated from immunized mice can improve survival and behavior, reduce brain 
microstructural impairment via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and decrease 
α-synuclein pathology burden in a peripherally induced preclinical SP model 
(M83) when administered prior to disease onset. This study provides preclinical 
evidence for ACT as a potential immunotherapy for LBD, PD and other related SPs, 
and future work will provide necessary understanding of the mechanisms of its 
action."
1454,"BACKGROUND: The survival of children with congenital heart disease has increased 
substantially over the past decades, with 97% currently reaching adulthood. The 
total effect of advanced treatment on future mortality and morbidity in adult 
survivors with congenital heart disease (CHD) is less well described.
METHODS: We used data from the Swedish National Inpatient, Outpatient, and Cause 
of Death Register to identify patients with CHD who were born between 1950 and 
1999 and were alive at 18 years of age. Ten controls identified from the Total 
Population Register were matched for year of birth and sex and with each patient 
with CHD. Follow-up was from 1968 and 18 years of age until death or at the end 
of the study (2017). Survival percentage with 95% CI for all-cause mortality 
were performed with Kaplan-Meier survival function. Cox proportional hazard 
regression models with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI were used to estimate the 
risk of all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: We included 37 278 patients with adult CHD (ACHD) and 412 799 controls. 
Mean follow-up was 19.2 years (±13.6). Altogether, 1937 patients with ACHD 
(5.2%) and 6690 controls (1.6%) died, a death rate of 2.73 per 1000 person-years 
and 0.84 per 1000 person years, respectively. Mortality was 3.2 times higher 
(95% CI, 3.0-3.4; P<0.001) among patients with ACHD compared with matched 
controls. Up to the maximum of 50 years of follow-up, >75% of patients with ACHD 
were still alive. Mortality was highest among patients with conotruncal defects 
(HR, 10.13 [95% CI, 8.78-11.69]), but also significantly higher for the more 
benign lesions, with the lowest risk in patients with atrial septal defects (HR, 
1.36 [95% CI, 1.19-1.55]). At least 75% of patients with ACHD alive at 18 years 
of age lived past middle age and became sexagenerians.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large, nationwide, register-based cohort study of patients 
with ACHD surviving to 18 years of age, the risk of mortality up to 68 years of 
age was >3 times higher compared with matched controls without ACHD. Despite 
this, at least 75% of patients with CHD alive at 18 years of age lived past 
middle age and became sexagenerians. A notable risk decline in the mortality for 
patients with ACHD was noted for those born after 1975."
1455,"AIM: To clarify factors that support a policy change from pandemic to endemic 
status and to examine options for non-medical responses to reduce COVID-19 
transmission.
BACKGROUND: Critical factors to be considered in pandemic response decisions are 
not limited to medical options or public health orders, although these are 
important.
SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: All evidence drawn from publicly available sources is 
presented through the lens of the authors' nursing, management, education, 
policy and research experience.
DISCUSSION: As COVID-19 variants cause infections to surge nurses and other 
health practitioners, who are the de facto implementers of public and health 
policy, need to consider the evidence supporting a pandemic policy change to 
endemic status. Non-medical options for reducing transmission and variant 
mutations are needed to enable at-risk populations to avoid infection.
CONCLUSION: Public policy that shifts infection risks onto the general 
population requires close scrutiny of the evidence base for such decisions and 
warrants open debate and review. If people are to manage risks arising from 
policy decisions, they need access to non-medical virus detection options as 
well as access to effective medicines and treatment.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses have an extension to their advocacy 
role when policy changes about infectious disease status are declared. 
Evaluation of policy in terms of validity, equity and scientific basis is part 
of nursing's public responsibility. Policies that fail to reflect what is 
happening at the patient care level need to be questioned and modified where 
necessary. Only policies deemed 'good' policy by nurses should be implemented 
without challenge. Access to devices for environmental detection of the virus 
would enable real-time estimation of infection risks and inform individual 
decisions about the real risk of participating in work or other activities.
IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL POLICY: Policy decisions to transition from 
pandemic to endemic status must be evidence based. Clear messaging about risks 
and options assists policy implementation. Terminologies describing stages of 
infectious disease spread from 'outbreak, epidemic, endemic and pandemic' are 
not interchangeable, although they will expand and contract across the range in 
response to interventions such as public health safety measures (PHSM), 
quarantine, vaccinations, antivirals and fatalities that alter the case count in 
defined locations for those who avoid or survive an infection."
1456,"Recent work has challenged the classical, long-standing conceptualization of 
Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology as driven by amyloid-β plaques and 
hyperphosphorylated tau tangles, including the treatments thereby derived. This 
article highlights the importance of the lost synchronization of Nuclear factor 
kappa B (NF-κB) and yin yang 1 (YY1) induction of β-site amyloid precursor 
proteincleaving enzyme (BACE)1 induction and amyloid-β production with the 
melatonergic pathway. Emphasis is placed on the importance of released glia 
melatonin and autocrine effects in limiting the duration of amyloid-β production 
and paracrine melatonin's anti-inflammatory effects in neurons, including the 
suppression of hyperphosphorylated tau. Many of the broader bodies of data on 
dementia pathophysiology, including the role of the gut microbiome, gut 
permeability and inflammation, are intimately linked to the regulation of 
tryptophan's conversion to melatonin and the factors regulating this, including 
14-3-3 isoforms, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)2, acetyl-CoA, sirtuin-3 and 
circadian, pineal melatonin. The glia melatonergic pathway is intimately linked 
to mitochondrial function, from where most melatonin is derived, and provides an 
important hub to better link wider dementia pathophysiology as well as providing 
novel treatment targets, challenging the treatment limitations imposed by 
anti-amyloid antibody treatments. This also has relevance for wider 
neurodegenerative and neuro-psychiatric conditions."
1457,"Soft tissue sarcomas treated by extensive surgical resection and adjuvant 
radiation can lead to large tissue deficits that require free flap repair. 
Significant radiation can further compromise vessels necessitating novel 
therapeutic approaches. We describe an 82-year-old man who presented with a 
posterior thigh sarcoma and underwent wide local tumor resection and immediate 
reconstruction with a microvascular free flap. Due to radiated recipient 
vessels, this case required bovine patch angioplasty as a conduit for end to 
side anastomosis. Initial resection and pathology revealed a large 
myxofibrosarcoma. Wide local resection and radiotherapy resulted in a large 
irradiated soft tissue defect of 26 x 15 x 4 cm with exposed, radiation damaged 
neurovascular structures, and a lack of available regional flap options. The 
planned free flap, a 30 x 8 cm skin island from the left latissimus dorsi muscle 
with end-to-side anastomosis to the popliteal artery was complicated by 
friability of the vessel wall and insufficient perfusion. Given the extent of 
resection and radiation, there were no alternative recipient vessels present 
within the field. A bovine pericardial patch angioplasty of 2.5 cm in length was 
performed to the diseased popliteal vessel and an end to side anastomosis was 
successfully performed between the thoracodorsal artery and the patch. Improved 
reperfusion of the free flap was noted immediately following anastomosis 
indicating completion of the anastomosis of our complicated recipient vessel. 
During the uncomplicated postoperative course, the flap had good perfusion with 
Doppler signals present, and incision sites intact at discharge from acute 
hospitalization. Recurrent sarcomas that have undergone extensive resection and 
radiotherapy pose significant reconstructive challenges. For defects that 
require free tissue reconstruction when there are limited options for healthy, 
recipient vessels, bovine pericardial patch angioplasty may act as a robust 
conduit for diseased vessels."
1458,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma-measured tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) is 
a potential non-invasive biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated 
whether plasma p-tau217 predicts subsequent cognition and positron emission 
tomography (PET) markers of pathology in autosomal dominant AD.
METHODS: We analyzed baseline levels of plasma p-tau217 and its associations 
with amyloid PET, tau PET, and word list delayed recall measured 7.61 years 
later in non-demented age- and education-matched presenilin-1 E280A carriers 
(n = 24) and non-carrier (n = 20) family members.
RESULTS: Carriers had higher plasma p-tau217 levels than non-carriers. Baseline 
plasma p-tau217 was associated with subsequent amyloid and tau PET pathology 
levels and cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that plasma p-tau217 predicts subsequent brain 
pathological burden and memory performance in presenilin-1 E280A carriers. These 
results provide support for plasma p-tau217 as a minimally invasive diagnostic 
and prognostic biomarker for AD, with potential utility in clinical practice and 
trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Non-demented presenilin-1 E280A carriers have higher plasma tau 
phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) than do age-matched non-carriers. 
Higher baseline p-tau217 is associated with greater future amyloid positron 
emission tomography (PET) pathology burden. Higher baseline p-tau217 is 
associated with greater future tau PET pathology burden. Higher baseline 
p-tau217 is associated with worse future memory performance."
1459,"Dietary methionine restriction (MR) has been associated with multifaceted 
health-promoting effects. MR is conducive to prevention of several chronic 
diseases and cancer, and extension of lifespan. A growing number of studies on 
new phenotypes and mechanisms of MR have become available in the past five 
years, especially in angiogenesis, neurodegenerative diseases, intestinal 
microbiota, and intestinal barrier function. In this review, we summarize the 
characteristics and advantages of MR, and current knowledge on the physiological 
responses and effects of MR on chronic diseases and aging-associated 
pathologies. Potential mechanisms, in which hydrogen sulfide, fibroblast growth 
factor 21, gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids, and so on are involved, are 
discussed. Moreover, directions for epigenetics and gut microbiota in an MR diet 
are presented in future perspectives. This review comprehensively summarizes the 
novel roles and interpretations of the mechanisms underlying MR in the 
prevention of chronic diseases and aging."
1460,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current understanding of histone post-translational 
modifications (histone modifications) across immune cell types in patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during remission and flare is limited. The 
study aimed to quantify histone modifications at a single-cell resolution in IBD 
patients during remission and flare and how they differ compared to healthy 
controls.
METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 94 subjects (83 IBD patients and 
11 healthy controls). IBD patients had either UC (n=38) or CD (n=45) in clinical 
remission or flare. We used epigenetic profiling by time-of-flight (EpiTOF) to 
investigate changes in histone modifications within peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells from IBD patients.
RESULTS: We discovered substantial heterogeneity in histone modifications across 
multiple immune cell types in IBD patients. They had a higher proportion of less 
differentiated CD34 + hematopoietic progenitors, and a subset of CD56 bright NK 
cells and γδ T cells characterized by distinct histone modifications associated 
with the gene transcription. The subset of CD56 bright NK cells had increased 
several histone acetylations. An epigenetically defined subset of NK was 
associated with higher levels of CRP in peripheral blood. CD14+ monocytes from 
IBD patients had significantly decreased cleaved H3T22, suggesting they were 
epigenetically primed for macrophage differentiation.
CONCLUSION: We describe the first systems-level quantification of histone 
modifications across immune cells from IBD patients at a single-cell resolution 
revealing the increased epigenetic heterogeneity that is not possible with 
traditional ChIP-seq profiling. Our data open new directions in investigating 
the association between histone modifications and IBD pathology using other 
epigenomic tools."
1461,"BACKGROUND: An unmet need remains for improved management in perianal 
fistulising Crohn's disease (pCD). Recently, local administration of 
adipose-derived cells has shown promising results.
AIMS: To assess the safety and feasibility of injection of stromal vascular 
fraction (SVF) with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in patients with pCD.
METHODS: Patients ≥ 18 years with pCD were included and underwent fistula 
curettage, SVF with PRP injection, and closure of the internal opening. The 
primary endpoint was safety at 12 months. The secondary outcomes were complete 
radiological healing at 3 months (absence of fluid-containing tracts on MRI) and 
partial and complete clinical response at 3 and 12 months (closure of ≥1, 
respectively, all treated external opening(s)).
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included (35 [IQR 25-40] years; 14 [56%] 
female); median CD duration 4 [IQR 2-8] years. Twenty-four (95%) patients had 
previously undergone fistula surgery. No adverse events were encountered at 
lipoharvesting sites. Two (8%) patients were readmitted to hospital and six 
(24%) underwent unplanned re-interventions. Post-operative MRI (n = 24) showed 
complete radiological healing in nine (37.5%) patients. Partial clinical 
response was present in 48% (12/25) at 3 months and in 68% (17/25) at 12 months, 
and complete clinical closure in five (20%) patients at 3 months and in 10 (40%) 
patients at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: Injection with autologous SVF with PRP is feasible and safe in 
patients with treatment-refractory pCD. Early complete radiological healing was 
observed in more than one-third of patients, and clinical response in two-thirds 
of patients at 12 months."
1462,"The actions of the immune system are finely tuned, involving complex 
communication and coordination between diverse immune and non-immune cells 
across the tissues of the body. A healthy immune system requires a precise 
balance between immunity and tolerance. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have long 
been appreciated as one of the master regulators of this balance; their 
importance is underscored by the autoimmunity that develops in mice and humans 
when Tregs are missing or dysfunctional. In addition to the immunoregulatory 
roles of Tregs in suppressing autoimmunity and inflammation via control of 
adaptive and innate immune responses, several non-immune modulatory functions of 
Tregs have been identified in recent years. In this review, we have highlighted 
the growing literature on the action of Tregs in metabolism, stem cell 
maintenance, tissue repair, and angiogenesis. Alongside Tregs' immune 
suppressive role, these non-suppressive activities comprise a key function of 
Tregs in regulating health and disease. As Tregs receive increasing attention as 
therapeutic targets, understanding their non-canonical functions may become an 
important feature of Treg-directed interventions."
1463,"BACKGROUND: Today, in response to consumer demand and market trends, the 
development of new packaging with better performance such as intelligent 
packaging has become more important. This packaging system is able to perform 
intelligent functions to increase shelf life, increase safety and improve 
product quality.
OBJECTIVES: Recently, various types of packaging systems are available for meat 
products, especially cooked, fresh and processed meats. But because meat 
products are very perishable, monitoring their quality and safety in the supply 
chain is very important. This systematic article briefly reviews some of the 
recent data about the application of intelligent packaging in meat products.
METHODS: The search was conducted in Google Scholar, Science Direct, Elsevier, 
Springer, Scopus, and PubMed, from April 1996 to April 2021 using a different 
combination of the following keyword: intelligent packaging, and meat.
RESULTS: The results showed that the intelligent packaging presents several 
benefits compared to traditional packaging (e.g., antimicrobial, antioxidant, 
and shelf life extension) at the industrial processing level. Thus, these 
systems have been applied to improve the shelf life and textural properties of 
meat and meat products.
CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to control the number of intelligent compounds that 
are included in the packaging as they clearly influence the quality and 
nutritional properties as well as the final cost of the food products."
1464,"Pathogen effectors can suppress various plant immune responses, suggesting that 
they have multiple targets in the host. To understand the mechanisms underlying 
plasma membrane-associated and effector-mediated immunity, we performed 
Phytophthora capsici  RxLR cell death Inducer Suppressing Immune System (CRISIS) 
screening. In Nicotiana benthamiana, the cell death induced by the RxLR effector 
CRISIS2 is inhibited by the irreversible plasma membrane H +-ATPase (PMA) 
activator fusicoccin. Biochemical and gene silencing analyses revealed that 
CRISIS2 physically and functionally associates with PMAs and induces host cell 
death independent of immune receptors. CRISIS2 induces apoplastic alkalization 
by suppressing PMA activity via its association with the C-terminal regulatory 
domain of PMA. In planta expression of CRISIS2 significantly enhanced the 
virulence of P. capsici, whereas host-induced gene silencing of CRISIS2 
compromised disease symptom and biomass of P. capsici. Our study identified a 
novel RxLR effector playing multiple roles in the suppression of plant defense 
and induction of cell death to support the pathogen hemibiotrophic life cycle in 
the host plant."
1465,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a complication associated with the long-term use of 
tamoxifen for the treatment of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis in a dog.
CASE SUMMARY: A 2-year-old female spayed poodle cross was evaluated for a stump 
pyometra. The dog was diagnosed with sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis a year 
prior and was treated with tamoxifen, an oestrogen receptor antagonist, for 
treatment of the disease. The dog developed a swollen vulva with vulvar 
discharge and a stump pyometra was diagnosed on ultrasound. Hormonal testing was 
submitted to evaluate for an ovarian remnant and the dog underwent an 
exploratory laparotomy, where the uterine stump was removed. No ovarian remnant 
tissue was identified intra-operatively, and hormonal testing (anti-Müllerian 
hormone, progesterone, oestradiol) and histopathology were consistent with the 
absence of ovarian tissue. The tamoxifen was discontinued. The dog recovered 
uneventfully after surgery.
NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: This report describes a complication of 
treatment of a rarely described clinical disease. While most cases of stump 
pyometra involve ovarian remnant syndrome, this case report describes a stump 
pyometra in a dog without remnant tissue that was undergoing treatment with 
tamoxifen. Tamoxifen has been reported to cause pyometra in intact female dogs. 
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report to describe a stump 
pyometra in a spayed female dog, secondary to the use of tamoxifen."
1466,"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between impaired kidney function (KF), dementia, 
and brain pathologies remains unclear.
METHODS: A total of 1354 dementia- and kidney disease-free participants 
including 895 with normal and 459 with impaired KF were followed from 2002 until 
2020 (median [interquartile range]: 5 [2-9]) to detect incident dementia. KF was 
assessed at baseline and categorized as normal or impaired. Over the follow-up, 
453 participants died and underwent autopsies for neuropathological assessment.
RESULTS: Compared to those with normal KF, the hazard ratios (95% confidence 
intervals [CIs]) of those with impaired KF was 1.48 (1.15, 1.90)/1.44 (1.10, 
1.88) for dementia/Alzheimer's dementia. Furthermore, impaired KF was related to 
a significantly higher burden of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; odds 
ratio = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.17, 3.30), but not to other brain pathologies.
DISCUSSION: Impaired KF is associated with an increased risk of dementia and 
Alzheimer's dementia. CAA may underlie, in part, this association.
HIGHLIGHTS: Impaired kidney function (KF) was associated with higher dementia 
and Alzheimer's dementia risk. Impaired KF anticipated dementia and Alzheimer's 
dementia onset by more than 1.5 years. Impaired KF was significantly related to 
a higher burden of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) but not to other brain 
pathologies."
1467,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has indirect impacts on patients with chronic 
medical conditions, which may increase mortality risks for various non-COVID-19 
causes. This study updates excess death statistics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and Parkinson's disease (PD) up to 2022 and evaluates their demographic and 
spatial disparities in the USA.
METHODS: This is an ecological time-series analysis of AD and PD mortality in 
the USA from January 2018 to March 2022. Poisson log-linear regressions were 
utilised to fit the weekly death data. Excess deaths were calculated with the 
difference between the observed and expected deaths under a counterfactual 
scenario of pandemic absence.
RESULTS: From March 2020 to March 2022, we observed 41,115 and 10,328 excess 
deaths for AD and PD, respectively. The largest percentage increases in excess 
AD and PD deaths were found in the initial pandemic wave. For people aged 
≥85 years, excess mortalities of AD and PD (per million persons) were 3946.0 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 2954.3, 4892.3) and 624.3 (95% CI: 369.4, 862.5), 
which were about 23 and 9 times higher than those aged 55-84 years, 
respectively. Females had a three-time higher excess mortality of AD than males 
(182.6 vs. 67.7 per million persons). The non-Hispanic Black people experienced 
larger increases in AD or PD deaths (excess percentage: 31.8% for AD and 34.6% 
for PD) than the non-Hispanic White population (17.1% for AD and 14.7% for PD).
CONCLUSION: Under the continuing threats of COVID-19, efforts should be made to 
optimise health care capacity for patients with AD and PD."
1468,"BACKGROUND: Bintrafusp alfa is a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein 
composed of the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta receptor 
II (a TGF-β ""trap"") fused to a human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody 
blocking programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). We report the efficacy and 
safety in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that progressed 
following anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this expansion cohort of NCT02517398-a global, 
open-label, phase I trial-adults with advanced NSCLC that progressed following 
chemotherapy and was primary refractory or had acquired resistance to 
anti-PD-(L)1 treatment received intravenous bintrafusp alfa 1200 mg every 2 
weeks until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or trial withdrawal. 
The primary endpoint was best overall response (by Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors version 1.1 adjudicated by independent review committee); 
secondary endpoints included safety.
RESULTS: Eighty-three eligible patients (62 [74.7%] treated with ≥3 prior 
therapies) received bintrafusp alfa. Four patients (3 primary refractory, 1 
acquired resistant) had confirmed partial responses (objective response rate, 
4.8%; 95% CI, 1.3%-11.9%), and 9 had stable disease. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression 
was not associated with response. Nineteen patients (22.9%) experienced grade ≥3 
treatment-related adverse events, most commonly asthenia (3 [3.6%]) and fatigue, 
eczema, and pruritus (2 each [2.4%]). One patient had grade 4 amylase increased. 
One patient died during treatment for pneumonia before initiation of bintrafusp 
alfa.
CONCLUSION: Although the primary endpoint was not met, bintrafusp alfa showed 
some clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily 
pretreated NSCLC, including prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Tumor responses occurred 
irrespective of whether disease was primary refractory or had acquired 
resistance to prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy."
1469,"INTRODUCTION: Leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG) is a newly studied 
biomarker for inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether LRG 
can be used for evaluating transmural activity in patients with Crohn's disease 
(CD).
METHODS: We performed magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in 227 consecutive 
patients with CD from June 2020 to August 2021. We prospectively compared MRE 
findings with clinical and laboratory data including LRG. MRE was evaluated 
using 2 validated scoring systems, and transmural inflammation was defined as 
having a maximum simplified magnetic resonance index of activity (sMaRIA) score 
of ≥4 and a 5-point classification score of ≥9, respectively.
RESULTS: The correlation between LRG and the total MRE score showed a positive 
correlation (r = 0.576 for the sMaRIA score, P < 0.01, and r = 0.633 for the 
5-point score, P < 0.01). Serum concentrations of LRG significantly increased as 
MRE scores increased (P < 0.01). The area under the curve of LRG for a sMaRIA 
score of ≥4 and a 5-point score of ≥9 was 0.845 and 0.869, respectively, which 
was significantly higher than that of CDAI (P < 0.01) or C-reactive protein (P < 
0.01). LRG levels of ≥14 μg/mL had a 67% sensitivity and 90% specificity for a 
sMaRIA score of ≥4 and a 73% sensitivity and 89% specificity for a 5-point score 
of ≥9. Patients with high LRG levels were also strongly associated with 
CD-related hospitalization, surgery, and clinical relapse compared with those 
with low LRG levels (P < 0.01 for all).
DISCUSSION: LRG is a highly accurate serum biomarker for detecting transmural 
activity in patients with CD. Results need to be validated in further 
multicenter studies."
1470,"Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are functionally poised, tissue-resident 
lymphocytes that respond rapidly to damage and infection at mucosal barrier 
sites. ILC2 reside within complex microenvironments where they are subject to 
cues from both the diet and invading pathogens-including helminths. Emerging 
evidence suggests ILC2 are acutely sensitive not only to canonical activating 
signals but also perturbations in nutrient availability. In the context of 
helminth infection, we identify amino acid availability as a nutritional cue in 
regulating ILC2 responses. ILC2 are found to be uniquely preprimed to import 
amino acids via the large neutral amino acid transporters Slc7a5 and Slc7a8. 
Cell-intrinsic deletion of these transporters individually impaired ILC2 
expansion, while concurrent loss of both transporters markedly impaired the 
proliferative and cytokine-producing capacity of ILC2. Mechanistically, amino 
acid uptake determined the magnitude of ILC2 responses in part via tuning of 
mTOR. These findings implicate essential amino acids as a metabolic requisite 
for optimal ILC2 responses within mucosal barrier tissues."
1471,"INTRODUCTION: Splenogonadal fusion is a rare congenital anomaly. The aim of this 
study was to report a case of splenogonadal fusion mimicking a spermatic cord 
cyst, and discuss therapeutic management of this rare congenital malformation.
OBSERVATION: An eight-years old patient was presented with an asymptomatic 
three-centimeter oval scrotal mass mistaken for a spermatic cord cyst. Surgical 
exploration has revealed tow purple-red, firm encapsulated masses. The first 
mass was two cm long and adherent to the upper pole of the left testis with a 
cleavage plane. The second mass was four cm long, attached to the first by a 
fibrous cord and drawn on its superior pole by a serpiginous vascular structure 
that extended inside the abdomen. The spermatic cord was individualized. 
Extemporaneous anatomopathological examination of the first mass, totally 
excised, has concluded to benign lesion. Therefore, the peritoneum was opened, 
and the superior mass was excised as high as it could be reached without 
orchiectomy. Definitive Anatomopathological examination concluded to an ectopic 
splenic tissue. The final diagnosis was a continuous splenogonadal fusion.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the clinical characteristics of this condition, 
with a special focus on the signs and findings that might help prevent 
unnecessary orchiectomy. Consequently, it is essential to include this 
malformation in the differential diagnosis of scrotal masses in children."
1472,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19(coronavirus-19 disease) pandemic, health care 
workers (HCWs) faced the risk of infection and distressing work to meet health 
requirements. The aim of the present stud ywas to evaluate perceptions of HCWs 
of their security at work in COVID-19 units and their coping strategies, at the 
military hospital of Tunis, during the second wave of COVID-19.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted via an auto-questionnaire on 
February 2021.HCWs of the military hospital of Tunis were included. Participants 
were asked about their perceived security at work in COVID-19 units and their 
coping behaviors. Mental disorders were assessed, via qualitative 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: A total of 110 HCWs' responses were collected. Fifty-eight participants 
(52.7%) were females. The mean age was 33.7 years (SD 9.3). They were doctors at 
45.5% and nurses at 39.1%. HCWs declared having worked in COVID-19 units in 
81.8% of cases. The participants reported their fears about being infected in 
58.2% and infecting family members in 85.5% of cases. Protective factors 
included information about the disease (80%), availability of personal 
protective equipment (PPE) (80.9%), support from colleagues(72.7%)or superiors 
at work (50.9%), and ability to communicate with others (63.6%). Depression, 
anxiety, and insomnia were found in respectively 25.5%, 30%, and 41.8% of HCWs. 
In multivariate analysis, suffering from a traumatic distress was significantly 
associated with anxiety and depression (p (p<0.01 and, p<0.05 respectively). In 
addition, insomnia severity was linked to age (p=0.05) and having colleagues 
infected with COVID-19 (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: In the present study, HCWs of the military hospital of Tunis stated 
having high levels of insomnia, anxiety, and depression since the early outbreak 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. These mental disorders may have a negative impact on 
the quality of life of HCWs and should be enhanced by psychological support and 
preventive measures."

importantes. Bien que cette maladie peut impliquer divers organes, y compris 
l’os, la peau et les ganglions lymphatiques. L’atteinte multi systémique de 
L’Histiocytose Langerhansienne est rare chez l’adulte. Présentation du cas: Nous 
rapportons le cas d'un homme de 31 ans atteint d’Histiocytose Langerhansienne 
touchant l’os et les poumons. La présentation radio clinique initiale était 
plutôt en faveur d'une tuberculose pulmonaire. A travers cette observation nous 
attirons l'attention sur cette pathologie rare et nous discuterons les critères 
diagnostiques et les principes de prise en charge thérapeutique. Conclusion: 
Bien qu'il est parfois difficile de distinguer l’Histiocytose Langerhansienne 
d'autres maladies, un bilan de dissémination pourrait être utile pour le 
diagnostic différentiel. Puisque cette cette maladie n’est pas un néoplasie, une

1474,"Introduction: Les comorbidités organiques du syndrome d'apnées obstructives du 
sommeil (OSA) ont été largement étudiées. Cependant, les troubles psychiatriques 
n'ont pas sollicité autant d'attention. Objectif : Déterminer la prévalence et 
les facteurs prédictifs de dépression et d'anxiété chez les patients apnéiques. 
L'objectif secondaire était d'étudier l'association entre la sévérité du OSA et 
ces troubles psychiatriques. Méthodes : Une étude transversale incluant 80 
apnéiques non traités sans antécédents de maladie mentale a été menée. Les 
questions de l’échelle HAD de la dépression (HAD-D) et d’anxiété (HAD-A) ont été 
posées. Le diagnostic de dépression et d’anxiété était retenu pour des scores 
HAD-D et HAD-A ≥ 8. Résultats : Quatre-vingts patients ont été inclus (âge moyen 
: 54,83 ± 13,12 ans ; femmes : 52 (65 %) ; indice de masse corporelle (IMC) 
moyen : 34,7 ± 6,14 kg/m2). La prévalence de la dépression et de l'anxiété était 
respectivement de 35% et 43,8%. Les patients apnéiques dépressifs et anxieux 
avaient plus de troubles de la libido (p = 0,011, p = 0,0007; respectivement), 
d'anhédonie (p = 10-4, p = 10-4 ; respectivement) et d'idées suicidaires (p = 
0,002, p = 0,019 ; respectivement). De plus, les patients apnéiques déprimés 
avaient une condition socio-économique plus basse (p = 0,019), plus de 
coronaropathie (p = 0,019) et moins de troubles cognitifs (p = 0,005). Les 
facteurs prédictifs de la dépression et de l’anxiété étaient le sexe féminin (p 
= 0,035, p = 0,004 respectivement) et les trouble de la libido (p = 0,040, p = 
0,02 respectivement). L'anhédonie (p = 10-4) et les coronaropathies (p = 0,010) 
ont été également identifiés comme facteurs prédictifs de la dépression. 
Conclusion  : Les prévalences élevées de la dépression et de l’anxiété chez les 
patients apnéiques témoignent de l’importance du volet psychiatrique dans la 
prise en charge de cette pathologie. Une collaboration entre pneumologues et 
psychiatres s’avère nécessaire afin d’améliorer la qualité de vie de ces 
malades."
1475,"AIM: Describe the epidemiological characteristics of occupational diseases (OD) 
recognized by the Central Medical Commission (CMC) of the first ministry during 
the period from 2012 to 2019.
METHODS: It was a descriptive and retrospective study covering all cases of 
diseases declared and recognized as occupational diseases by the CMC of the 
first ministry in the public sector and their repair during the period from the 
first of January 2012 to December 31, 2019.
RESULTS: During the study period, 294 OD were declared, of which, 213 were 
recognized by the CMC (72.4%). The average age of the population was 45.8 ± 10.9 
years. A female predominance was noted (61%). Most employees (56%) were part of 
the health sector. Tuberculosis was the most common occupational disease 
(21.1%). Cancers were present in 5.6% of cases. In this series, 99 workers had a 
temporary total disability (TTD) (46.5%). A partial permanent disability rate 
(PPD) was attributed to 20 victims of OD (9.4%) with an average rate of 29% and 
extremes ranging from 8% to 70%.
CONCLUSION: The OD recognized in the public sector seemed to be low. This 
encourages better information for workers on occupational risks and better 
awareness of attending physicians to report the professional nature of PD."
1476,"PURPOSE: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled precise 
three-dimensional analysis of individual muscles on computed tomography (CT) or 
magnetic resonance images via automatic segmentation. This study aimed to 
perform three-dimensional assessments of pelvic and thigh muscle atrophy and 
fatty degeneration in patients with unilateral hip osteoarthritis using CT and 
to evaluate the correlation with health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
METHODS: The study included one man and 43 women. Six muscle groups were 
segmented, and the muscle atrophy ratio was calculated volumetrically. The 
degree of fatty degeneration was defined as the difference between the mean CT 
values (Hounsfield units [HU]) of the healthy and affected sides. HRQoL was 
evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
(WOMAC) index and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Hip Disease Evaluation 
Questionnaire (JHEQ).
RESULTS: The mean muscle atrophy rate was 16.3%, and the mean degree of muscle 
fatty degeneration was 7.9 HU. Multivariate correlation analysis revealed that 
the WOMAC stiffness subscale was significantly related to fatty degeneration of 
the hamstrings, the WOMAC physical function subscale was significantly related 
to fatty degeneration of the iliopsoas muscle, and the JHEQ movement subscale 
was significantly related to fatty degeneration of the hip adductors.
CONCLUSION: We found that fatty degeneration of the hamstrings, iliopsoas, and 
hip adductor muscles was significantly related to HRQoL in patients with hip 
osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that these muscles should be targeted 
during conservative rehabilitation for HOA and perioperative rehabilitation for 
THA."
1477,"Brain size abnormality is correlated with an increased frequency of autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Genetic analysis indicates that 
heterozygous mutations of the WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) are associated with 
ASD. However, biological evidence is still lacking. Our study showed that Wdr62 
knockout (KO) led to reduced brain size with impaired learning and memory, as 
well as ASD-like behaviors in mice. Interestingly, Wdr62 Nex-cKO mice (depletion 
of WDR62 in differentiated neurons) had a largely normal brain size but with 
aberrant social interactions and repetitive behaviors. WDR62 regulated dendritic 
spinogenesis and excitatory synaptic transmission in cortical pyramidal neurons. 
Finally, we revealed that retinoic acid gavages significantly alleviated 
ASD-like behaviors in mice with WDR62 haploinsufficiency, probably by 
complementing the expression of ASD and synapse-related genes. Our findings 
provide a new perspective on the relationship between the microcephaly gene 
WDR62 and ASD etiology that will benefit clinical diagnosis and intervention of 
ASD."
1478,"Accurate and efficient methods for identifying and tracking each animal in a 
group are needed to study complex behaviors and social interactions. Traditional 
tracking methods (e.g., marking each animal with dye or surgically implanting 
microchips) can be invasive and may have an impact on the social behavior being 
measured. To overcome these shortcomings, video-based methods for tracking 
unmarked animals, such as fruit flies and zebrafish, have been developed. 
However, tracking individual mice in a group remains a challenging problem 
because of their flexible body and complicated interaction patterns. In this 
study, we report the development of a multi-object tracker for mice that uses 
the Faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) deep learning 
algorithm with geometric transformations in combination with 
multi-camera/multi-image fusion technology. The system successfully tracked 
every individual in groups of unmarked mice and was applied to investigate 
chasing behavior. The proposed system constitutes a step forward in the 
noninvasive tracking of individual mice engaged in social behavior."
1479,"Urinary system stones have a complex pathophysiology affected by environmental 
and genetic factors. To confirm whether ALPL gene polymorphisms are an effective 
universal risk factor for the development of urolithiasis, we aimed to 
investigate ALPL gene polymorphism in Turkish population. Our study was carried 
out with 187 patients with urolithiasis and 92 healthy volunteers (control 
group) who were not diagnosed with urolithiasis either in themselves or in their 
families, applied to Emergency Medicine Clinic of Health Sciences University 
Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey between 
November 2021 and February 2022, prospectively. In order to evaluate the 
relationship between ALP gene (rs1256328) polymorphism and urolithiasis, blood 
samples were analyzed by quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) method.  Male gender 
(OR:3.785; 95% CI:2.118-6.763; p<0.001), increased BUN level (OR:1.082; 95% 
CI:1.013-1.156; p=0.019), increased NLR level (OR:1.149; 95 %CI:1.033-1.277; 
p=0.011) and heterozygous genotype (OR:2.353; 95% CI:1.31-4.225; p=0.004) were 
determined as independent risk factors for the development of urolithiasis. The 
presence of heterozygous (CT) genotype in the ALPL rs1256328 gene region in the 
Turkish population is associated with an increased risk of urolithiasis. This 
suggests that ALPL rs1256328 gene polymorphism can be used as a genetic marker 
in the Turkish population."
1480,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported many cases of Trichinella spiralis 
(T. spiralis) infection in normal skeletal muscle but there is little research 
on T. spiralis infection in abnormal muscle tissue.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the effect of T. spiralis infection on muscular 
dystrophy, this study compared aspects of infection between normal (C57BL/10) 
and dystrophin-deficient Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mdx mice.
METHOD: Infection rate was found to be lower in mdx mice than in C57BL/10 mice 
at early stages of infection; however, infection and inflammation in mdx mice 
persisted at later stages of infection while the infection rate and inflammation 
in C57BL/10 mice decreased gradually. The inflammation area was proportional to 
the degree of infection in both groups. Muscle strength was measured by the time 
of latency to fall in the wire-hanging test. Hanging time was shorter in the 
infected group than in the uninfected group in both C57BL/10 and mdx mice.
RESULTS: Muscle strength was also reduced in mdx mice compared with C57BL/10 
mice in both the un-infected and infected groups. The muscle intracellular 
cytokines TGF-β and IL-6 were continuously expressed from early stage to 
late-stage infection. IL-10 was strongly expressed at the early stage of 
infection but decreased as the infection progressed. TNF-α expression remained 
stable from early to late-stage infection in mdx mice, while TNF-α was elevated 
only during early-stage infection in C57BL/10 mice. The degree of muscle damage 
was significantly higher in mdx mice than in C57BL/10 mice because of the high 
level of serum creatine kinase (CK).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that mdx mice continued in infection and 
inflammation until the late stages of disease, which was in contrast to the 
C57BL/10 mice that recovered to some extent in the late stage of infection. In 
addition, that dystrophin-deficient mice are not suitable for T. spiralis 
infection compared to normal mice, and the degree of inflammation may be worse 
in mdx mice."
1481,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a severe form of 
alcoholic hepatitis (SAH). We aimed to study the natural course, response to 
corticosteroids (CS), and the role of the Asian Pacific Association for the 
Study of Liver (APASL) research consortium (AARC) score in determining clinical 
outcomes in AH patients.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data from the AARC database were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 1249 AH patients, (aged 43.8 ± 10.6 years, 96.9% male, AARC 
score 9.2 ± 1.9), 38.8% died on a 90 day follow-up. Of these, 150 (12.0%) had 
mild-moderate AH (MAH), 65 (5.2%) had SAH and 1034 (82.8%) had ACLF. Two hundred 
and eleven (16.9%) patients received CS, of which 101 (47.87%) were steroid 
responders by day 7 of Lille's model, which was associated with improved 
survival [Hazard ratio (HR) 0.15, 95% CI 0.12-0.19]. AARC-ACLF grade 3 [OR 0.28, 
0.14-0.55] was an independent predictor of steroid non-response and mortality 
[HR 3.29, 2.63-4.11]. Complications increased with degree of liver failure [AARC 
grade III vs. II vs I], bacterial infections [48.6% vs. 37% vs. 34.7%; 
p < 0.001); extrahepatic organ failure [66.9% vs. 41.8% vs. 35.4%; p < 0.001] 
respectively. The AARC score better discriminated 90-day mortality. Harrell's 
C-index was 0.72 compared to other scores.
CONCLUSION: Nearly 4 of 5 patients with AH present with ACLF. Such patients have 
a higher risk of infections, organ failures, lower response to CS, and higher 
mortality. Patients with AH and ACLF with AARC grade 3 should be considered for 
an early liver transplant."
1482,"Breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common consequence of oncological 
treatment. Its management is a complicated, chronic, and arduous process. 
Therapeutic options can be divided on non-surgical and surgical methods, 
although there is still no clear consensus about their effectiveness in 
preventing or stopping the disease. That brings problems in everyday practice, 
as there are no guidelines about proper time for starting therapy and no 
agreement about which management will be beneficial for each patient. The aim of 
this review is to summarize current knowledge about possible treatment choices, 
non-surgical so as surgical, indicate knowledge gaps, and try to direct pathways 
for future studies."
1483,"BACKGROUND: Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB) has important 
morbidity and mortality. Predicting high-risk patients for mortality and 
rebleeding is necessary for a treatment plan. In the present study, we aimed to 
define the epidemiological and etiological characteristics of patients 
presenting with nonvariceal UGB and to observe mortality and morbidity rates. We 
also aimed to compare Rockall and Glasgow-Blatchford scoring systems in 
predicting rebleeding and mortality.
METHODS: Subjects presenting with nonvariceal UGB over a 3-year period were 
included. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, and signs on physical 
examination, laboratory data, endoscopic signs and diagnosis, interventions 
during hospitalization and follow-up period were recorded. Glasgow-Blatchford 
and Rockall scores were calculated for every participant at the first day of the 
admission.
RESULTS: A total of 709 patients were enrolled in the study. A total of 490 of 
them (69.1%) were men. The mean age of the women and men was 60.7±1.2 and 58.6± 
0.7 years, respectively. Melena was the most common presenting symptom. Duodenal 
ulcer (31%), gastric ulcer (20.7%), and erosive disease (17.6%) were the most 
common causes of bleeding. History of use of aspirin and/or nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug use were present in 63.7% of the subjects. All patients 
were followed up for 30th-day mortality. Overall, rebleeding and mortality rates 
were 11% and 7%, respectively. A Rockall score greater than 6 was the most 
important predictor of mortality (odds ratio:39.1) and rebleeding (odds 
ratio:4.7).
CONCLUSION: Nonvariceal UGB patients with a Rockall score greater than 6 should 
undergo aggressive endoscopic treatment and inpatient care."
1484,"BACKGROUND: Obese individuals are often underrepresented in clinical trials, 
leading to a lack of dosing guidance.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate which physiological parameters and 
drug properties determine drug disposition changes in obese using our 
physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) framework, informed with obese 
population characteristics.
METHODS: Simulations were performed for ten drugs with clinical data in obese 
(i.e., midazolam, triazolam, caffeine, chlorzoxazone, acetaminophen, lorazepam, 
propranolol, amikacin, tobramycin, and glimepiride). PBPK drug models were 
developed and verified first against clinical data in non-obese (body mass index 
(BMI) ≤ 30 kg/m2) and subsequently in obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) without changing 
any drug parameters. Additionally, the PBPK model was used to study the effect 
of obesity on the pharmacokinetic parameters by simulating drug disposition 
across BMI, starting from 20 up to 60 kg/m2.
RESULTS: Predicted pharmacokinetic parameters were within 1.25-fold (71.5%), 
1.5-fold (21.5%) and twofold (7%) of clinical data. On average, clearance 
increased by 1.6% per BMI unit up to 64% for a BMI of 60 kg/m2, which was 
explained by the increased hepatic and renal blood flows. Volume of distribution 
increased for all drugs up to threefold for a BMI of 60 kg/m2; this change was 
driven by pKa for ionized drugs and logP for neutral and unionized drugs. Cmax 
decreased similarly across all drugs while tmax remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION: Both physiological changes and drug properties impact drug 
pharmacokinetics in obese subjects. Clearance increases due to enhanced hepatic 
and renal blood flows. Volume of distribution is higher for all drugs, with 
differences among drugs depending on their pKa/logP."

METHODS: Population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response analyses were 
performed to characterize upadacitinib pharmacokinetics in UC patients and 
evaluate the relationships between plasma exposures and key efficacy or safety 
endpoints at the end of 8-week induction and 52-week maintenance periods. Data 
from 1234 UC patients from Phase 2 and 3 induction trials and 449 UC patients 
from a Phase 3 maintenance trial were used for these analyses. Additionally, 
data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, Crohn's 
disease, and healthy volunteers were used in the pharmacokinetics analysis. 
Quartile plots and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the 
exposure-response relationships across upadacitinib doses of 7.5-45 mg once 
daily (QD) for induction and 15-30 mg QD for maintenance.
RESULTS: Upadacitinib plasma exposures were dose-proportional in UC patients 
across the evaluated dose range. Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics in UC were 
consistent between the induction and maintenance periods, and with other patient 
populations. Upadacitinib plasma exposures associated with the 45 mg QD 
induction dose maximized efficacy for Week 8 clinical and endoscopic endpoints. 
Plasma exposures associated with upadacitinib 30 mg maintenance dose provided 
additional incremental benefit compared to 15 mg QD for Week 52 key clinical and 
endoscopic endpoints. No trends were observed in the evaluated safety events 
with increasing plasma exposures at the end of induction or maintenance periods.
CONCLUSION: These analyses supported selection of upadacitinib UC induction and 
maintenance doses.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Data from studies NCT02819635 and NCT03653026 were included 
in these analyses."
1486,"Energy generation from coal poses an environmental drawback due to the abundance 
of some potential hazardous elements (PHEs). A few PHEs (As, Sb, Cu, Mn and Zn) 
are noticed in the coal collected from thermal power plants of India. Among 
them, As and Sb are depleted while Cu, Mn and Zn are enriched in fly and bottom 
ash. The short- and long-term exposure of these PHEs into the ecosystem by 
emission, deposition and leaching causes environmental contamination as well as 
pollution and health hazards. The water-leaching experiment shows that these 
elements have feeble mobilisation tendency and low risk. The bioavailability 
test reflects that bio-uptake of these PHEs into the human system may be the 
origin of several diseases. Proper storage and recycling of the large amount of 
fly and bottom ash are a serious concern of thermal power plants. Chemical 
characterisation of ash, including elemental mapping by scanning electron 
microscope, calculated enrichment ratio (ER) and relative enrichment index (REI) 
values, as well as lab-scale water-leaching experiments predict that combustion 
residues of the studied power generating unit are safe for utilisation in 
construction, geotechnical and even in agricultural sectors. Chemical 
characterisation and pre-treatment of ashes before utilisation are urgently 
required to prevent any possible contamination. Regular scrutiny of emission 
control device, proper management of ash disposal and frequent utilisation are 
the keys for clean energy generation. A deep chemical and physical analysis of 
coal from power plants prior to utilisation is the primary task for sustainable 
energy generation from environmental aspect."
1487,"Cryptosporidium and Giardia (major causes of diarrhea) are widely distributed in 
Chinese source waters and threaten human health. A new spatially explicit 
GloWPa-TGR-Crypt-Giar C1 model is presented to simultaneously estimate mean 
monthly (oo)cyst concentrations in surface and ground waters in the Three Gorges 
Reservoir (TGR) watershed. A quantitative risk assessment of protozoal 
infections considered different source waters, transmission pathways, regions, 
susceptible subpopulations, and drinking water treatments. Monthly mean 
Cryptosporidium oocyst and Giardia cyst concentrations ranged between 0.5-19.3 
oocysts/10 L and 0.2-5.0 cysts/10 L in surface water, respectively, and 
0.007-0.3 oocysts/10 L and 0.002-0. 2 cysts/10 L in groundwater. The cumulative 
disease burdens attributable to cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis were, 
respectively, 5.77×10-5 DALYs (disability-adjusted life years/person/year) and 
4.63×10-6 DALYs in urban areas, and 6.35×10-4 DALYs and 8.84×10-5 DALYs in rural 
areas, which were much higher than the reference risk level recommended by the 
World Health Organization ([Formula: see text] DALYs). The annual burden 
associated with consuming surface water was calculated to be 3.84×10-4 DALYs for 
Cryptosporidium and [Formula: see text] DALYs for Giardia, whereas consuming 
groundwater entailed the lower burdens (1.26×10-5 and 3.50×10-6 DALYs, 
respectively). Most DALYs were a consequence of consumption of directly supplied 
surface water. Fifty percent of the health burden was carried by 
immunodeficiency with HIV. Children (0-4 years) were more likely to have an 
individual disease burden than adults (15-64 years). Males were more susceptible 
than females. Improving sanitation through adequate ozone and microfiltration 
treatment should be considered when attempting to reduce disease burden. 
Sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of reducing (oo)cyst loads to 
protect the watershed. The methodology and results described will help in 
evaluating and reducing the burden of protozoal infection associated with 
surface and ground waters in the TGR and similar watersheds."
1488,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been associated with accelerated 
retinal neurodegeneration. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 
association between retinal neurodegeneration and the best-corrected visual 
acuity (BCVA) decline in patients with CKD.
METHODS: Post hoc analysis of two prospective studies. Patients with CKD 
stage ≥ 3 were enrolled. Macular thickness, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber 
layer (pRNFL) thickness, and macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness were 
measured by optical coherence tomography. Eyes were classified into three 
groups: Group 1, no GCC defect; Group 2, GCC defect confined to parafoveal area; 
and Group 3, GCC defects extending beyond the parafoveal area. Each group was 
matched for age, sex, axial length, lens status, and cataract grading.
RESULTS: A total of 120 eyes (40 eyes in each group) from 120 patients (age 
63.0 ± 10.3 years) were included. The logMAR BCVA was 0.076 ± 0.101, 
0.100 ± 0.127, and 0.196 ± 0.191 in Group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Group 3, 
but not Group 2, had a significantly worse BCVA than Group 1. In simple linear 
regression, parafoveal inner retinal thickness, pRNFL thickness, presence of 
pRNFL defect, GCC thickness, GCC global loss volume, GCC focal loss volume, and 
GCC defect extending beyond parafoveal area were associated with BCVA. Central 
subfield retinal thickness (CRT), parafoveal full retinal thickness, and 
parafoveal outer retinal thickness were not associated with BCVA. In backward 
stepwise linear regression, age and GCC defects extending beyond the parafoveal 
area were factors associated with BCVA. Moreover, GCC defect extending beyond 
parafoveal area was connected with worse BCVA in both phakic and pseudophakic 
subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: GCC defect extending beyond parafoveal area could be an independent 
biomarker associated with decreased BCVA in patients with CKD. However, macular 
thinning measured by CRT or parafoveal full retinal thickness might have low 
discriminative power in determining BCVA."
1489,"BACKGROUND: P. aeruginosa bacteremia is a common and severe infection carrying 
high mortality in older adults. We aimed to evaluate outcomes of P. aeruginosa 
bacteremia among old adults (≥ 80 years).
METHODS: We included the 464/2394 (19%) older adults from a retrospective 
multinational (9 countries, 25 centers) cohort study of individuals hospitalized 
with P. aeruginosa bacteremia. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression 
models were used to evaluate risk factors for 30-day mortality among older 
adults.
RESULTS: Among 464 adults aged ≥ 80 years, the mean age was 84.61 (SD 3.98) 
years, and 274 (59%) were men. Compared to younger patients, ≥ 80 years adults 
had lower Charlson score; were less likely to have nosocomial acquisition; and 
more likely to have urinary source. Thirty-day mortality was 30%, versus 27% 
among patients 65-79 years (n = 894) and 25% among patients < 65 years 
(n = 1036). Multivariate analysis for predictors of mortality among 
patients ≥ 80 years, demonstrated higher SOFA score (odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.51, p < 0.001), corticosteroid therapy (OR 3.15, 
95% CI: 1.24-8.01, p = 0.016) and hospital acquired P. aeruginosa bacteremia (OR 
2.30, 95% CI: 1.33-3.98, p = 0.003) as predictors. Appropriate empirical therapy 
within 24 h, type of definitive anti-pseudomonal drug, and type of regimen 
(monotherapy or combination) were not associated with 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with P. aeruginosa bacteremia, background 
conditions, place of acquisition, and disease severity are associated with 
mortality, rather than the antimicrobial regimen. In this regard, preventive 
efforts and early diagnosis before organ failure develops might be beneficial 
for improving outcomes."
1490,"In spine surgery, allogenic bone grafts are often required to ensure bone 
fusion, however, the main concern regarding their use is the infection risk: 
therefore, an intraoperative swab for culture test is performed. The 
cost-effectiveness of these swabs and their influence on the patients' 
postoperative course have often been questioned. This study aims at determining 
whether positive spine allograft culture results are predictive of an increased 
risk of surgical site infection and whether they influence the surgeon's choices 
in postoperative management. The records of 340 patients who received allogenic 
bone graft during spinal fusion surgery in our institution were reviewed, for a 
total of 677 allografts. Each graft was swabbed intraoperatively. All patients 
were followed clinically for postoperative complications. Infection was 
diagnosed based on clinical data, blood tests and radiographic images, all 
assessed by an infectious disease specialist. Only 4 of the 677 allografts used 
(0.6%) resulted positive at the intraoperative swab culture. Three cultures were 
positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis and one culture for S. warneri. No 
clinical infection occurred in any of these patients. Twenty-eight of the 340 
patients (8.2%) developed an infection, but none of them had a positive 
intraoperative swab culture. The most common microbiologic pathogen isolated 
from this cohort was S. aureus. According to our series, intraoperative swab 
culture results were not predictive for higher risk of infection and did not 
affect the clinical behavior of the surgeons in postoperative management."
1491,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of finerenone on cardiovascular events in 
Kidney Disease and/or Diabetes.
METHODS: The ClinicalTrials.gov, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane 
Library databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to 
December 20, 2021 in order to identify randomized controlled trials that 
evaluated the effect of finerenone on cardiovascular events in Kidney Disease 
and/or Diabetes, without language restriction. This meta-analysis collected data 
from 7 randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effect of finrrenone in 
15,618 patients with kidney disease and/or diabetes. Risk of bias was assessed 
by Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was 
assessed by I2 statistic. The main endpoints included death from cardiovascular 
causes, death from any cause, incidence of myocardial infarction, rate of heart 
failure, hospitalization for any cause, rate of total advent events and 
study-drug-related adverse events.
RESULTS: A total of 7 randomized controlled trials involving 15,618 fulfilled 
the inclusion criteria. The outcomes of this meta-analysis presented that 
finerenone significantly reduced the death from any cause (95% CI 0.82-0.99; 
P = 0.031), risk of heart failure (95% CI 0.67-0.92; P = 0.002) among patients 
with kidney disease and/or diabetes when compared to control group. Besides, 
finerenone could not reduce the incidence of death from cardiovascular, 
myocardial infarction and hospitalization for any cause among patients with 
kidney disease and/or diabetes (p > 0.05). In terms of safety, finerenone shared 
the same risk of total advent events with placebo among patients with kidney 
disease and/or diabetes (p > 0.05). However, finerenone had higher risk of 
study-drug-related advent events than placebo among patients with kidney disease 
and/or diabetes (95% CI 1.27-1.48; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with kidney disease and/or diabetes, treatment with 
finerenone resulted in lower risk of death from any cause and heart failure than 
placebo. However, the study-drug-related advent events also increased 
significantly at the same time."
1492,"Accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is central to the pathogenesis of 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies suggest that α-syn pathology may 
originate from the olfactory bulb (OB) or gut in response to an unknown pathogen 
and later progress to the different brain regions. Aging is viewed as the utmost 
threat to PD development. Therefore, studies depicting the role of age in α-syn 
accumulation and its progression in PD are important. In the present study, we 
gave intranasal rotenone microemulsion for 6 weeks in 12-month-old female BALB/c 
mice and found olfactory dysfunction after 4 and 6 weeks of rotenone 
administration. Interestingly, motor impairment was observed only after 6 weeks. 
The animals were sacrificed after 6 weeks to perform western blotting and 
immunohistochemical studies to detect α-syn pathology, neuroinflammation and 
neurodegeneration. We found α-syn accumulation in OB, striatum, substantia nigra 
(SN) and cortex. Importantly, we found significant glial cell activation and 
neurodegeneration in all the analysed regions which were absent in our previous 
published studies with 3 months old mice even after they were exposed to 
rotenone for 9 weeks indicating age is a crucial factor for α-syn induced 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. We also observed increased iron 
accumulation in SN of rotenone-exposed aged mice. Moreover, inflammaging was 
observed in OB and striatum of 12-month-old BALB/c mice as compared to 
3-month-old BALB/c mice. In conclusion, there is a difference in sensitivity 
between adult and aged mice in the development and progression of α-syn 
pathology and subsequent neurodegeneration, for which inflammaging might be the 
crucial probable mechanism."
1493,"Italian Research Group for Gastric Cancer (GIRCG), during the 2013 annual 
Consensus Conference to gastric cancer, stated that laparoscopic or robotic 
approach should be limited only to early gastric cancer (EGC) and no further 
guidelines were currently available. However, accumulated evidences, mainly from 
eastern experiences, have supported the application of minimally invasive 
surgery also for locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The aim of our study is 
to give a snapshot of current surgical propensity of expert Italian upper 
gastrointestinal surgeons in performing minimally invasive techniques for the 
treatment of gastric cancer in order to answer to the question if clinical 
practice overcome the recommendation. Experts in the field among the Italian 
Research Group for Gastric Cancer (GIRCG) were invited to join a web 30-item 
survey through a formal e-mail from January 1st, 2020, to June 31st, 2020. 
Responses were collected from 46 participants out of 100 upper gastrointestinal 
surgeons. Percentage of surgeons choosing a minimally invasive approach to treat 
early and advanced gastric cancer was similar. Additionally analyzing data from 
the centers involved, we obtained that the percentage of minimally invasive 
total and partial gastrectomies in advanced cases augmented with the increase of 
surgical procedures performed per year (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04 respectively). It 
is reasonable to assume that there is a widening of indications given by the 
current national guideline into clinical practice. Propensity of expert Italian 
upper gastrointestinal surgeons was to perform minimally invasive surgery not 
only for early but also for advanced gastric cancer. Of interest volume activity 
correlated with the propensity of surgeons to select a minimally invasive 
approach."
1494,"For the sustainable farming of disease-free and healthy shrimps, antimicrobial 
use is frequent nowadays in shrimp-cultured system. Considering the serious 
impact of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the present study was focused 
to investigate the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant vibrios among infected 
shrimps (Penaeus vannamei) from two brackish water-cultured farms. Diverse 
species of vibrios viz. V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae, V. 
mimicus, and V. fluvialis along with Aeromonas hydrophila, A. salmonicida and 
Shewanella algae were recovered from the shrimps on TCBS medium. Shannon-Wiener 
diversity index and H' (loge) were 1.506 and 1.69 for the isolates from farm 1 
and farm 2, respectively. V. alginolyticus was found to be the most resistant 
isolate by showing multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of 0.60 followed 
by V. mimicus (0.54) and V. parahaemolyticus (0.42). Among the 35 antibiotics of 
15 different classes tested, tetracyclines, beta-lactams and cephalosporins were 
found as the most resistant antibiotic classes. All the isolates possessed a MAR 
index > 0.2 and the majority exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) > 256 mcg/ml, thereby indicating the excess exposure of antibiotics in the 
systems. An enhanced altered resistance phenotype and a significant shift in the 
MAR index were noticed after plasmid curing. Public health is further concerning 
because plasmid-borne AMR is evident among the isolates and the studied shrimp 
samples are significant in the food industry. This baseline information will 
help the authorities to curb antimicrobial use and pave the way for establishing 
new alternative strategies by undertaking a multidimensional ""One-Health"" 
approach."
1495,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) through mechanisms that remain incompletely 
characterized. Similar to AD, TBI models present with cellular metabolic 
alterations and modulated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). 
Specifically, AD and TBI tissues display increases in amyloid-β as well as its 
precursor, the APP C-terminal fragment of 99 a.a. (C99). Our recent data in cell 
models of AD indicate that C99, due to its affinity for cholesterol, induces the 
formation of transient lipid raft domains in the ER known as 
mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (""MAM"" domains). 
The formation of these domains recruits and activates specific lipid metabolic 
enzymes that regulate cellular cholesterol trafficking and sphingolipid 
turnover. Increased C99 levels in AD cell models promote MAM formation and 
significantly modulate cellular lipid homeostasis. Here, these phenotypes were 
recapitulated in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in adult 
mice. Specifically, the injured cortex and hippocampus displayed significant 
increases in C99 and MAM activity, as measured by phospholipid synthesis, 
sphingomyelinase activity and cholesterol turnover. In addition, our cell 
type-specific lipidomics analyses revealed significant changes in microglial 
lipid composition that are consistent with the observed alterations in 
MAM-resident enzymes. Altogether, we propose that alterations in the regulation 
of MAM and relevant lipid metabolic pathways could contribute to the 
epidemiological connection between TBI and AD."
1496,"PURPOSE: Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is a rare but disabling 
disease. Although several cases have been reported in the literature, their 
treatment remains unclear, especially in patients with advanced age. We, 
therefore, aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of cervical SSEH in 
octogenarians with an acute onset of neurological illness undergoing 
laminectomy.
METHODS: Electronic medical records from a single institution between September 
2005 and December 2020 were retrieved. Data on patient demographics, 
neurological conditions, functional status, surgical characteristics, 
complications, hospital course, and 90-day mortality were also collected.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients aged ≥ 80 years with SSEH undergoing laminectomy 
were enrolled in this study. The mean Charlson comorbidity index was 9.1 ± 2.0, 
indicating a poor baseline reserve. Ten individuals (45.5%) were taking 
anticoagulant agents with a pathologic partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 
46.5 ± 3.4 s. Progressive neurological decline, as defined by the motor score 
(MS), was observed on admission (63.8 ± 14.0). The in-hospital and 90-day 
mortality were 4.5% and 9.1%, respectively. Notably, the MS (93.6 ± 8.3) 
improved significantly after surgery (p < 0.05). Revision surgery was necessary 
in 5 cases due to recurrent hematoma. Anticoagulant agents and pathological PTT 
are significant risk factors for its occurrence. Motor weakness and 
comorbidities were unique risk factors for loss of ambulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Laminectomy and evacuation of the hematoma in octogenarians with 
progressive neurological decline induce clinical benefits. Emergent surgery 
seems to be the ""state of the art"" treatment for SSEH. However, potential 
complications associated with adverse prognostic factors, such as the use of 
anticoagulants, should be considered."
1497,"Mycosis Fungoides (MF) makes up the most of the cutaneous lymphomas. As a 
malignant disease, the greatest diagnostical challenge is to timely 
differentiate MF from inflammatory diseases. Contemporary computational methods 
successfully identify cell nuclei in histological specimens. Deep learning 
methods are especially favored for such tasks. A deep learning model was used to 
detect nuclei Hematoxylin-Eosin(H-E) stained micrographs. Nuclear properties are 
extracted after detection. A multi-layer perceptron classifier is used to detect 
lymphocytes specifically among the detected nuclei. The comparisons for each 
property between MF and non-MF were carried out using statistical tests the 
results are compared with the findings in the literature to provide a 
descriptive analysis as well. Random forest classifier method is used to build a 
model to classify MF and non-MF lymphocytes. 10 nuclear properties were 
statistically significantly different between MF and non-MF specimens. MF nuclei 
were smaller, darker and more heterogenous. Lymphocyte detection algorithm had 
an average 90.5% prediction power and MF detection algorithm had an average 
94.2% prediction power. This project aims to fill the gap between computational 
advancement and medical practice. The models could make MF diagnoses easier, 
more accurate and earlier. The results also challenge the manually examined and 
defined nuclear properties of MF with the help of data abundance and computer 
objectivity."
1498,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the dynamic changes in cardiac deformation and tissue 
characteristics using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in asymptomatic patients 
during 12 months after heart transplantation (HT).
METHODS: From April 2020 to January 2021, 21 consecutive HT patients without 
clinical symptoms were included in this prospective study. Multiparametric CMR 
was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after HT. Twenty-five healthy volunteers 
served as controls.
RESULTS: During follow-up, a decline in left ventricular (LV) global radial 
strain (GRS) (p = 0.020) and right ventricular (RV) global longitudinal strain 
(GLS) (p < 0.001) and an increase in post-contrast T1 (p = 0.024) and T2 (p < 
0.001) in asymptomatic HT patients occurred at 3 months, which normalized at 6 
months postoperatively, compared with those in healthy controls. A decline in 
LVGLS (p < 0.001) and LV global circumferential strain (GCS) (p < 0.001) and an 
increase in native T1 (p < 0.001), T2 (p < 0.001), and extracellular volume 
(ECV) (p < 0.001) occurred at 3 months. Although most parameters improved 
gradually, LVGLS, native T1, and ECV remained abnormal compared with those in 
healthy controls at 12 months; only T2 and LVGCS were normalized at 6 months and 
12 months, respectively. ECV was significantly correlated with LVGLS, LVGCS, and 
LVGRS.
CONCLUSION: Cardiac deformation and tissue characteristics were abnormal early 
after HT, although the patients were clinically asymptomatic. The dynamic 
changes in CMR characteristics demonstrate a gradual recovery of myocardial 
injury associated with transplantation during the first 12 months after HT.
KEY POINTS: • Multiparametric CMR can detect the dynamic changes of 
transplantation-associated myocardial injury. • Post-contrast T1, T2, LVGRS, and 
RVGLS values are normalized at 6 months after HT. • Native T1, ECV, and LVGLS 
values remain abnormal compared with those in healthy controls at 12 months 
after HT."
1499,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the association between the 
perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI) and the success of the antegrade 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusion (CTO).
METHODS: This study evaluated patients with only one CTO lesion observed on 
conventional coronary angiography (CAG) who underwent coronary computed 
tomography angiography (CCTA) < 1 month before CAG, from 2018 to 2019. The 
clinical data, CCTA-based CTO lesion morphologic characteristics, and 
perivascular FAI of CTO lesions were recorded and analysed.
RESULTS: In total, 156 patients with CTOs were enrolled in this study. 
Successful antegrade PCI (A-PCI) was achieved in 105 CTO lesions (67.3%). The 
perivascular FAI of the failed A-PCI group was significantly lower than the 
successful A-PCI group (-84.76 ± 10.44 Hounsfield unit (HU) vs. -67.54 ± 9.94 
HU; p < 0.001), and the cut-off value determined by the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve was -77.50 HU. Multivariable analysis revealed no 
statistical significance in the clinical data, FAI ≤ -77.50 HU (odds ratio (OR): 
33.96), negative remodeling (OR: 4.36), severe calcification degree (OR: 4.43) 
and occlusion length ≥ 20.25 mm (OR: 3.89) were independent predictors of A-PCI 
failure. The prediction performance of combining the three morphologic 
characteristics (severe calcification, occlusion length ≥ 20.25 mm, and negative 
remodeling) with FAI ≤ -77.50 HU was better than that of the three morphologic 
characteristics alone (0.93 versus 0.77, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: As a non-invasive index for detecting coronary inflammation, FAI 
complements indicators based on coronary CTA well and may be helpful for 
choosing appropriate interventional strategies.
KEY POINTS: • Perivascular FAI of CTO was significantly higher in the failed 
A-PCI group. • The combination of FAI with other morphological predictors showed 
higher predictive performance of failed A-PCI for CTOs. • FAI is a good 
complement to indicators based on coronary CTA."
1500,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a fully automated deep learning model for adrenal 
segmentation and to evaluate its performance in classifying adrenal hyperplasia.
METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated automated adrenal segmentation in 
308 abdominal CT scans from 48 patients with adrenal hyperplasia and 260 
patients with normal glands from 2010 to 2021 (mean age, 42 years; 156 women). 
The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets at a ratio of 
6:2:2. Contrast-enhanced CT images and manually drawn adrenal gland masks were 
used to develop a U-Net-based segmentation model. Predicted adrenal volumes were 
obtained by fivefold splitting of the dataset without overlapping the test set. 
Adrenal volumes and anthropometric parameters (height, weight, and sex) were 
utilized to develop an algorithm to classify adrenal hyperplasia, using 
multilayer perceptron, support vector classification, a random forest 
classifier, and a decision tree classifier. To measure the performance of the 
developed model, the dice coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient 
(ICC) were used for segmentation, and area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used for 
classification.
RESULTS: The model for segmenting adrenal glands achieved a Dice coefficient of 
0.7009 for 308 cases and an ICC of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90-0.93) for adrenal volume. 
The models for classifying hyperplasia had the following results: AUC, 
0.98-0.99; accuracy, 0.948-0.961; sensitivity, 0.750-0.813; and specificity, 
0.973-1.000.
CONCLUSION: The proposed segmentation algorithm can accurately segment the 
adrenal glands on CT scans and may help clinicians identify possible cases of 
adrenal hyperplasia.
KEY POINTS: • A deep learning segmentation method can accurately segment the 
adrenal gland, which is a small organ, on CT scans. • The machine learning 
algorithm to classify adrenal hyperplasia using adrenal volume and 
anthropometric parameters (height, weight, and sex) showed good performance. • 
The proposed segmentation algorithm may help clinicians identify possible cases 
of adrenal hyperplasia."
1501,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have more myocardial malperfusion on CT 
myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI), as well as to further assess if NAFLD is 
a predictor of myocardial ischemia independently.
METHODS: A total of 310 consecutive patients were included for analysis. All 
patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of 
NAFLD, which was diagnosed by noncontrast cardiac CT partially covered liver and 
spleen. Clinical characteristics as well as imaging features including coronary 
artery calcium score, CCTA, and CT-MPI findings were analyzed. Univariable and 
multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to find out the 
relationship between NAFLD and myocardial ischemia.
RESULTS: NAFLD (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.2 to 4.4, p = 0.008), male (HR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.5 to 4.5, p = 0.001), 
obstructive CAD (HR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3 to 4.2, p = 0.004), and FAI ≥ -70.1 HU 
(HR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.8 to 5.5, p < 0.001) were associated with myocardial 
ischemia in univariable analysis. After adjusting for traditional CAD risk 
factors and CT characteristics in the multivariable regression analysis, NAFLD 
(HR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2 to 4.4, p = 0.016) was an independent predictor of 
myocardial ischemia.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that myocardial ischemia was more prevalent in 
patients with NAFLD, and NAFLD is a predictor of myocardial ischemia independent 
of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and CCTA characteristics.
KEY POINTS: • NAFLD patients had higher calcium score, incidence of obstructive 
coronary artery disease, grade of CAD-RADS, quantitative plaque characteristics, 
and incidence of fat attenuation index ≥ -70.1 HU. • NAFLD patients had a higher 
incidence of myocardial ischemia, myocardial hypoperfusion, and hypoperfusion 
myocardial segments ratio. • NAFLD was a predictor of myocardial ischemia, 
independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and CCTA 
characteristics."
1502,"PURPOSE: Examining epigenetic patterns is a crucial step in identifying 
molecular changes of disease pathophysiology, with DNA methylation as the most 
accessible epigenetic measure. Diet is suggested to affect metabolism and health 
via epigenetic modifications. Thus, our aim was to explore the association 
between food consumption and DNA methylation.
METHODS: Epigenome-wide association studies were conducted in three cohorts: 
KORA FF4, TwinsUK, and Leiden Longevity Study, and 37 dietary exposures were 
evaluated. Food group definition was harmonized across the three cohorts. DNA 
methylation was measured using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip in KORA and 
Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the Leiden study and the TwinsUK study. 
Overall, data from 2293 middle-aged men and women were included. A fixed-effects 
meta-analysis pooled study-specific estimates. The significance threshold was 
set at 0.05 for false-discovery rate-adjusted p values per food group.
RESULTS: We identified significant associations between the methylation level of 
CpG sites and the consumption of onions and garlic (2), nuts and seeds (18), 
milk (1), cream (11), plant oils (4), butter (13), and alcoholic beverages (27). 
The signals targeted genes of metabolic health relevance, for example, GLI1, 
RPTOR, and DIO1, among others.
CONCLUSION: This EWAS is unique with its focus on food groups that are part of a 
Western diet. Significant findings were mostly related to food groups with a 
high-fat content."
1503,"OBJECTIVE: The study aims to compare differences among iliac bone flaps with 
different iliac crest orientations for the repair of mandibular defects with an 
aim to analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and effects.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical data and computed tomography scans of all 
patients who underwent iliac bone flap repair of the mandible in Peking 
University School and Hospital of Stomatology from January 2016 to April 2021 
were collected. Patients were divided into the iliac crest towards alveolar 
process (Group A) and the iliac crest towards mandibular inferior margin (Group 
B). Software was used to measure corresponding indicators. The results obtained 
for the groups were statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: The study included 78 patients (25 and 53 in groups A and B, 
respectively). The symmetry of the LC-type defect was better in group A 
(p < 0.05). The all-bone width of the alveolar process side in group A was 
greater than 6 mm; in 15 cases of group B, the width was less than 6 mm 
(p < 0.05). The intermaxillary distance of two sites were higher in group B 
(p < 0.05). The bone cortical thickness was significantly thicker in group A 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: One year after the mandibular body defect was reconstructed with a 
vascularized iliac bone flap, the iliac crest towards alveolar process group 
showed better bone symmetry, width, intermaxillary distance, and cortical 
thickness to meet the planting requirements.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of an iliac crest towards alveolar process may be a 
better approach for mandible reconstruction."
1504,"The heart relies predominantly on the use of fatty acids to derive energy. 
Metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes pose a 
major risk factor for the development of heart failure. Dysregulation of lipid 
metabolism observed in these diseases manifests as cardiac lipotoxicity, and is 
associated with cardiac dysfunction. The alarming rise in the incidence of these 
metabolic disorders warrants the need for tools to investigate the underlying 
molecular mechanisms. In this article, we describe a confocal microscopy-based 
approach to monitor fatty acid uptake and lipid accumulation in vitro, in 
neonatal murine cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells. The protocol for assessment of 
fatty acid uptake relies on the use of BODIPY FL C 12™ to study the kinetics of 
fatty acid uptake via real-time imaging of fatty acid uptake in live cells. 
Importantly, it circumvents the need for radioactive labeling of fatty acids to 
evaluate their uptake. Similarly, the protocol for assessment of lipid 
accumulation relies on the use of BODIPY™ 493/503 to stain the cytosolic neutral 
lipid population in fixed cells. We couple these confocal microscopy-based 
approaches with fluorescence intensity analysis using FIJI to quantify fatty 
acid uptake and lipid accumulation in vitro. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic

1505,"OBJECTIVE: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease mediated by 
antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The thymus plays a primary 
role in AChR-MG and is characterized by a type I interferon (IFN) signature 
linked to IFN-β. We investigated if AChR-MG was characterized by an IFN-I 
signature in the blood, and further investigated the chronic thymic IFN-I 
signature.
METHODS: Serum levels of IFN-β and IFN-α subtypes, and mRNA expression for IFN-I 
subtypes and IFN-stimulated genes in PBMCs were analyzed. The contribution of 
endogenous nucleic acids in thymic expression of IFN-I subtypes was investigated 
in human thymic epithelial cell cultures and the mouse thymus. By 
immunohistochemistry, thymic CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages were analyzed in 
AChR-MG. To investigate the impact of a decrease in thymic macrophages, mice 
were treated with an anti-CSF1R antibody.
RESULTS: No IFN-I signature was observed in the periphery emphasizing that the 
IFN-I signature is restricted to the MG thymus. Molecules mimicking endogenous 
dsDNA signalization (Poly(dA:dT) and 2'3'-cGAMP), or dexamethasone-induced 
necrotic thymocytes increased IFN-β and α-AChR expression by thymic epithelial 
cells, and in the mouse thymus. A significant decrease in thymic macrophages was 
demonstrated in AChR-MG. In mice, a decrease in thymic macrophages led to an 
increase of necrotic thymocytes associated with IFN-β and α-AChR expression.
INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the decrease of thymic macrophages in 
AChR-MG impairs the elimination of apoptotic thymocytes favoring the release of 
endogenous nucleic acids from necrotic thymocytes. In this inflammatory context, 
thymic epithelial cells may overexpress IFN-β, which specifically induces 
α-AChR, resulting in self-sensitization and thymic changes leading to AChR-MG.

1506,"The development of a multitarget ultrasensitive immunoassay is significant to 
fields such as medical research, clinical diagnosis, and food safety inspection. 
In this study, an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 
programmable-particle-decoding technique (APT)-based digital immunoassay system 
was developed to perform multitarget ultrasensitive detection. Multitarget was 
encoded by programmable polystyrene (PS) microspheres with different 
characteristics (particle size and number), and subsequent visible signals were 
recorded under an optical microscope after the immune reaction. The resultant 
images were further analyzed using a customized, AI-based computer vision 
technique to decode the intrinsic properties of polystyrene microspheres and to 
reveal the types and concentrations of targets. Our strategy has successfully 
detected multiple inflammatory markers in clinical serum and antibiotics with a 
broad detection range from pg/mL to μg/mL without extra signal amplification and 
conversion. An AI-based digital immunoassay system exhibits great potential to 
be used for the next generation of multitarget detection in disease screening 
for candidate patients."
1507,"OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to investigate whether ticagrelor/aspirin 
versus clopidogrel/aspirin can further reduce the residual risk of stroke 
recurrence in patients with positive diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the 
High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events II (CHANCE-2) 
trial.
METHODS: Patients with DWI data in the CHANCE-2 trial were included and divided 
into those with and without acute infarction according to their DWI findings. 
The primary efficacy outcome and safety outcome were stroke recurrence and 
moderate to severe bleeding within 3 months of follow-up, respectively.
RESULTS: Of the 6,412 patients enrolled in the CHANCE-2 trial, 5,796 (90.4%) 
patients with DWI data were included in the subgroup analysis. A total of 4,369 
patients (75.4%) had an acute infarction on DWI. Patients with positive DWI had 
higher risk of recurrent stroke (8.1%) than those without infarction (2.2%) 
within 3-month follow-up. Compared with clopidogrel/aspirin, ticagrelor/aspirin 
was associated with lower risk of stroke in patients with positive DWI (hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.80; P < .001) than in 
those negative DWI (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.55-2.72; P = .63), with a significant 
interaction association (P for interaction = .049). The risk of moderate to 
severe bleeding was similar between ticagrelor/aspirin and clopidogrel/aspirin 
treatment in different groups.
INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrate that imaging evaluation should be 
emphasized before targeting the best candidates for genotype-guided dual 
antiplatelet therapy in future clinical research and practice. This article is

1508,"OBJECTIVE: Polygenic variation accounts for a substantial portion of the risk of 
Alzheimer's disease, but its effect on the rate of fibrillar-tau accumulation as 
a key driver of dementia symptoms is unclear.
METHODS: We combined the to-date largest number of genetic risk variants of AD 
(n = 85 lead SNPs) from recent GWAS to generate a PGS. We assessed longitudinal 
tau-PET, amyloid-PET, and cognition in 231 participants from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Using the PGS, together with global 
amyloid-PET, we predicted the rate of tau-PET increases in Braak-stage 
regions-of-interest and cognitive decline. We also assessed PGS-risk enrichment 
effects on the required sample size in clinical trials targeting tau pathology.
RESULTS: We found that a higher PGS was associated with higher rates of tau-PET 
accumulation, in particular at elevated amyloid-PET levels. Tau-PET increases 
mediated the association between PGS and faster cognitive decline. Risk 
enrichment through high PGS afforded sample size savings by 34%.
INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate that the PGS predicts faster tau 
progression and thus cognitive decline, showing utility to enhance statistical 
power in clinical trials. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1509,"Extrapulmonary tuberculosis can occur in patients treated with Janus kinase 
inhibitors. We present a case of rheumatoid arthritis complicated by 
extrapulmonary tuberculosis following baricitinib treatment. A 45-year-old 
Japanese woman was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at another hospital, and 
she subsequently started treatment with methotrexate at 6.0 mg/week and 
prednisolone at 3.0 mg/day at our institute. The methotrexate dose was increased 
to 10 mg/week, and clinical remission was achieved; however, the disease 
activity flared up 6 months after the initial visit. INH prophylaxis was started 
following positive T-SPOT® screening for tuberculosis, and baricitinib 
(Olumiant®) was introduced 3 weeks later because of an insufficient response to 
methotrexate. INH prophylaxis was continued for 6 months. Ten months after 
starting INH treatment, a painless mass was observed on the left side of the 
patient's neck. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enlarged lymph nodes with 
calcification. A subsequent biopsy and pathologic examination led to a diagnosis 
of tuberculous lymphadenitis, and the patient was started on anti-tuberculosis 
therapy. Ten months later, the patient was still in remission and doing well. 
Extrapulmonary tuberculosis can be difficult to diagnose because of inconsistent 
physical and laboratory findings. When treating patients with Janus kinase 
inhibitors, physicians should be cognisant of the potential for extrapulmonary 
tuberculosis to develop."
1510,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric Epstein-Barr virus-negative monomorphic post solid organ 
transplant lymphoproliferative disorder [EBV(-)M-PTLD] comprises approximately 
10% of M-PTLD. No large multi-institutional pediatric-specific reports on 
treatment and outcome are available.
METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective review of solid organ recipients 
diagnosed with EBV(-)M-PTLD aged ≤21 years between 2001 and 2020 in 12 centers 
in the United States and United Kingdom was performed, including demographics, 
staging, treatment, and outcomes data.
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were identified with EBV(-)M-PTLD. Twenty-three 
(63.9%) were male. Median age (range) at transplantation, diagnosis of 
EBV(-)M-PTLD, and interval from transplant to PTLD were 2.2 years (0.1-17), 14 
years (3.0-20), and 8.5 years (0.6-18.3), respectively. Kidney (n = 17 [47.2%]) 
and heart (n = 13 [36.1%]) were the most commonly transplanted organs. Most were 
Murphy stage III (n = 25 [69.4%]). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 22/34 
(64.7%) and ≥2 times upper limit of normal in 11/34 (32.4%). Pathological 
diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 31 [86.1%]) and 
B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 5 [13.9%]). Of 
nine different regimens used, the most common were: pediatric mature 
B-NHL-specific regimen (n = 13 [36.1%]) and low-dose cyclophosphamide, 
prednisone, and rituximab (n = 9 [25%]). Median follow-up from diagnosis was 3.0 
years (0.3-11.0 years). Three-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall 
survival (OS) were 64.8% and 79.9%, respectively. Of the seven deaths, six were 
from progressive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: EFS and OS were comparable to pediatric EBV(+) PTLD, but inferior 
to mature B-NHL in immunocompetent pediatric patients. The wide range of 
therapeutic regimens used directs our work toward developing an active 
multi-institutional registry to design prospective studies.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Pediatric Epstein-Barr virus-negative monomorphic post 
solid organ transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV(-)M-PTLD) have 
comparable outcomes to EBV(+) PTLD, but are inferior to diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma in immunocompetent pediatric patients. The variety of treatment 
regimens used highlights the need to develop a pediatric PTLD registry to 
prospectively evaluate outcomes. The impact of treatment regimen on relapse risk 
could not be assessed because of small numbers. In the intensive pediatric 
B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma chemoimmunotherapy group, 11 of 13 patients remain alive 
in complete remission after 0.6 to 11 years."

1513,"BACKGROUND: Management of urinary incontinence (UI) in nursing homes (NHs) 
represents a complex process that may have become more challenging during a 
period in which front-line health professionals (HPs) must deal with the 
outbreak of a new infectious disease. We aimed to investigate how UI and its 
management was affected in NHs during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the 
perception of health professionals.
METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted between January and March 2021 
with 16 health professionals working in nine NHs in the Osona county (Barcelona, 
Spain) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The individual interviews were conducted 
via online videoconferencing and each session was audio recorded.
RESULTS: The HPs highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the management 
of continence in NHs, resulting in increased UI. Two main factors were 
identified: workforce-related and resident-related factors. Considering the 
workforce, three main topics emerged: pandemic as the priority, lack of 
personnel and use of personal protective equipment as an obstacle to 
communication with residents and attending to their needs.
CONCLUSION: Managing UI in NHs always has been a challenging point of care, and 
these challenges were worsened by the restrictions and additional difficulties 
that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic."
1514,"BACKGROUND: As in other domains of medicine, high-throughput sequencing methods 
have led to the identification of an ever-increasing number of gene variants in 
the fields of both male and female infertility. The increasing number of 
recently identified genes allows an accurate diagnosis for previously idiopathic 
cases of female infertility and more appropriate patient care. However, robust 
evidence of the gene-disease relationships (GDR) allowing the proper translation 
to clinical application is still missing in many cases.
OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: An evidence-based curation of currently identified 
genes involved in female infertility and differences in sex development (DSD) 
would significantly improve both diagnostic performance and genetic research. We 
therefore performed a systematic review to summarize current knowledge and 
assess the available GDR.
SEARCH METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were applied to curate all available 
information from PubMed and Web of Science on genetics of human female 
infertility and DSD leading to infertility, from 1 January 1988 to 1 November 
2021. The reviewed pathologies include non-syndromic as well as syndromic female 
infertility, and endocrine and reproductive system disorders. The evidence that 
an identified phenotype is caused by pathogenic variants in a specific gene was 
assessed according to a standardized scoring system. A final score (no evidence, 
limited, moderate, strong, or definitive) was assigned to every GDR.
OUTCOMES: A total of 45 271 publications were identified and screened for 
inclusion of which 1078 were selected for gene and variant extraction. We have 
identified 395 genes and validated 466 GDRs covering all reported monogenic 
causes of female infertility and DSD. Furthermore, we present a genetic 
diagnostic flowchart including 105 genes with at least moderate evidence for 
female infertility and suggest recommendations for future research. The study 
did not take into account associated genetic risk factor(s) or 
oligogenic/polygenic causes of female infertility.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS: We have comprehensively reviewed the existing research on 
the genetics of female infertility and DSD, which will enable the development of 
diagnostic panels using validated genes. Whole genome analysis is shifting from 
predominantly research to clinical application, increasing its diagnostic 
potential. These new diagnostic possibilities will not only decrease the number 
of idiopathic cases but will also render genetic counselling more effective for 
infertile patients and their families."
1515,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), which is caused by a novel 
Bunyavirus, has gradually become a threatening infectious disease in rural areas 
of Asia. Studies have identified a severe cytokine storm and impaired humoral 
immune response in SFTS. However, the cellular immune response to SFTS virus 
(SFTSV) infection remains largely unknown. Here we report that SFTS patients had 
a cytokine storm accompanied by high levels of chemokines. CD8+ T cells in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of SFTS patients exhibited a more activated 
phenotype and enhanced the antiviral responses. They increased the expression of 
CD69 and CD25, secreted a higher level of IFN-γ and granzyme, and had a stronger 
proliferative ability than in healthy controls. In convalescent SFTS patients, 
the expression of CD69 and CD25 on CD8+ T cells was reduced. In addition, we 
found the ratio and cellularity of CD14+ CD16+ intermediate monocytes were 
increased in peripheral blood of SFTS patients. Both the expression of C-X-C 
motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) on CD14+ CD16+ intermediate monocytes and the 
expression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) on CD8+ T cells increased 
dramatically in SFTS patients. Our studies reveal a potential pathway that CD8+ 
T cells rapidly activate and are mostly recruited by intermediate monocytes 
through CXCL10 in SFTSV infection. Our results may be of clinical relevance for 
further treatment and discharge instructions in SFTSV infections."
1516,"BACKGROUND: Family caregivers offer essential support to persons living with 
dementia (PLWD). Providing care for more than one family member or close other 
across adulthood is becoming increasingly common, yet little is known about the 
ways that caregiving experiences shape caregiver preparedness. The current study 
presents a grounded theory of future caregiver preparedness in former caregivers 
of PLWD.
METHOD: A coding team (five coders and two auditors) used Consensual Qualitative 
Research and grounded theory techniques to analyze transcripts from 32 
semi-structured interviews with midlife former caregivers of parents who died 
following advanced Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed two dimensions of future caregiver 
preparedness: caregiving confidence and caregiving insights. Narratives from 
caregiving experiences informed participants' descriptions of their future 
caregiver preparedness. Though some former caregivers described a positive 
(i.e., boosted or sustained) sense of caregiving confidence following care for 
their parents, others described a diminished (i.e., restricted or impeded) sense 
of confidence. Regardless of their confidence, all caregivers described specific 
caregiving insights related to one or more categories (i.e., caregiving 
self-conduct, care systems and resources, and relating with a care partner).
CONCLUSIONS: Preparedness for future caregiving following recent care for a PLWD 
varies: For some, past experiences appear to offer cumulative advantages in 
anticipating future care roles, whereas for others, past experiences may 
contribute to apprehension towards, or rejection of, future care roles. Entering 
new caregiving roles with diminished confidence may have negative consequences 
for caregivers' and care partners' wellbeing. Multidimensional assessment of 
future caregiver preparedness in former caregivers of PLWD may support 
development of resources for former caregivers entering new caregiving roles."
1517,"Ion channels play an important role for regulation of the exocrine and the 
endocrine pancreas. This review focuses on the Ca2+-regulated K+ channel KCa3.1, 
encoded by the KCNN4 gene, which is present in both parts of the pancreas. In 
the islets of Langerhans, KCa3.1 channels are involved in the regulation of 
membrane potential oscillations characterizing nutrient-stimulated islet 
activity. Channel upregulation is induced by gluco- or lipotoxic conditions and 
might contribute to micro-inflammation and impaired insulin release in type 2 
diabetes mellitus as well as to diabetes-associated renal and vascular 
complications. In the exocrine pancreas KCa3.1 channels are expressed in acinar 
and ductal cells. They are thought to play a role for anion secretion during 
digestion but their physiological role has not been fully elucidated yet. 
Pancreatic carcinoma, especially pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is 
associated with drastic overexpression of KCa3.1. For pharmacological targeting 
of KCa3.1 channels, we are discussing the possible benefits KCa3.1 channel 
inhibitors might provide in the context of diabetes mellitus and pancreatic 
cancer, respectively. We are also giving a perspective for the use of a 
fluorescently labeled derivative of the KCa3.1 blocker senicapoc as a tool to 
monitor channel distribution in pancreatic tissue. In summary, modulating KCa3.1 
channel activity is a useful strategy for exo-and endocrine pancreatic disease 
but further studies are needed to evaluate its clinical suitability."
1518,"MOTIVATION: Understanding comorbidity is essential for disease prevention, 
treatment, and prognosis. In particular, insight into which pairs of diseases 
are likely or unlikely to co-occur may help elucidate the potential 
relationships between complex diseases. Here, we introduce the use of an 
inter-disease interactivity network to discover/prioritize comorbidities. 
Specifically, we determine disease associations by accounting for the direction 
of effects of genetic components shared between diseases, and categorize those 
associations as synergistic or antagonistic. We further develop a comorbidity 
scoring algorithm to predict whether diseases are more or less likely to 
co-occur in the presence of a given index disease. This algorithm can handle 
networks that incorporate relationships with opposite signs.
RESULTS: We finally investigate inter-disease associations among 427 phenotypes 
in UK Biobank PheWAS data and predict the priority of comorbid diseases. The 
predicted comorbidities were verified using the UK Biobank inpatient electronic 
health records. Our findings demonstrate that considering the interaction of 
phenotype associations might be helpful in better predicting comorbidity.

1519,"SUMMARY: A 72-year-old man with type 2 diabetes volunteered to participate in 
the control group of a clinical study. The study evaluated non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease in patients with kidney disease. The patient was followed at a 
gastroenterology department due to Crohn's disease and post-operative bile acid 
malabsorption. The patient had no symptoms or biochemical findings suggesting 
liver disease. Surprisingly, a transient elastography (FibroScan®) suggested 
advanced fibrosis with a median of 16.1 kPa. A liver biopsy showed non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH)-cirrhosis. The diagnosis was only made incidentally and 
highlights how NASH-cirrhosis may be overlooked due to the lack of symptoms.
LEARNING POINTS: Clinicians treating high-risk populations, including patients 
with type 2 diabetes and/or components of the metabolic syndrome, should be 
aware of the frequently occurring co-existence with non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) and especially non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Liver 
enzymes may be in the normal range even in people with steatosis, NASH, or even 
cirrhosis. The diagnosis of NAFLD should include evaluation of hepatic fibrosis 
as this is the most important prognostic factor for liver-related complications 
and mortality. Guidelines about systematic screening for NAFLD in patients with 
type 2 diabetes are incongruent."
1520,"SUMMARY: Adult-onset nesidioblastosis is a rare complication of Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass surgery and may occur months to years after the initial surgical 
procedure. It is manifested by a hyperinsulinemic, hypoglycemic state. The 
annual incidence of adult-onset hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is believed to be 
less than 0.1 in 1 000 000 with a mean age of onset of 47 years (1). Here, we 
describe a patient who presented with worsening hypoglycemic symptoms for 1 year 
prior to presentation that eventually progressed to hypoglycemic seizures. The 
onset of this hypoglycemia was 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. A 
full neurological evaluation, which included an EEG, head CT, and MRI, was 
performed to rule out epilepsy and other seizure-related disorders. After 
hypoglycemia was confirmed, extensive laboratory studies were obtained to 
elucidate the cause of the hypoglycemia and differentiate nesidioblastosis from 
insulinoma. Once the diagnosis of nesidioblastosis was established, a sub-total 
pancreatectomy was performed, and the patient was discharged and placed on 
acarbose, a competitive reversible inhibitor of pancreatic α-amylase and 
intestinal brush border α-glucosidases which slows carbohydrate absorption. The 
lack of information and understanding of nesidioblastosis due to its rarity 
makes any knowledge of this rare but important surgical complication essential. 
As incidence of obesity increases, the number of gastric bypasses being 
performed increases with it, and understanding this disease process will be 
essential for the primary care provider. This is the primary reason for the 
writing of this publication.
LEARNING POINTS: Nesidioblastosis is a persistent hyperinsulinemic, hypoglycemic 
state, mostly seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, with symptoms 
occurring postprandially. The incidence is 0.1-0.3% of all post Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass patients. The key diagnostic clue to identifying nesidioblastosis 
is a positive selective arterial calcium stimulation test, showing a diffuse 
pattern of increased basal hepatic venous insulin concentration, whereas 
insulinomas would show focal increases. Pathological specimen of pancreas will 
show diffuse hypertrophy of beta cells. Management includes acarbose and total 
or subtotal pancreatectomy, which can be curative. With the prevalence of 
obesity increasing and more patients turning to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, more 
patients may be at risk of this potential surgical complication."
1521,"SUMMARY: In this study, we herein describe a 47-year-old Japanese woman who 
manifested inheritable non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and severe 
dyslipidemia. Interestingly, her NASH progression was ameliorated by treatment 
with a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. This inheritability 
prompted us to comprehensively decode her genomic information using whole-exome 
sequencing. We found the well-established I148M mutation in PNPLA3 as well as 
mutations in LGALS3 and PEMT for her NASH. Mutations in GCKR may contribute to 
both NASH and dyslipidemia. We further mined gene mutations potentially 
responsible for her manifestations that led to the identification of a novel 
M188fs mutation in MUL1 that may be causally associated with her mitochondrial 
dysfunction. Our case may provide some clues to better understand this spectrum 
of disease as well as the rationale for selecting medications.
LEARNING POINTS: While the PNPLA3 I148M mutation is well-established, 
accumulation of other mutations may accelerate susceptibility to non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH and dyslipidemia may be intertwined biochemically 
and genetically through several key genes. SGLT2 inhibitors emerge as promising 
treatment for NASH albeit with interindividual variation in efficacy. Genetic 
background may explain the mechanisms behind the variation. A novel 
dysfunctional mutation in MUL1 may lead to metabolic inflexibilities through 
impaired mitochondrial dynamics and function."
1522,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tremor in chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is common, often unresponsive to treatment, and 
may contribute to disability. We aim to investigate whether tremor is associated 
with disability as measured in daily practice and clinical trials, independent 
of other impairments.
METHODS: We included 76 CIDP patients in this cross-sectional study. We assessed 
tremor with the Tremor Research Group essential tremor rating assessment scale 
(TETRAS) and Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical rating scale (FTM). Disability was 
measured with the inflammatory Rasch-built overall disability scale (I-RODS) and 
the adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment disability scale 
(INCAT-DS, categorized separately in arm score, or total score). Impairments 
including strength, sensory impairment and fatigue were measured using specific 
impairment scales. We tested whether 'the presence of a clinically relevant 
tremor' (based on TETRAS and FTM) or 'tremor severity' (FTM part B sumscore) was 
associated with disability scores (I-RODS, INCAT-DS total score, and INCAT-DS 
arm score), independent of the impairment scores, using multivariate regression.
RESULTS: Both 'the presence of a clinically relevant tremor' and 'tremor 
severity' were significantly associated with disability measured by the INCAT-DS 
(arm score and total score), but not the I-RODS, independent of strength, 
sensory impairment and fatigue. The explained variances were low.
INTERPRETATION: Clinically relevant tremor can (partly) explain disability in 
CIDP, as measured with the INCAT-DS, independent of muscle strength, sensory 
deficits, and fatigue. To assess disease activity in CIDP patients with tremor, 
both impairment and disability outcomes should be assessed, as disability is 
caused partly by tremor while the effect of immunotherapy on tremor seems 
limited. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1523,"PURPOSE: Nephrolithiasis (NL) affects 1 in 11 individuals worldwide, leading to 
significant patient morbidity. NL is associated with nephrocalcinosis (NC), a 
risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Causative genetic variants are detected 
in 11-28% of NL and/or NC, suggesting additional NL/NC-associated genetic loci 
await discovery. Therefore, we employed genomic approaches to discover novel 
genetic forms of NL/NC.
METHODS: Exome sequencing and directed sequencing of the OXGR1 locus were 
performed in a worldwide NL/NC cohort. Putatively deleterious rare OXGR1 
variants were functionally characterized.
RESULTS: Exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous OXGR1 missense variant 
(c.371T>G, p.L124R) co-segregating with calcium oxalate NL and/or NC disease in 
an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern within a multi-generational family 
with five affected individuals. OXGR1 encodes 2-oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) 
receptor 1 in the distal nephron. In response to its ligand α-ketoglutarate 
(AKG), OXGR1 stimulates the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger Pendrin, which also 
regulates transepithelial calcium transport in cortical connecting tubules. 
Strong amino acid conservation in orthologues and paralogues, severe in silico 
prediction scores, and extreme rarity in exome population databases suggested 
the variant was deleterious. Interrogation of the OXGR1 locus in 1107 additional 
NL/NC families identified five additional deleterious dominant variants in five 
families with calcium oxalate NL/NC. Rare, potentially deleterious OXGR1 
variants were enriched in NL/NC subjects relative to ExAC controls (Χ2=7.117, 
p=0.0076). Wildtype OXGR1-expressing Xenopus oocytes exhibited AKG-responsive 
Ca2+ uptake. Four of five NL/NC-associated missense variants revealed impaired 
AKG-dependent Ca2+ uptake, demonstrating loss-of-function.
CONCLUSION: Rare, dominant loss-of-function OXGR1 variants are associated with 
recurrent calcium oxalate NL/NC disease."
1524,"BACKGROUND: Endogenous production of carbon monoxide during hemoglobin 
metabolism leads to the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin 
concentration is abnormally high in humans with hemolytic anemia (HA).
HYPOTHESIS: Measurement of carboxyhemoglobin concentration can discriminate HA 
from other forms of anemia.
ANIMALS: Twenty-seven dogs with HA (immune-mediated HA, n = 22; microangiopathic 
HA, n = 5), 27 dogs with non-HA (kidney disease, n = 14; immune-mediated 
thrombocytopenia, [n = 6]; miscellaneous, n = 7) and 24 nonanemic control dogs.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study. Carboxyhemoglobin quantification, a CBC and 
biochemistry profile were performed upon admission, and survival to hospital 
discharge and at 30 days were the measured outcomes. Groups were compared by the 
Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) 
analyses were used to examine the predictive utility of carboxyhemoglobin for 
the diagnosis of HA in anemic dogs.
RESULTS: Carboxyhemoglobin (median [interquartile range]) differed between dogs 
with HA (7.7% [2.5%]) and non-HA (3.6% [1.05]; P < .001) and dogs with HA and 
nonanemic dogs (3.5% [0.65%]; P < .001). No difference was detected between 
nonHA and nonanemic dogs. The area under the ROC curve for carboxyhemoglobin as 
predictor of HA in anemic dogs was 0.997 (95% CI, 0.99-1.00). Three optimal 
cut-off points were identified, including 5.05%, 4.55% and 4.85%, with 
corresponding sensitivity/specificity of 92.6%/100%, 100%/92.6% and 96.3%/96.3%, 
respectively. Neither carboxyhemoglobin nor any of the CBC or chemistry analytes 
were associated with survival.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Carboxyhemoglobin proved an excellent 
predictor of HA in dogs and might constitute a useful, ancillary tool for 
diagnosing and monitoring hemolytic anemias."
1525,"BACKGROUND: Parenteral penicillin G (PENG) and oral amoxicillin (AMOX) are 
recommended as treatment for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). With 
recent epidemiologic penicillin susceptibility data for Streptococcus 
pneumoniae, the most common etiology of CAP, the objective of this study was to 
evaluate optimal dosing regimens of PENG and AMOX based on population 
pharmacokinetics linked to current susceptibility data.
METHODS: Using NONMEM v7.3, Monte Carlo simulations (N=10,000) were conducted 
for AMOX 15 mg/kg/dose PO every 8 hours (standard-dose), AMOX 45 mg/kg/dose PO 
every 12 hours (high-dose), and PENG 62,500 units/kg/day IV every 6 hours using 
six virtual subjects with ages spanning 3 months to 15 years old. The 
probability of target attainment (PTA) was determined for both serum and 
epithelial lining fluid (ELF) to achieve free drug concentrations above the 
minimum inhibitory concentration (%fT>MIC) across the population of pneumococci 
for 30-50% of the dosing interval.
RESULTS: In 2018, all 21 (100%) pneumococcal isolates were susceptible to both 
PENG and AMOX based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; MIC at 
2 mg/L) breakpoints, and 15 of 21 (71%) were susceptible based on EUCAST (MIC at 
0.5 mg/L) breakpoints. As compared with CLSI, EUCAST breakpoints consistently 
achieved higher PTA for all antibiotic regimens. At 50% fT>MIC in the serum at 
the susceptible MICs, standard-dose AMOX achieved >4% PTA (CLSI) and >86% PTA 
(EUCAST); high-dose AMOX achieved >73% PTA (CLSI) and >99% PTA (EUCAST); and 
PENG achieved 0% PTA (using CLSI) and 100% PTA (using EUCAST). Standard-dose 
AMOX, high-dose AMOX, and PENG achieved >71%, >93%, and 100% PTA, respectively, 
in the serum at 30-50%fT>MIC when each patient was stochastically linked to an 
MIC based on the frequency distribution of national susceptibility data. The PTA 
was consistently lower in ELF as compared with serum for all regimens.
CONCLUSION: Based on the recent rates of resistance, antibiotic doses evaluated 
provide appropriate exposure for pediatric CAP based on the serum and ELF data 
associated with predicted clinical and microbiologic success for pneumococcus. 
High-dose AMOX may still be required to treat pediatric CAP, especially if using 
CLSI breakpoints. Ongoing surveillance for resistance is essential."
1526,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a prothrombotic autoimmune disease with 
heterogenous clinicopathological manifestations and is a well-established cause 
of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and transient ischaemic attack (TIA), 
particularly in younger patients. There is growing recognition of a wider 
spectrum of APS-associated cerebrovascular lesions, including white matter 
hyperintensities, cortical atrophy and infarcts, which may have clinically 
important neurocognitive sequalae. Diagnosis of APS-associated AIS / TIA 
requires expert review of clinical and laboratory information. Management also 
poses challenges, given the potential for substantial morbidity and recurrent 
thrombosis, additional risk conferred by conventional cardiovascular risk 
factors, and limitations in the evidence-base regarding optimal antithrombotic 
therapy for secondary prevention.In this review, we summarise key features of 
APS-associated cerebrovascular disorders, with focus on clinical and laboratory 
aspects of diagnostic evaluation, including practical guidance for 
antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) testing, and an overview of neuroimaging 
findings. The current status of prognostic markers is considered. We review the 
evidence base for antithrombotic treatment in APS-associated stroke and discuss 
ongoing uncertainties in this setting, including the optimal intensity of 
anticoagulation and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Clinical 
practice recommendations are provided, covering antithrombotic treatment, 
supportive management and options for anticoagulant-refractory cases, and we 
highlight the benefits of adopting a careful multidisciplinary team approach."
1527,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease affecting women, caused by 
somatic mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, and driven by estrogen. Similar to 
many cancers, it is metastatic, primarily to the lung. Despite its monogenetic 
nature, like many cancers, LAM is a heterogeneous disease. The cellular 
constituents of LAM are very diverse, including mesenchymal, epithelial, 
endothelial and immune cells. LAM is characterized by dysregulation of many cell 
signaling pathways, distinct populations of LAM cells, and a rich 
microenvironment, in which the immune system appears to play an important role. 
This review delineates the heterogeneity of LAM and focuses on the metastatic 
features of LAM, the deregulated signaling mechanisms and the tumor 
microenvironment. Understanding the tumor-host interaction in LAM may provide 
insights into development of new therapeutic strategies, which could be 
combinatorial or superlative to Sirolimus, the current FDA-approved treatment."
1528,"Obesity is a major risk factor for developing various health problems, including 
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Although controversial, accumulation of 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and notably an increase in mitochondrial reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) production, was proposed as a key contributor leading to 
obesity-induced insulin resistance. Here, our goal was to investigate whether 
Parkin overexpression, a key regulator of the removal of dysfunctional 
mitochondria through mitophagy, could confer protection against obesity-induced 
mitochondrial dysfunction. To this end, intramuscular injections of 
adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were performed to overexpress Parkin in limb 
muscle of 6-month-old mice fed a control diet (CD) or a high fat diet (HFD) for 
12 weeks. An AAV expressing GFP was used as control. HFD increased fat mass, 
altered glycemia and resulted in insulin resistance. Parkin overexpression 
resulted in an increase in muscle mass in both CD and HFD mice. In CD mice, 
Parkin overexpression increased maximal mitochondrial respiration and lowered 
H2O2 emission. HFD increased mitochondrial respiration and, surprisingly, also 
lowered H2O2 emission. Parkin overexpression did not significantly impact 
mitochondrial function in HFD mice. Taken altogether, our results indicate that 
Parkin overexpression positively impacts muscle and mitochondrial health under 
basal conditions and challenge the notion that intrinsic mitochondrial 
dysfunction is involved in the development of insulin resistance caused by high 
fat feeding."
1529,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a classical hormonal system involved in a 
myriad of cardiovascular functions. This system is composed of many different 
peptides that act in the heart through different receptors. One of the most 
important of these peptides is Angiotensin II, which in pathological conditions 
triggers a set of actions that lead to heart failure. On the other hand, another 
RAS peptide, Angiotensin-(1-7) is well known to develop powerful therapeutic 
effects in many forms of cardiac diseases. In the last decade, two new 
components of RAS were described, the heptapeptide Alamandine and its receptor, 
the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member D (MrgD). Since then, great 
effort was made to characterize their physiological and pathological function in 
the heart. In this review, we summarize the latest insights about the actions of 
Alamandine/MrgD axis in the heart, with particular emphasis in the 
cardiomyocyte. More specifically, we focused on their anti-hypertrophic and 
contractility effects, and the related molecular events activated in the 
cardiomyocyte."
1530,"Recently, there has been increased recognition of the importance of sex as a 
biological factor affecting disease and health. Many preclinical studies have 
suggested that males may experience a less favorable outcome in response to 
sepsis than females. The underlying mechanisms for these differences are still 
largely unknown but are thought to be related to the beneficial effects of 
estrogen. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive role of testosterone is also 
thought to contribute to the sex-dependent differences that are present in 
clinical sepsis. There are still significant knowledge gaps in this field. This 
mini-review will provide a brief overview of sex-dependent variables in relation 
to sepsis and the cardiovascular system. Preclinical animal models for sepsis 
research will also be discussed. The intent of this mini-review is to inspire 
interest for future considerations of sex related variables in sepsis that 
should be addressed to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
in sepsis-induced cardiovascular dysfunction for identification of therapeutic 
targets and improved sepsis management and treatment."
1531,"In vitro models provide an important platform for the investigation of cellular 
growth and atrophy to inform, or extend mechanistic insights from, logistically 
challenging in vivo trials. While these models allow for the identification of 
candidate mechanistic pathways, many models involve supraphysiological dosages, 
non-physiological conditions, or experimental changes relating to individual 
proteins or receptors, all of which limit translation to human trials. To 
overcome these drawbacks, the use of ex vivo human plasma and serum has been 
used in cellular models to investigate changes in myotube hypertrophy, cellular 
protein synthesis, anabolic and catabolic markers in response to differing age, 
disease states, and nutrient status. However, there are currently no concurrent 
guidelines outlining the optimal methodology for this model. This review 
discusses the key methodological considerations surrounding the use of ex 
vivoplasma and serum, with a focus in application to skeletal muscle cell lines 
(i.e., C2C12, L6 and LHCN-M2) and human primary skeletal muscle cells (HSMC) as 
a means to investigate molecular signaling in models of atrophy and hypertrophy, 
alongside future directions."
1532,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is among the most frequent diseases of the musculoskeletal 
system. Degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) is a hallmark of OA. 
During the degradation process intact/full-length proteins as well as 
proteolytic fragments are released which then might induce different downstream 
responses via diverse receptors, therefore leading to different biological 
consequences. Collagen type II and the proteoglycan aggrecan are the most 
abundant components of the cartilage ECM. However, over the last decades, a 
large number of minor components have been identified and for some of those a 
role in the manifold processes associated with OA has already been demonstrated. 
To date, there is still no therapy able to halt or cure OA. A better 
understanding of the matrikine landscape occurring with or even preceding 
obvious degenerative changes in joint tissues is needed and might help to 
identify molecules that could serve as biomarkers, druggable targets, or even be 
blueprints for DMOADs. For this narrative review, we screened PubMed for 
relevant literature in English language and summarized the current knowledge 
regarding the function of selected ECM molecules and the derived matrikines in 
the context of cartilage and OA."
1533,"High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) allows noninvasive muscle 
monitoring and disease diagnosis. Clinical translation of current HDsEMG 
technologies is hampered by cost, limited scalability, low usability, and 
minimal spatial coverage. Here, this study presents, validates, and demonstrates 
the broad clinical applicability of dry wearable MXene HDsEMG arrays (MXtrodes) 
fabricated from safe and scalable liquid-phase processing of Ti3 C2 Tx . The 
fabrication scheme allows easy customization of array geometry to match subject 
anatomy, while the gel-free and minimal skin preparation enhance usability and 
comfort. The low impedance and high conductivity of the MXtrode arrays allow 
detection of the activity of large muscle groups at higher quality and spatial 
resolution than state-of-the-art wireless electromyography  sensors, and in 
realistic clinical scenarios. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of 
MXtrodes in the context of neuromuscular diagnostics and rehabilitation, 
simultaneous HDsEMG and biomechanical mapping of muscle groups across the whole 
calf during various tasks, ranging from controlled contractions to walking is 
shown. Finally, the integration of HDsEMG acquired with MXtrodes with a machine 
learning pipeline and the accurate prediction of the phases of human gait are 
shown. The results underscore the advantages and translatability of MXene-based 
wearable bioelectronics for studying neuromuscular function and disease, as well 
as for precision rehabilitation."
1534,"Tuberculosis (TB) disease continues to remain one of the global threats for 
mankind. Till date many antibacterial compounds have been identified to target 
mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). However, the mutating nature of the 
mycobacteria has always posed a challenge for designing newer drugs which can 
target both the non-mutating and mutating forms of TB. In this process, 
Mycobacterial membrane protein Large 3 (MmpL3) transporter was identified as one 
of the key targets for inhibiting tuberculosis. Herein we have made an effort to 
find potential inhibitors against MmpL3 by using a pharmacophore-based virtual 
screening workflow, followed by molecular docking studies and molecular dynamic 
simulations. Based on a set of 220 compounds showing anti-tubercular activity 
proposed to target MmpL3 transporter with MIC values ranging from 0.003 to 
737 μM, a 5-point pharmacophore ADHHR_2 model possessing one hydrogen acceptor, 
one hydrogen donor, two hydrophobic groups and an aromatic ring system was 
generated. The model validated by enrichment study was used to screen Asinex and 
DrugBank database to identify a potential lead compound such as DrugBank_6059 
that was found to show better binding affinity (-11.36) and hydrophobic 
interactions with target protein in comparison to standard drug 
SQ109.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
1535,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal 
mucosa affecting the quality of life of patients. SRY-box transcription factor 
11 (SOX11) was reported to play important roles in inflammatory responses, but 
its role in AR is poorly understood.
AIMS: To explore the role of SOX11 in the development of allergic rhinitis.
STUDY DESIGN: Cell culture and animal study.
METHODS: An in vivo murine allergic rhinitis model was established using 
ovalbumin treatment in female mice. Interleukin-13-stimulated human nasal mucosa 
epithelial cells were used for in vitro studies. Expression levels of SOX11, 
epithelial-derived cytokines, and mucin were determined in both modesls.
RESULTS: SOX11 was highly expressed in allergic rhinitis mice. Allergy symptoms, 
serum ovalbumin-specific IgE, histamine, eosinophils, goblet cells, and type 2 
cytokine secretion were increased in ovalbumin-treated mice. Furthermore, 
allergic rhinitis mice exhibited overproduction of epithelial-derived cytokines 
(thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interleukin-25, interleukin-33), C-C motif 
chemokine ligand 26 (CCL26), and mucin 5 AC (MUC5AC). Silencing SOX11 alleviated 
the behavioral symptoms and upregulation of epithelial-derived cytokines, CCL26, 
and MUC5AC. In human nasal mucosa epithelial cells, interleukin-13 enhanced 
SOX11 expression in a time-dependent manner, and signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 6 (STAT6) was involved in the interleukin-13-mediated 
expression of SOX11 by regulating transcription. Knockdown of SOX11 reduced 
epithelial-derived cytokine expression and MUC5AC levels in 
interleukin-13-treated human nasal mucosa epithelial cells.
CONCLUSION: SOX11 plays a critical role in allergic rhinitis development by 
regulating epithelial-derived cytokines and might be a new therapeutic target 
for allergic rhinitis."
1536,"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) shares similar immunological and 
clinical features with multiple sclerosis (MS), and is therefore widely used as 
a model to identify new drug targets for better patient treatment. MS is 
characterized by several different disease courses: relapsing-remitting MS 
(RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and a 
rare progressive-relapsing form of MS (PRMS). Although animal models do not 
accurately mimic all of these contrasting human disease phenotypes, there are 
EAE models that reflect some of the different clinical manifestations of MS. For 
example, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE in C57BL/6J mice 
mimics human PPMS, while myelin proteolipid protein (PLP)-induced EAE in SJL/J 
mice resembles RRMS. Other autoantigens, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), and 
a number of different mouse strains are also used to study EAE. To induce 
disease in these autoantigen-immunization EAE models, a water-in-oil emulsion is 
prepared and injected subcutaneously. The majority of EAE models also require an 
injection of pertussis toxin for the disease to develop. For consistent and 
reproducible EAE induction, a detailed protocol to prepare the reagents to 
produce antigen/adjuvant emulsions is necessary. The method described here takes 
advantage of a standardized method to generate water-in-oil emulsions. It is 
simple and fast and uses a shaking homogenizer instead of syringes to prepare 
quality-controlled emulsions."
1537,"Sepsis is a severe life-threatening and rapidly developing disease that causes 
millions of deaths annually worldwide. Researchers have made tremendous efforts 
to elucidate the pathophysiology of sepsis using various animal models; the 
mouse model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) is widely 
used in laboratories. The three technical aspects that affect the severity and 
replicability of the CLP model are the percentage of cecum ligated, the size of 
the needle used for cecal puncture, and the volume of feces squeezed into the 
abdominal cavity. The rapid and specific diagnosis of sepsis is a crucial factor 
that affects the outcome. The gold standard for sepsis diagnosis is microbial 
culture; however, this process is time-consuming and sometimes inaccurate. The 
detection of sepsis-specific biomarkers is fast, but the existing biomarkers are 
unsatisfactory due to a short half-life, non-specificity, and insufficient 
sensitivity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a reliable biomarker of 
sepsis in the early stages. Previous publications suggest that excessive 
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) occur in sepsis. Citrullinated histone H3 
(CitH3), as a NET component, is elevated both in septic animals and patients, 
and the presence of CitH3 is a reliable diagnostic biomarker of sepsis. The 
present study aimed to describe a standardized mouse model of CLP-induced sepsis 
and establish a reliable blood biomarker of sepsis. Our work may contribute to 
the early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis in the future."
1538,"Non-protein amino acids (NPAAs) are a large class of amino acids (AAs) that are 
not genetically encoded for translation into proteins. The analysis of NPAAs can 
provide crucial information about cellular uptake and/or function, metabolic 
pathways, and potential toxicity. β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a neurotoxic 
NPAA produced by various algae species and is associated with an increased risk 
for neurodegenerative diseases, which has led to significant research interest. 
There are numerous ways to extract AAs for analysis, with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry being the most common, requiring protein 
precipitation followed by acid hydrolysis of the protein pellet. Studies on the 
presence of BMAA in algal species provide contradictory results, with the use of 
unvalidated sample preparation/extraction and analysis a primary cause. Like 
most NPAAs, protein precipitation in 10% aqueous TCA and hydrolysis with fuming 
HCl is the most appropriate form of extraction for BMAA and its isomers 
aminoethylglycine (AEG) and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB). The present 
protocol describes the steps in a validated NPAA extraction method commonly used 
in research and teaching laboratories."
1539,"Potassium chloride cotransporters 2 (KCC2) is a member of the solute carrier 
family 12 (SLC12) of cation-chloride-cotransporters (CCCs), found exclusively in 
the neuron and is essential for the proper functioning of Cl- homeostasis and 
consequently functional GABAergic inhibition. Failure in proper regulation of 
KCC2 is deleterious and has been associated with the prevalence of several 
neurological diseases, including epilepsy. There has been considerable progress 
with regard to understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of KCC2, 
accredited to the development of techniques that enable researchers to study its 
functions and activities; either via direct (assessing kinase regulatory sites 
phosphorylation) or indirect (observing and monitoring GABA activity) 
investigations. Here, the protocol highlights how to investigate KCC2 
phosphorylation at kinase regulatory sites - Thr906 and Thr1007- using western 
blotting technique. There are other classic methods used to directly measure 
KCC2 activity, such as rubidium ion and thallium ion uptake assay. Further 
techniques such as patch-clamp-electrophysiology are used to measure GABA 
activity; hence, indirectly reflecting activated and/or inactivated KCC2 as 
informed by the assessment of intracellular chloride ion homeostasis. A few of 
these additional techniques will be briefly discussed in this manuscript."
1540,"One of the challenges in retina research is studying the cross-talk between 
different retinal cells such as retinal neurons, glial cells, and vascular 
cells. Isolating, culturing, and sustaining retinal neurons in vitro have 
technical and biological limitations. Culturing retinal explants may overcome 
these limitations and offer a unique ex vivo model to study the cross-talk 
between various retinal cells with well-controlled biochemical parameters and 
independent of the vascular system. Moreover, retinal explants are an effective 
screening tool for studying novel pharmacological interventions in various 
retinal vascular and neurodegenerative diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. 
Here, we describe a detailed protocol for retinal explants' isolation and 
culture for an extended period. The manuscript also presents some of the 
technical problems during this procedure that may affect the desired outcomes 
and reproducibility of the retinal explant culture. The immunostaining of the 
retinal vessels, glial cells, and neurons demonstrated intact retinal 
capillaries and neuroglial cells after 2 weeks from the beginning of the retinal 
explant culture. This establishes retinal explants as a reliable tool for 
studying changes in the retinal vasculature and neuroglial cells under 
conditions that mimic retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy."
1541,"The presence of biofilms in the dairy industry is of major concern, as they may 
lead to the production of unsafe and altered dairy products due to their high 
resistance to most clean-in-place (CIP) procedures frequently used in processing 
plants. Therefore, it is imperative to develop new biofilm control strategies 
for the dairy industry. This protocol is aimed at evaluating the efficacy of 
organic peroxyacids (peracetic, perpropionic, and perlactic acids and a 
commercial peracetic acid-based disinfectant) for eradicating dairy biofilms 
using a combination of static and dynamic methods. All the disinfectants were 
tested on the strongest biofilm-producing bacteria in either a single or a mixed 
biofilm using the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay, a 
static high-throughput screening method. A contact time of 5 min with the 
disinfectants at the recommended concentrations successfully eradicated both the 
single and mixed biofilms. Studies are currently ongoing to confirm these 
observations using the Center for Disease Control (CDC) biofilm reactor, a 
dynamic method to mimic in situ conditions. This type of bioreactor enables the 
use of a stainless-steel surface, which constitutes most industrial equipment 
and surfaces. The preliminary results from the reactor appear to confirm the 
efficacy of organic peroxyacids against biofilms. The combined approach 
described in this study may be used to develop and test new biological or 
chemical formulations for controlling biofilms and eradicating microorganisms."
1542,"The liver is a complex and heterogenous tissue responsible for carrying out many 
critical physiological functions, such as the maintenance of energy homeostasis 
and the metabolism of xenobiotics, among others. These tasks are performed 
through tight coordination between hepatic parenchymal and non-parenchymal 
cells. Additionally, various metabolic activities are confined to specific areas 
of the hepatic lobule-a phenomenon called liver zonation. Recent advances in 
single-cell sequencing technologies have empowered researchers to investigate 
tissue heterogeneity at a single-cell resolution. In many complex tissues, 
including the liver, harsh enzymatic and/or mechanical dissociation protocols 
can negatively affect the viability or the quality of the single-cell 
suspensions needed to comprehensively characterize this organ in health and 
disease. This paper describes a robust and reproducible protocol for isolating 
nuclei from frozen, archived liver tissues. This method yields high-quality 
nuclei that are compatible with downstream, single-cell omics approaches, 
including single-nucleus RNA-seq, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin 
with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), as well as multimodal omics (joint 
RNA-seq and ATAC-seq). This method has been successfully used for the isolation 
of nuclei from healthy and diseased human, mouse, and non-human primate frozen 
liver samples. This approach allows the unbiased isolation of all the major cell 
types in the liver and, therefore, offers a robust methodology for studying the 
liver at the single-cell resolution."
1543,"Pluripotent stem cells can generate complex tissue organoids that are useful for 
in vitro disease modeling studies and for developing regenerative therapies. 
This protocol describes a simpler, robust, and stepwise method of generating 
retinal organoids in a hybrid culture system consisting of adherent monolayer 
cultures during the first 4 weeks of retinal differentiation till the emergence 
of distinct, self-organized eye field primordial clusters (EFPs). Further, the 
doughnut-shaped, circular, and translucent neuro-retinal islands within each EFP 
are manually picked and cultured under suspension using non-adherent culture 
dishes in a retinal differentiation medium for 1-2 weeks to generate 
multilayered 3D optic cups (OC-1M). These immature retinal organoids contain 
PAX6+ and ChX10+ proliferating, multipotent retinal precursors. The precursor 
cells are linearly self-assembled within the organoids and appear as distinct 
radial striations. At 4 weeks after suspension culture, the retinal progenitors 
undergo post-mitotic arrest and lineage differentiation to form mature retinal 
organoids (OC-2M). The photoreceptor lineage committed precursors develop within 
the outermost layers of retinal organoids. These CRX+ and RCVRN+ photoreceptor 
cells morphologically mature to display inner segment-like extensions. This 
method can be adopted for generating retinal organoids using human embryonic 
stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). All steps and 
procedures are clearly explained and demonstrated to ensure replicability and 
for wider applications in basic science and translational research."
1544,"Neurodegenerative disorders are common and heterogeneous in terms of their 
symptoms and cellular affectation, making their study complicated due to the 
lack of proper animal models that fully mimic human diseases and the poor 
availability of post-mortem human brain tissue. Adult human nervous tissue 
culture offers the possibility to study different aspects of neurological 
disorders. Molecular, cellular, and biochemical mechanisms could be easily 
addressed in this system, as well as testing and validating drugs or different 
treatments, such as cell-based therapies. This method combines long-term 
organotypic cultures of the adult human cortex, obtained from epileptic patients 
undergoing resective surgery, and ex vivo intracortical transplantation of 
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical progenitors. This method will 
allow the study of cell survival, neuronal differentiation, the formation of 
synaptic inputs and outputs, and the electrophysiological properties of 
human-derived cells after transplantation into intact adult human cortical 
tissue. This approach is an important step prior to the development of a 3D 
human disease modeling platform that will bring basic research closer to the 
clinical translation of stem cell-based therapies for patients with different 
neurological disorders and allow the development of new tools for reconstructing 
damaged neural circuits."
1545,"Duck viral hepatitis (DVH), mainly caused by duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV), is a 
highly fatal and rapidly spreading infectious disease of young ducklings that 
seriously jeopardises the duck industry worldwide. DHAV type 1 (DHAV-1) is the 
main genotype responsible for disease outbreaks since 1945, and the disease 
situation is complicated by the emergence and dissemination of a novel genotype 
(DHAV-3) in some countries in Asia and Africa. Live attenuated DHAV vaccines are 
widely used to induce a considerable degree of protection in ducklings. Breeder 
ducks are immunised with inactivated or/and live DHAV vaccines to achieve 
satisfactory levels of passive immunity in progeny. In addition, novel 
characteristics of virus transmission, pathogenicity and pathogenesis of DHAV 
were recently characterised, which necessitate the development of new vaccines 
and effective vaccination programmes against DVH. Therefore, a systematic 
dissection of the profiles, strengths and shortcomings of the available DHAV 
vaccines is essential. Moreover, to further increase the efficiency of vaccine 
production and administration, the development of next-generation DHAV vaccines 
using the cutting-edge technologies is also required. In this review, based on a 
comprehensive summary of the research advances in the epidemiology, 
pathogenicity, and genomic features of DHAV, we focus on reviewing and analysing 
the features of the commercial and experimental DHAV vaccines. We also proposed 
perspectives for disease control based on the specific disease situations in 
different countries. This review provided essential information for vaccine 
development and disease control of DVH."
1546,"OBJECTIVE: We examined medical records to determine health conditions associated 
with dementia at varied intervals prior to dementia diagnosis in participants 
from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).
METHODS: Data were available for 347 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 76 vascular 
dementia (VaD), and 811 control participants without dementia. Logistic 
regressions were performed associating ICD-9 health codes with dementia status 
across all timepoints, at 5 and 1 year(s) prior to dementia diagnosis, and at 
the year of diagnosis, controlling for age, sex and follow-up length of the 
medical record.
RESULTS: In AD, the earliest and most consistent associations across all time 
points included depression, erectile dysfunction, gait abnormalities, hearing 
loss, and nervous and musculoskeletal symptoms. Cardiomegaly, urinary 
incontinence, non-epithelial skin cancer, and pneumonia were not significant 
until 1 year before dementia diagnosis. In VaD, the earliest and most consistent 
associations across all time points included abnormal EKG, cardiac dysrhythmias, 
cerebrovascular disease, non-epithelial skin cancer, depression, and hearing 
loss. Atrial fibrillation, occlusion of cerebral arteries, essential tremor, and 
abnormal reflexes were not significant until 1 year before dementia diagnosis.
INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that some health conditions are 
associated with future dementia beginning at least 5 years before dementia 
diagnosis and are consistently seen over time, while others only reach 
significance closer to the date of diagnosis. These results also show that there 
are both shared and distinctive health conditions associated with AD and VaD. 
These results reinforce the need for medical intervention and treatment to 
lessen the impact of health comorbidities in the aging population. This article

1547,"BACKGROUND: : The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is relatively high in Saudi 
Arabia, and little is known about the accuracy of serological markers in the 
local population. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of 
various serological markers for detecting CD in Saudi children and adults.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 148 CD patients and 512 controls 
to assess the diagnostic performances of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase 
antibodies (TTG), IgG anti-TTG, IgA anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies 
(anti-DGP), IgG anti-DGP, and endomysium antibodies (EMA).
RESULTS: : Immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-TTG was the most sensitive test [98.9% 
(95% confidence interval (CI) 94.1-99.8%)], while EMA was the most specific 
[100%, 95%CI 98.6-100%]. By applying the criteria of IgA anti-TTG titers ≥10 × 
upper limit of normal (ULN) and positive EMA, 57.3% of patients could have 
avoided intestinal biopsy. IgG anti-DGP test had a sensitivity of 85.9% (95% CI 
= 77.3-91.5%) and a specificity of 93.5% (95% CI = (90.0-95.9%). Titers of IgA 
anti-TTG, IgA anti-DGP, and IgG anti-DGP were higher in CD patients with the 
Marsh 3c class than in those with the Marsh 3b and Marsh 3a classes. IgG 
anti-TTG and IgA anti-DGP had no additional diagnostic value.
CONCLUSIONS: : IgA anti-TTG and EMA are excellent CD markers in children and 
adults. The use of IgA anti-TTG titers ≥10 × ULN and positive EMA as criteria 
for CD diagnosis in children and adults might be a good alternative to 
intestinal biopsy."
1548,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the therapeutic opportunities for 
patients with psychological disorders when they may decline to take medication. 
We sought to systematically compare the anesthetic efficacy of ketamine, 
propofol, and dexmedetomidine for electroconvulsive therapy in 
treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients. This double-blind trial 
enrolled treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients (n = 85) who had 
been hospitalized for ECT in the Amir Kabir Hospital's psychiatric ward (Arak, 
Iran). The ketamine, propofol, and dexmedetomidine groups received a dose of 0.2 
μg/kg ketamine, 1.5 mg/kg propofol, and 0.8 mg/kg dexmedetomidine, respectively. 
In all intervention groups, 10 mL of interventional drugs was injected 
intravenously for 10 minutes, and in the placebo group, 10 mL of normal saline 
was given over the same period. The dexmedetomidine group's blood pressure was 
revealed comparatively lower at all times. Dexmedetomidine-treated patients 
showed their marked satisfaction, while those treated with propofol had shorter 
recovery time, shorter seizure duration, and shorter time to achieve an Aldrete 
score of 9-10 and increased relaxation, and next dexmedetomidine produced deeper 
relaxation. Propofol could shorten recovery time and seizure duration, and 
enhance relaxation, while dexmedetomidine was associated with higher patient 
satisfaction. Considering that any anesthetic which does not shorten seizure 
duration may serve efficiently for ECT and that ketamine-treated patients had 
more prolonged seizure duration, the preferred drug can hence be considered from 
various angles, thereby offering anesthetic agents with highly favorable 
efficacy in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients needing ECT. 
The drug choice thus depends on physical conditions, underlying diseases, and 
psychiatrist consultation."
1549,"Intestinal bacteria can be classified into ""beneficial bacteria"" and ""harmful 
bacteria."" However, it is difficult to explain the mechanisms that make 
""beneficial bacteria"" truly beneficial to human health. This issue can be 
addressed by focusing on hydrogen-producing bacteria in the intestines. Although 
it is widely known that molecular hydrogen can react with hydroxyl radicals, 
generated in the mitochondria, to protect cells from oxidative stress, the 
beneficial effects of hydrogen are not fully pervasive because it is not 
generally thought to be metabolized in vivo. In recent years, it has become 
clear that there is a close relationship between the amount of hydrogen produced 
by intestinal bacteria and various diseases, and this report discusses this 
relationship."
1550,"Hydrogen (H2) has been widely used in the chemical industry as a reducing agent. 
As the researches move along, increasing attention has been paid to its 
biological functions. The selective antioxidant effect of hydrogen is considered 
to be the main reason for medical applications. So far, many studies have 
confirmed its potential protective effects on ischemia/reperfusion injury of 
multiple organs, neurodegenerative diseases, bone and joint diseases, and 
respiratory diseases, opening a new era in the medical research and application 
of H2. Increasing studies have focused on its biological effects and molecular 
mechanisms in the treatment of different diseases. In this paper, we review the 
biological effects, molecular mechanisms and methods of H2 supply. We do hope 
that the advances in materials science can be better translated into medical 
applications and solve clinical problems. The medical application of H2 is 
promising, and how to prepare an H2 sustained-release system to achieve a 
sustained and stable H2 supply in the body and ultimately improve the 
therapeutic effect of H2 is a problem worthy of further investigation."
1551,"Reactive oxygen species and other free radicals cause oxidative stress which is 
the underlying pathogenesis of cellular injury in various neurological diseases. 
Molecular hydrogen therapy with its unique biological property of selectively 
scavenging pathological free radicals has demonstrated therapeutic potential in 
innumerable animal studies and some clinical trials. These studies have 
implicated several cellular pathways affected by hydrogen therapy in explaining 
its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. This article reviews relevant 
animal and clinical studies that demonstrate neuroprotective effects of hydrogen 
therapy in stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, neurotrauma, and global brain 
injury."
1552,"Activating V600E in v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) is a 
common driver mutation in cancers of multiple tissue origins, including melanoma 
and glioma. BRAFV600E has also been implicated in neurodegeneration. The present 
study aims to characterize BRAFV600E during cell death and proliferation of 
three major cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, and 
microglia. Multiple primary cultures (primary cortical mixed culture) and cell 
lines of glial cells (BV2) and neurons (SH-SY5Y) were employed. BRAFV600E and 
BRAFWT expression was mediated by lentivirus or retrovirus. Blockage of 
downstream effectors (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and JNK1/2) were 
achieved by siRNA. In astrocytes and microglia, BRAFV600E induces cell 
proliferation, and the proliferative effect in microglia is mediated by 
activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, but not c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase. Conditioned medium from BRAFV600E-expressing microglia induced neuronal 
death. In neuronal cells, BRAFV600E directly induces neuronal death, through 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase. We 
further show that BRAF-related genes are enriched in pathways in patients with 
Parkinson's disease. Our study identifies distinct consequences mediated by 
distinct downstream effectors in dividing glial cells and in neurons following 
the same BRAF mutational activation and a causal link between BRAF-activated 
microglia and neuronal cell death that does not require physical proximity. It 
provides insight into a possibly important role of BRAF in neurodegeneration as 
a result of either dysregulated BRAF in neurons or its impact on glial cells."
1553,"Neurotrophic factors, particularly nerve growth factor, enhance neuronal 
regeneration. However, the in vivo applications of nerve growth factor are 
largely limited by its intrinsic disadvantages, such as its short biological 
half-life, its contribution to pain response, and its inability to cross the 
blood-brain barrier. Considering that let-7 (human miRNA) targets and regulates 
nerve growth factor, and that let-7 is a core regulator in peripheral nerve 
regeneration, we evaluated the possibilities of let-7 application in nerve 
repair. In this study, anti-let-7a was identified as the most suitable let-7 
family molecule by analyses of endogenous expression and regulatory 
relationship, and functional screening. Let-7a antagomir demonstrated biosafety 
based on the results of in vivo safety assessments and it entered into the main 
cell types of the sciatic nerve, including Schwann cells, fibroblasts and 
macrophages. Use of hydrogel effectively achieved controlled, localized, and 
sustained delivery of let-7a antagomir. Finally, let-7a antagomir was integrated 
into chitosan conduit to construct a chitosan-hydrogel scaffold 
tissue-engineered nerve graft, which promoted nerve regeneration and functional 
recovery in a rat model of sciatic nerve transection. Our study provides an 
experimental basis for potential in vivo application of let-7a."
1554,"Emodin, a substance extracted from herbs such as rhubarb, has a protective 
effect on the central nervous system. However, the potential therapeutic effect 
of emodin in the context of multiple sclerosis remains unknown. In this study, a 
rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was established by immune 
induction to simulate multiple sclerosis, and the rats were intraperitoneally 
injected with emodin (20 mg/kg/d) from the day of immune induction until they 
were sacrificed. In this model, the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor 
family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the microglia 
exacerbated neuroinflammation, playing an important role in the development of 
multiple sclerosis. In addition, silent information regulator of transcription 1 
(SIRT1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1α) 
was found to inhibit activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and SIRT1 activation 
reduced disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. 
Furthermore, treatment with emodin decreased body weight loss and 
neurobehavioral deficits, alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration and 
demyelination, reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, inhibited 
microglial aggregation and activation, decreased the levels of NLRP3 signaling 
pathway molecules, and increased the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1α. These 
findings suggest that emodin improves the symptoms of experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis, possibly through regulating the SIRT1/PGC-1α/NLRP3 signaling 
pathway and inhibiting microglial inflammation. These findings provide 
experimental evidence for treatment of multiple sclerosis with emodin, enlarging 
the scope of clinical application for emodin."
1555,"The adult cortex has long been regarded as non-neurogenic. Whether injury can 
induce neurogenesis in the adult cortex is still controversial. Here, we report 
that focal ischemia stimulates a transient wave of local neurogenesis. Using 
5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling, we demonstrated a rapid generation of 
doublecortin-positive neuroblasts that died quickly in mouse cerebral cortex 
following ischemia. Nestin-CreER-based cell ablation and fate mapping showed a 
small contribution of neuroblasts by subventricular zone neural stem cells. 
Using a mini-photothrombotic ischemia mouse model and retrovirus expressing 
green fluorescent protein labeling, we observed maturation of locally generated 
new neurons. Furthermore, fate tracing analyses using PDGFRα-, GFAP-, and 
Sox2-CreER mice showed a transient wave of neuroblast generation in mild 
ischemic cortex and identified that Sox2-positive astrocytes were the major 
neurogenic cells in adult cortex. In addition, a similar upregulation of Sox2 
and appearance of neuroblasts were observed in the focal ischemic cortex of 
Macaca mulatta. Our findings demonstrated a transient neurogenic response of 
Sox2-positive astrocytes in ischemic cortex, which suggests the possibility of 
inducing neuronal regeneration by amplifying this intrinsic response in the 
future."
1556,"CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 can inhibit ferroptosis, which has been associated 
with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, in individuals with head and neck cancer. 
Therefore, CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 may be implicated in cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury. To validate this hypothesis in the present study, 
we established mouse models of occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and HT22 
cell models of oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation to mimic cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo and in vitro, respectively. We found 
remarkably decreased CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 expression in the mouse brain 
tissue and HT22 cells. When we used adeno-associated virus and plasmid to 
up-regulate CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 expression in the brain tissue and HT22 
cell models separately, mouse neurological dysfunction was greatly improved; the 
cerebral infarct volume was reduced; the survival rate of HT22 cells was 
increased; HT22 cell injury was alleviated; the expression of 
ferroptosis-related glutathione peroxidase 4, cystine-glutamate antiporter, and 
glutathione was increased; the levels of malondialdehyde, iron ions, and the 
expression of transferrin receptor 1 were decreased; and the expression of 
nuclear-factor E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 was increased. Inhibition of 
CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 upregulation via the nuclear-factor E2-related factor 
2 inhibitor ML385 in oxygen-glucose deprived and reoxygenated HT22 cells blocked 
the neuroprotective effects of CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 up-regulation and the 
activation of the nuclear-factor E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 pathway. 
Our data indicate that the up-regulation of CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 can 
attenuate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, thus providing theoretical 
support from the perspectives of cytology and experimental zoology for the use 
of this protein as a therapeutic target in patients with cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury."
1557,"Alteration of the outer retina leads to various diseases such as age-related 
macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa characterized by decreased visual 
acuity and ultimately blindness. Despite intensive research in the field of 
retinal disorders, there is currently no curative treatment. Several therapeutic 
approaches such as cell-based replacement and gene therapies are currently in 
development. In the context of cell-based therapies, different cell sources such 
as embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, or multipotent stem 
cells can be used for transplantation. In the vast majority of human clinical 
trials, retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptors are the cell types 
considered for replacement cell therapies. In this review, we summarize the 
progress made in stem cell therapies ranging from the pre-clinical studies to 
clinical trials for retinal disease."
1558,"Huntington's disease is a genetic disease caused by expanded CAG repeats on exon 
1 of the huntingtin gene located on chromosome 4. Compelling evidence implicates 
impaired mitochondrial energetics, altered mitochondrial biogenesis and quality 
control, disturbed mitochondrial trafficking, oxidative stress and mitochondrial 
calcium dyshomeostasis in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Unfortunately, 
conventional mitochondrial-targeted molecules, such as cysteamine, creatine, 
coenzyme Q10, or triheptanoin, yielded negative or inconclusive results. 
However, future therapeutic strategies, aiming to restore mitochondrial 
biogenesis, improving the fission/fusion balance, and improving mitochondrial 
trafficking, could prove useful tools in improving the phenotype of Huntington's 
disease and, used in combination with genome-editing methods, could lead to a 
cure for the disease."
1559,"Evidence from genetics and from analyzing cellular and animal models have 
converged to suggest links between neurodegenerative disorders of early and late 
life. Here, we summarize emerging links between the most common late life 
neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, and the most common early life 
neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. Genetic studies 
reported an overlap of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and mutations in 
genes known to cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. Accumulating data strongly 
suggest dysfunction of intracellular trafficking mechanisms and the 
autophagy-endolysosome system in both types of neurodegenerative disorders. This 
suggests shared cytopathological processes underlying these different types of 
neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of the common mechanisms 
underlying the different diseases is important as this might lead to the 
identification of novel targets for therapeutic concepts, the transfer of 
therapeutic strategies from one disease to the other and therapeutic approaches 
tailored to patients with specific mutations. Here, we review dysfunctions of 
the endolysosomal autophagy pathway in Alzheimer's disease and neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinoses and summarize emerging etiologic and genetic overlaps."
1560,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition characterized by damage to 
the spinal cord resulting in loss of function, mobility, and sensation with no 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved cure. Enolase, a multifunctional 
glycolytic enzyme upregulated after SCI, promotes pro- and anti-inflammatory 
events and regulates functional recovery in SCI. Enolase is normally expressed 
in the cytosol, but the expression is upregulated at the cell surface following 
cellular injury, promoting glial cell activation and signal transduction pathway 
activation. SCI-induced microglia activation triggers pro-inflammatory mediators 
at the injury site, activating other immune cells and metabolic events, i.e., 
Rho-associated kinase, contributing to the neuroinflammation found in SCI. 
Enolase surface expression also activates cathepsin X, resulting in cleavage of 
the C-terminal end of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and non-neuronal enolase 
(NNE). Fully functional enolase is necessary as NSE/NNE C-terminal proteins 
activate many neurotrophic processes, i.e., the plasminogen activation system, 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/protein kinase B, and 
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Studies 
here suggest an enolase inhibitor, ENOblock, attenuates the activation of 
Rho-associated kinase, which may decrease glial cell activation and promote 
functional recovery following SCI. Also, ENOblock inhibits cathepsin X, which 
may help prevent the cleavage of the neurotrophic C-terminal protein allowing 
full plasminogen activation and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 
3-kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. The combined NSE/cathepsin X 
inhibition may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing 
neuroinflammation/degeneration and promoting neural cell regeneration and 
recovery following SCI. The role of cell membrane-expressed enolase and 
associated metabolic events should be investigated to determine if the same 
strategies can be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, this 
review discusses the importance of enolase activation and inhibition as a 
potential therapeutic target following SCI to promote neuronal survival and 
regeneration."
1561,"Parkinson's disease is the most common movement disorder, affecting about 1% of 
the population over the age of 60 years. Parkinson's disease is characterized 
clinically by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability, 
as a result of the progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. In 
addition to this neuronal cell loss, Parkinson's disease is characterized by the 
accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, 
composed primarily of the protein α-synuclein. Although it was first described 
almost 200 years ago, there are no disease-modifying drugs to treat patients 
with Parkinson's disease. In addition to conventional therapies, 
non-pharmacological treatment strategies are under investigation in patients and 
animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. Among such strategies, 
environmental enrichment, comprising physical exercise, cognitive stimulus, and 
social interactions, has been assessed in preclinical models of Parkinson's 
disease. Environmental enrichment can cause structural and functional changes in 
the brain and promote neurogenesis and dendritic growth by modifying gene 
expression, enhancing the expression of neurotrophic factors and modulating 
neurotransmission. In this review article, we focus on the current knowledge 
about the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental enrichment 
neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease, highlighting its influence on the 
dopaminergic, cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic systems, as well as the 
involvement of neurotrophic factors. We describe experimental pre-clinical data 
showing how environmental enrichment can act as a modulator in a neurochemical 
and behavioral context in different animal models of Parkinson's disease, 
highlighting the potential of environmental enrichment as an additional strategy 
in the management and prevention of this complex disease."
1562,"Epigenetics focuses on DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin 
remodeling, noncoding RNAs, and other gene regulation mechanisms beyond the DNA 
sequence. In the past decade, epigenetic modifications have drawn more attention 
as they participate in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy 
despite tight control of glucose levels. The underlying mechanisms of epigenetic 
modifications in diabetic retinopathy still urgently need to be elucidated. The 
diabetic condition facilitates epigenetic changes and influences target gene 
expression. In this review, we summarize the involvement of epigenetic 
modifications and metabolic memory in the development and progression of 
diabetic retinopathy and propose novel insights into the treatment of diabetic 
retinopathy."
1563,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (CMT) constitute a group of common but highly 
heterogeneous, non-syndromic genetic disorders affecting predominantly the 
peripheral nervous system. CMT type 1A (CMT1A) is the most frequent type and 
accounts for almost ~50% of all diagnosed CMT cases. CMT1A results from the 
duplication of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Overexpression of 
PMP22 protein overloads the protein folding apparatus in Schwann cells and 
activates the unfolded protein response. This leads to Schwann cell apoptosis, 
dys- and de- myelination and secondary axonal degeneration, ultimately causing 
neurological disabilities. During the last decades, several different gene 
therapies have been developed to treat CMT1A. Almost all of them remain at the 
pre-clinical stage using CMT1A animal models overexpressing PMP22. The 
therapeutic goal is to achieve gene silencing, directly or indirectly, thereby 
reversing the CMT1A genetic mechanism allowing the recovery of myelination and 
prevention of axonal loss. As promising treatments are rapidly emerging, 
treatment-responsive and clinically relevant biomarkers are becoming necessary. 
These biomarkers and sensitive clinical evaluation tools will facilitate the 
design and successful completion of future clinical trials for CMT1A."
1564,"Alternative splicing is the process of producing variably spliced mRNAs by 
choosing distinct combinations of splice sites within a messenger RNA precursor. 
This splicing enables mRNA from a single gene to synthesize different proteins, 
which have different cellular properties and functions and yet arise from the 
same single gene. A family of splicing factors, Serine-arginine rich proteins, 
are needed to initiate the assembly and activation of the spliceosome. Serine 
and arginine rich splicing factor 1, part of the arginine/serine-rich splicing 
factor protein family, can either activate or inhibit the splicing of mRNAs, 
depending on the phosphorylation status of the protein and its interaction 
partners. Considering that serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 is either 
an activator or an inhibitor, this protein has been studied widely to identify 
its various roles in different diseases. Research has found that serine and 
arginine rich splicing factor 1 is a key target for neuroprotection, showing its 
promising potential use in therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders. 
Furthermore, serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 might be used to 
regulate cancer development and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we 
highlight how serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 has been studied 
concerning neuroprotection. In addition, we draw attention to how serine and 
arginine rich splicing factor 1 is being studied in cancer and immunological 
disorders, as well as how serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 acts 
outside the central or peripheral nervous system."
1565,"In light of the rising evidence of the association between viral and bacterial 
infections and neurodegeneration, we aimed at revisiting the infectious 
hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and analyzing the possible implications of 
COVID-19 neurological sequelae in long-term neurodegeneration. We wondered how 
SARS-CoV-2 could be related to the amyloid-β cascade and how it could lead to 
the pathological hallmarks of the disease. We also predict a paradigm change in 
clinical medicine, which now has a great opportunity to conduct prospective 
surveillance of cognitive sequelae and progression to dementia in people who 
suffered severe infections together with other risk factors for Alzheimer's 
disease."
1566,"As the average age of the world population increases, more people will face 
debilitating aging-associated conditions, including dementia and stroke. Not 
only does the incidence of these conditions increase with age, but the recovery 
afterward is often worse in older patients. Researchers and health professionals 
must unveil and understand the factors behind age-associated diseases to develop 
a therapy for older patients. Aging causes profound changes in the immune system 
including the activation of microglia in the brain. Activated microglia promote 
T lymphocyte transmigration leading to an increase in neuroinflammation, white 
matter damage, and cognitive impairment in both older humans and rodents. The 
presence of T and B lymphocytes is observed in the aged brain and correlates 
with worse stroke outcomes. Preclinical strategies in stroke target either 
microglia or the lymphocytes or the communications between them to promote 
functional recovery in aged subjects. In this review, we examine the role of the 
microglia and T and B lymphocytes in aging and how they contribute to cognitive 
impairment. Additionally, we provide an important update on the contribution of 
these cells and their interactions in preclinical aged stroke."
1567,"INTRODUCTION: Emerging and re-emerging viral diseases are a major threat to 
public health. Proper laboratory surveillance plays an important role in 
estimating the disease burden that helps in taking preventive measures for 
controlling seasonal diseases. This study focuses on the prevalence of different 
viral diseases in the state of Odisha, India, from 2010-2017.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 43,397 patients with clinical suspicion of 
viral diseases were screened for different viral etiology during 2010-2017. The 
laboratory diagnosis was conducted by serology (ELISA) and RealTime RT-PCR for 
24 different viruses, i.e., Dengue, Chikungunya, Japanese Encephalitis, 
Hepatitis A Virus, Hepatitis E Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, 
Rotavirus, Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and Herpes Simplex Virus-2, Epstein -Barr 
Virus & Cytomegalo Virus, and respiratory viruses. Patients were enrolled from 
sporadic hospital admissions and outbreaks under different categories as per 
clinical diagnosis like fever with rash, diarrhoea, encephalitis, jaundice, 
respiratory illness, and fever of unknown etiology.
RESULTS: The majority of patients belonged to exanthematous group, i.e., fever 
with rash (32.24%). The number of males were more in all categories except fever 
with rash, where females (53.34%) were more. Children <16 years of age were 
found to be the predominant age group for suspected viral diarrhoea (85.26%), 
encephalitis (76.96%), fever of unknown origin (40.16%), and respiratory 
infections (27.23%).
CONCLUSION: Odisha being one of the coastal states in the country, reports many 
viral illnesses due to its typical geographical location. Initially, it was 
thought to be the only vector-borne disease that posed a threat to the state, 
but subsequently, other viral illnesses were also diagnosed and reported. This 
is the first report of laboratory confirmation and distribution of different 
viral diseases in the state of Odisha and neighboring regions, which will 
support public health management."
1568,"Edwardsiella tarda (ET) and Edwardsiella anguillarum (EA) are the most harmful 
bacterial fish pathogens in Taiwan. However, there is confusion regarding the 
genotypic identification of E. tarda and E. piscicida (EP). Therefore, we used a 
novel Nanopore MinION MK1C platform to sequence and compare the complete genomes 
of E. piscicida and E. anguillarum. The number of coding genes, rRNA, and tRNA 
recorded for E. anguillarum and E. piscicida were 8322, 25, and 98, and 5458, 
25, and 98, respectively. Ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) for 
E. piscicida indicated 35 rps. The shared clusters between E. anguillarum and 
E. piscicida indicated several unique clusters for the individual genomes. The 
phylogenetic tree analysis for all complete genomes indicated that 
E. anguillarum and E. piscicida were placed into two species-specific genotypes. 
Distribution of subsystems for annotated genomes found that genes related to 
virulence, defence, and disease for E. anguillarum were 103 and those for 
E. piscicida were 60 and pathogenic islands (PI) were 498 and 225, respectively. 
Vaccine candidates were identified in silico from the core genes using high 
antigenic, solubility, and secretion probabilities. Altogether, the genome data 
revealed distinctive features between E. anguillarum and E. piscicida, which 
suggest different pathogenicity and thus the need for separate preventive 
strategies."
1569,"Helminths are large multicellular parasites responsible for widespread chronic 
disease in humans and animals. Intestinal helminths live in close proximity with 
the host gut microbiota and mucosal immune network, resulting in reciprocal 
interactions that closely influence the course of infections. Diet composition 
may strongly regulate gut microbiota composition and intestinal immune function 
and therefore may play a key role in modulating anti-helminth immune responses. 
Characterizing the multitude of interactions that exist between different 
dietary components (e.g. dietary fibers), immune cells, and the microbiota, may 
shed new light on regulation of helminth-specific immunity. This review focuses 
on our current knowledge of how metabolism of dietary components shapes immune 
response during helminth infection, and how we may potentially harness this 
information to design new therapeutics to manage parasitic infections and 
associated diseases. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1570,"New coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic, has brought about a huge burden on global healthcare 
systems. Rapid and early detection is important to prevent the spread of the 
pandemic. Here, an assay based on CRISPR/Cas13a and catalytic hairpin assembly 
(CHA), termed as Cas-CHA, was developed for ultrasensitive and specific 
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Upon specific recognition of the target, the 
CRISPR/Cas13a collaterally cleaved a well-designed hairpin reporter and 
triggered the CHA reaction. Under optimized conditions, the assay detected the 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a wide range of 100 aM to 100 nM and realized a low 
detection limit of 84 aM. At the same time, the whole detecting process could be 
completed within 35 min. More importantly, the assay was able to distinguish 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from common human coronaviruses and analyze in saliva samples. By 
the flexible design of crRNA, the assay was expanded to detect other viruses. 
The clinical sample analysis verified that the proposed assay held a great 
potential for practical testing."
1571,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected disease with a broad spectrum of 
clinical manifestations and involvement of visceral organs. Organ-specific 
immune response against the Leishmania donovani (Ld) complex is not yet 
understood due to the unavailability of an appropriate experimental model. In 
reference to our recent work on comparing the hamster model with VL patients, it 
is now possible to understand immune profiling in different visceral organs. 
This may offer an answer to varying parasite loads in different visceral organs 
in the same host. Herein, we analyzed a panel of immune markers (Th-2/Th-1) in 
visceral organs of Ld-infected hamsters and quantified parasitic load in the 
same tissues using qPCR assay. In spleen, liver, bone marrow and lymph node 
(mesenteric) from Ld infected hamsters, the parasite burden was quantified along 
with mRNA expression of a panel of Th-2 and Th-1 type immune markers viz. IL-10, 
IL-4, Arginase-I, GATA-3, SOCS-3, IL-12, IFN-γ, iNOS, T-bet and SOCS-5. A clear 
dichotomy was absent between Th-2 and Th-1 type immune markers and the major 
players of this immune response were found to be IFN-γ, IL-10, T-bet, GATA-3, 
SOCS-5 and SOCS-3. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1572,"Assays to evaluate the susceptibility of Simulium larvae to temephos and 
Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis (Bti) were carried out by setting-up an 
in vitro laboratory test ('bio assay') and a semi-natural test ('système de 
goutières') to assess the LC50/LC90 values. Larvae of Simulium species in 
Cameroon (S. damnosum s.l., S. hargreavesi, S. vorax and S. cervicornutum) and 
(S. (Odagmia) ornatum and S. latipes) in Germany were identified and tested. In 
the bio-assay, 50 larvae were exposed for 10 min to concentrations from 0.01 to 
10 ppm. For the Simulium from Germany, the LC50 (LC90) values after 3 and 6 h 
were 3.1 (27.9) and 0.14 (1.26) ppm for temephos and for Bti 7.8 (70.2) and 1.7 
(15.3) ppm, respectively. For Cameroonian species, the values of LC50 (LC90) 
were lower, that is, 0.42 (8.04), 0.14 (2.70) and 0.073 (1.38) ppm, 
respectively, after 3, 6 and 12 h for temephos. In a semi natural condition, the 
LC50 of 10 min of application of temephos was 0.84 ppm after 3 h and a working 
solution (2.6 L) of Bti killed 50% after 6 h. To detect an upcoming of any 
resistance as it happened in Ivory Coast, a study of the occurrence resistance 
genes should be implemented."
1573,"The pathogenesis of chronic intervillositis of unknown etiology (CIUE) may 
involve IFNγ overexpression. This study assesses the extent of IFNγ expression 
in CIUE by immunohistochemistry and compares it to spontaneous pregnancy losses. 
C4d deposition is also assessed to see whether IFNγ and C4d might represent 
separate diagnostic categories. Placenta from first to early second trimester 
with high grade CIUE (CHG; 17 cases) and low grade CIUE (CLG; 12 cases) is 
compared to euploid (SPLN; 18 cases), aneuploid spontaneous pregnancy losses 
(SPLA, 17 cases), normal placenta (NP, 13 cases). Protein level expression of 
IFNγ and C4d is assessed on whole tissue sections by immunohistochemistry. 35% 
of CHG and 42% of CLG show some level of IFNγ expression localized to the 
luminal surface of syncytiotrophoblast. 12% of SPLA and no SPLN or NP cases are 
IFNγ positive. C4d deposition is seen in 100% of CIUE, 88% of SPLA, 83% of SPLN, 
and 46% of NP samples. IFNγ overexpression occurs in approximately 40% of 
CIUE-related pregnancy losses. IFNγ expression restricted to a subgroup of CIUE 
implies that IFNγ may define a distinct disease process. The non-discriminatory 
pattern of C4d deposition suggests it is a non-specific phenomenon possibly 
related to placental damage."

PURPOSE: Antithrombotic agents have a role in coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) treatment, but the pandemic disrupted medication supply. This study 
examined changes in the volume of oral and parenteral anticoagulant and 
antiplatelet medications at US hospitals during the pandemic.
METHODS: IQVIA National Sales Perspective (NSP) data was used to determine the 
monthly volume of anticoagulants and antiplatelets purchased at US hospitals 
between January 2018 and February 2021. Mean monthly medication volumes, 
reported as extended units (EUs), and year-over-year changes in medication 
volume were determined. A single-group interrupted time series analysis was used 
to evaluate changes in the rate of growth of monthly medication volumes before 
(January 2019-February 2020) and during (March 2020-February 2021) the COVID-19 
pandemic.
RESULTS: Overall, there was a 43.4% decline in the total volume of 
anticoagulants and antiplatelets at US hospitals in March 2020, driven by a 
decrease in heparin volume. Mean monthly volumes decreased significantly (P < 
0.05) for parenteral anticoagulants (-106,691,340 EU [95% CI, -200,033,910 to 
-13,348,780]), oral anticoagulants (-354,800 EU [95% CI, -612,180 to -97,420]), 
and parenteral antiplatelets (-391,880 EU [95% CI, -535,420 to -248,330]). 
During the pandemic, the monthly volume of oral anticoagulants, parenteral 
anticoagulants, and parenteral antiplatelets grew significantly more than in the 
prepandemic period. This growth was primarily seen in volumes of apixaban, 
argatroban, enoxaparin, heparin, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. Apixaban and 
heparin volumes continued a prepandemic uptrend, while argatroban and 
eptifibatide volumes reversed trend.
CONCLUSION: Rapid changes in anticoagulant and antiplatelet volume at US 
hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for institutional 
protocols to manage fluctuating medication volume demands."
1576,"The enzymatic cascades for ubiquitin transfer regulate key cellular processes 
and are the intense focus of drug development for treating cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. E1 is at the apex of the UB transfer cascade, and 
molecules inhibiting E1 have shown promising activities against cancer cell 
proliferation. Compared to small molecules, peptidomimetics have emerged as 
powerful tools to disrupt the protein-protein interactions (PPI) with less drug 
resistance and high stability in the cell. Herein, we harnessed the 
D-sulfono-γ-AA peptide to mimic the N-terminal helix of E2 and thereby inhibit 
E1-E2 interaction. Two stapled peptidomimetics, M1-S1 and M1-S2, were identified 
as effective inhibitors to block UB transfer from E1 to E2, as shown by in vitro 
and cellular assays. Our work suggested that PPIs with the N-terminal helix of 
E2 at the E1-E2 and E2-E3 interfaces could be a promising target for designing 
inhibitors against protein ubiquitination pathways in the cell."
1577,"BACKGROUND: Conventional MR pulse sequences result in poor signal from low T2 
cortical bone because the minimum achievable echo time is limited. A sequence 
resulting in improved bone contrast is desirable.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance of grayscale 
inversion zero echo time imaging (GI-ZTE) and grayscale inversion T1-weighted 
imaging (GI-T1WI) compared with computed tomography (CT).
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
SUBJECTS: A total of 50 patients with musculoskeletal tumors or tumor-like 
diseases of the lower extremities having MRI and CT studies.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: GI-T1WI and GI-ZTE sequences at 1.5 T.
ASSESSMENT: Assessed cortical and medullary bone morphology abnormalities using 
CT as the reference standard. Three radiologists scored the images quality and 
recorded nine metrics to assess the diagnostic performance.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Differences in image quality were calculated using the 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used 
to analyze the agreement of quantitative lesion parameters between CT and MR 
sequences, as well as the interobserver reliability. A P value <0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Image quality score was significantly higher for CT images than GI-TIWI 
images. Except for radiologist 3 [4(0) vs 4 (1)], there was no significant 
difference in scores between CT and GI-ZTE [radiologist 1: 4 (0) vs 4 (0), 
P = 0.133; radiologist 2: 4 (0) vs 4 (0), P = 0.085]. There was good-excellent 
agreement between both MR sequences and CT for size, lesion number, location, 
sclerotic rim, expanded shell, destruction pattern, and matrix mineralization 
for all radiologists (ICC: 0.636-1.000). The consistency of periosteal reaction 
and penetration of the cortex was fair to good (0.481-0.729) between GI-T1WI and 
CT and good to excellent between GI-ZTE and CT (0.682-0.852).
DATA CONCLUSIONS: GI-ZTE images had superior intermodality agreement with CT 
images and allowed visualization of more cortical bone detail than GI-T1WI 
images.
EVIDENCE LEVEL: 1.

1578,"The immune response is crucial for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) 
progression, with the participation of proinflammatory cells and cytokines, 
inducing lung injury and loss of respiratory function. CLEC5A expression on 
monocytes can be triggered by viral and bacterial infections, leading to poor 
outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 is able to induce neutrophil activation by CLEC5A and 
Toll-like receptor 2, leading to an aggressive inflammatory cascade, but little 
information is known about the molecular interactions between CLEC5A and 
SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Here, we aimed to explore how CLEC5A expression could be 
affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection using immunological tools with in vitro, in 
vivo and in silico assays. The findings revealed that high levels of CLEC5A 
expression were found in monocytes from severe COVID-19 patients in comparison 
with mild COVID-19 and unexposed subjects, but not in vaccinated subjects who 
developed mild COVID-19. In hamsters, we detected CLEC5A gene expression during 
3-15 days of Omicron strain viral challenge. Our results also showed that CLEC5A 
can interact with SARS-CoV-2, promoting inflammatory cytokine production, 
probably through an interaction with the receptor binding domain in the 
N-acetylglucosamine binding site (NAG-601). The high expression of CLEC5A and 
high levels of proinflammatory cytokine production were reduced in vitro by a 
human CLEC5A monoclonal antibody. Finally, CLEC5A was triggered by spike 
glycoprotein, suggesting its involvement in COVID-19 progression; therapy with a 
monoclonal antibody could be a good strategy for COVID-19 treatment, but 
vaccines are still the best option to avoid hospitalization/deaths. This article

1579,"Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV-r) is an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and has 
been recommended in the treatment of non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In 
rare occasions, some patients experience virologic and symptomatic rebound after 
initial resolution, which we call COVID-19 rebound after NMV-r. Although COVID 
rebound can also occur after molnupiravir treatment or even no antiviral 
treatment, we have more serious concern about the rebound after NMV-r, which 
remains the most effective antiviral. Due to a lack of information about its 
frequency, mechanism, outcomes, and management, we conducted this review to 
provide comprehensive and updated information to address these questions. Based 
on the limited evidence, the incidence of COVID-19 rebound after NMV-r was less 
than 2%, and most cases developed 5-15 days after initiating NMV-r treatment. 
Almost all reported cases had mild symptoms, and the clinical condition 
gradually subsided without additional treatment. Overall, the clinical outcome 
was favourable, and only a small number of patients required emergency 
department visits or hospitalization. Regarding virologic rebound, culturable 
SARS-CoV-2 with possible transmission was observed, so re-isolation may be 
needed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
1580,"The SPF10-PCR-based line probe assay (LiPA-25) for human papillomavirus (HPV) 
genotyping with high analytical sensitivity and specificity was widely used in 
HPV vaccine clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. In the study, we aimed to 
compare a novel GP5+/6+-PCR-based reverse dot blot hybridization assay 
(Yaneng-23) with LiPA-25. The performance of two assays was evaluated in 1735 
cervical swab and 117 tissue samples, with a focus on 19 common HPV types (14 
high-risk: 16,18,31,33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58,59,66 and 68/73; 5 low-risk: 
6,11,42,43 and 53). A total of 1197 (69.0%) swab samples were identified as 
HPV-positive by two assays. Of these, 878 (73.4%) samples displayed absolute 
agreement (concordant), 255 (21.3%) showed additional or fewer types 
(compatible), and the remaining 64 (5.3%) samples were discordant. Additionally, 
the two assays showed an excellent strength of agreement for 19 HPV-combined 
detection (κ=0.886) and 17 individual HPV types (all κ>0.800), and displayed a 
good agreement for HPV39 (κ=0.780) and 42 (κ=0.699). Yaneng-23 was more 
sensitive than LiPA-25 for HPV58, 59, 68/73, 42, 43 and 53 (McNemar's test: all 
P<0.05), while LiPA-25 was more sensitive for HPV31, 39, 52 and 66 than 
Yaneng-23 (all P<0.05). In 113 HPV-positive tissue specimens, the identification 
of genotypes was 82.3% identical and 17.7% compatible. The agreement between the 
tests for HPV45 (κ=0.796) and 51 (κ=0.742) was good, and for other types (all 
κ>0.843) and 19 HPV-combined detection (κ=0.929) was perfect (all P>0.05). In 
conclusion, Yaneng-23 and LiPA-25 are comparable. Yaneng-23 could be used for 
the detection and genotyping of HPV in cervical samples for epidemiological and 
vaccine studies worldwide. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1581,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the immunogenicity to SARS-CoV-2 and 
evasive subvariants BA.4/5 in people living with HIV (PLWH) following a third 
booster shot of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 318 PLWH and 241 healthy 
controls (HC) using SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays. Vaccine-induced immunological 
responses were compared before and after the third dose.
RESULTS: Serum levels of IgG anti-RBD and inhibition rate of NAb were 
significantly elevated at the ""post-third dose"" sampling time compared with the 
pre-third dose in PLWH, but were relatively decreased relative to those of HCs. 
Induced humoral and cellular responses attenuated over time after triple-dose 
vaccination. The neutralizing capacity against BA.4/5 was also intensified but 
remained below the positive inhibition threshold. Seropositivity of 
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in PLWH was prominently lower than that in HC. We 
also identified age, CD4 cell counts, time after the last vaccination, and WHO 
staging type of PLWH as independent factors associated with the seropositivity 
of antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: PLWH receiving booster shot of inactivated vaccines generate higher 
antibody responses than the second dose, but lower than that in HCs. Decreased 
anti-BA.4/5 responses than that of WT impede the protective effect of the third 
dose on Omicron prevalence. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

has raised concerns of its ability to establish endemicity beyond its 
traditional geographical locations. In this review, we discuss the current 
understanding of mpox virology and viral dynamics that are relevant to mpox 
diagnostics. A synopsis of the traditional and emerging laboratory technologies

1583,"Heterogeneity of antibody responses has been reported in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
recipients with underlying diseases. We investigated the impact of the presence 
of comorbidities on the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients 
with chronic disease (PWCD) and assessed the effect of the number of 
comorbidities on the humoral response to vaccination. In this study, 
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding 
domain (RBD-IgG) were monitored following a full-course vaccination. In total, 
1400 PWCD (82.7%, inactivated vaccines; 17.3%, subunit recombinant vaccine) and 
245 healthy controls (65.7% inactivated vaccines, 34.3% subunit recombinant 
vaccine) vaccinated with inactivated or subunit recombinant SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, 
were included. The seroconversion and antibody levels of the NAbs and RBD-IgG 
were different in the PWCD group compared with those in the control group. 
Chronic hepatitis B (odds ratio [OR]: 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.46-0.93), cancer (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.42-0.99), and diabetes (OR: 0.50; 95% 
CI: 0.28-0.89) were associated with lower seroconversion of NAbs. Chronic kidney 
disease (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.11-0.76), cancer (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.23-0.62), and 
diabetes (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20-0.69) were associated with lower seroconversion 
of RBD-IgG. Only the presence of autoimmune disease showed significantly lower 
NAbs and RBD-IgG titers. Patients with most types of chronic diseases showed 
similar responses to the controls, but humoral responses were still 
significantly associated with the presence of ≥2 coexisting diseases. Our study 
suggested that humoral responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are impaired 
in patients with certain chronic diseases. This article is protected by

1584,"Following the rapidly increasing number of multisystem inflammatory syndromes in 
children (MIS-C), a similar clinical scenario has been observed in adult 
patients. Although its prevalence is low and probably related to underdiagnosis, 
its development can be associated with high mortality. Multisystem inflammatory 
syndrome in adults (MIS-A) can develop following both asymptomatic and 
symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection and in previously healthy people. Like MIS-C, MIS-A is a multisystem 
disease that can involve the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, 
dermatologic, hematologic, and neurologic systems. In addition to the clinical 
manifestations, the diagnosis of MIS-A requires laboratory evidence of 
inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The appropriate treatment for MIS-A 
remains unclear; anti-inflammatory agents, including intravenous immunoglobulin 
and corticosteroids, are commonly used. However, there are still many unknowns 
regarding MIS-A. Further studies are needed to determine the true prevalence,

1585,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death 
worldwide, with up to 90% of HCC cases occurring in the setting of underlying 
cirrhosis. Therapeutic landscape for advanced HCC has dramatically changed in 
recent years with the advent of immunotherapy, including several combinations. 
Data suggest that the surrounding liver milieu may influence tumour response. In 
addition, different aetiologies of HCC and their effects on the host liver may 
impact response to immunotherapy. However, to date, guidelines do not take into 
account this parameter to guide therapeutic selection, and phase III trials are 
likewise performed in patients irrespective of HCC aetiology. Moreover, most 
clinical trial data are collected in highly selected patients with preserved 
liver function (defined as Child-Pugh class A) and controlled portal 
hypertension, which does not accurately reflect routine clinical practice. In 
this review, we discuss the influence of liver disease aetiology on the response 
to immunotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. We also discuss the safety and 
efficacy of various immunotherapeutic agents in Child-Pugh B patients to 
determine if these treatments are beneficial in this vulnerable patient

mitigating the risks of sternal complications and functional decline associated 
with sternotomy. In such patients at elevated risk for SWI, MICS CABG may

1587,"Mycotoxins have substantial impacts on agricultural production and food 
preservation. Some have high similarities in bioactivity but subtle differences 
on structures from various fungal producers. Understanding of their complex 
cross-biosynthesis will provide new insights into enzyme functions and food 
safety. Here, based on structurally related mycotoxins, such as aurovertins, 
asteltoxin, and citreoviridin, we showed that methyltransferase (MT)-catalyzed 
methylation is required for efficient oxidation and polyketide stability. MTs 
have broad interactions with polyketide synthases and flavin-containing 
monooxygenases (FMOs), while MT AstB is required for FMO AstC functionality in 
vivo. FMOs have common catalysis on pyrone-polyene intermediates but different 
catalytic specificity and efficiency on oxidative intermediates for the 
selective production of more toxic and complex mycotoxins. Thus, the subtle 
protein interaction and elaborate versatile catalysis of biosynthetic enzymes 
contribute to the efficient and selective biosynthesis of these 
structure-related mycotoxins and provide the basis to re-evaluate and control 
mycotoxins for agricultural and food safety."
1588,"The current understanding of skin aging is that senescent fibroblasts accumulate 
within the dermis and subcutaneous fat to cause abnormal tissue remodeling and 
extracellular matrix dysfunction, triggering a senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP). A novel therapeutic approach to prevent skin aging is to 
specifically eliminate senescent dermal fibroblasts; this requires the 
identification of specific protein markers for senescent cells. Apolipoprotein D 
(ApoD) is involved in lipid metabolism and antioxidant responses and is 
abundantly expressed in tissues affected by age-related diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. However, its behavior and role in skin 
aging remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether ApoD functions as a 
marker of aging using human dermal fibroblast aging models. In cellular 
senescence models induced via replicative aging and ionizing radiation exposure, 
ApoD expression was upregulated at the gene and protein levels and correlated 
with senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the decreased uptake of 
the proliferation marker BrdU, which was concomitant with the upregulation of 
SASP genes. Furthermore, ApoD-positive cells were found to be more abundant in 
the aging human dermis using fluorescence flow cytometry. These results suggest 
that ApoD is a potential clinical marker for identifying aging dermal 
fibroblasts."
1589,"Bisphenol (BP) compounds are important environmental pollutants and endocrine 
disruptors. BPs are capable of inducing DNA/chromosome breaks (clastogenesis, 
involved in carcinogenesis), which requires activation by human CYP1A1. We 
hypothesized that combined BPs and extended (from the standard two-cell cycle) 
exposure may enhance their genotoxicity via modulating CYP enzymes. In this 
study, individual and combined BPA/BPF/BPS/BPAF and a human hepatoma (HepG2) 
cell line were used for testing several genotoxicity end points. Exposing for a 
two-cell cycle period (48 h), each BP alone (0.625-10 μM) was negative in the 
micronucleus test, while micronucleus was formed under three- (72 h) and 
four-cell cycle (96 h) exposure; BP combinations further elevated the potency 
(with nanomolar thresholds). Immunofluorescence analysis of the centromere with 
formed micronucleus indicated that 48 h exposure produced centromere-negative 
micronucleus and phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) (evidencing 
clastogenesis), while extended (72 and 96 h) exposure formed centromere-positive 
micronucleus and phosphorylated histone H3 (p-H3) (indicating chromosome loss, 
i.e., aneugenesis); moreover, 1-aminotriabenzotriazole (CYP inhibitor) 
selectively blocked the formation of centromere-negative micronucleus and 
γ-H2AX, without affecting that of centromere-positive micronucleus and p-H3. 
This study suggests that the genotoxicity of BPs is potentiated by combined and 
extended exposure, the latter being specific for aneuploidy formation, a CYP 
activity-independent effect."
1590,"BACKGROUND: In children with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), measures more 
sensitive than spirometry are needed to characterize underlying pulmonary 
impairment. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a promising noninvasive 
method for monitoring the distribution of lung ventilation, and it does not 
require patient collaboration. We aimed to provide an assessment of the 
feasibility and clinical usefulness of EIT in characterizing lung impairment in 
children with PCD, compared to spirometry and nitrogen multiple breath washout 
(MBWN2 ) test.
METHODS: Children and adolescents with PCD underwent MBWN2 test as first 
respiratory assessment, followed by EIT monitoring and spirometry during 
outpatient follow-up.
RESULTS: We included 12 out of 16 individuals regularly followed at our clinic. 
A total of 41.7% (5/12) showed abnormal FEV1 , whereas 11/12 (91.7%) had 
abnormal ventilation inhomogeneity measured with MBWN2 test. Using EIT, the 
global inhomogeneity (GITOT ) index was strongly correlated with FEV1 (rho = 
-0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.87 to 0.02) and ranged from 37 to 44, 
with the highest inhomogeneity detected in the dorsal right quadrant. GITOT was 
moderately correlated with RV/TLC %predicted (rho = 0.38, 95%CI: -0.17 to 0.74), 
while we detected a weak correlation between GITOT and LCI (rho = 0.29, 95%CI: 
-0.45 to 0.82).
CONCLUSION: EIT appears promising as a non-invasive technique to characterize 
ventilation distribution in children with PCD, thus providing a complementary 
assessment to static and dynamic lung function measures of PCD disease. This

1591,"The overexpression of membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) on 
tumour cells helps them survive complement attacks by suppressing 
antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Consequently, mCRP

plays an important role in inhibiting antibody-mediated CDC. However, the 
mechanisms regulating CD55 expression in tumour cells remain unclear. Here, the 
aim was to explore CD55-targeting miRNAs. We previously constructed an in vitro 
model comprising cancer cell lines expressing α-gal and serum containing natural 
antibodies against α-gal and complement. This was used to simulate 
antibody-mediated CDC in colon cancer cells. We screened microRNAs that directly 
target CD55 using LoVo and Ls-174T colon cell lines, which express CD55 at low 
and high levels, respectively. miR-132-3p expression was dramatically lower in 
Ls-174T cells than in LoVo cells. miR-132-3p overexpression or inhibition 
transcriptionally regulated CD55 expression by specifically targeting its mRNA 
3'-untranslated regions. Further, miR-132-3p modulation regulated colon cancer 
cell sensitivity to antibody-mediated CDC through C5a release and C5b-9 
deposition. Moreover, miR-132-3p expression was significantly reduced, whereas 
CD55 expression was increased, in colon cancer tissues compared to levels in 
adjacent normal tissues. CD55 protein levels were negatively correlated with 
miR-132-3p expression in colon cancer tissues. Our results indicate that 
miR-132-3p regulates colon cancer cell sensitivity to antibody-mediated CDC by 
directly targeting CD55. In addition, incubating the LoVo human tumour cell 
line, stably transfected with the xenoantigen α-gal, with human serum containing 
natural antibodies comprises a stable and cheap in vitro model to explore the 
mechanisms underlying antibody-mediated CDC."
1592,"BACKGROUND: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is associated with progressive 
muscle weakness and respiratory decline. To date, studies have focused on the 
respiratory decline and loss of ambulation as a metric of loss of skeletal 
muscle strength. However, new functional measures can assess skeletal muscle 
disease regardless of ambulatory status. The relationship between these tests 
and concurrent lung function is currently unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the correlation between spirometry measurements and 
functional muscle assessments such as accelerometry and quantitative muscle 
testing (QMT) METHODS: Enrolled patients with DMD underwent accelerometry and 
QMT at study clinic visits. Any pulmonary function testing within six months of 
visit was obtained from the electronic medical record. Spearman correlation 
coefficient was used to assess the relationship between spirometry and 
functional muscle testing.
RESULTS: Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1 ) demonstrated the strongest correlation with accelerometry. Both FVC and 
FEV1 showed a similar relationship to accelerometry when activity was divided 
into intensity categories, with low intensity and moderate-to-vigorous activity 
categories showing the strongest correlation. Maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) 
and FVC showed the most robust correlations with total QMT (p<0.001 and p<0.01, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Lung function, specifically FVC%p and FEV1 %p, shows a good 
correlation with upper and lower extremity skeletal muscle functional testing 
such as accelerometry and quantitative muscle testing. This article is protected

1593,"Phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of macrophages is clearly a critical 
component of their effective functions in innate and adaptive immunity. This 
investigation hypothesized that altered profiles of gene expression in gingival 
tissues in health, disease and resolution would reflect changes in macrophage 
phenotypes occurring in these tissues. The study used a nonhuman primate model 
to evaluate gene expression profiles as footprints of macrophage variation using 
a longitudinal experimental model of ligature-induced periodontitis in animals 
from 3-23 years of age to identify aging effects on the gingival environment. 
Significant differences were observed in distribution of expressed gene levels 
for M0, M1 and M2 macrophages in healthy tissues with the younger animals 
showing the least expression. M0 gene expression increased with disease in all 
but the aged group, while M1 was increased in adult and young animals, and M2 in 
all age groups, as early as disease initiation (within 0.5 months). Numerous 
histocompatibility genes were increased with disease, except in the aged 
samples. An array of cytokines/chemokines representing both M1 and M2 cells were 
increased with disease showing substantial increases with disease initiation 
(eg. IL1A, CXCL8, CCL19, CCL2, CCL18), although the aged tissues showed a more 
limited magnitude of change across these macrophage genes. The analytics of 
macrophage genes at sites of gingival health, disease and resolution 
demonstrated distinct profiles of host response interactions that may help model 
the disease mechanisms occurring with the formation of a periodontal lesion."
1594,"Myocardial regeneration is identified as a concept at histological level. The 
core content is to increase the number of cardiomyocytes (CMs), so as to 
maintain the steady state of CMs under pathological or physiological conditions 
and ensure the normal cardiac function. In this review, we discussed the 
relevant factors involved in the regeneration of CMs, generalized in mice, large 
mammals and human. During different development stages of mammalian hearts, CMs 
showed several controlling and growth modes on the physiological or pathological 
state: mitosis, hypertrophy, nuclear polyploidy and multinucleation, amitosis 
and etc. We also discussed the mechanisms of specific microRNAs implicated in 
the cardiac development, as well as disease-induced apoptosis in CMs and the 
process of re-entering cell cycle after injury. It is hoped that this review 
will contribute to a deeper understanding of therapeutic approaches for 
myocardial regeneration after injury."
1595,"We aimed to compare a transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) agonist 
with a TNF inhibitor, and to test the potential of their combination in 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) as a potential future strategy for rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Following the onset of CIA DBA1/j mice were started on treatment 
with either vehicle, etanercept (8mg/kg three times a week), the TRPV2 agonist 
O1821 (20-30mg/Kg/day), or a combination of both. Mice were scored over a 61-day 
period. Synovial tissues were obtained for RNA sequencing. Mice on monotherapy 
with either O1821 or etanercept developed milder clinical disease. The O1821 
protection was observed at an earlier time-point than in the etanercept group. 
The combination therapy group achieved a more robust and sustained reduction in 
disease severity than either monotherapy group. All treatment groups had reduced 
scores for synovial inflammation, synovial hyperplasia and erosive changes, 
compared with controls, with the combination group achieving the most 
significant protection. RNA sequencing and pathway analyses of synovial tissues 
identified pathways and processes regulated by the TRPV2 agonist, such as 
chemotaxis and cytokine receptor signaling, including IL6R. The combination 
therapy affected additional pathways not seen in the monotherapy groups. In 
conclusion, the TRPV2 agonist achieved an overall similar reduction in arthritis 
severity and histology scores as etanercept, but the combination therapy 
achieved a more sustained disease control and more pronounced reduction in joint 
damage, suggesting a potential future option for improving disease control in 
RA. RNA sequencing analyses identified new pathways regulated by TRPV2, and also 
by the combination treatment."
1596,"Piezoelectric sensors are widely used in wearable devices to mimic the functions 
of human skin. However, it is considerably challenging to develop soft 
piezoelectric materials that can exhibit high sensitivity, stretchability, super 
elasticity, and suitable modulus. In this study, a soft skin-like piezoelectric 
polymer elastomer composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and a novel 
elastic substrate polyacrylonitrile is prepared by combining the radical 
polymerization and freeze-drying processes. Dipole-dipole interaction results in 
the phase transition of PVDF (α phase to β phase), which enhances the electrical 
and mechanical performances. Thus, we achieve a high piezoelectric coefficient 
(d33max = 63 pC/N), good stretchability (211.3-259.3%), super compressibility 
(subjected to 99% compression strain without cracking), and super elasticity 
(100% recovery after extreme compression) simultaneously for the elastomer. The 
soft composite elastomer produces excellent electrical signal output (Vocmax = 
253 mV) and responds rapidly (15 ms) to stress-induced polarization effects. In 
addition, the elastomer-based sensor accurately detects various physiological 
signals such as gestures, throat vibrations, and pulse waves. The developed 
elastomers exhibit excellent mechanical properties and high sensitivity, which 
helps facilitate their application as artificial electronic skin to sense subtle 
external pressure in real time."
1597,"BACKGROUND: To compare the research hotspots of infections with the Delta and 
Omicron variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to identify future 
research trends.
METHODS: Studies about Delta and Omicron variant infections published over the 
last 3 years were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database. A 
comparative bibliometric analysis was conducted through machine learning and 
visualization tools, including VOSviewer, Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence 
Matrix Builder, and Graphical Clustering Toolkit. Research hotspots and trends 
in the field were analyzed, and the contributions and collaborations of 
countries, institutions, and authors were documented. A cross-sectional analysis 
of the relevant studies registered at ClinicalTrials.gov was also performed to 
clarify the direction of future research.
RESULTS: A total of 1,787 articles distributed in 107 countries and 374 
publications from 77 countries focused on the Delta and Omicron variants were 
included in our bibliometric analysis. The top five productive countries in both 
variants were the USA, China, the UK, India, and Germany. In 5,999 and 1,107 
keywords identified from articles on the Delta and Omicron, the top two frequent 
keywords were the same: ""COVID-19"" (occurrence: 713, total link strength: 1,525 
in Delta; occurrence: 137, total link strength: 354 in Omicron), followed by 
""SARS-CoV-2"" (occurrence: 553, total link strength: 1,478 in Delta; occurrences 
132, total link strength: 395 in Omicron). Five theme clusters from articles on 
Delta variant were identified: transmission, molecular structure, activation 
mode, epidemiology, and co-infection. While other three theme clusters were 
recognized for the Omicron variant: vaccine, human immune response, and 
infection control. Meanwhile, 21 interventional studies had been registered up 
to April 2022, most of which aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of 
different kinds of vaccines in various populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Publications and clinical trials related to COVID-19 increased 
annually. As the first comparative bibliometric analysis for Delta and Omicron 
variants, we noticed that the relevant research trends have shifted from vaccine 
development to infection control and management of complications. The ongoing 
clinical studies will verify the safety and efficacy of promising drugs."
1598,"BACKGROUND: Data is lacking as to the clinical presentation of erosive 
esophagitis (EE) in neurologically impaired children compared to 
non-neurologically impaired children (non-NIC). To determinate the clinical 
presentation, associations, management, and outcomes of EE in neurologically 
impaired children compared to children without neurologic impairment.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all esophagogastroduodenoscopies 
performed in pediatric patients at the University of Mississippi Medical Center 
from 1998 to 2020 with the diagnosis of EE. Fisher's exact test was used to 
compare results from neurologically impaired children group and non-NIC. A 
probability <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were diagnosed with EE and met study criteria. 
Twenty-six patients were neurologically impaired children, and 21 were non- 
neurologically impaired children. No significant difference was seen between age 
at diagnosis, sex, or hematologic markers of anemia. The most common indication 
for esophagogastroduodenoscopies in neurologically impaired children was 
hematemesis (65.4%), whereas abdominal pain (33.3%) was the most common in 
non-NIC. Neurologically impaired children were more likely to be treated with 
acid-blockade. Nine neurologically impaired children had gastrostomy tubes prior 
to diagnosis as opposed to 0 non-neurologically impaired children. After 
diagnosis, 8 neurologically impaired children underwent gastrostomy tube 
placement compared to 0 non-neurologically impaired children, and fundoplication 
was performed in 11 neurologically impaired children as compared to 1 non-NIC. 
The sensitivity of fecal occult blood test for detecting EE was higher for 
neurologically impaired children (91.7%) than for non-NIC (33.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: EE in neurologically impaired children presents differently than in 
non-neurologically impaired children with blood loss being the most common 
presentation in neurologically impaired children. Neurologically impaired 
children are more likely to be treated with acid-blockade prior to diagnosis, 
likely due to heightened risk for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
Additionally, they are more likely to undergo surgical management of EE than 
non- neurologically impaired children."
1599,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence of portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) after 
splenectomy in patients with Wilson disease (WD) can lead to serious 
complications. The early identification of high-risk patients can help improve 
patient prognosis. This study aimed to establish and validate a personalized 
nomogram for assessing the risk of PVST after splenectomy in patients with WD 
and hypersplenism.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data from 81 patients with WD and 
hypersplenism who underwent splenectomy. Based on whether PVST occurred within a 
month after the operation, they were divided into the PVST group and the 
non-PVST group. The clinical data of the 2 groups were compared, and univariate 
analysis was used to select the statistically significant features and 
incorporated into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression model for optimization. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
used to determine the independent risk factors for PVST after splenectomy, which 
were then applied to establish a personalized nomogram. We calculated the 
concordance (C)-index and drew the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve, the model calibration curve, and the clinical decision analysis (DCA) 
curve to evaluate the accuracy, calibration, and clinical applicability of the 
model, respectively. We used bootstrapping for internal validation of the model.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the differences in preoperative portal 
vein diameter and velocity of portal blood flow, postoperative mean platelet 
volume (MPV), mean platelet distribution width (PDW), D-dimer, prothrombin time 
(PT), and the increase of platelet count (PLT) were of statistical significance 
(P<0.05). According to the results of the LASSO and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses, a model including preoperative portal vein diameter, 
preoperative portal blood flow velocity, postoperative D-dimer, and the increase 
of PLT was established to predict the risk of PVST after splenectomy. The model 
showed good accuracy with a C-index of 0.838 (95% CI: 0.750-0.926) and had a 
well-fitted calibration curve. Furthermore, internal validation showed it 
achieved a moderate C-index of 0.805. The DCA curve indicated that the model has 
clinical applicability when patients are treated at thresholds of 2-100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a predictive model for the risk of PVST in patients 
with WD and hypersplenism after splenectomy can help clinicians identify 
patients at high risk of PVST who require intervention measures."
1600,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a common 
etiology of acute vertebrobasilar artery occlusion (VBAO) in Asia, which 
complicated endovascular treatment (EVT). We aimed to investigate the incidence, 
impacts, and predictors of ICAD in VBAO.
METHODS: Subjects were selected from the ANGEL-ACT registry and divided into two 
groups based on whether underlying ICAD existed. Underlying ICAD was determined 
when the following situations arise in the occlusion site during EVT: 1) fixed 
stenosis degree >70% or 2) stenosis >50% with distal blood flow impairment or 
evidence of repeated reocclusion. Multivariable regression models were used to 
investigate the effect of underlying ICAD on outcomes measured by modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days, and to identify baseline characteristics 
associated with underlying ICAD.
RESULTS: Among the 315 patients enrolled, 171 (54.3%) had underlying ICAD. 
Favorable functional outcomes (mRS 0-3) occurred in 79 of 163 patients (48.5%) 
with ICAD and 69 of 137 patients (50.4%) without ICAD (P=0.743). Outcomes were 
similar between the two groups and remained similar after adjusting for the 
confounders. History of hypertension and elevated admission neutrophil to 
lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were strong predictors of underlying ICAD, whereas 
history of atrial fibrillation and distal basilar artery occlusion were negative 
predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, underlying ICAD was recognized in approximately half 
of the VBAO patients, leading to comparable outcomes after more complex EVT 
strategies. Some baseline characteristics were identified to be predictors for 
underlying ICAD, which were helpful to guide the EVT strategies before the 
procedure.Data access statement: The data that support the findings of this 
study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."
1601,"BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain secondary to degenerative changes in the spine 
is a common cause of disability, and disc degeneration is one of the most 
frequent imaging findings. Intervertebral vacuum phenomenon (IVP) is usually 
observed in advanced degeneration. Recently, this phenomenon has gained interest 
due to a relatively new surgical technique called percutaneous discoplasty, 
aimed at treating low back pain secondary to degenerative disc disease in 
elderly patients.
PURPOSE: To analyze the prevalence and related factors of the vacuum phenomenon 
in adult patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients who 
underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) for non-spine-related reasons. Age, 
body mass index, smoking, and CT-based characteristics as presence of IVP, 
subchondral sclerosis, and facet joint degeneration at the lumbar spine from L1 
to the sacrum were included in order to determine the prevalence of the vacuum 
phenomenon in this population and establish a relationship between this 
condition and patient demographics and other signs of spine degeneration, such 
as sclerosis and facet joint disease.
RESULTS: A total of 238 patients were included in the study (114 men, 124 women; 
mean age = 75.6 ± 12.3 years. In total, 91 (38%) patients had at least one level 
of IVP; 59 (25%) patients exhibited subchondral sclerosis, and 235 (98%) facet 
joint degeneration. Among risk factors, age, smoking, and subchondral sclerosis 
were significantly associated with the presence of vacuum.
CONCLUSION: IVP was present in 38% of participants. Risk factors associated with 
vacuum were age, smoking, and subchondral sclerosis."
1602,"BACKGROUND: A drawback in the treatment of chronic Chagas disease (American 
trypanosomiasis) is the long time required to achieve complete loss of 
serological reactivity, the standard for determining treatment efficacy.
METHODS: Antibody-secreting and memory B cells specific for Trypanosoma cruzi 
and their degree of differentiation were evaluated in adult and pediatric 
subjects with chronic Chagas disease prior to and after etiological treatment.
RESULTS: Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibody-secreting cells disappeared from 
the circulation in benznidazole or nifurtimox-treated subjects with declining 
parasite-specific antibody levels posttreatment, whereas B cells in most 
subjects with unaltered antibody levels were low prior to treatment and did not 
change after treatment. The timing of the decay in parasite-specific 
antibody-secreting B cells was similar to that in parasite-specific antibodies 
as measured by a Luminex-based assay, but preceded the decay in antibody levels 
detected by conventional serology. The phenotype of total B cells returned to a 
non-infection profile after successful treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: T. cruzi-specific antibodies in the circulation of chronically T. 
cruzi-infected subjects likely derive from both antigen-driven plasmablasts, 
that disappear following successful treatment, and long-lived plasma cells that 
persist and account for the low frequency and long course to complete 
seronegative conversion in successfully treated subjects."
1603,"BACKGROUND: Louse-borne trench fever caused by Bartonella quintana is a 
neglected public health concern, known to be transmitted from body louse faeces 
via scratching. No viable B. quintana have ever been isolated from head lice 
before; therefore, their role as a vector is still poorly understood.
METHODS: In Senegal, the implementation of a permanent local surveillance system 
in a Point-of-Care laboratory (POC) allows the monitoring of emerging diseases. 
Here, we used culture as well as molecular and genomic approaches to document an 
outbreak of trench fever associated with head lice in the village of Ndiop. Head 
lice and blood samples were collected from febrile patients between November 
2010 and April 2015. Genomes of two isolated strains of B. quintana were 
sequenced and analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 2,289 blood samples were collected in the 2010-2015 period. 
From 2010-2013, B. quintana DNA was detected by PCR in 0.25% (4/1,580). In 2014, 
228 blood samples were collected, along with 161 head lice from five 
individuals. B. quintana DNA was detected in 4·4% (10/228) of blood samples, and 
in lice specimens collected from febrile patients (61·7%, 50/81) and non-febrile 
patients (61·4%, 43/70). Two B. quintana strains were isolated from blood and 
head lice from two different patients. Genomic sequence analysis showed 99·98% 
overall similarity between both strains.
CONCLUSION: The presence of live B. quintana in head lice, and the genetic 
identity of strains from patients' blood and head lice during a localised 
outbreak in Senegal, supports the evidence of head lice vectorial capacity."
1604,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The minor T-allele of the MUC5B promoter polymorphism 
rs35705950 is strongly associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
However, conflicting results have been reported on the relationship between the 
MUC5B minor allele and survival and it is unknown whether a specific subgroup of 
IPF patients might benefit from MUC5B minor allele carriage. We investigated the 
association between MUC5B rs35705950, survival and patient characteristics in a 
real-world population of European IPF patients.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1751 patients with IPF from 8 European 
centres were included. MUC5B rs35705950 genotype, demographics, clinical 
characteristics at diagnosis and survival data were analysed.
RESULTS: In a multi-variate Cox proportional hazard model the MUC5B minor allele 
was a significant independent predictor of survival when adjusted for age, sex, 
high resolution computed tomography pattern, smoking behaviour and pulmonary 
function tests in IPF. MUC5B minor allele carriers were significantly older at 
diagnosis (p = 0.001). The percentage of MUC5B minor allele carriers increased 
significantly with age from 44% in patients aged <56 year, to 63% in patients 
aged >75. In IPF patients aged <56, the MUC5B minor allele was not associated 
with survival. In IPF patients aged ≥56, survival was significantly better for 
MUC5B minor allele carriers (45 months [CI: 42-49]) compared to non-carriers 
(29 months [CI: 26-33]; p = 4 × 10-12 ).
CONCLUSION: MUC5B minor allele carriage associates with a better median 
transplant-free survival of 16 months in the European IPF population aged over 
56 years. MUC5B genotype status might aid disease prognostication in clinical 
management of IPF patients."
1605,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (AECOPD) are heterogeneous in aetiology and accelerate disease 
progression. Here, we aimed to investigate the association of fractional exhaled 
nitric oxide (FeNO) and its variability with AECOPD of different aetiology.
METHODS: FeNO was determined in 2157 visits (1697 stable, 133 AECOPD and 327 
follow-up) of 421 COPD patients from the PREVENT study, an 
investigator-initiated, longitudinal and interventional study, who were on daily 
treatment with inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting β2-agonists.
RESULTS: Longitudinal measurements of FeNO revealed an intra-subject variability 
of FeNO that was significantly higher in exacerbators compared to 
non-exacerbators (p < 0.001) and positively associated with the number of 
AECOPD. As FeNO variability increased, the probability of patients to remain 
AECOPD-free decreased. In patients included in the highest FeNO variability 
quartile (≥15.0 ppb) the probability to remain free of AECOPD was only 35% as 
compared to 80% for patients included in the lowest FeNO variability quartile 
(0.50-4.39 ppb). The change of FeNO from the last stable visit to AECOPD was 
positively associated with the probability of viral infections and this 
association was stronger in current smokers than ex-smokers. In contrast, the 
change in FeNO from the last stable visit to an AECOPD visit was inversely 
associated with the probability of bacterial infections in ex-smokers but not in 
current smokers.
CONCLUSION: FeNO variability was associated with the risk and aetiology of 
AECOPD differentially in current and ex-smokers."
1606,"Today, cancer is one of the main health-related challenges, and in the meantime, 
breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women, with an 
alarming number of incidences and deaths every year. For this reason, the 
discovery of novel and more effective approaches for the diagnosis, treatment, 
and monitoring of the disease are very important. In this regard, scientists are 
looking for diagnostic molecules to achieve the above-mentioned goals with 
higher accuracy and specificity. RNA interference (RNAi) is a posttranslational 
regulatory process mediated by microRNA intervention and small interfering RNAs. 
After transcription and edition, these two noncoding RNAs are integrated and 
activated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and AGO2 to connect the 
target mRNA by their complementary sequence and suppress their translation, thus 
reducing the expression of their target genes. These two RNAi categories show 
different patterns in different BC types and stages compared to healthy cells, 
and hence, these molecules have high diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic 
potentials. This article aims to review the RNAi pathway and diagnostic and 
therapeutic potentials with a special focus on BC."
1607,"BACKGROUND: Melioidosis is a neglected tropical infection caused by the 
environmental saprophyte Burkholderia pseudomallei.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study at nine hospitals in 
northeastern Thailand, a hyperendemic melioidosis zone, to define current 
characteristics of melioidosis patients and quantify outcomes over one year.
FINDINGS: 2574 individuals hospitalised with culture-confirmed melioidosis were 
screened and 1352 patients were analysed. The median age was 55 years, 975 (72%) 
were male, and 951 (70%) had diabetes. 561 (42%) patients presented with lung 
infection, 1042 (77%) were bacteremic, 442 (33%) received vasopressors/inotropes 
and 547 (40%) received mechanical ventilation. 1307 (97%) received an 
intravenous antibiotic against B. pseudomallei. 335/1354 (25%) patients died 
within one month and 448/1331 (34%) of patients died within one year. Most 
patients had risk factors for melioidosis, but patients without identified risk 
factors did not have a reduced risk of death. Of patients discharged alive, most 
received oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which was associated with decreased 
risk of post-discharge death; 235/970 (24%) were readmitted, and 874/1015 (86%) 
survived to one year. Recurrent infection was detected in 17/1018 patients (2%). 
Patients with risk factors other than diabetes had increased risk of death and 
increased risk of hospital readmission.
INTERPRETATION: In northeastern Thailand patients with melioidosis experience 
high rates of bacteremia, organ failure and death. Most patients discharged 
alive survive one year although all-cause readmission is common. Recurrent 
disease is rare. Strategies that emphasize prevention, rapid diagnosis and 
intensification of early clinical management are likely to have greatest impact 
in this and other resource-restricted regions.

1609,"Since 2019, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly 
worldwide, posing an unignorable threat to the global economy and human health. 
It is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a 
single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacoronavirus. This virus is highly 
infectious and relies on its angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-receptor to enter 
cells. With the increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, the 
difficulty of diagnosis due to the lack of global healthcare resources becomes 
increasingly apparent. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis models with 
high generalisability can effectively alleviate this pressure. Hyperparameter 
tuning is essential in training such models and significantly impacts their 
final performance and training speed. However, traditional hyperparameter tuning 
methods are usually time-consuming and unstable. To solve this issue, we 
introduce Particle Swarm Optimisation to build a PSO-guided Self-Tuning 
Convolution Neural Network (PSTCNN), allowing the model to tune hyperparameters 
automatically. Therefore, the proposed approach can reduce human involvement. 
Also, the optimisation algorithm can select the combination of hyperparameters 
in a targeted manner, thus stably achieving a solution closer to the global 
optimum. Experimentally, the PSTCNN can obtain quite excellent results, with a 
sensitivity of 93.65%±1.86%, a specificity of 94.32%±2.07%, a precision of 
94.30%±2.04%, an accuracy of 93.99%±1.78%, an F1-score of 93.97%±1.78%, Matthews 
Correlation Coefficient of 87.99%±3.56%, and Fowlkes-Mallows Index of 
93.97%±1.78%. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional methods, 
hyperparameter tuning of the model using an optimisation algorithm is faster and 
more effective."
1610,"Migrating birds face a myriad of hazards, including higher exposure to parasites 
and numerous competing energy demands. It follows that migration may act as a 
selective filter and limit population growth. Understanding how individual-level 
physiological condition and disease status scale up to population dynamics 
through differential survival of individuals is necessary to identify threats 
and management interventions for migratory populations, many of which face 
increasing conservation challenges. However, linking individual physiological 
condition, parasite infection status and survival can be difficult. We examined 
the relationship among two measures of physiological condition [scaled-mass 
index and heterophil/leukocyte (H/L) ratio], hematozoa (i.e. hemoparasites) 
presence and abundance, and constitutive immunity in 353 autumn migrating 
red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis calurus) from 2004 to 2018. Hematazoa (i.e. 
Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) were in the blood smears from 139 red-tailed 
hawks (39.4%). H/L ratio decreased with scaled-mass index. Adults had a 
significantly higher H/L ratio than juveniles. Our two measures of immune 
defences, hemolytic-complement activity and bacteria-killing ability, were 
highly positively correlated. Our most notable finding was a negative 
relationship between Haemoproteus parasitemia and survival (i.e. documented 
individual mortality), indicating that haemosporidian parasites influence 
survival during a challenging life stage. The effect of haemosporidian parasites 
on individuals is often debated, and we provide evidence that parasitemia can 
affect individual survival. In contrast, we did not find evidence of trade-offs 
between survival and immune defences."
1611,"Patients with chronic lymphocyticleukemia (CLL) typically have innate/adaptive 
immune system dysregulation, thus the protective effect of coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) vaccination remains uncertain. This prospective review evaluates 
vaccination response in these patients, including seropositivity rates by CLL 
treatment status, type of treatment received, and timing of vaccination. 
Antibody persistence, predictors of poor vaccine response, and severity of 
COVID-19 infection in vaccinated patients were also analyzed. Practical advice 
on the clinical management of patients with CLL is provided. Articles reporting 
COVID-19 vaccination in patients with CLL, published January 1, 2021-May 1, 
2022, were included. Patients with CLL displayed the lowest vaccination 
responses among hematologic malignancies; however, seropositivity increased with 
each vaccination. One of the most commonly reported independent risk factors for 
poor vaccine response was active CLL treatment; others included 
hypogammaglobulinemia and age >65-70 years. Patients who were treatment-naive, 
off therapy, in remission, or who had a prior COVID-19 infection displayed the 
greatest responses. Further data are needed on breakthrough infection rates and 
a heterologous booster approach in patients with hematologic malignancies. 
Although vaccine response was poor for patients on active therapy regardless of 
treatment type, CLL management in the context of COVID-19 should aim to avoid 
delays in antileukemic treatment, especially with the advent of numerous 
strategies to mitigate risk of severe COVID-19 such as pre-exposure prophylaxis, 
and highly effective antivirals and monoclonal antibody therapy upon confirmed 
infection. Patients with CLL should remain vigilant in retaining standard 
prevention measures such as masks, social distancing, and hand hygiene."
1612,"The definition of autoimmune neutropenias (AIN) has been based on the 
demonstration of autoantibodies directed to various epitopes on blood 
neutrophils. However, this definition is probably too limited and excludes 
neutropenias (NPs) with a negative autoantibody test but with other phenomena 
that indicate an underlying autoimmune process. Examples of such AINs may be 
complete or incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases 
where NP is common but patients may not fulfill formal diagnostic criteria for a 
rheumatic disease. Recently, various inherited immune-dysregulation syndromes, 
such as those related to variants in, for example, TACI, BAFFR, ACKR1/DARC, 
LRBA, CTLA 4 genes, with dysregulated B- and T-lymphocyte functions, have been 
associated with concomitant AINs. Cellular immune mechanisms may also play a 
prominent role in the development of NP, in the presence or not of 
autoantibodies, in cases of large granular lymphocyte syndromes of T- and 
NK-cell types or in chronic idiopathic NP, particularly in adults with T-cell 
clonal populations. The course of AIN may differ according to age, being 
transient and rather uncomplicated in children, and chronic with treatment 
requirement in adolescents and adults. This review discusses current knowledge 
of AINs, including diagnostic procedures, treatments, and prognosis."
1613,"Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with heterogeneous 
clinical course. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remains the only 
curative therapy, but its morbidity and mortality require careful candidate 
selection. Therefore, accurate disease risk prognostication is critical for 
treatment decision-making. We obtained registry data from patients diagnosed 
with MF in 60 Spanish institutions (N = 1386). These were randomly divided into 
a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). A machine learning (ML) technique 
(random forest) was used to model overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free 
survival (LFS) in the training set, and the results were validated in the test 
set. We derived the AIPSS-MF (Artificial Intelligence Prognostic Scoring System 
for Myelofibrosis) model, which was based on 8 clinical variables at diagnosis 
and achieved high accuracy in predicting OS (training set c-index, 0.750; test 
set c-index, 0.744) and LFS (training set c-index, 0.697; test set c-index, 
0.703). No improvement was obtained with the inclusion of MPN driver mutations 
in the model. We were unable to adequately assess the potential benefit of 
including adverse cytogenetics or high-risk mutations due to the lack of these 
data in many patients. AIPSS-MF was superior to the IPSS regardless of MF 
subtype and age range and outperformed the MYSEC-PM in patients with secondary 
MF. In conclusion, we have developed a prediction model based exclusively on 
clinical variables that provides individualized prognostic estimates in patients 
with primary and secondary MF. The use of AIPSS-MF in combination with 
predictive models that incorporate genetic information may improve disease risk 
stratification."
1614,"Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous 
disease with poor clinical outcome. Our previous work had demonstrated that 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analyses were feasible in ENKTL, and dynamic 
tracing of ctDNA could be used to monitor the disease status. However, the 
prognostic value of ctDNA in ENKTL has not been fully investigated. Patients 
with newly diagnosed ENKTL from February 2017 to December 2021 (n = 70) were 
enrolled. The pretreatment ctDNA concentration (hGE/mL) was measured. The 
prognostic value of ctDNA, international prognostic index (IPI), Korean 
prognostic index (KPI), PINK-E, and the combination of PINK-E and ctDNA 
(PINK-EC) were investigated in our cohort. The IPI and PINK-E risk categories 
had a significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) between the low-risk and intermediate-risk groups. The KPI risk 
category had a difference in PFS and OS between the intermediate-risk and 
high-risk groups. Furthermore, integrating ctDNA into the PINK-E model could 
overcome the shortcomings of other prognostic models, which could significantly 
distinguish the different-risk groups. Overall, our results demonstrated that 
PINK-EC showed a superior prognostic prediction value and stability compared 
with IPI, KPI, and PINK-E. The integration of molecular features of the tumor 
into classic risk categories might better characterize a high-risk group where 
novel treatment approaches are most needed."
1615,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is an urgent global healthcare concern. 
Beyond carbapenems as broad-spectrum, often 'last resort' antibiotics, oral 
penem antibiotics currently are approved only in Japan and India, used for the 
treatment of indications including urinary tract infections (UTIs). Exploring 
oral penem use to better understand the impact of antibiotic resistance on 
public health would help inform the management of infectious diseases, including 
UTIs.
SCOPING REVIEW METHODOLOGY: This scoping review investigated the impact of 
faropenem and other oral penems on Enterobacterales infection treatment and 
evaluated evidence for faropenem resistance and cross-resistance to carbapenems. 
PubMed, Embase, J-STAGE and CiNii were searched for relevant English- or 
Japanese-language articles published between 1 January 1996 and 6 August 2021.
KEY FINDINGS: From 705 unique publications, 29 eligible articles were included 
(16 in vitro studies; 10 clinical trials; 2 in vitro and in vivo studies; and 1 
retrospective medical chart review). Limited evidence described faropenem to 
treat infectious disease; only four randomized clinical trials were identified. 
Faropenem dosing regimens varied broadly within and between indications. One 
study indicated potential dependence of penem efficacy on underlying antibiotic 
resistance mechanisms, while several studies reported UTI persistence or 
recurrence after faropenem treatment. In vitro MIC data suggested some potential 
bacterial resistance to faropenem, while limited clinical data showed resistance 
emergence after faropenem treatment. Preliminary in vitro evidence suggested 
faropenem resistance might foster cross-resistance to carbapenems. Overall, very 
limited clinical evidence describes faropenem for treating infectious diseases. 
Preclinical and clinical research investment and dedicated community 
surveillance monitoring is crucial for understanding faropenem treatment 
patterns, resistance and potential cross-resistance to carbapenems."
1616,"OBJECTIVES: Dalbavancin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin 
and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) in adults. Its unique pharmacokinetic 
properties allow daily dosing to be avoided. The objective was to describe the 
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients treated with 
dalbavancin in Spain, and to evaluate its effectiveness and safety in real-world 
settings.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This non-interventional, retrospective, observational and 
multicentre study included patients who received at least one dose between 2018 
and 2019 in seven Spanish hospitals.
RESULTS: In total, 187 patients were included. The most common comorbidities 
were cardiovascular disease (27.4%) and diabetes mellitus (23.5%). Dalbavancin 
was used to treat osteoarticular infections (28.3%), ABSSSIs (22.5%), 
cardiovascular infections (20.9%) and catheter-related infections (18.2%). The 
most prevalent pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (34.2%), CoNS (32.6%), and 
enterococci (12.8%). The main reason for use was early hospital discharge 
(65.8%). Most patients were treated with 1500 mg in a single dose (35.3%) and 
the median duration of treatment was 2 weeks. The treatment was clinically 
successful in 91.4% of cases. Six patients (3.2%) reported adverse events. 
Physicians agreed on the potential reduction of hospitalization days (85.3%). A 
subanalysis of patient characteristics and type of pathogen showed similar 
results in terms of efficacy and safety.
CONCLUSIONS: Dalbavancin seems to be effective and safe as second-line treatment 
in severe Gram-positive infections. It improves treatment adherence and allows 
outpatient management. Furthermore, the effectiveness and safety profile are 
maintained against diverse microorganisms in Gram-positive infections and 
regardless of the patients' comorbidities at baseline, or age."
1617,"BACKGROUND: The use of antimicrobials in layer poultry production for improved 
production, growth promotion, prophylaxis and treatment purposes has contributed 
to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in poultry. In Zambia, 
there is a paucity of information on the prevalence and AMR patterns of 
Enterococcus species isolated from laying hens.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the prevalence and AMR patterns of 
enterococci isolated in layer hens in Lusaka and Copperbelt provinces of Zambia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2020 to April 
2021. Three hundred and sixty-five pooled cloacal swab samples were collected 
from 77 layer poultry farms. Enterococci identification and confirmation were 
performed using Analytical Profile Index (API 20 STREP) and 16S rRNA sequencing, 
respectively. A panel of nine antibiotics was used for antibiotic susceptibility 
testing and interpreted according to the CLSI 2020 guidelines. Data were 
analysed using SPSS version 23 and WHONET 2020.
RESULTS: A total of 308 (83%) single Enterococcus species isolates were obtained 
and showed resistance to tetracycline (80.5%), erythromycin (53.6%), 
quinupristin/dalfopristin (53.2%), ampicillin (36.72%), vancomycin (32.8%), 
linezolid (30.2%), ciprofloxacin (11.0%), nitrofurantoin (6.5%) and 
chloramphenicol (3.9%). The prevalence of enterococci resistant to at least one 
antibiotic was 99.4% (n = 306), of which 86% (n = 265) were MDR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found a high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant 
enterococci. The presence of MDR requires urgent intervention and implementation 
of AMR surveillance strategies and antimicrobial stewardship programmes in layer 
poultry production in Zambia."
1618,"BACKGROUND: The growing evidence of the contribution of antimicrobial use (AMU) 
in animal agriculture to the public health threat of antimicrobial resistance 
has highlighted to policymakers the importance of the need for prudent AMU in 
animal production. Livestock farming is an economic process, where farmers are 
using inputs such as antimicrobials to minimize their losses.
OBJECTIVES: Using a large and unique dataset combining time-series data on 
economic performance and health records in conventional broiler production in 
France, we identify how improved healthcare management and disease prevention 
impact economic performance, AMU reduction and health outcomes.
METHODS: We analyse the main characteristics of the economic performance of 
farms measured by the profit per m2, by performing advanced regression models 
investigating the relative importance of medication and veterinary procedures.
RESULTS: In our study, 50% of the treatments (expressed as number of new 
treatments) are attributable to only 30% of all flocks. There is an inverted 
U-shaped relationship between AMU and economic performance. This finding implies 
that the marginal profit of antimicrobials is decreasing, meaning that using 
antimicrobials is only profitable up to a certain threshold. Results also show 
that the profit increases as the number of preventive treatments increase.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that policies encouraging farmers to work 
upstream from the occurrence of disease have the potential to perform better 
than regulations, as they would maintain a profitable activity while diminishing 
AMU. Encouraging adequate infection control practices by subsidizing or 
providing other incentives would benefit farmers and society."
1619,"Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) from fibrils embedded in a fixed, thin 
section of tissue includes contributions from the fibrils, the polymeric matrix 
surrounding the fibrils, other constituents of the tissue, and cross-terms due 
to the spatial correlation between fibrils and neighboring molecules. This 
complex mixture severely limits the amount of information that can be extracted 
from scattering studies. However, availability of micro- and nano-beams has made 
the measurement of scattering from very small volumes possible, which, in some 
cases, may be dominated by a single fibrillar constituent. In such cases, 
information about the predominant species may be accessible. Nevertheless, even 
in these cases, the correlations between the positions of fibrils and other 
constituents have a significant impact on the observed scattering. Here, 
strategies are proposed to extract partial information about fibril structure 
and tissue organization on the basis of SAXS from samples of this type. It is 
shown that the spatial correlation function of the fibril in the direction 
perpendicular to the fibril axis can be computed and contains information about 
the predominant fibril structure and the organization of the surrounding tissue 
matrix. This has significant advantages over approaches based on techniques 
developed for X-ray solution scattering. Examples of correlation calculations in 
different types of samples are given to demonstrate the information that can be 
obtained from these measurements."
1620,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness for the 
elderly in high-income countries. Although multivitamin antioxidant nutrients 
can slow the progression of intermediate ""dry"" or nonneovascular AMD, no 
treatment can halt or reverse any stage of dry disease. Multiple biologic 
pathways have been implicated in AMD pathobiology, including the complement 
pathway. These pathways have been targeted by various approaches in clinical 
trials. To date, no treatment has reached their prespecified primary end point 
in 2 phase III trials, a requirement by the US Food and Drug Administration for 
a new drug approval. Here, we describe perspectives on the failures and possible 
successes of various clinical trials that will guide further investigation. 
These perspectives will also discuss clinical trial design issues to consider in 
future investigations, and how recent insights into AMD pathobiology might both 
provide additional explanation for trials not reaching the prespecified primary 
end points and offer direction for identifying prioritized treatment targets."
1621,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness 
worldwide. Early to intermediate AMD is characterized by the accumulation of 
lipid- and protein-rich drusen. Late stages of the disease are characterized by 
the development of choroidal neovascularization, termed ""exudative"" or 
""neovascular AMD,"" or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell and photoreceptor 
death, termed ""geographic atrophy"" (GA) in advanced nonexudative AMD. Although 
we have effective treatments for exudative AMD in the form of anti-VEGF agents, 
they have no role for patients with GA. Neuroprotection strategies have emerged 
as a possible way to slow photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss in patients 
with GA. These approaches include reduction of oxidative stress, modulation of 
the visual cycle, reduction of toxic molecules, inhibition of pathologic protein 
activity, prevention of cellular apoptosis or programmed necrosis (necroptosis), 
inhibition of inflammation, direct activation of neurotrophic factors, delivery 
of umbilical tissue-derived cells, and RPE replacement. Despite active 
investigation in this area and significant promise based on preclinical studies, 
many clinical studies have not yielded successful results. We discuss selected 
past and current neuroprotection trials for AMD, highlight the lessons learned 
from these past studies, and discuss our perspective regarding remaining 
questions that must be answered before neuroprotection can be successfully 
applied in the field of AMD research."
1622,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the socioeconomic 
inequities among individuals with tuberculosis (TB) in metropolitan Detroit.
METHODS: We used data from the TB Social Survey to examine socioeconomic and 
demographic characteristics among individuals diagnosed with TB in one of three 
metropolitan Detroit health departments. We then examined mean levels of both 
economic disadvantage and socioeconomic instability across levels of 
race/ethnicity, nativity, and health department.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of individuals with TB in Detroit City were 
non-Hispanic Black, compared to 27% and 25% in Oakland County and Wayne County 
(excluding Detroit), respectively. Non-Hispanic Blacks, U.S.-born individuals, 
and those living in Detroit City had higher mean levels of both economic 
disadvantage and socioeconomic instability compared to non-Hispanic Whites, 
foreign-born individuals and those living in Wayne (excluding Detroit City) or 
Oakland County.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study highlight the ways in which TB is 
distributed along lines of socioeconomic disadvantage. This suggests that 
enduring inequities in socioeconomic resources may be contributing to inequities 
in TB disease, a trend that is likely to continue with worsening socioeconomic 
disparities in the U.S."
1623,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM), developed in the early 1980s, has become a 
powerful characterization tool in micro- and nanoscale science. In the early 
1990s, its relevance within biology and medicine research became evident, 
although its incorporation into healthcare applications remains relatively 
limited. Here, we briefly explore the reasons for this low level of 
technological adoption. We also propose a path forward for the incorporation of 
frequency-dependent nanomechanical measurements into integrated healthcare 
strategies that link routine AFM measurements with computer analysis, real-time 
communication with healthcare providers, and medical databases. This approach 
would be appropriate for diseases such as cancer, lupus, arteriosclerosis and 
arthritis, among others, which bring about significant mechanical changes in the 
affected tissues."
1624,"AIM: Coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia differs from ordinary pneumonia in that 
it is associated with lesions that reduce pulmonary perfusion. Dual-energy 
computed tomography is well suited to elucidate the etiology of coronavirus 
disease 2019 pneumonia, because it highlights changes in organ blood flow. In 
this study, we investigated whether dual-energy computed tomography could be 
used to determine the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia.
METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, 
admitted to our hospital, and underwent dual-energy computed tomography were 
included in this study. Dual-energy computed tomography findings, plane computed 
tomography findings, disease severity, laboratory data, and clinical features 
were compared between two groups: a critical group (18 patients) and a 
non-critical group (30 patients).
RESULTS: The dual-energy computed tomography results indicated that the 
percentage of flow loss was significantly higher in the critical group compared 
with the non-critical group (P < 0.001). Additionally, our data demonstrated 
that thrombotic risk was associated with differences in clinical characteristics 
(P = 0.018). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the 
percentage of flow loss, evaluated using dual-energy computed tomography, could 
predict severity in the critical group with 100% sensitivity and 77% 
specificity. However, there were no significant differences in the receiver 
operating characteristic values for dual-energy computed tomography and plane 
computed tomography.
CONCLUSION: Dual-energy computed tomography can be used to associate the 
severity of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia with high accuracy. Further 
studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions."
1625,"BACKGROUND: Periodontal diseases when persistent, results in periodontal 
pockets, attachment loss and progressive destruction of the alveolar bone. 
Grafting periodontal bone defects with bone substitute biomaterials has proven 
clinical success for accomplishing reconstruction of lost attachment apparatus, 
especially in deep intra-bony defects. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been considered 
indispensable in the future of health sciences and NP based alloplastic graft 
materials such as nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (NCHA) hold great promise for 
regeneration of periodontal defects. Therefore the aim of this review is to 
evaluate the role of NCHA as an effective substitute for periodontal bone 
regeneration.
MATERIAL & METHODS: Popular scientific databases such as PubMed (Medline), 
Cochrane database of clinical trials, Scopus (Elsevier), Web of science 
(Clarivate Analytics) and Google Scholar, were searched. The literature search 
was restricted to published reports in English, between January 2000 and 
December 2021. Database search returned 1227 results which were screened based 
on title, author names and publication dates.
RESULTS: Data from the 14 included studies were reviewed and tabulated. In the 
present review, all the studies reported using commercially available NCHA for 
periodontal bone regeneration.
CONCLUSION: NCHA is a suitable bone substitute material for periodontal bone 
regeneration, with outcomes comparable to that of conventionally used graft 
materials such as bovine xenograft and other synthetic alloplastic materials. 
While grafting with NCHA in intrabony periodontal defects, after any form of 
periodontal flap surgery or debridement, significantly improves bone 
regeneration by 6 months, addition of adjuncts like EMD and PRF further enhance 
the outcomes."
1626,"OBJECTIVES: The contemporary information on the prevalence of periodontitis and 
associated risk factors is deficient in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our aim was 
to measure the prevalence of periodontitis and associated risk factors among the 
Saudi population in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia who visited the 
University Dental Hospital.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, the demographic data and medical and 
dental records of 700 subjects were examined. Bitewing radiographs were analyzed 
to measure the alveolar bone loss in posterior teeth by measuring the distance 
between the cementoenamel junction and the crest of the alveolar bone. A 
chi-square test was performed to compare the severity of periodontitis. A 
comparison of multivariate mean bone loss was performed using a t-test. Logistic 
regression analysis was used to evaluate the predictors of periodontitis. A 
P-value equal to or under 0.05 reflected statistical significance.
RESULTS: Among 700 cases, the patients' mean age was 35.6 ± 12.1; 52.6 % were 
male and 47.4 % were female. Overall periodontitis prevalence was 52.1 %. The 
distribution of mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis prevalence was 36.1 %, 
14.1 %, and 1.8 %, respectively. The severity of periodontitis was statistically 
similar between males and females (p = 0.148); however, significantly more Saudi 
than non-Saudi patients had moderate periodontitis. Higher proportions of severe 
periodontitis were seen in the age group of over 50-years-old (p < 0.001) and in 
patients with poor oral hygiene (p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p < 0.005), and 
hypertension (p < 0.002). Six total predictors of periodontitis were depicted, 
i.e., age > 50 years (OR = 3.73), poor OH status (OR = 2.24), BOP (OR = 3.35), 
presence of plaque (OR = 2.61), diabetes mellitus (OR = 3.19), and hypertension 
(OR = 3.62).
CONCLUSION: The primary factors associated with the prevalence of periodontitis 
were age, nationality, diabetes, hypertension, BOP, plaque, and OH status. 
However, no association was observed between gender or cardiovascular disease 
and the prevalence of periodontitis in the studied population."
1627,"Uncontrolled bleeding is linked to higher treatment costs, risk of post-surgical 
infection and increased disease and death. Hemostatic agents are used to treat 
excessive bleeding. A good hemostatic agent controls bleeding effectively, 
reduces the need for blood transfusion, removes the need for systemic drugs to 
control bleeding, results in shorter surgery time, and reduces the cost and 
length of hospital stay of the patient. Gelatin-based hemostatic agents have 
been widely used in medical and dental procedures, owing to their 
biodegradability and biocompatibility, as well as availability and low cost of 
raw materials. In this narrative literature review, we discuss the background 
and different types of gelatin-based hemostatic agents in medical and dental 
procedures, the comparison of gelatin-based and non-gelatin-based hemostatic 
agents, and the usage and development of enhanced or novel gelatin-based 
hemostatic agents. Gelatin-based hemostatic agents are effective and important 
part of bleeding control, as evidenced by its wide application in medicine and 
dentistry. The development of novel combination gelatin-based hemostatic agents 
has much potential for effective control of excessive bleeding."
1628,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the influence of periodontal status, 
clinical data, and serum markers on salivary leptin levels in patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted with 38 patients with SLE and 29 
healthy controls. Periodontal data included periodontal probing depth (PPD), 
clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival bleeding on probing (BOP). 
Stimulated saliva samples were collected to analyze salivary leptin levels. 
Clinical and serum data were collected from the SLE group. Statistical analysis 
included the t-test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation coefficient, and a 
structural equation model.
RESULTS: The SLE group had a lower salivary leptin level than the control group 
(P = 0.002). The model revealed that SLE had an inverse and independent effect 
on salivary leptin (standardized estimate =  - 0.289, P = 0.023). Moreover, 
salivary leptin level negatively correlated with the serum levels of 
triglyceride, creatinine, and leukocytes, positively correlated with the serum 
total cholesterol, but was not significantly correlated with the periodontal 
status.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that patients with SLE have a lower salivary 
leptin level. In addition, the level of salivary leptin does not appear to be 
related to periodontal status in patients with SLE."
1629,"INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease, resulting due to 
host immune response against subgingival biofilm. Most conventional treatment 
protocols aim to control the subgingival biofilm by mechanical means, such as 
dental scaling and root planning, and frequently accompanied by antibacterial 
co-adjuvant therapies, including antibiotics, antiseptics, or probiotics. Local 
drug delivery facilitates administration of a lower dose of the drug to the 
target site, but at higher concentration, thereby reducing systemic adverse 
effects and toxicity. The present systematic review was conducted with the aim 
of identifying and reporting nanoparticle based periodontal drug delivery 
systems, with a specific focus on current trends and future perspectives in this 
field.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Comprehensive literature search, restricted to published 
reports in English language between January 2000 and February 2022, was done 
electronically and manually. Search queries were addressed to the following 
electronic databases including, PubMed (MEDLINE), Science Direct (Elsevier), 
Cochrane Library, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) and Scholar (Google). 
Database search returned 780 results which were screened based on title, author 
names and publication dates, to identify 13 studies fulfilling the review 
criteria.
RESULTS: Data from the 13 included studies were reviewed and tabulated, 
elaborating the type of nanoparticle used, drug delivered and 
tissues/cells/subcellular components targeted by periodontal drug delivery. 
While majority of the studies were conducted in vitro, there were 3 in vivo 
studies and 3 clinical studies. Using nanotechnology for drug delivery resulted 
in better inhibition of bacterial growth, inflammatory modulation favoring 
resolution of periodontitis and capability for early tissue regeneration.
CONCLUSION: Recent developments in nanotechnology have enabled targeted local 
delivery of drugs and anti-inflammatory biomolecules, in synergy with 
nanoparticles, towards periodontal pathogens, inflammatory cells and periodontal 
tissues. Further research evaluating clinical periodontal disease management 
through nanoparticle based local drug delivery drugs is highly recommended."
1630,"Oesophageal neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare tumours. Neuroendocrine 
carcinomas (NECs) are the highest grade of NENs, with aggressive biological 
behaviour and poor outcomes. No standardized treatment pathways exist for these 
tumours, with management being individualized based on patient and tumour 
factors. We present five cases, four men and one women between 63 and 68 years 
old, who were diagnosed with symptomatic primary oesophageal NECs. Three were 
diagnosed with localized disease, and two were diagnosed with metastatic 
disease. Endoscopy, biopsy and staging scan results are outlined. Two patients 
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Three patients with localized disease 
underwent oesophagectomy. Two of these patients received neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. Four patients have succumbed to their disease, with a median 
survival following a diagnosis of 18 months (5-34 months). This case series 
highlights the variability of presentation and stage at diagnosis of oesophageal 
NECs. Multimodal treatment is commonly utilized; however, outcomes are 
universally poor. Further research is required to determine the optimal 
treatment regimen for oesophageal NENS."
1631,"Tongue metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are rare, with 90% of malignant

with an incidental finding of pulmonary metastasis from a RCC of the left 
kidney, and he concurrently had a RCC deposit on the dorsum of the tongue, which 
was diagnosed after biopsy. Treatment modalities of surgical excision, 
radiotherapy and systemic therapy are considered, but with such a poor prognosis 
with disseminated disease, options are limited. Treatment should include 
multidisciplinary team input, with a focus on reducing disease morbidity."

lifetime risk of depression, little is known about postpartum depression rates 
in this population. Describing rates of positive postpartum depression screens 
and identifying risk factors that are unique to cardiac patients may help inform 
risk reduction strategies.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included pregnant patients with 
congenital and/or acquired cardiac disease who delivered at a single institution 
between 2014 and 2020. The primary outcome was a positive postpartum depression 
screen, defined as Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Score (EPDS) ≥10. Potential 
exposures were selected a priori and compared between patients with and without 
a positive postpartum depression screen using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher's 
exact tests. Secondary outcomes were responses to a longitudinal follow-up 
survey sent to English-speaking patients evaluating cardiac status, mental 
health, and infant development.
RESULTS: Of 126 eligible cardiac patients, 23 (18.3%) had a positive postpartum 
depression screen. Patients with a positive postpartum depression screen were 
more likely to have had antepartum anticoagulation with heparin or enoxaparin 
(56.5% versus 26.2%, p=0.007), blood transfusion during delivery (8.7% versus 
0%, p=0.032), and maternal-infant separation postpartum (52.2% versus 28.2%, 
p=0.047) compared to patients with a negative screen. Among 29 patients with a 
positive screen who responded to the follow up survey, 50% reported being 
formally diagnosed with anxiety or depression and 33.3% reported child 
development problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of screening for postpartum 
depression in patients with cardiac disease, especially those requiring 
antepartum anticoagulation or maternal-infant separation postpartum."

1637,"Navajo children disproportionately experience poor asthma outcomes. Following a 
one-year community engagement period with key stakeholders from the Navajo 
Nation, the Community Asthma Program (CAP) was created using evidenced based 
programs with the goal of reducing asthma disparities among Navajo children. CAP 
is being evaluated with a six-year, multi-site step-wedge design in three Navajo 
communities: Tuba City, Chinle and Fort Defiance, Arizona. The primary outcome 
is asthma exacerbations defined as use of systemic oral corticosteroids, asthma 
hospitalizations, asthma related ED visits, and ICU admissions. Asthma 
exacerbations will be measured using data from the electronic medical records of 
the three community health care centers. Secondary outcomes include will changes 
in asthma-related events and asthma control. The RE-AIM ( R each and 
representativeness, 2) E ffectiveness, 3) A doption, 4) I mplementation, and 5) 
M aintenance) framework is being used to guide the implementation evaluation 
which includes iterative collection and analysis of process data to identify 
facilitators and barriers, describe relevant organizational contexts, and inform 
strategies for dissemination. The CAP intervention requires community engagement 
and participation, building community capacity, incorporating evidenced-based 
guidelines and practices while ensuring program strategies actively involve 
Navajo community members during all steps of the intervention. The outcome of 
this trial will allow us to determine the effectiveness of a multi-component, 
community-focused intervention to improve asthma in a tribal community."
1638,"BACKGROUND: In most regions, cancer ranks the second most frequent cause of 
death following cardiovascular disorders.
AIM: In this article, we review the various aspects of glycolysis with a focus 
on types of MCTs and the importance of lactate in cancer cells.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Metabolic changes are one of the first and most 
important alterations in cancer cells. Cancer cells use different pathways to 
survive, energy generation, growth, and proliferation compared to normal cells. 
The increase in glycolysis, which produces substances such as lactate and 
pyruvate, has an important role in metastases and invasion of cancer cells. Two 
important cellular proteins that play a role in the production and transport of 
lactate include lactate dehydrogenase and monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). 
These molecules by their various isoforms and different tissue distribution help 
to escape the immune system and expansion of cancer cells under different 
conditions."
1639,"Recent advances in ingestible sensors have enabled in situ detection of 
gastrointestinal (GI) biomarkers which shows great potential in shifting the 
paradigm of diagnosing GI and systemic diseases. However, the humid, acidic 
gastric environment is extremely harsh to electrically powered sensors, which 
limits their capacity for long term, continuous monitoring. Here, we propose an 
encapsulation approach for a gas sensor integrated into a nasogastric (NG) tube 
that overcomes chemical corrosion, electrical short, and mechanical collision in 
a gastric environment to enable continuous gaseous biomarkers monitoring. The 
coating effects on the sensitivity, signal latency, and repeatability are 
investigated. Our long-term continuous monitoring in vitro results show that the 
proposed coating method enables the gas sensors to function reliably and 
consistently in the simulated GI environment for more than 1 week. The 
encapsulation is composed of Polycaprolactone (PCL) to protect against 
mechanical scratching and Parylene C to prevent a sensor from chemical corrosion 
and electrical short. The average life-time of the sensor with 10 micrometers 
Parylene coating is about 3.6 days. Increasing the coating thickness to 20 
micrometers results in 10.0 days. In terms of repeatability, 10 micrometers and 
20 micrometers Parylene C coated sensors have a standard deviation of 1.30% and 
2.10% for its within sensor response, and 5.19% and 3.06% between sensors 
respectively."
1640,"Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are a threat to public health and sustainable 
development. NCDs were equated to being a 'pandemic' before COVID-19 originated. 
Globally, NCDs caused approximately 74% of deaths (2019). India accounted for 
nearly 14·5% of these deaths. NCDs and COVID-19 have a lethal bi-directional 
relationship with both exacerbating each other's impact. Health systems and 
populations, particularly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) like India 
have among the highest burden of COVID-19. This narrative review tracks key 
policy and programmatic developments on NCD prevention and control in India, 
with a focus on commercially-driven risk factors (tobacco and alcohol use, 
unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and air pollution), and the corresponding 
NCD targets. It identifies lacunae and recommends urgent policy-focussed 
multi-dimensional action, to ameliorate the dual impact of NCDs and COVID-19. 
India's comprehensive response to NCDs can steer national, regional and global 
progress towards time-bound NCD targets and NCD-related Sustainable Development 
Goals."
1641,"The standard therapy for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the administration of 
statins to reduce plasma cholesterol levels, but this requires lifelong 
treatment. We developed a CVD vaccine candidate that targets the 
pro-inflammatory mediator calprotectin by eliciting antibodies against the 
S100A9 protein. The vaccine, based on bacteriophage Qβ virus-like particles 
(VLPs) displaying S100A9 peptide epitopes, was formulated as a slow-release 
PLGA:VLP implant by hot-melt extrusion. The single-dose implant elicited 
S100A9-specific antibody titers comparable to a three-dose injection schedule 
with soluble VLPs. In an animal model of CVD (ApoE-/- mice fed on a high-fat 
diet), the implant reduced serum levels of calprotectin, IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1, 
resulting in less severe aortic lesions. This novel implant was therefore able 
to attenuate atherosclerosis over a sustained period and offers a novel and 
promising strategy to replace the repetitive administration of statins for the 
treatment of CVD."

1646,"Dementia incidence increases steadily with age at rates that may vary across 
racial groups. This racial disparity may be attributable to polygenic risk, as 
well as lifestyle and behavioural factors. We examined whether Alzheimer's 
disease polygenic score and race predict Alzheimer's disease and other related 
dementia incidence differentially by sex and mediation through polygenic scores 
for other health and behavioural conditions. We used longitudinal data from the 
nationally representative Health and Retirement Study. We restricted 
participants to those with complete data on 31 polygenic scores, including 
Alzheimer's disease polygenic score (2006-2012). Among participants aged 55 
years and older in 2008, we excluded those with any memory problems between 2006 
and 2008 and included those with complete follow-up on incident Alzheimer's 
disease and all-cause dementia, between 2010 and 2018 (N = 9683), based on self- 
or proxy-diagnosis every 2 years (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018). Cox 
proportional hazards and 4-way decomposition models were conducted. Analyses 
were also stratified by sex and by race. There were racial differences in 
all-cause dementia incidence (age and sex-adjusted model, per standard 
deviation: hazard ratio, HR = 1.34, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.09-1.65, P = 
0.007), partially driven by educational attainment and income. We also found 
independent associations of race (age and sex-adjusted model, African American 
versus White adults: HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.52-2.83, P < 0.001) and Alzheimer's 
disease polygenic score (age and sex-adjusted model, per SD: HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 
1.00-1.87, P < 0.001) with Alzheimer's disease incidence, including sex 
differences whereby women had a stronger effect of Alzheimer's disease polygenic 
score on Alzheimer's disease incidence compared with men (P < 0.05 for sex by 
Alzheimer's disease polygenic score interaction) adjusting for race and other 
covariates. The total impact of Alzheimer's disease polygenic scores on 
Alzheimer's disease incidence was mostly direct, while the effect of race on 
all-cause dementia incidence was mediated through socio-economic, lifestyle and 
health-related factors. Finally, among the 30 polygenic scores we examined, the 
total effects on the pathway Alzheimer's disease polygenic score --> Other 
polygenic score --> Incident Alzheimer's or all-cause dementia, were 
statistically significant for all, driven primarily by the controlled direct 
effect (P< 0. 001). In conclusion, both race and Alzheimer's disease polygenic 
scores were associated independently with Alzheimer's disease and all-cause 
dementia incidence. Alzheimer's disease polygenic score was more strongly linked 
to incident Alzheimer's disease among women, while racial difference in 
all-cause dementia was explained by other factors including socio-economic 
status."
1647,"Cortical cholinergic deficits contribute to cognitive decline and other deficits 
in Parkinson's disease. Cross-sectional imaging studies suggest a stereotyped 
pattern of posterior-to-anterior cortical cholinergic denervation accompanying 
disease progression in Parkinson's disease. We used serial acetylcholinesterase 
PET ligand imaging to characterize the trajectory of regional cholinergic 
synapse deficits in Parkinson's disease, testing the hypothesis of 
posterior-to-anterior progression of cortical cholinergic deficits. The 16 
Parkinson's disease subjects (4 females/12 males; mean age: 64.4 ± 6.7 years; 
disease duration: 5.5 ± 4.2 years; Hoehn & Yahr stage: 2.3 ± 0.6 at entry) 
completed serial 11C-methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate acetylcholinesterase PET 
scans over a 4-8 year period (median 5 years). Three-dimensional stereotactic 
cortical surface projections and volume-of-interest analyses were performed. 
Cholinergic synapse integrity was assessed by the magnitude, k 3, of 
acetylcholinesterase hydrolysis of 11C-methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate. Based on 
normative data, we generated Z-score maps for both the k 3 and the k 1 
parameters, the latter as a proxy for regional cerebral blood flow. Compared 
with control subjects, baseline scans showed predominantly posterior cortical k 
3 deficits in Parkinson's disease subjects. Interval change analyses showed 
evidence of posterior-to-anterior progression of cholinergic cortical deficits 
in the posterior cortices. In frontal cortices, an opposite gradient of 
anterior-to-posterior progression of cholinergic deficits was found. The 
topography of k 3 changes exhibited regionally specific disconnection from k 1 
changes. Interval-change analysis based on k 3/k 1 ratio images (k 3 adjustment 
for regional cerebral blood flow changes) showed interval reductions (up to 20%) 
in ventral frontal, anterior cingulate and Brodmann area 6 cortices. In 
contrast, interval k 3 reductions in the posterior cortices, especially Brodmann 
areas 17-19, were largely proportional to k 1 changes. Our results partially 
support the hypothesis of progressive posterior-to-cortical cholinergic 
denervation in Parkinson's disease. This pattern appears characteristic of 
posterior cortices. In frontal cortices, an opposite pattern of 
anterior-to-posterior progression of cholinergic deficits was found. The 
progressive decline of posterior cortical acetylcholinesterase activity was 
largely proportional to declining regional cerebral blood flow, suggesting that 
posterior cortical cholinergic synapse deficits are part of a generalized loss 
of synapses. The disproportionate decline in regional frontal cortical 
acetylcholinesterase activity relative to regional cerebral blood flow suggests 
preferential loss or dysregulation of cholinergic synapses in these regions. Our 
observations suggest that cortical cholinergic synapse vulnerability in 
Parkinson's disease is mediated by both diffuse processes affecting cortical 
synapses and processes specific to subpopulations of cortical cholinergic 
afferents."
1648,"Previous studies indicate that occupation might affect cognitive functioning in 
late life. As people in low and middle income countries often have to work until 
late life, we sought to investigate if there are cognitive benefits to working 
later into life and whether cognitive function deteriorates after exiting the 
labor force. We analyzed longitudinal data from the Mexican Health and Aging 
Study (MHAS), a nationally representative sample of Mexican adults age 50+ 
(n=7,375), that assessed cognitive functioning by verbal learning, delayed 
recall, and visual scanning. Analyses were carried out using mixed-effects 
modeling corrected for the influence of gender, IADLs, diabetes, stroke, 
hypertension, depression, income, and marital status. Results suggest that 
working actively, compared to exiting the workforce, was associated with 
cognitive performance only in context with occupation. Domestic workers had a 
faster decline in verbal learning (b=-0.02, p=0.020) and delayed recall 
(b=-0.02, p=0.036) if they continued working actively and people working in 
administration (b=0.03, p=0.007), sales (b=0.02, p=0.044), and educators 
(b=0.03, p=0.049) had a slower decline in visual scanning if they continued 
working in old age. Our findings indicate that continued participation in the 
labor force in old age does not necessarily come with cognitive benefits. 
Whether or not working actively in later life protects or even harms cognitive 
functioning is likely to depend on the type of job."
1649,"BACKGROUND: Several studies conducted in Europe have suggested a protective 
association between early-life farming exposures and childhood eczema or atopic 
dermatitis; few studies have examined associations in adults.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations between early-life exposures and eczema 
among 3217 adult farmers and farm spouses (mean age 62.8 years) in a 
case-control study nested within an US agricultural cohort.
METHODS: We used sampling-weighted logistic regression to estimate odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for associations between early-life 
exposures and self-reported doctor-diagnosed eczema (273 cases) and polytomous 
logistic regression to estimate ORs (95%CIs) for a 4-level outcome combining 
information on eczema and atopy (specific IgE≥0.35). Additionally, we explored 
genetic and gene-environment associations with eczema.
RESULTS: Although early-life farming exposures were not associated with eczema 
overall, several early-life exposures were associated with a reduced risk of 
having both eczema and atopy. Notably, results suggest stronger protective 
associations among individuals with both eczema and atopy than among those with 
either atopy alone or eczema alone. For example, ORs (95%CIs) for having a 
mother who did farm work while pregnant were 1.01 (0.60-1.69) for eczema alone 
and 0.80 (0.65-0.99) for atopy alone, but 0.54 (0.33-0.80) for having both 
eczema and atopy. A genetic risk score based on previously identified atopic 
dermatitis variants was strongly positively associated with eczema, and 
interaction testing suggested protective effects of several early-life farming 
exposures only in individuals at lower genetic risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In utero and childhood farming exposures are associated with 
decreased odds of having eczema with atopy in adults."
